Ten people who were working as tele-callers in the call centre were “bound down” that means they have been booked in the case and directed to remain available for investigation, whenever required.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap said that some days ago, the district’s cyber cell received a complaint from IndiGo airline that some people were running a racket in the name of providing jobs in the airline at various airports in India. The cheats were also issuing fake appointment letters on the company’s behalf. Accordingly, a case was registered and investigation was taken up.The cyber cell team investigation showed that the job racket was being run through a call centre operating from a rented building in Ghazipur village. A raid was conducted and 12 people were caught.“We arrested the two owners, Surjeet Yadav and Sundaram Gupta, while the 10 tele-callers, including eight women, were bound down. Six computers, 16 cellphones, one laptop and other electronic devices used for running the call centre were seized along with ₹26,000 cash,” said DCP Kashyap.During the interrogation, the DCP said, the arrested men said that they mostly cheated job aspirants from south India, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The tele-callers were hired on a monthly payment of ₹6,000 to ₹9,000. The mastermind posted advertisements on job portals, inviting applications from job seekers interested in working in IndiGo. “After obtaining details of the candidates, the racketeers used to take their online interviews. Thereafter, they tricked the candidates into paying the processing fee, which is between ₹1,500 and ₹30,000, in their bank accounts. Further, they issued fake appointment letters. The candidates found themselves cheated when they visited the airline office and learnt that the appointments were fake,” said an investigator.DCP Kashyap said the arrested frauds have cheated hundreds of job aspirants to the tune of over ₹10 lakh in the past couple of months.In a statement, IndiGo said it has been regularly alerting people against such fraud practices. “IndiGo has been continuously working towards creating awareness through advisories and regular informercials around such fake job offers by criminals. Our strong belief in handling the issue with a combination of police action as well as awareness has resulted in apprehension of these miscreants today,” said the statement issued by Raj Raghavan, senior vice president: human resources||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-bust-fraud-call-centre-offering-jobs-in-airlines-101627237647546.html

Our infrastructure, patient load, number of faculties and laboratories also fulfil criteria which are needed by the NMC to grant the seats,” he said.Gupta also said that the GIMS will apply for MD/MS seats in all the streams, including medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, gynaecology and anesthesia. “According to our infrastructure and bench strength, we are expected to get at least 100 MD/MS seats. The NMC will invite applications from medical colleges by the end of August this year. They are supposed to sanction the MD/MS seats by the end of December this year. After getting the NMC permission, the Uttar Pradesh government will issue a sanction letter to us and then we will be able to take admission for these postgraduate courses through the National Eligibility Entrance Test (Postgraduate) or NEET (PG) for the academic session 2022-23,” he added.NMC sources also confirmed that due to the second wave of Covid-19 across India, the invitation of applications from medical colleges has been delayed. “We will soon release a notification in this regard and the final approval of PG seats will be done by December 2021. Once a medical college gets nod to start MD/MS courses, its DNB seats are deemed null and void after the beginning of MD/MS courses,” said a NMC board director, requesting anonymity.He also said one has to qualify MBBS or an equivalent programme with 50% or above aggregate percentage along with clearing the NEET (PG) test to get admission in MD/MS courses. “The course is covered in six semesters, comprising rotational training. Any medical college in Uttar Pradesh pays each of these students. The pay scale for a junior resident doctor (fixed by the state government) is ₹78,500 per month,” he said.GIMS is an autonomous tertiary care teaching hospital in Gautam Budh Nagar.

Radhakrishnan shares the award with UK-based colourist John Pearson. They won for their work on UK-based author Ram V’s 145-page graphic novel Blue In Green, published in October 2020 by Image Comics.The mixed-media images, created using pencil, ink and acrylic paint, are hauntingly realistic portrayals of a young musician’s self-doubt and struggles in pursuit of creative success. “Blue In Green is about existential dread, an artist’s insecurity. The story is slow-paced and subdued and the images complement the narrative,” Radhakrishnan told HT. “They are very realistic in terms of the proportions and anatomy and the images are a little hazy as well.”Winning an Eisner is great validation, he adds. “I work from home and very few people get to see what I do. But when Eisner acknowledges you, you realise that people are looking at your work. It’s made me feel that what I do has meaning.”He’s hoping the recognition will draw attention to the graphic novel in general too. “I strongly believe that if there is a consolidated effort to push graphic novels, they have the potential to become as big in India as Manga is in Japan,” Radhakrishnan says.The Mahim resident is currently working on another graphic novel, Radio Apocalypse, also with Ram V. It is the tale of a radio station and crew that have survived the apocalypse. The book is set for release in October.The Eisner Awards were founded in 1988 by American comics editor Dave Olbrich, in response to the discontinuation of the popular Kirby Awards for comics in 1987. The Eisners are named in honour of the pioneering writer and artist Will Eisner. The awards are announced each year at the San Diego Comic-Con.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/32yrold-mumbai-graphic-artist-wins-oscar-of-the-comics-world-101627237533928.html

The sump well was constructed to store rainwater in the low-lying area to tackle waterlogging.Four men — the deceased, Sandeep (22) and Vishal Srivastava (27), and the injured, Rakesh and Mohammad Ansari — had entered the sump well, police said. “All sump wells in the city are meant to carry rainwater and should be kept clean. No water should remain stored in it, except for the rainy season i.e. three months a year. How can there be sewer in sump wells or drains? This means, sewage is not treated properly before dumping it into water channels — violating the National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders. A probe should be initiated in the matter and action should be taken against the violators,” said Amit Gupta, member of Progressive Community Foundation (PCF), a social group of the residents.In an order issued on February 25, 2020, the NGT had directed the Noida authority “not to discharge untreated sewage into drains as it pollutes rivers too”. All the drains in Noida are either emptied into the Yamuna or the Hindon.“Dumping untreated sewage into drains means you are defeating the ‘Clean Ganga’ mission as the Yamuna merges with the Ganga. The Noida authority should work seriously to make sure that not even a drop of untreated sewage goes into city drains,” said Vikrant Tongad, an environmentalist from Noida.The Noida authority, which has the onus of treating sewer in the city, meanwhile, said that the victims did not pay heed to warnings of a supervisor who was present at the sump well site. “Our guard had tried to stop the men from entering the boundary wall of the pit, but they entered there forcefully. The guard called the police and tried to save the victims...,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer (CEO), Noida authority.On the poor condition of the sump well, Maheshwari said, “We will look into the matter, and conduct a probe if required. Action will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2-drown-in-pit-residents-accuse-noida-authority-of-negligence-101627237407586.html

The expressway has decreased travel time between Delhi and Meerut, (which was 3 hours and more while travelling through NH58) to merely 45 minutes. Work on rapid rail is also going on and hopefully the first phase would be operational by 2023. It would convert into metro after entering into Meerut. The Delhi- Meerut Expressway and rapid rail would also reduce travelling time from Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha and other districts to Delhi. Commuters from Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar will also reach Delhi in much less time. Observers say these and other projects in western UP region may top the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s development agenda on which it intends to fight the forthcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. To note, the party had announced that the forthcoming elections in UP would be fought on issues of nationalism and development and projects being carried out in Meerut region would certainly be on top to woo voters in western UP region, feel people. BJP MP from Meerut Rajendra Agarwal said that the party had done a lot of developmental work in the area and the Delhi- Meerut Expressway, rapid rail and Metro were flagship projects which would benefit not only Meerut but almost the entire region. He said that the party would certainly convey the benefits of these developmental activities to people and claimed, “People had extended their support to the BJP and we hope they would continue it after assessing its work.” Agarwal said that speedy and easy connectivity of west UP districts with the national capital would help in strengthening business and opening new avenues of growth and development in the region. Opposition leaders, however, are ready to down play the claims of the BJP. Samajwadi Party’s district president in Meerut Rajpal Singh accused the BJP of projecting previous governments’ projects as their own to mislead people. He said that the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and rapid rail projects were originally of the Congress and Metro Rail was of Samajwadi Party. He said the BJP promised airport and ring road to Meerut which were still a distant dream and there were many other projects which were promised but didn’t come into existence.“They are champions in misleading people and would continue doing it in forthcoming elections but we will expose their lies,” said Singh. A trader Amit Sharma, who owns an automobile showroom and has other businesses, said that in spite of many controversies in BJP governance, these development projects would give the party an edge over others because traders and people were demanding speedy connectivity with Delhi for years. On opposition parties’ allegations that most of the projects were conceptualized and planned during previous government, Sharma said, “The credit goes to those who deliver”.

25-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Two drown in pit while retrieving cricket ball||Two men allegedly drowned, and their friend was injured after they entered a sump well, a pit to trap rainwater, to fetch a cricket ball in Sector 6 on Sunday morning. An e-rickshaw driver who tried to help the three men also fell into the 20-foot deep pit after losing consciousness due to “toxic fumes” coming from the sump well. The sump well is part of a sewage treatment plant (STP) of the Noida authority. The incident took place around 6.30am. Authorities did not immediately clear if the sump well had rainwater or sewage. While police said they suspect that the victims drowned in the sump well, Noida authority officials said they will launch a probe into the matter as the sump well is supposed to collect rainwater.An operator at the plant said that he warned the youngsters who had gone there to play cricket against entering the pit, but they did not pay heed to him. He also said that the sump well, which is surrounded by a grille, had about six feet water at the time of the incident.“Some men often gather at the nearby ground to play cricket in the morning. Around 6.30am today, their ball fell into the sump well. Three of them came here to retrieve the ball. I asked them not to go near the pit but one of them didn’t listen. He lost consciousness after looking for the ball standing on the edge and fell inside. The two others who rushed to help him also fell inside. I then started shouting for help,” said Balram Singh, the operator. According to police, an e-rickshaw driver who was passing through the area rushed in to help the operator, but he also fell into the pit after losing consciousness. Soon, locals gathered at the spot and one of them informed police about the incident, police officials said. “After getting information, we called the fire services department and sent a police team to the spot. Our personnel, along with the fire department’s team, wearing oxygen mask and other necessary equipment, pulled the four men out of the sump well,” said Munish Chauhan, station house officer, Sector 20 police station. The operation lasted for over 30 minutes, Chauhan said.The four victims were rushed to the district hospital in Sector 30 where two of them were declared brought dead, police said. The deceased were identified as Sandeep, 22, and Vishal Kumar Srivastava, 27, residents of Harola village. They worked at a local factory, police said. The injured, Rakesh and Mohammad Ansari, were referred to a health centre in Delhi where they are undergoing treatment, the officials said, adding that they are now out of danger. The police said that the bodies were sent for an autopsy and the reports are awaited. So far, no complaint has been filed in the case, they said. Meanwhile, the Noida authority said the victims did not pay heed to warnings of the operator who was present at the sump well. “Our operator tried to stop the men from entering the pit, but they refused to do so. Then he called the police and tried to save the victims,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer (CEO), Noida authority.When asked about the “toxic fumes” coming out of the sump well and the fact that the victims reportedly fell unconscious, Maheshwari said, “We will look into the matter, and conduct a probe if required. Action will be taken accordingly.”Locals at the spot said that the victims entered the premises of the sewage plant after crossing over its boundary wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-two-drown-in-pit-while-retrieving-cricket-ball-101627237047532.html
25-07-2021||Other||First time since inception, Goa mining could see new players||On Tuesday, when Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant returned from an official trip to Delhi, he came with one message - “We have already taken a decision to form a mining corporation,” he told reporters. The chief minister said that the corporation would once again begin mining in full strength - both the mining corporation and auction of mining leases. “The government is serious about the auction of leases and the restart of mining through a corporation and I have asked the director of mines to work on it on priority,” he said. Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court pronounced its decision rejecting the Goa government’s review plea to relook its 2018 order cancelling Goa’s leases. It was the state’s last-ditch attempt to restore the status quo ante and resume mining in Goa as if there hadn’t been any cancellation. That move was bound to fail.Sawant’s announcement was more out of necessity than any conscious choice.When on February 7, 2018, the Supreme Court of India dropped a bombshell declaring that 88 mining leases renewed by the Goa government across 2014-15 were in effect defunct and cancelled the purported renewals, the Goa government’s first reaction was to attempt a “legislative cure” to the mining imbroglio, that, in simple terms, meant undoing the Supreme Court’s judgement through an Act of Parliament to ensure that the leases were given an extended period of validity. But with no support from the central government - despite promises to the contrary given by local BJP leaders - the lobbying for a bill in Parliament to undo the SC order failed, leaving the state with no option to look at its remaining two options - a state-run corporation or auctions. “Through the corporation, we hope to once again begin mining in full strength (through) both the mining corporation and auction of mining leases,” chief minister Sawant said.Tuesday’s announcement by the chief minister marks a watershed moment for the Goa mining industry. If followed through, it will mark the first time since the beginning of the century-old industry that leases are being allotted afresh and with it the possibility of new players entering the field that has up to now been largely been controlled by dozen-odd family-run mining companies who were beneficiaries of Portuguese granted leases. It’s no surprise then that such a move is being opposed by Goa’s mining operators who, under the banner of the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), continue to hold out hope that their demands for an extension of the leases be acceded to - hope that now lies on a bunch of petitions before the Supreme Court challenging a decision of the Goa government to deny them a 50 year period of validity dating back to 1987. “The main petitions and SLPs (special leave petitions) filed by Vedanta and Geetabala Parulekar (another leaseholder) are listed to be heard, which are on the basis of leases being valid till 2037. We remain optimistic that we will place the legal positions before the Supreme Court and mining will eventually restart,” the GMOEA said in a statement.“Furthermore, as has already been placed before the Supreme Court by the state and central government, auctions are not possible in those areas, where the challenge to the Abolition Act (The Goa Daman and Diu Mining Concessions Abolition Act, 1987) is still pending,” the statement read.Being the predominant industry in Goa, the mining industry has had a disproportionate clout over Goa’s political affairs and is alleged to have built and destroyed several political careers and governments over the decades. It is no surprise then, that the Goa government has, over the last few years, sought to protect the industry’s interests and ensure that the status quo is not disturbed. In a policy document brought out in 2015 after the Supreme Court first allowed resumption of mining after the 2012 ban, the then Goa government did its best to avoid auctions - something that could bring in players from outside the state into Goa’s mining industry. “While there cannot be any gainsaying that the mode of the auction could have brought in possibly and probably a greater revenue share for the state of Goa on account of the competitive bidding and the consequent match-bids, it has also certain risks involved in it, namely it would have involved inviting unknown business interest, often referred to as mining mafia,” the Goa government’s 2015 Grant of Mining Lease Policy stated while justifying the government’s decision not to opt for auctions back then.It was the leases renewed under this policy of 2015 that were struck down by the Supreme Court bringing mining to a halt once again and taking the state back to square one. According to the Goa Foundation, whose petition resulted in the cancellation of Goa’s mining leases, the Goa government’s decision has come six years too late. If instead of renewing the leases, the state had to opt for auctions back in 2014 itself the industry would have restarted faster. “The (minerals in the) state should be reserved for public sector mining through a PSU as that is the only way to ensure zero loss in the present legal framework. Proposals being made... for the issue of an ordinance are intended to return the mining leases into the hands of the private lease-holders. The move will not survive judicial scrutiny or review. It will also further delay the restart of mining activity in the state,” the Goa Foundation had recommended back in 2018.The Goa Foundation has been advocating that the quickest way to resume mining in the interest of the dependents, that also respects the notion of intergenerational equity in which publicly owned assets, if they are to be extracted, the proceeds be stored in a sovereign fund the interest of which is used for the benefit of the state, would be to resume mining through a corporation. But the Goa government wasn’t enthused. Until now that is. But not everyone agrees that allowing the immediate resumption of mining, either through a corporation or through auctions, is the best way forward. “Our generation has already mined the share of 100 generations and more. We cannot rob our kids anymore. And leave them the costs and destruction. Let there be no mining for 20 years, our kids will then decide. If you cannot agree, then let mining be owned and run by all-inclusive, equitable village cooperatives, where children, elders, farmers and women will decide how much to mine, if at all,” Abhijit Prabhudesai, an environmental activist, said. One possible hurdle to resuming mining in Goa is a plea challenging the Central Government’s Act converting Goa’s mining concessions granted by the Portuguese into leases under the Mines and Minerals Development Act is currently also pending before the Supreme Court. “Pending adjudication of the legal issues involved there will always remain an inherent legal uncertainty on the title rights of the mines if granted as per the directions passed by this Court as the original title of rights is still under litigation,” the Mines Ministry said in an appeal before the Supreme Court.For now, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant brushed aside those concerns. “Whatever decision we take for now will be subject to the outcome of that petition. We will go ahead with the corporation,” he said. The mining industry was a major revenue and employment generator for the state and at its peak contributed close to 15% of the state’s GDP. The state used to export 54 million tons per annum before the ban came into effect in 2012 as a result of the Shah Commission report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-time-since-inception-goa-mining-could-see-new-players-101627236750226.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||Toll in Maharashtra floods rises to 149||The death toll in the flood-ravaged districts of Konkan and western Maharashtra on Sunday rose to 153, amid receding water levels of major rivers and dams. Sixty-four people are still missing, official data revealed, while nearly thousand more people were evacuated from Sangli late on Saturday, taking the number of evacuated to around 230,000.The torrential downpour over Thursday and Friday triggered the worst floods and landslides in decades in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Palghar, Thane, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. In Sangli, 196,957 people have been evacuated, while in Kolhapur, 145,930 people have been taken to safe places and temporary shelters. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and armed forces teams deployed in rescue operations in the eight districts recovered few more bodies from the debris at landslide sites on Sunday, while search operations at a few sites were called off by evening. Eight more bodies were recovered from the landslide site at Taliye in Raigad on Sunday, taking its toll to 64, while the toll in Satara rose to 41 from three landslide sites. A few bodies in Taliye were recovered from as far as 2km on Sunday.Kolhapur had reported six landslides on Friday, while Raigad had three landslides in Taliye, Sakhar Sutarwadi and Kevlane. The death toll of the landslide in Ambeghar, Satara, touched 14, while the Mirgaon landslide claimed 8 lives. Nine people in Satara are still missing. The NDRF called off the rescue operation on Sunday evening. In Ratnagir, a total of 35 people died and 14 are still missing, mostly from landslide sites. “The rescue operations at most of the landslide sites are expected to be called off by Monday as the chances of the recovery of missing people from the sites are very small. The bodies are likely to have washed away with the force of the water and may have travelled far off,” said an official from district collectorate in Raigad. The water level in many rivers in Konkan and Western Maharashtra has started receding since Saturday, though many of them are still at the warning level. Krishna, Warana rivers in western Maharashtra, Savitri, Kundalika in Konkan are flowing either at the warning level or below it. Most of these rivers were above the danger level on Friday. Panchagana is still above its danger level of 43ft as it is flowing at 51 at Rajaram band in Kolhapur. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited flood-affected Chiplun on Sunday and assured affected people of relief in the next few days. Thackeray also announced to set up a separate disaster response system on the lines of NDRF in every district. “The assessment of the losses will be completed in the next four days, but before that, all basic facilities to the flood-affected people will be extended immediately. The natural calamities are occurring frequently in some parts of the state, and hence we have decided to have a dedicated system for every district. The flooding in Chiplun and Raigad has been unprecedented as people did not get a chance to save their belongings because it happened all of a sudden,” he said. “We will require central assistance for long-term mitigation measures. The central government has provided assistance by deploying rescue teams from defence forces,” he later said. Thackeray said the state’s economy was already “sluggish” because of the pandemic.After the state government’s request for additional teams of NDRF and armed forces, the 33 teams (with 45 personnel in each team) are engaged in rescue operations, while eight teams are on standby in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. Eight teams in Kolhapur, six in Ratnagiri, four in Satara and two in Sangli have been deployed in rescue operations. Ten teams of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guards) have been deployed in operation. As the Karnataka government started discharging more than 3,50,000 cusecs water on Sunday, the level of the water in Krishna, Panchganga, Warana rivers in Kolhapur and Sangli has stabilised in the last 24 hours. Panchganga river’s water level as Rajaram band in Kolhapur was highest at 51 feet at 4pm on Sunday, down from the 54.05ft on Friday at 5pm. Discharge from Koyana dam in Satara, too has been brought down to 30,864 cusecs at 4pm on Sunday, which had gone up to more than 50,000 cusecs on Friday. Satej Patil, minister of state for home and guardian minister of Kolhapur Satej Patil said, “The water level in major rivers has stabilised and the water on roads has started receding. However, the water level is still above their warning level and will take a few days to the situation to normalise.” Major state and national highways were still shut owing to the water logging and in few cases roads and bridges are having washed away. Kolhapur-Pune, Mumbai-Goa, Kolhapur-Ratnagiri were shut till Sunday evening in patches in Ratnagiri, Kolhapur and Sindhudurg. In Kolhapur, which was badly affected due to downpour on Thursday and Friday, 17 of 25 state highways are still shut and total 366 villages have been affected. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and union MSME minister Narayan Rane visited Taliye village where more than 30 people are still missing and 42 people were declared deadafter a landslide on Thursday evening. “I have spoken to prime minister Narendra Modi. He has assured me all kind help from the central government. I will submit a report to the PM after the visit. The rehabilitation of the people affected in the landslide will be done at the site they want to. Rescue teams of NDRF and arm forces have been deployed in affected district, we will try to keep a few teams stationed in Raigad or Ratnagiri keeping the constant risk of downpour every monsoon in mind,” Rane said. Till Sunday, the NDRF, which is conducting rescue operations in Taliye in Raigad, Porase and Pedhe in Ratnagiri, and Mirgaon, Ambeghar and Dhokawale in Satara district, has retrieved 90 bodies, SN Pradhan, NDRF director general, tweeted on Sunday. A total of 875 villages have been hit by the floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/toll-in-maharashtra-floods-rises-to-149-101627236747467.html

Vaikunth crematorium is located in a residential area of Pune city and after local residents and a non-governmental organisation (NGO) filed a public interest litigation (PIL) with the Bombay High Court on the issue of pollution at the crematorium, PMC tasked Neeri to come up with a plan to control the air pollution.Shrinivas Kandul, additional city engineer, electrical department, PMC, said, “Senior scientist Padma Rao visited Vaikunth crematorium and made a suggestion of installing a wet scrubber to control the air pollution. Corporation has already installed a scrubber. After the recommendation of Rao, we will put in another wet scrubber. Officials have also suggested putting in a pollution monitoring system.”Neeria is to inspect and assess the air pollution control system at the Vaikunth crematorium and then submit a report within six months.Types of scrubbers Air scrubbers are useful for improving the quality of indoor air. It is a technology that cleans out contaminants in the air, serving as an air purifier.There are two major methods used in air scrubbers; dry and wet scrubbing – which both work in different ways.Wet scrubbing works by sucking air through a damp pad or filter to trap free-floating contaminants and particulate matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/environment-body-recommends-wet-scrubbers-to-control-air-pollution-at-vaikunth-crematorium-101627236087459.html

However, we will put in a clause in the agreement that the final decision will be taken by the municipal commissioner. The terms and conditions of the agreement are yet to be finalised but we will take care of the possibility of other companies approaching the PMC to provide electrical vehicle (EV)-related facilities.”The general body meeting of the PMC on Tuesday passed the proposal which was tabled by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporators and Amol Balwadkar, former chairman, CIC and approved in 2020. The PMC administration gave a positive response to the proposal, which was finally approved in the general body meeting sans any discussion. Typically, the corporation calls an EoI for all such facilities but in this case, the process was bypassed.As per the proposal, VITRO Motors Pvt limited and e Matrixmile India Pvt Ltd will provide e-bikes on rent to commuters. The two companies will provide a total 500 e-bikes and 500 charging stations will be made available to Punekars.The companies have proposed to charge ₹4 per kilometre for the e-bikes. There will also be one-day, weekly and monthly packages. It is proposed to charge ₹450 for a one-day package of a maximum 150 kilometre. In the weekly package, the companies will charge ₹1,900 for a maximum 1,000 kilometre, while ₹3,800 will be charged for a maximum 4,000 kilometre. The companies will also install charging stations in different parts of the city with at least one station along each main road. A single charging station will charge 10 bikes at a time.Dr Khemnar said, “The corporation is only providing space for charging stations for e-bikes under our supervision. The list of charging stations has not been finalised, yet. One Energy Efficiency Service Limited (EESL) has approached the PMC for setting up charging stations in the city. At present, we have only e-bus charging stations but in future, we will also have to provide space for two-, three- and four-wheeler charging stations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/other-e-bike-firms-will-also-be-considered-municipal-commissioner-to-take-final-decision-101627235908673.html

Earlier, the PMC had given an in-principle approval to relocate the drainage lines. Now, the commissioner has officially placed the proposal before the standing committee and has sought to transfer this money from a budgetary allocation for merged villages. The standing committee will take a decision on the proposal this week. The work of relocating the lines is already in progress on this stretch, according to officials. The National Highway Authority of India *NHAI) has undertaken a road widening between Navale bridge and Katraj chowk, increasing both sides of the highway by one lane each. This is one of the important roads as the population in Ambegaon and other areas has seen a massive increase in the past few years. following major real estate projects and better road connectivity. Though it was earlier considered a bypass, the five-kilometre stretch now sees a lot if traffic every day. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari approved the funds for the project, but requested PMC to bear the costs of relocating the drainage lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-seeks-to-use-rs7-48-crore-from-merged-villages-budgetary-allocation-for-drainage-work-101627235907518.html

Locals and healthcare workers are dabbling with the aftermath of the floods – cleaning sludge and water from their homes and salvaging their belongings. Health officials said that it will take at least a week to resume all Covid-related works. “We have continued the Covid-related drives in all the other areas, but it was not possible to do so in Chiplun due to the high impact of floods,” said Ratnagiri district health officer Dr Aniruddh Athalye. Any village or area with more than 15 active Covid-19 cases is defined as a hotspot by district health officials. Chiplun taluka has seven such hotspots, while Ratnagiri taluka has two and Sangameshwar has one. To break the chain of infection, health officials have been tasked to achieve 100% testing in all the hotspots. “But it’ll be difficult to achieve that goal now,” said Dr Yatin Mayekar, medical officer in the primary health centre at Chiplun’s Adare village. “Locals have been traumatised by the floods, losing their homes and belongings. We have sent out mobile vans for testing, but for a few days, we’ll have to only test people who are coming to the centres on their own,” he said. Many hospitals in the taluka were impacted by the floods. On Thursday, eight Covid-19 patients succumbed in Apranth Hospital – managed by the Nagar Parishad in Chiplun – while others were shifted to government hospitals. An isolation centre in Kherdi, which had five Covid-19 patients, was also submerged. But the patients and staff were safe on the higher floors of the three-storey building. According to Dr Mayekar, many Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers, staff nurses and other field staff have been impacted by the floods, mainly in the urban and semi-urban areas of Chiplun. “I visited many of the homes on Sunday. They have spent hours cleaning out the mud and most of their belongings have been washed away or destroyed,” said Dr Mayekar, adding that Asha workers and other staff may take at least a week to resume their work. The affected areas do not have electricity. Drinking water is being supplied to the locals with the help of tankers. The gram panchayat members have started distributing Mediclore – a drinking water disinfectant – to avoid a spurt in waterborne diseases. But health officials fear a possible spike in Covid-19 as well as other diseases.Ratnagiri has been a district of concern after nine patients infected with the Delta Plus variant were found in six villages of Sangameshwar. The officials had achieved 100% testing in Sangameshwar within a week after finding the Delta Plus variant and planned to comb the other hotspots as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-7-hotspots-covid-19-testing-vax-come-to-a-standstill-in-chiplun-101627235727429.html

The state government is expected to announce a special package for the flood-hit districts by keeping the set norms of National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) aside. Meanwhile, Union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) Narayan Rane, leaders of Opposition in state legislature Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar visited the landslide-hit Taliye village in Raigad as well as Chiplun on Sunday. Forty-two people were killed in Thursday’s deaths landslide at the village. Thackeray, who had visited Taliye on Saturday and will be on a visit to the flood-hit villages of Kolhapur on Monday, also announced to set up a system for the disaster response on the lines of NDRF in every district. He said that the districts of Konkan have been witnessing the natural calamities more frequently of late and the perpetual measures need to be taken. “I am not going to announce any package for the sake of publicity. The assessment of the losses will be completed in next four days after which the decision over the relief will be taken. We are taking all steps for the immediate relief of people. The calamity in Raigad and Ratnagiri is unprecedented and we will ensure that the affected people get the due compensation,” he said. According to officials from the chief minister’s office (CMO), the state government is expected to announce a special package for the flood-affected districts. “The state government has already demanded with the Centre for rise in the relief amount given for the losses of crops, houses, structures and loss of lives. The state government had given greater amount than NDRF norms to the people affected by Nisarga and Tauktae cyclones that had hit coastal Maharashtra over the past two years. This time too, the compensation amount is expected to be higher that the set norms. We expect the assessment to be completed in a week, after which the relief package will be announced,” an official said. Former CM Fadnavis said that the state government should announce a special relief for the flood-affected people. “The losses are unprecedented as some residents and traders have lost everything they owned. We had announced a special package for the flood-affected people in Sangli and Kolhapur in 2019. Small traders and labourers were given cover, while the amount for the losses and rebuilding the houses had been increased. Similar steps are required to be taken,” he said. Rane, who had accompanied Fadnavis to Taliye village, said that the rehabilitation of the village will be done at the site the villagers select. “The Central government is extending every help to the flood-affected districts of Maharashtra. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured me to help the affected families and submit a report on the losses,” said Rane. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will tour the flood-affected cities of Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli on Monday. BMC sends two teams for relief work to Raigad and KolhapurThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sent two teams to carry out relief work in flood-hit Mahad at Raigad as well as to Kolhapur on Sunday, following directions from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.

25-07-2021||Gurugram||DTCP pulls up developer over delay in affordable housing project||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) issued a show-cause notice to the developer of an affordable housing project in Sector 109 for failing to adhere to construction timelines, incomplete internal works and not renewing the project licence. DTCP officials on Saturday directed the developer, Ocean Seven Buildtech Private Limited, to submit a reply in this matter by July 30 and explain why action should not be taken against the developer for failing to comply with the licence conditions.The notice issued by the district town planner (enforcement) stated that the developer has not completed internal development works in the project. The community building, which should have been completed in four years, has not been constructed. The pace of construction is also slow and it violates the agreement with the buyers. The notice also said that the developer has failed to comply with the conditions of the affordable housing policy. Ocean Buildtech launched the affordable housing project in 2016, announcing around 1,000 flats on 7.5 acres. Buyers said that the developer has completed only 60% to 70% of the work, while payment has been made in full by them. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said that the licence of the project also expired in June this year but the developer has not renewed it. “A number of complaints have been lodged by the buyers regarding the slow pace of construction and so, a review of the project was conducted. It was observed that internal development works are not completed and community building was not constructed, apart from other violations,” he said. The representative of the developer, however, said that they had not violated any conditions and would explain the situation to the department. Sanjiv Kumar, a senior official of Ocean Seven Buildtech Private Limited, said that the project will be completed within the stipulated period. “As the project is under affordable housing policy, the time for completion is four years from the date of commencement of the project, i.e November 30, 2017. So, we have to complete the project by November 30, 2021. Moreover, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has given a six-month extension to all projects. Availing of that, we have time till May 30, 2022, to complete the project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-pulls-up-developer-over-delay-in-affordable-housing-project-101627235251393.html
25-07-2021||Gurugram||Almost two weeks into monsoon, MCG’s plantation drive yet to take off||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) plan of planting 300,000 saplings this monsoon season is yet to start, almost two weeks after monsoon arrived in the city. Officials attributed the delay to a change of strategy, with the agency currently in the process of hiring a contractor for carrying out the drive and distributing saplings to residents.On June 21, the MCG officials stated in an official release that they are targeting to plant at least 300,000 saplings this monsoon, including 100,000 trees and 200,000 shrubs. While the MCG had not announced a date for starting the drive, officials said it would commence as soon as the monsoon arrives in the city.Last year, the MCG planted 105,910 saplings across the city with the help of 269 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), with the drive started on June 27, two days after the arrival of the monsoon season. However, even as the monsoon arrived on July 13 this year, there seems to be little progress with the plantation drive almost two weeks later. On Sunday, the district administration started its plantation drive, while the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) started its plantation drive last week.A senior MCG official overlooking the matter, on the condition of anonymity, said that all arrangements were made to start this season’s drive from mid-July onwards but the civic agency decided to change its strategy and hire a contractor for this season’s drive.“Just prior to the drive’s commencement, I enquired from officials about the fate of saplings regarding last year’s drive. They informed me that they primarily distributed saplings to RWAs and did not carry out any follow-up or checks regarding their fate and survival rate,” the official said.To ensure, proper records and maintenance of saplings are done in the 2021 drive, the official cited above said that the MCG has floated tenders to hire contractors distribution of the saplings and looking after their maintenance in association with RWAs and non-governmental organisations.“The tendering process has started. We are aiming to start the drive from mid-August onwards. The target of planting 200,000 shrubs will be achieved. However, in regards to the tree saplings, we will be revising our target and reducing it by half, to 50,000 saplings,” said the official.Environmentalists, however, said that despite the change in strategy, the MCG’s plantation drive is likely to have limited success due to the delay. “Saplings need at least three to four weeks of continuous rains to survive, and unless the MCG manages to plant them within the next two weeks, their window will be over,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, a city-based environmentalist.Chandra said that instead of attempting a drive that is likely to have limited success due to the short period of time, the MCG should focus on tracing last year’s saplings and ensure that the saplings that have survived are properly maintained.MCG officials privy to the matter said that last year, the MCG had originally aimed at planting around 40,000 saplings. “The demand from RWAs for the drive was much higher than we had anticipated. It was only then that we used the support of Gurujal and started keeping records,” an official with the MCG’s horticulture wing said.The horticulture wing official said that the MCG has only basic records of the first 41,000 saplings it distributed to the RWAs. Later along with Gurujal, an integrated water management initiative of the district administration, records of 65,000 saplings that were distributed were kept properly.In mid-June, the MCG and Gurujal opened registrations for RWAs and NGOs for taking part in the 2021 drive, and the invite stated the sapling distribution will be carried out between mid-July and September.For the 2021 drive, unlike last year, the MCG also announced it will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the RWAs and the NGOs. The MoU would mandate each RWA and NGO to maintain saplings for three years. Also, a cap of 500 saplings per RWA or NGO was announced for the distribution of saplings from the MCG’s four nurseries in sectors 15, 44, and 46, and Kadipur.MCG officials said that the majority of tree saplings would be of peepal (sacred fig) and banyan, while the shrubs will be of native species.“The MCG has distributed saplings to a few RWAs on a limited scale. The full-fledged drive will commence soon. The GMDA already started its plantation drive last week, while the administration has started it on Sunday. The three aforementioned government entities, as well as the forest department, are committed to increasing Gurugram’s green cover through various plantation drives this monsoon season,” said Subhash Yadav, the district forest officer (DFO), who is also the additional chief executive officer of GMDA and the nodal officer of the MCG’s environment and sustainability wing.According to a 2019 Forest Survey of India (FSI) report, only 9.2% of Gurugram’s total geographical area is under forest cover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/almost-two-weeks-into-monsoon-mcg-s-plantation-drive-yet-to-take-off-101627235250229.html

25-07-2021||Gurugram||Four Afghan nationals arrested for illegal stay||The chief minister’s flying squad on Sunday raided a house in Jharsa village of Sector 39 and arrested four Afghanistan nationals for allegedly overstaying in India after their visa and passports expired. Officials said they were tipped off about the matter and the police will seek custody of the foreign nationals. Officials said that they are probing the case and that they had entered the country on tourist visas.The suspects were identified as Abdul Gaffar Nori, Mohammad Shabbir, Islam Aariya and Mohammad Yasin Shahadat of Kabul in Afghanistan. The police said they have booked the house owner, named Punit Kumar, for not informing the police and failing to get a police verification conducted. A case under sections 14A , 14B and 14C of the Foreigners Act and Section 12 (1A) of the Passport Act was registered at Sadar police station on Sunday. Inderjeet Yadav, the deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department, said that they were living in a rented accommodation. “We immediately informed seniors regarding the information, following which a joint team was formed and the house raided,” he said. According to an initial probe, the four came to India in November 2016 on a tourist visa. They were not employed and are suspected to be involved in illegal activities for money, the police said. Yadav said, “During verification, it was found that they were residing without legal documents. Their travel documents were also not valid.

Residents of the Carnation Residency housing society alleged that their premises have turned into breeding grounds for mosquitoes due to overflow and stagnation of sewage. They said the situation worsened after the heavy rain last week and that a foul stench from the sewage has forced them to confine themselves to the building. The condominium is spread across 29 acres, with 1,600 apartments in all. Around 1,000 have shifted to the complex since 2015. They said that as the level of the road in front of their society is low, foul water gets collected there and also led to accidents often. Ashish Gupta, a member of the Carnation Residency residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that the issue of overflow is in neighbouring Sikanderpur Barha village, from where untreated household wastewater is channelled. Also, the village drain is not connected to the master drain and leads to overflow onto sector roads, he said. “We are facing extensive waterlogging due to which chances of mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya and malaria remain high. Last year, our area was declared a large outbreak area. Shockingly, the authorities have not laid the pipelines yet. We have been suffering for the past two years, and yet, no one is bothered,” he said. Naresh Kumar, the vice-president of the RWA, said that they have run from pillar to post for the last few years. “We were promised a solution to this during the state elections. However, post elections, there is no word on this. We have approached all government officials about this. The situation has turned so bad that we have to lock the main gate and use alternate routes to exit/enter the society,” he said. Residents also said that the extensive waterlogging might compromise the integrity of the construction and cause a building collapse, on the lines of an incident in Farrukhnagar last week that left three dead.Satinder Singh Bhatia, another RWA member, said that they have paid external development charges (EDC) as well as infrastructure development charges (IDC) to the government but there seems to be no end to their problem. “We are not asking for any favours, but a proper utilisation of our money,” he said.The residents, on Saturday, once again wrote to the newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM), highlighting the precarious condition of civic amenities in the area. They also alleged that de-silting was not done before the monsoon and this resulted in blockage. They also said that after a lot of effort, they managed to get financial approval from the public works department (PWD) for fixing the problem, but the matter was put on hold. “The MCM is still a nascent civic body. We were formed only in December last year. This year’s monsoon is our first experience of waterlogging and are, hence, heavily reliant on residents for feedback,” said a senior MCM official.The official quoted above said that the MCM is in the process of creating a database of waterlogging points, points where sewerage or stormwater drain overflow, and combined with rains, are leading to issues and will, accordingly, execute measures ahead of the next monsoon.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that the administration will look into the matter and get the issue checked at the earliest. “Will check with other agencies and ensure the issue is resolved at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sewage-overflow-untreated-wastewater-major-concerns-for-sec-85-residents-101627235188028.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Alternative investment options||With the capital market in disarray due to the Covid pandemic, alternative investment options now include asset classes that were once relegated as unprofitable. Balancing the risk-reward paradigm with a portfolio that delivers stability and returns equally is not easy. The unpredictability of the equity movement prompted many people to allocate their money in debt funds. However, as many companies defaulted on bond payments, this too was not a failsafe option. A mix of traditional and unconventional asset classes could not only earn exceptionally high returns in the long run but can also shield you against market volatility. The risk is also diversified as more money finds its way into investments that may not be related to stock movements at all. Let’s take a look at some options that retail investors are turning to. Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies came into prominence as markets toppled and people lost money invested in stocks and debt funds, and with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009. Deemed as one of the most reliable forms of digital currencies, many people resorted to investing in cryptocurrency as they lose faith in the stock market reeling under the effects of the pandemic. Those who relied more on debt funds due to their secure nature also found investments in cryptocurrencies profitable as the value of Bitcoin rose by more than 200 per cent in 2019 alone. Alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum performed better than Bitcoin during the same period. If you have newfound interest in cryptocurrency investments, you may also consider allocating your money into Bitcoin alternatives including Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Putting money in gold and gold funds The habit of buying jewellery, coins and bars has been replaced with digital gold that includes gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), gold funds and sovereign gold bonds. Some may complain that the returns from investment in gold funds do not yield high returns proportional to the rise in the stock market. However, it is the inverse relationship between gold share prices and stocks that benefits investors as gold shares soar with the plummeting of the stock market. Gold investments offer a platform to investors inclined towards alternative asset classes that grow in value over time. Gold funds yielded an average of more than 25 per cent returns in 2020 when stock prices fell, and the market took a nosedive. Sovereign Gold Bonds provide ease of purchase and storage and don’t pose the same challenges as selling gold in its physical form does. Also, gold bonds offer 2.5 per cent interest on investment every year. Government bonds Floating Rate Savings Bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India offer more than 7 per cent with this year’s interest rate slated at 7.15 per cent till the next reset date. The interest rate on these bonds is linked to that of the National Savings Certificate (NSC) and fetches 0.35 per cent interest above the prevailing NSC rate. These bonds, available with a lock-in period of seven years, are a preferred investment option for senior citizens and investors looking for a regular income plan. Fixed income deposits in banks Risk-averse investors are now preferring cash deposits over long-term allocations or volatile investments in the stock and capital markets. Many are now allocating their savings to fixed-term deposits or recurring deposits despite their low interest rates to avail of their high liquidity levels. Bank deposits are already deemed safe with an added ₹5 lakh insurance cover given to account holders to cover their deposits. Digital collectables This concept is new, especially, after a prolonged period of having heard or witnessed art collectors buying and hoarding valuable art collections as high-priced assets for future sales. However, things have changed with the non-fungible token (NFT) art adopting blockchain technology of cryptocurrencies to create a platform for digital art collectables. Through this platform, you can invest in any artwork or creative piece including artwork, animation videos, music, etc. An unusual part of this technology is that you can trade art pieces for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and more. With the value of cryptocurrencies set to increase in future and more people showing interest in cryptocurrency investments, art investors are in for a great and profitable start. The market is close to $ 100 million and is slated to rise with NFT serving as an interesting proposition for art investors. Initial Public Offerings News surrounding possible Initial Public Offerings arouse interest in people who wish to invest early in shares with high growth potential. Buy cheap and sell at more is the mantra behind investing in IPOs. However, such investments must be made only after a detailed assessment of the company’s fundamentals that justify the share price and the potential to grow in future. With both the pharma and IT companies providing the much-needed stability even during Covid times, many people are now looking forward to IPO launches by healthcare and IT companies.

He pointed out that he had offered his resignation two months earlier to the high command and said that he would continue or quit based on what the high command tells him to do.Yediyurappa said that he would take a decision himself in case no ‘message’ comes from the high command. He also said that he would not ‘cross the disciplinary line’ and abide by the decision taken by the party’s central leadership. “I got most of the positions in the party, which no one else might have got in Karnataka, for which I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda,” Yediyurappa was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Yediyurappa said that his primary target is bringing the BJP back to power in Karnataka. Karnataka will head to polls in 2023. He agreed with BJP national general secretary CT Ravi’s statement, who had earlier said that every person in the BJP is an ordinary party worker.BJP chief JP Nadda who is currently in Goa praised Yediyurappa for his work in Karnataka. “It is good, he has done a good job. Karnataka is running smoothly. Yediyurappa is looking (managing) at things on his part,” Nadda said.Yediyurappa also refrained from commenting on his successor. He said that it is solely the high command’s decision. “I'm not the one to decide about it, it is for the high command to decide. I have decided to work till the last minute. I'm ready to resign as and when they ask me to do so,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-be-clear-by-tomorrow-yediyurappa-on-continuing-as-karnataka-cm-101627233665312.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects bail of man who cheated Dena Bank of ₹245 crore||The Bombay high court (HC) recently refused to grant bail to a man who had cheated Dena Bank of ₹245 crore in 2014. The man, while claiming to be a representative of the bank, had influenced eight public entities to start fixed-term deposits with the bank to the tune of ₹259 crores and then used the KYC documents of the public entities to get loans against the deposits to the tune of ₹240 crores. He later siphoned off the amount using fake loan accounts in the name of the entities.The court held that as the offense was serious and the trial was likely to commence and end in a year said it was not inclined to grant bail as the accused had absconded after the investigation had got underway as well.The single bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the bail application of Vimal Barot, was informed by advocate Ujjwal Gandhi that after being arrested the authorities had attached his properties under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and recovered a substantial amount of the defrauded money, hence the custody of his client was not necessary and he should be released on bail.According to the FIR in 2014, Barot had approached the manager of the Malabar Hill branch and introduced himself as a custodian of funds of government departments and corporations. He was asked to mobilise funds in the form of fixed deposits for the growth of the bank.Barot used this request of the bank to get public entities like Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation Ltd., Mumbai APMC, Hero MotoCorp Ltd., Modi Innovative Education Society, Modi ATI Education Private Ltd. and Mahatma Phule Backward Class Development Corporation Ltd. to make fixed-term deposits in Dena Bank. The amount he managed to garner was ₹256.49 crores.While the bank took him to be the financial advisor of these public entities, the respective authorities took him to be a representative of the bank and hence handed over documents for KYC to him.Barot retained the receipts from the bank and gave the entities photocopies and then based on the KYC documents applied for loans from the bank using the receipts as surety. The bank assuming Barot to be the financial advisor of the entities sanctioned the loans which were deposited in fake loan accounts and later withdrawn by Barot through various other entities.Special public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar for CBI opposed the application stating that Barot had gone absconding after the fraud came to light and a complaint was registered and was nabbed after being traced to Ahmedabad. Venegaonkar added that as the investigating officer in his affidavit had stated that the trial would start and end in a year, the presence of the accused was necessary and as he had already absconded once, allowing him bail would prejudice the trial hence his application should be rejected.After hearing the submissions, justice Kotwal observed, “The offence indeed is very serious. The sheer audacity of the applicant in defrauding various entities including the informant’s bank shows that this is not a case where some leniency can be shown to the present applicant in granting him bail during the pendency of the trial.” The court further took note of the statements of witnesses which pointed to the involvement of a bank manager in the fraud as well.In light of the opposition by the state and CBI and the fact that Barot had used the siphoned off amount to buy properties in his and his wife’s name and as the trial was expected to be expedited the bench rejected the bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-bail-of-man-who-cheated-dena-bank-of-245-crore-101627234287903.html

Lifts are still not working as they are under repair,” said Govind Madhav, 49, a resident.The society was flooded twice since July 19, leading to no water and power supply as meter rooms and water tanks were submerged. Following this, the residents had demanded remedial measures from the developer. Komal Patel, 32, another resident, said, “Power and water supply has been resumed now, however there are few towers which are still out of water. Lifts are not operational yet, but our daily chores will get easy now with power and water supply.” In a statement issued by Tata, it mentioned that Amantra residents have taken over the society management in 2019 and the society has been responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the project. The society management committee has, however, claimed that the management committee has not taken over the society from the developer. The committee claimed it had put forward several demands related to the issues caused by flooding in the society but the demands were not met. “It is not completely over; it is in conditional handover wherein we are only going to see the maintenance. The full handover is not done. We, the managing committee, will discuss this matter and further issue a statement,” said Swapna Bhanushali, chairperson of Tata Amantra housing society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/power-restored-at-tata-amantra-water-supply-partly-resumed-101627234228566.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||FYJC optional CET site to be open from Monday 3pm||Six days after the website for the optional common entrance test (CET) exam for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions was launched, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) on Sunday announced that the registration will now be open from July 26, 3pm till August 2. Class 10 students interested in opting for the CET exam can now log in to https://cet.11thadmission.org.in to complete the registration process.“Students who completed the registration process last week need to only use their application form number to be eligible for the CET exam. We are also giving enough time to students to complete the registration process,” said the official statement from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) released on Sunday.Originally, registration for the optional CET exam for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) seats was scheduled to take place between July 20 and 26. New dates will be announced soon, said the official.This year, the Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. While Secondary School Certificate (SSC) results were announced last week, the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced ICSE results on Saturday.According to the circular released by the state board last week, an optional CET exam based solely on the SSC syllabus and consisting of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks will be conducted. This two-hour paper will be conducted in physical mode on August 21 from 11am to 1pm.Last month, a Class 10 ICSE student approached the Bombay high court seeking help in this matter. The student’s petition points out the ‘bias’ against students of other boards and the added stress for students, therefore. The court this week asked the state board to consider conducting the CET with the syllabus of ICSE and CBSE boards as well, the board is yet to respond to this as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fyjc-optional-cet-site-yet-to-reopen-for-registrations-101627234227892.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||Ban BS-III vehicles in MMR to prevent air pollution: MPCB panel||An independent committee constituted by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has recommended a complete ban on the entry and operation of Bharat Stage (BS)-III vehicles in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The committee was formed last November to address concerns around vehicular pollution in Mumbai.Officials said the move, if implemented, would bring about an immediate reduction in emissions while spurring the uptake of latest BS-VI emissions norms. Experts, however, cautioned that commercial vehicles such as inter-city taxis and goods carriers may be adversely affected by this proposal.An MPCB official, seeking anonymity, clarified that no final decision has been taken in the matter. “The committee report was submitted in June and is awaiting comments from other departments. The state government will take a decision after considering all commercial and environmental aspects,” the official said.The recommendation was part of an exhaustive list of mitigation measures proposed by the 13-member committee, headed by former additional chief secretary (transport) Satish Saharabuddhe. The committee consists of officials from MPCB, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Automotive Research Association of India (Pune), Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Delhi), representatives from Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, and independent experts.“The committee was constituted to make recommendations specifically on reducing vehicular pollution in the MMR region. We have suggested a range of proposals including revamping the existing pollution under control (PUC) system and setting up vehicle inspection centres along the lines of those proposed in Nashik, improving scrappage policy for legacy vehicles, remote sensing of vehicular pollutants at key junctions, and introducing a reward-based carpooling system which reduces the number of private vehicles on city streets while allowing owners to cover their cost of travel,” said committee chairman Satish Sahasrabuddhe.“We also deliberated on e-mobility. Some of the recommendations adopted in the Electric Vehicles Policy 2021 were first suggested by us, including electrifying all state government vehicles. Converting last-mile delivery vehicles for food and logistics companies to electric two-wheelers was also something which we had initially suggested,” he said.The committee has recommended that such companies pro-actively buyback two-wheelers from their delivery partners using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, and replace them with electric two-wheelers, availing incentives under Central and state schemes, which stand to significantly reduce the total cost of operation for such vehicles. The companies can further reduce the cost by availing scrappage policies,” Sahasrabuddhe said.However, one of the most ambitious proposals in the short-term remains the ban on BS-III vehicles which, officials said, is in line with the already existing Bombay High Court instruction barring vehicles older than 16 years from plying in the city. These are mainly BS-II vehicles. “We are making this rule stricter. BS-III vehicles plying in Mumbai will now be around 10 years old. The same rule should apply to them, given that we have stricter BS-VI norms now. We have proposed that the vehicles be converted to CNG fuel in order to keep plying,” said Sahasrabuddhe.Madhav Pai, urban policy researcher and executive director of the World Resources Institute India Ross Center, said the move to ban the operation of BS-III vehicles in MMR is a positive step. “But there will be livelihoods at stake. People who operate older goods carriers and other commercial vehicles will require some support so that they can affordably make the switch to newer BS-VI vehicles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ban-bs-iii-vehicles-in-mmr-to-prevent-air-pollution-mpcb-panel-101627234227210.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||Five-day-old embryos too can contract Covid-19, finds study||Embryos even as old as five days develop receptors that are known to provide an easy passage to the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, finds a new study by ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRH) carried out using 45 donated human embryos after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure at fertility clinics. Researchers said their findings indicate that embryos can get infected with Covid-19 in the womb from infected mothers and also during IVF procedure in laboratories which, according to them, increase the chances of a miscarriage or even failure to conceive in both natural and IVF-induced pregnancy. Though no cumulative data is available about the total number of miscarriages recorded among Covid-19 infected pregnant women, a significant number of private and civic-run hospitals have witnessed such cases. Receptor is a specific protein that provides an entry point to the virus to hook into and infect a wide range of human cells. Studies have found that Sars-CoV-2 infects the lungs through the receptor—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – and enzyme TMPRSS2. The ICMR-NIRRH study—Expression map of entry receptors and infectivity factors for pan-coronaviruses in preimplantation and implantation stage human embryos published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics in May – found many cells of the embryos that fertilized as early as five days express the same receptors—ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Dr Deepak Modi, lead investigator of the study, explained this new finding has established the fact that embryos are susceptible to contracting the infection either through vertical transmission (from the infected mother to the foetus in the womb) or horizontal transmission during artificial fertilisation process of the embryos in labs through IVF. “We have discovered that the same cells also have the necessary machinery to allow virus multiplication and growth inside the embryonic cells. This will harm the developing embryos and may cause their death. The team also found that along with ACE2, the cells of early embryos contain receptors for other coronaviruses making them highly likely to get infected,” said Dr Modi in response to an email. Dr Manjiri Mehta, consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician, Fortis Hiranandani hospital, Vashi, said that she has seen a definite rise in first as well as second-trimester miscarriages and intrauterine deaths among Covid-19 infected mothers. “This can be directly or indirectly related to the Covid-19 infection. The study indicates the virus can infect the human embryo in the lab. In pregnant women, the Covid-19 virus can impact in different ways such as vertical (mother to child transmission), immunological mechanisms, to name a few. This will certainly have an impact on infertility treatment. The real impact will be known once we have more data and studies to substantiate these claims or otherwise,” she said. BYL Nair hospital, where more than 1,000 Covid-19 pregnant women have delivered babies, has also witnessed miscarriages. “We can’t firmly say if the miscarriages happened because the foetus contracted the infection from the mother in the womb. More studies need to be done to confirm vertical transmission among the foetus,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, hospital dean. Researchers said their findings can help couples who seek IVF treatment and doctors practicing IVF. In case of IVF labs, said Modi, the virus can spread from an asymptomatic carrier and the embryos can get infected. “The virus can stay alive on surfaces of the lab and cold chain like liquid nitrogen, where embryos are preserved. Once the virus gets in touch with the embryos, it can infect them and multiply, thereby creating a problem. There might be low pregnancy rates and poor embryo quality due to viral infection to embryos,” he added. When a woman tests positive while undergoing IVF treatment, doctors suggest that couples delay the process until complete recovery. “There is a possibility that the virus can go inside the embryos from an infected mother. So, whenever a woman gets infected before conceiving, we ask them to halt the treatment for at least 1-2 months,” said Dr Richa Jagtap, clinical director, consultant reproductive medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, Mumbai. “Although the infection rate among pregnant women was more in the second wave compared to the first wave, we didn’t see any case where an embryo contracting the infection during the fertilisation procedure in our labs,” she said. However, IVF experts said all precautions are being taken considering the high risk associated with the fertilised embryos. ICMR issued guidelines for recommencing ART (assisted reproductive technology) services during Covid-19 pandemic. “All procedures in laboratories are done through closed working chambers where the chance of embryos getting infected is almost zero. Also, the labs have high-efficiency particulate air filters which provide better safety against the microscopic viruses,” said Dr Kshitiz Murdia, chief executive officer and co-founder of Indira IVF. He said all staffers have been vaccinated following ICMR guidelines, in addition to conducting RT-PCR tests on women before performing any complicated fertility procedures. “We have started tele-consultation to avoid unnecessary crowding in clinics. For any emergency use for infected mothers, we have a separate chamber for video consultancy where a patient can virtually meet the doctors. We are in the process of acquiring RT-PCR testing kit which will get us results within 20 minutes,” said Dr Murdia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fivedayold-embryos-too-can-contract-covid-19-finds-study-101627234167244.html

The last four years have coincided with the Yogi Adityanath government’s tenure. The state assembly elections are due early next year.Adityanath was in Ayodhya to review the progress of ongoing projects and the district administration’s preparedness in view of the fight against Covid-19. After inspecting the Raja Dashrath Medical College, popularly known as Ayodhya Medical College, Adityanath said to media persons: “In the ongoing session, 14 new medical colleges are being constructed with the help of the central government.” “There are 16 districts in the state that do not have a medical college. The government will take up the issue with the Medical Council of India and will come up with a policy for setting up medical colleges in these districts,” said the chief minister. On the status of medical facilities in the state, the chief minister said: “In 69 years from 1947 to 2016, only 12 new medical colleges were established in the state. But in the last four years, 32 new medical colleges have come up in the state.” He also said Uttar Pradesh will go on to have the maximum number of medical colleges in the country. Yogi Adityanath expressed his condolences for all those who died due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Commenting on the Ayodhya Medical College, the chief minister said: “This new medical college has the facility to conduct 3000 RT-PCR tests per day.” “In 2019-20, the state government had started eight new medical colleges after approval from the MCI. The Ayodhya Medical College was one of them. In March 2020, when Covid-19 was reported, this medical college was used as a Covid hospital,” the chief minister said. Stating that both the Central and state governments were committed to restoring Ayodhya to its ancient glory and importance, he said widespread development was being carried out in the pilgrim town. He directed the authorities to expedite all the projects. He also inspected ongoing construction work related to the Ram temple and offered prayers on the Ram Janmabhoomi campus and later at Hanuman Garhi temple.

25-07-2021||Patna||New equipment at AIIMS-Patna reduce brain, spine surgery cost||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in capital city Patna has added three state-of-the-art equipment with artificial intelligence and robotic technology that enables neurosurgeons to perform complex brain and minimal invasive spine surgeries with precision, greater efficacy and reduced time, hospital officials said on Sunday. “These first of its kind equipment in Bihar, with a consolidated cost of ₹9 crore (approximate), are a boon, as it improves patient-safety while reducing surgery time, post-operative complications and surgery cost,” said Dr Vikas Chandra Jha, associate professor and head, department of neurosurgery, AIIMS-Patna. One of the new equipment Kenovo 900 operating microscope with endoscopic assistance and robotic arm technology allows up to 20 times magnification in brain surgery, making minute vascular details clearer and neural structures more vivid, avoiding post-operation complications, Dr Jha said. “It also minimizes the cost of operation at a government set-up such as AIIMS, where complex brain tumour or brain haemorrhage surgeries are done within ₹1 lakh against an estimated cost of ₹4 lakh in big corporates,” said Dr Jha. “The high-frequency C-arm with minimal invasive spine set (MISS), which gives three-dimensional reconstruction of the spine, helps in minimally invasive spine surgery, reducing the cost of such complex surgeries with fractured vertebrae and spinal deformities from ₹3 lakh to within ₹1 lakh. It also reduces the operative time from 12-15 hours to 3-4 hours, providing better safety to patients,” he added. Both the instruments are integrated with another high-end equipment StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system, that provides sub-millimetre accuracy in spinal instrument fixation. It helps to treat deep-seated lesions like basal ganglia bleed and brain stem lesion accurately, said the neurosurgeon. Talking about a procedure recently performed using the high-frequency C-arm, Dr Jha said, “A 60-year-old female, osteoporotic (weak and brittle bones) with paraparesis (partially unable to move legs) and bladder incontinence (loss of bladder control leading to involuntary leakage of urine) was treated with percutaneous (a procedure where access to inner organs or tissue is done via needle-puncture of the skin rather than by using an “open” approach, where organs or tissues are exposed) real-time 3D imaging with navigation guided pedicle-screw fixation that allows preservation of motion segments and stabilisation of the spine. The patient’s health is fast improving.” The equipment also reconstructs the 3D spine model and helps repair under-vision fractured segment by percutaneous fusion using button-hole procedure, without having to make a big incision over spine. “It is a big leap in minimal invasive spine surgery and real-time 3D imaging with axial, saggital (also longitudinal plane) and coronal (vertical plane that divides the body into ventral and dorsal or belly and back sections) cuts giving unbelievable accuracy to the surgeon. We have performed more than 10 such surgeries, mostly in accident cases,” signed off Dr Jha.

Earlier this month, the board had raised objections on several schools for allotting inflated marks to their students and asked them to redo the moderation of marks before July 25. Patna city coordinator Rajiv Ranjan Sinha said, “Roughly, 20 schools in the city were asked to redo Class 12 marks. The board directed those schools that awarded higher marks exceeding historical performance to scale down their marks. Schools had to revise marks of such candidates who had been awarded 95 or above marks.” “Majority of schools have submitted their revised marks while around eight schools were yet doing the same till Sunday evening. For schools who failed to submit updated marks till Sunday, their results will be declared separately after July 31,” he added. Meanwhile, schools shared that they have reviewed marks following the CBSE’s formulated policy. “We have uploaded the revised marks on the CBSE portal. No large changes were made as less than five students had scored above 95 marks in two or three subjects,” said an official of Danapur-based school. CBSE students shared that they were desperately waiting for the declaration of the result. Neha Kumari, a Class 12 science student, said, “I did not perform well in internal exams due to health issues but my Class 10 marks were good. I hope to get above 80%. I am more concerned about college admission as many varsities have decided to take admission on the basis of Class 12 results.” As per sources, more than 80,000 students from the state have filled the Class 12 examination form this year..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/city-schools-submit-revised-class-12-marks-101627230933461.html

25-07-2021||Patna||Monsoon session to begin today, likely to be eventful||The five-day Monsoon session of the state legislature, commencing Monday, is expected to be stormy as leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and left parties on Sunday resolved to rake up many contentious issues, including price rise, alleged mismanagement of Covid-19 pandemic, perennial shortage of vaccine, unemployment and blatant assault on unarmed legislators by police during the budget session.Leaders of opposition parties gathered at the residence of Opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav Sunday evening and unanimously decided to corner the government over the abovementioned issues. Senior RJD leader Alok Mehta, state Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha and Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma, CPI (ML) legislator Mahboob Alam and state secretary Kunal attended the meeting.After the meeting, Yadav said the opposition will not be content with anything less than an apology from chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar over the assault on legislators by the police during the last budget session on March 23 this year. “We all want the CM’s reply on the incident on the opening day of the session and an unconditional apology,” said the opposition leader.The Opposition leaders have already disapproved of Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha’s reluctance to act against the police, who mercilessly thrashed legislators in an unprecedented chaos. Police were called inside the Assembly to assist the marshals in evicting unruly opposition members, who physically tried to stop the Speaker from presiding over the meeting, which saw the approval of the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill during the Monsoon session.Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said action against only two constables for beating up over 25-30 MLAs, including women legislators, was unjustified. “The Speaker did not take cognizance of the video clips submitted to him by the Opposition for perusal,” alleged Mishra, saying that the Congress legislature party will meet separately to chalk out its floor strategy in the Assembly and the legislative council. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has already written to the Speaker, saying that Opposition legislators were scared to enter the house, owing to the thrashing incident.“Unlike the last session, the Opposition leaders will try doing away with disrupting the business of the House to raise issues of public concerns. However, it all depends on the approach of the government during the session. We will be compelled to stall proceedings if the ruling benches refuse to cooperate,” said Mehta, adding that there were a lot of issues that could keep the government restive throughout the session.The Opposition leaders said they were prepared to expose the government on the issues of rising prices of fuel and essential commodities, alleged scam in state teachers’ eligibility test, state of the economy and health care, unemployment post-pandemic etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/monsoon-session-to-begin-today-likely-to-be-eventful-101627230931833.html

Taking this a step forward, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, a research-intensive educational institute, last year initiated online demonstration sessions titled “Next-Gen Science Camps: Exploring Fun Activities at Your Doorstep” to make learning science a fun exercise. The experiment proved successful with the IISER managing to reach out to over 1.5 million viewers over the course of the pandemic and even completing the 50th episode of its demonstration sessions last week.Speaking on the occasion, Ashok Rupner, programme manager, science activity centre, IISER Pune, said, “The present situation induced by the ongoing pandemic gave the science activity centre an opportunity to explore the online medium to reach out to students, teachers, and science enthusiasts, going beyond geographical boundaries. The centre initiated online demonstration sessions beginning June 7 last year.”Rupner further said, “The sessions are designed with school curricula in mind but are organised topic-wise. The sessions begin with 40 minutes of demonstrations of science and mathematics activities followed by a 20 minutes question and answer (Q&A) with IISER Pune scientists. The sessions aim at incorporating hands-on activities that can be performed with readily available materials. They allow students and teachers to explore scientific concepts related to their curriculum in an exciting manner.” It is learned that the questions are chosen from those received over the previous weeks from members of the audience.The sessions were conducted in the form of YouTube live sessions every Sunday between 11am and noon on the science activity centre’s YouTube channel, Rupner informed. He confirmed that they had recently completed 50 episodes of the Sunday series and that their episodes had so far reached over 1.5 million viewers with an overwhelming response.Pramod Namdeo Loke, a teacher from Devgad taluka, Sindhudurg district, who participated in the online sessions, said, “Today’s electromagnetic experiments were excellent. We came to know about the relation of the magnetic field with the number of turns, strength of the magnet, speed of the coil, strength of the current, direction of the magnetic field and how to change the parameters and increase the efficiency of the project. Today’s workshop covered all concepts of electromagnetism. The experiments inspire our students and make them more creative.”Additionally, IISER Pune has also conducted 15 online sessions in Marathi titled “Let’s make friends with science and mathematics” for students and teachers in Maharashtra, in collaboration with the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training (MSCERT) Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iiser-pune-reaches-over-1-5-million-viewers-with-science-activity-sessions-101627229128066.html

Nath also claimed that during the 15-month-long Congress dispensation in the state helmed by him till March last year, the government had tried to improve the image of Madhya Pradesh and build an environment of trust, but the Chouhan-led government has brought things back to square one.“Shivraj ji, this is true that MP is the heart of India, but know the fact that investment comes with trust, which your government never earned. Because under your rule, the state earned the dubious distinction being a state of mafias, adulterators, corruption, and unemployment and for always being on top among the states in the crime against women,” Nath said in the tweet.शिवराज जी यह सही है कि मध्यप्रदेश देश का दिल है लेकिन यह सच भी जान ले कि निवेश सिर्फ़ विश्वास से आता है , जो आपकी सरकार में कभी नही रहा ?क्योंकि आपकी सरकार में देश में प्रदेश की पहचान माफ़ियाओ , मिलावट खोरो ,भ्रष्टाचार ,बेरोज़गारी ,महिला अपराध में देश में शीर्ष वाले प्रदेशDespite holding many investors' meets by spending lakhs and crores of rupees and making claims about attracting investments, everybody knows the reality on the investment front in the state, he added. “We tried to change this image (of the state) and build an environment of trust during our 15-month rule, but the BJP could not tolerate it and by striking deals, toppled our government?” Nath alleged in his tweet.

25-07-2021||Mumbai||HC rejects bail of man who cheated Dena Bank of ₹245 cr in 2014||The Bombay high court recently refused to grant bail to a man who cheated Dena Bank of ₹245 crore in 2014. The man, while claiming to be a representative of the bank, influenced eight public entities to start fixed-term deposits with the bank to the tune of ₹259 crores and then used the KYC documents of the public entities to get loans against the deposits to the tune of ₹240 crores, officials said. He later siphoned off the amount using fake loan accounts in the name of the entities. The court held that as the offence was serious and the trial was likely to commence and end in a year, it was not inclined to grant bail as the accused had absconded after the investigation got underway. The single bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the bail application of Vimal Barot, was informed by advocate Ujjwal Gandhi that after being arrested the authorities had attached his properties under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and recovered a substantial amount of the defrauded money, hence the custody of his client was not necessary and he should be released on bail. According to the FIR in 2014, Barot had approached the manager of the Malabar Hill branch and introduced himself as a custodian of funds of government departments and corporations. He was asked to mobilise funds in the form of fixed deposits for the growth of the bank. Barot used this request of the bank to get public entities like Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation Ltd., Mumbai APMC, Hero MotoCorp Ltd., Modi Innovative Education Society, Modi ATI Education Private Ltd. and Mahatma Phule Backward Class Development Corporation Ltd. to make fixed-term deposits in Dena Bank. The amount he managed to garner was ₹256.49 crores. While the bank took him to be the financial advisor of these public entities, the respective authorities took him to be a representative of the bank and hence handed over documents for KYC to him. Barot retained the receipts from the bank and gave the entities photocopies and then based on the KYC documents applied for loans from the bank using the receipts as surety. The bank, assuming Barot to be the financial advisor of the entities, sanctioned the loans which were deposited in fake loan accounts and later withdrawn by Barot through various other entities. Special public prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar for CBI opposed the application stating that Barot had gone absconding after the fraud came to light and a complaint was registered. He was nabbed after being traced to Ahmedabad. Venegaonkar added that as the investigating officer in his affidavit had stated that the trial would start and end in a year, the presence of the accused was necessary and as he had already absconded once, allowing him bail would prejudice the trial hence his application should be rejected. After hearing the submissions, justice Kotwal observed, “The offence indeed is very serious. The sheer audacity of the applicant in defrauding various entities including the informant’s bank shows that this is not a case where some leniency can be shown to the present applicant in granting him bail during the pendency of the trial.” The court further took note of the statements of witnesses which pointed to the involvement of a bank manager in the fraud as well. In light of the opposition by the state and CBI and the fact that Barot had used the siphoned off amount to buy properties in his and his wife’s name, and as the trial was expected to be expedited, the bench rejected the bail application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-rejects-bail-of-man-who-cheated-dena-bank-of-rs-245-cr-in-2014-101627220967862.html
25-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana hikes dearness allowance from 17% to 28%||Following in the footsteps of the central government, the Haryana government on Saturday announced to increase the rate of dearness allowance (DA) for state government employees and pensioners from 17% to 28%. The fresh increase will be applicable from July 1 which means that employees and pensioners will get 28% DA on their basic salary in this month’s pay packet. It also means that no arrears pertaining to the period of freeze will be paid. The DA is a financial component added to the basic salary or pension of an employee twice a year to meet the increase in cost of living or inflation. Quoting a communication of Union finance ministry, the state government in 2020 had decided not to pay the additional DA instalments applicable to the employees from January 1, 2020; July 1, 2020; and January 1, 2021, on account of economic crisis due to pandemic. The state government though continued paying DA at the existing rate of 17% “The rate of dearness allowance as effective from January 1, 2020; July 1, 2020; and January 1, 2021, has been restored prospectively and subsumed in the cumulative revised rate effective July 1, 2021. No arrears for the period from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 will be paid,’’ said an order. Chief minister ML Khattar, who holds the finance portfolio, said the revision will benefit about 2.85 lakh government employees and 2.62 lakh pensioners. It will put an additional burden of about ₹210 crore per month on the state exchequer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-hikes-dearness-allowance-from-17-to-28-101627218747674.html
25-07-2021||Jaipur||‘State Congress leaders reach consensus over cabinet reshuffle’: Ajay Maken||AICC general secretary and Rajasthan in-charge, Ajay Maken on Sunday said the state Congress leaders have reached a consensus over cabinet shuffle and the final decision is to be taken by the party high command. Maken’s comments came during a press briefing.However, both cabinet shuffle and political appointments may have to wait until next month as Maken said he would be returning to the state on July 28 and 29 to hold discussions with MLAs once more. Maken, along with AICC general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal, arrived in the City last night and held long discussions with CM Ashok Gehlot at his residence. Maken and Venugopal are members of the committee constituted by the AICC last year when senior Congress leader and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot revolted. This is the first time that they held discussions together on issues raised by Pilot with CM Gehlot. After meeting ministers, MLAs and office-bearers at the party office, Maken said that all the leaders have unanimously left the decision of the cabinet reshuffle to the party high command. However, he did not disclose the date of cabinet expansion. “I can say that there is no disagreement or contradiction among the party leaders and they all have left the final decision about the cabinet expansion to the party high command,” he said addressing the newspersons. “I am returning on July 28-29 and will hold one-on-one dialogue with Congress MLAs over district and block (appointments) as AICC wants to know the feedback of MLAs before taking any decisions. We will also ask them for good names for appointments on Boards and Corporations,” he said “We are holding discussions over the appointment of district presidents, and political appointments on Boards and Corporations. I just want to say that all unanimously have stated that whatever high command decides is accepted to us. We soon will take decisions on these issues as there is no disagreement,” he said. Maken, along with Venugopal, reached the state party office where the meeting with the ministers, MLAs, and office bearers, who were in present Jaipur, was held. It was an unofficial meeting during which issues like inflation, Pegasus ow, among others were discussed. “People of the country are suffering from high inflation; many people lost jobs during the corona pandemic and instead of spending money and resources for people, the central government misused the resources for snooping and spying on the leaders, journalists and judiciary. This is highly condemnable,” Maken said. Last night, both the senior leaders held a meeting with chief minister Ashok Gehlot at his residence and held a detailed discussion about the cabinet expansion, political appointments in boards and corporations, and manifesto implementation, which was raised by Pilot during the political crisis. After Punjab, the party high command has shifted its focus to Rajasthan, where demands for cabinet expansion and political appointments gained momentum after reports of resentment in the camp led by Pilot, who along with 18 MLAs had rebelled against the leadership of Gehlot last year. Three days back, Pilot had indicated that Congress would soon take suitable steps to address issues raised by him. He had said that he is in touch with the party’s high command over the issues raised by him and hoped that the required steps would be taken soon. Pilot was removed from the post of Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister and state party chief in July last year after he rebelled against the Gehlot leadership. After a one-month-long political crisis, the party high command announced to form a three-member committee to address the issues raised by him. Last month, MLAs from the Pilot camp said that the party should fulfil the promises made to Pilot last month, following which the demand for cabinet expansion and political appointments gained momentum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/state-congress-leaders-reach-consensus-over-cabinet-reshuffle-ajay-maken-101627216408070.html

Over 30 state government departments were read the riot act by the chief secretary to clear the pendency and submit the documents to the AG office, which had flagged pending UCs and DC bills for reconciliation and submission at the earliest, an official in the finance department said on condition of anonymity.They said UCs worth ₹90,000 crore was pending with various departments including ₹26000 cr with the panchayati raj department followed by ₹17000 cr by the education department and ₹8000 crore by the health department as on March 31st, 2021. Similarly, submission of abstract contingent (AC) bills worth ₹13,500 crore is pending as on March 31st, 20201 as per AG records sent to the state government, the finance department official quoted above said. The panchayati raj department on Friday issued a letter to district panchayati raj officers to ensure that gram panchayats and other rural local bodies submit the UCs of central funds utilised in 2018-19 by August 5 and also asked for submission of UCs from 2019-20 by 30 September. “The pendency of UCs as indicated by the AG is not only of recent years but some as old as 2002-03. We are working on it and directives have been issued to major departments to lessen the pendency of UCs and DC bills. There is a drive underway to reduce the pendency of UCs and focus is on 16 major departments where pendency is high,” another officer said on condition of anonymityUCs are documents of expenditure made against grants in aid made to departments for specific purpose while DCs bills are final vouchers of expenditure details against withdrawal of public funds from state treasuries by various departments against abstract contingent (AC) bills.UCs have to be submitted within 18 months of withdrawal while DCs have to be submitted within six months of withdrawal of ACs to the AG office, as per rules. Last week, additional deputy CAG (eastern region) Rakesh Mohan had flagged the issue of outstanding UCs during his interaction with deputy chief minister cum finance minister Tarkishore Prasad and other senior officials. He had said UCs worth ₹55000 crore were pending as on 2018-19. Mohan, in a media interaction had pointed out that the “delay in submission of such vouchers leave ample scope of financial misappropriation”.He had also censured the state government for making unrealistic budgets and parking of funds in personal ledger accounts and personal deposit accounts. Additional chief secretary, panchayat raj department Amrit Lal Meena said his department has set a target for bringing down the pendency.“We are aware there is a pendency of UCs around ₹26,000 crore. A drive has started for submission of UCs by gram panchayats against funds given under 14 finance commission, fifth state finance commission and the state plan. The pendency of UCs would be brought down to ₹10,000 crore by December this year,” Meena said. Meanwhile, principal secretary, finance S Siddharth said instructions have been issued to departments to submit the UCs and DC bills on a priority basis so that it could be submitted to the AG office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-seeks-to-reduce-pendency-of-bills-submission-after-rap-from-cag-101627211005761.html
25-07-2021||Pune||Your Space: Ensure all students appear for exams||Some colleges affiliated to SPPU have not given clearance to final-year students to sit for annual exams due to pending fees. With parents facing financial strain to cover their kids’ college expense due to the Covid situation, what steps should the state, local and college authorities take to ensure that educational pursuits of students are not affected. Reduce education fees The Covid pandemic has affected all sectors financially. Colleges and universities are taking unnecessary fees like development fees, library fees, parking fees, etc. The administration should take steps to do away with unnecessary expenses. Nagpur university has already cut down expenses in their fees on these grounds and other varsities should follow this example. If the educational institutes are not taking steps to ease the fee expenses then the government must intervene. Vaibhav Edke Colleges should not bar students from exams Students from all over the state come to Pune for higher education. With colleges closed due to the Covid situation, hostels and other rooms are mostly vacant as students have returned to hometown. Even as these expenses have been excluded, students and their parents have to pay for laptops, Wi-Fi or high-speed internet connection at homes, and college fees. With many parents facing financial crisis in the pandemic, colleges should definitely give fee concession. Only tuition fees should be charged and other amenities like campus maintenance, libraries, laboratories should be waived off. It is the only justifiable way to move forward. Blocking of students from examination over fee dues indicates the blatant arrogance of institutions. Tanmay Joshi Waive fees for EWS students The opportunities for employment have shrunk because of the Covid-induced financial crisis. Though colleges were closed, students had to pay for the new electronic/digital devices and the internet. In such a scenario, collecting overall fees from students is wrong. If practical lessons are not taken then why students should pay for laboratories? Also, the additional fees such as gyms, recreational centres should be waived off. Exams are being conducted online now. So, examination fees also can be reduced. Considering all these points, the overall fee for the semester could be reduced at least 40%. The entire fee of students who are from the economically weaker section (EWS) should be waived off. This facility should continue for upcoming years as well because it will take time to recover from the losses caused by Covid. Amir Kasim Pathan Do not deny right to education The nation has witnessed the horrors of Covid for the last one and a half years. Many of our brothers and sisters have lost their parents and dear ones. Uncountable people have lost their livelihood. In this hour of the grave, it will be inhuman to deny them their right to education just for lack of monetary capacity. It is the right time to understand that education is a right that everyone should get without any discrimination and not a luxurious commodity to be bought by the rich only. Government, Institutions, UGC, and all parties concerned should come to the table to safeguard the future of youth. This is the least we can do for our young citizens. Vijaysingh Chaudhari Authorities should support students Every sector has been impacted because of the Covid. It has caused severe social and financial crisis for the informal sector such as farmers and labourers. Students like me, who come from such families cannot afford to pay fees. The financial condition of the families has collapsed. If more than one student is in the family then it is adding to the worry. So, a certain relief must be given to students from weaker economic background. In these uncertain times, everyone has the right to complete their education. We were somehow managing to pay the college fees regularly until now. But the situation has worsened after the second wave. Institutions, colleges, universities and the government should adopt a sensitive approach in these difficult times. Balaji Narwate, student Centre, state should allocate funds, fellowships The Covid-19 isn’t just a health crisis. It has weakened our economy and unsettled our education system. It has exposed our education model. And therefore, there is a growing need to modify our education system. New techniques in the field may help us to reduce fees and mental pressure. Many girl students discontinued their education owing to a streak of lockdowns and economic hardships. Countless students find it difficult to pay college fees. And hence, I urge the universities to revise their fee structure. Apart from tuition and exam fees, the other fees should immediately be dropped, so that students can continue their studies. The Centre and state governments should rigorously monitor the situation and allocate funds and fellowships.

25-07-2021||Patna||Monsoon session of Bihar Assembly to begin on Monday, likely to be eventful||The monsoon session of the Bihar Assembly, which will begin on Monday, is likely to be eventful as the opposition parties have chalked out a strategy to corner the state government on issues such as rising prices of fuel, cooking gas, fertilisers and edible oil.The stage for a stormy session has been set by the tug of war between the state government and the opposition over the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, passed by the Assembly in the last budget session.Unprecedented chaos erupted on March 23 when police was called inside the Assembly to assist the marshals in evicting unruly opposition members who tried to physically prevent Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha from taking his chair. The bone of contention was Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, which the Nitish Kumar government had introduced in a bid to give its police more teeth, deemed necessary in view of the increasingly complex security needs of the state which has been witnessing rapid economic growth.The opposition had termed it as "black" legislation, taking strong exception to provisions that empower the Special Armed Police, previously known as the Bihar Military Police, to conduct searches and arrests without producing a warrant. The Bill was passed by the Assembly, amid a "walkout" by opposition MLAs who had squatted outside the building and raised slogans, slighted by the manner in which they were ousted from the hall on that day by the men in uniform.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has already written to the Speaker, saying that opposition legislators were scared to enter the House due to the March 23 incident. “Our MLAs are now afraid of entering the House and raising questions there...let us know the result of the investigation on the March 23 incident. That was a black day which will never be forgotten," Yadav wrote in his letter. “Whether in the Assembly or on the road, anyone who asks questions related to the public interest is being thrashed by this government headed by Nitish Kumar”, he said.The monsoon session will continue till July 30. Two policemen were recently suspended after they were found guilty of assaulting opposition MLAs in the Assembly on March 23. The Speaker had already assured that strict action would be taken against those who were involved in the scuffle with the opposition legislators.Meanwhile, Sinha has said legislators, who haven't received vaccine doses, would not be allowed to attend the monsoon session, stressing on the need to adhere to the Covid protocols for safe conduct of the proceedings. "MLAs, who have not been vaccinated, will not be allowed to attend the session. Vaccination is important for all the MLAs attending the House”, he said. Sinha said exemptions can be given to the members on certain medical grounds. MLAs who have recovered from Covid-19 and have been advised by their doctors to get jabs after a certain period will be allowed to participate in the monsoon session, the Speaker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/monsoon-session-of-bihar-assembly-to-begin-on-monday-likely-to-be-eventful-101627206751261.html

According to officials of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the area in the Najafgarh-- Dhansa region of southwest Delhi has deep cultural roots. “It has a rich history and is also home to a marshy ecosystem, which allows flourishing of local wildlife with a number of migratory birds seen here every year. The photographic displays have tried to showcase these characteristics of the region,” the DMRC said in a statement. A jheel (lake) located between Najafgarh and Dhansa has a rich biodiversity inviting species such as eagles, ducks, kingfishers and parrots, among others, making it a hub for bird watchers, especially during the winters. “The printed glass panels at the station showcase the rich biodiversity and are themed as Migratory birds,” it said. Besides, the colour palette of the station area has been kept earthy and bold to show the amalgamation of rural and urban settings. For instance, a hand-painted artwork titled Fringes of rural-urban progression shows the values held by the two communities. Also, the surrounding villages in this area are known for their ancient folklore and hence some of the painted artworks inspired by this spirit are themed as Local socio-cultural scenarios. The artworks, contributed by various budding artists and photographers, have been curated by the DMRC’s architecture department. DMRC officials said that the approximately one kilometre-long Najafgarh -- Dhansa bus stand corridor is now ready for operations after receiving the mandatory approval from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS).“The exact date for opening of the corridor shall be intimated shortly,” said a senior DMRC official. With the opening of this extension, the Delhi Metro rail network will become 390 km long comprising 286 metro stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-dhansa-metro-station-adorns-artwork-depicting-heritage-culture-101627207285557.html

The HRTC bus drivers and conductors are agitating for their pending dues, while the transfer of Shimla’s regional manager to Nerwa has irked them further. HRTC employees’ union president Manoj Sharma said, “The trigger for this strike has been the transfer of our regional manager to Nerwa. We have been demanding night allowance, overtime allowance, dearness allowance of 8% and clearance of arrears for several months now.

The police have also asked the varsity to submit its records, including a three-member fact-finding committee’s report, which found substantial evidence of embezzlement of funds. In May, the cash-strapped university’s internal audit department and finance wing had red-flagged five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh. The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised turned out to be bogus. The committee, comprising registrar Varinder Kaushik, dean (research) Ashok Tiwari and finance officer Rakesh Khurana, probed the bank accounts of the senior assistant and others involved. The help of the university’s forensic department was taken to investigate the fake signatures and stamps. DSP Jindal said the preliminary report in the matter will shortly be submitted as the varsity has asked to furnish records pertaining to the matter. “The statements of three-member committee will be recorded. Moreover, those against whom the complaint is filed have also been asked to submit their statement so that preliminary report could be prepared,” he added. DSP Jindal said on the basis of their statements and findings of the preliminary investigation, further criminal action could be suggested.According to the varsity report, the senior assistant — who handled funds provided to the university under various heads and was posted in the same department for over a decade — used to create and submit bogus bills in the name of fake research scholars and assistants to siphon off money. The funds included those provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for development schemes, non-UGC grant for research projects and scholarships given by the Union ministry of education besides those received under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan. It has been learnt that the embezzlement went unchecked for six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fake-billing-scam-punjabi-varsity-staff-asked-to-record-formal-statements-101627156099324.html

In a demi-official letter written to the Punjab government earlier this week, secretary, health and family welfare, Rajesh Bhushan, has cited the vaccination data till July 17 to strengthen the claims that the state was going ‘very slow’ on administering second doses of the vaccine. “The dose interval for Covid-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Drive is 12-16 weeks for Covishield and four to six weeks for Covaxin. The CoWIN data as on July 17 shows that 9,36,758 beneficiaries are due for second dose of Covishield (beyond 12 weeks of first dose) and 78,062 beneficiaries are due for second dose of Covaxin (beyond six weeks of first dose),” the letter stated. Officials said among over nine lakh beneficiaries due for the secondary shot — as citied by the Centre — are two lakh whose second jab is pending for the past more than 40 days. Following the Centre’s letter, director, health and family welfare, on July 23 wrote to all civil surgeons to immediately focus on increasing the administration of second doses to the tune of 80% from the fresh supply. ‘Vaccine shortage biggest reason behind pendency’State’s nodal officer for Covid, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, said the biggest reason behind the high pendency is the inadequate supply of vaccines. “On Friday, we got just 28,000 doses, whereas on July 21, over 2.5 lakh doses arrived and most of them were consumed for second shots,” said the nodal officer. Punjab is expected to get the next supply of vaccines on July 28 and 29. “I was due for my second shot one week ago. I belong to Sangrur, so I tried my best to get the jab there but without any success. In Mohali, too, I failed to get the second dose and ultimately I preferred to get one at a private facility,” said Vikas Gupta, a 34-year-old gym trainer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/administer-2nd-dose-of-vaccine-on-priority-centre-to-punjab-101627156039440.html
25-07-2021||Mumbai||Contractors write to BMC, allege tender for demolition of fish market was fixed||Five contractors have written to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) alleging that the tendering process for the demolition of one of the city’s oldest markets – Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Fish Market – at Fort has been fixed.On July 12, BMC had floated a short quotation tender for the demolition of the dilapidated market. A short quotation tender is floated when there is an emergency to conduct a work, while following the traditional manner of tendering.The fish market was taken up for demolition in 2016, following the collapse of a building at Dockyard Road, in which municipal employees and their families had lost their lives. However, only four floors of the market were pulled down and the ground floor as well as the basement were left out.The Bombay high court had pulled up BMC, following which the civic body had submitted that it would undertake the structure’s demolition and rebuild it. BMC then floated short quotations tender for demolition of the remaining part of the structure.The five contractors have alleged that one contractor was informed about the tender in advance and that as per the tender they were given only day to submit the bids. The contractor, allegedly along with his dummy associates (to show competitive bidding), submitted the tender and bagged the contract. The five contractors have alleged that over 40 other registered contractors were not informed about the tender.Mohammed Hussain, whose firm Moosa Uka & Company has sent the letter to BMC, said, “This is fixing of the tender and it is going on from quite a few months. We had brought it to BMC’s earlier too, but no action was taken. We will take BMC to the court if the awarded contract is not cancelled and an inquiry is not ordered into the same.”BMC, however, denied all the allegations. Assistant municipal commissioner Chanda Jadhav said, “This is a court matter. The court directed BMC’s market department to demolish the market immediately. As per directions, a short tender notice inviting quotation from registered demolition contractors was displayed on the [A ward] office notice board, as the SAP system (software), including BMC portal, was closed for upgradation.”BMC had not pre-decided the cost of the demolition work. In such demolition contracts, the usual practice is that the contractor demolishes the structure and is allowed to sell the scrap material from the demolition as profit. However, whichever contractor offers the highest ratio of the amount to be obtained by selling the scrap material is awarded the contract by BMC.Matiullah Khan of MK Traders, which bagged the contract, said, “All allegations made against me by the five contractors are baseless. Even others had submitted the tender. So why did they not fill it? Their job is only to extort money from those getting the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/contractors-write-to-bmc-allege-tender-for-demolition-of-mumbai-market-was-fixed-101627155976887.html

In the latest hearing of the plea by the principal on July 22, the court directed the DGSE to file an affidavit detailing relevant rules, regulations, instructions or decisions of competent authority vide which the post of OSD to DGSE was created, and total remuneration and other facilities being provided to him. The court has also sought to know by August 11 whether before appointing Malhotra the post was advertised in any newspaper, and information on the financial head under which funds were made available for the post. Besides, the DGSE was told to provide complete details of all departmental inquiries entrusted to Malhotra and their status so far. The appointment came under scanner during the plea of Himachali Devi, a school principal, against whom Malhotra is conducting a departmental probe. In the previous hearing of this plea on July 15, the court had asked the state’s counsel to provide a copy of the order vide which Malhotra was appointed as OSD. But on July 22, the counsel only submitted that post retirement from the Punjab State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (PUNSUP), Malhotra was appointed as OSD to DGSE for one year from August 14, 2017. The counsel was not aware about any further extension given to him, leading the court to seek details from the DGSE. School principal had sought closer postingThe school principal, Himachali Devi, had approached the high court on June 28 after the state government failed to decide on her request despite a legal notice on January 11, 2021. Having lost her parents in the past two years and facing departmental proceedings in Mohali, Devi, who retires in June 2022, had requested the department to transfer her from Ferozepur to Mohali, where she also lives, or to neighbouring districts like Ropar or Fatehgarh Sahib. Her counsel Vipin Mahajan had argued that even a 2018 policy provided for “favourable” posting to an employee who was about to retire. After her parents’ demise and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was difficult for her to live alone in Ferozepur. Also as the probe officer in the departmental proceedings going on against her was in Mohali, it was difficult for her to visit the town every now and then to join the probe, the court was told. This is when it came to light that Malhotra’s post was not cadre based and he was a contractual employee, prompting the court to seek details about his appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-wants-a-deeper-look-at-appointment-of-punjab-dgse-s-osd-101627155857503.html

Heavy rains had wreaked havoc in Raigad, Ratnagiri and parts of Sindhudurg districts of the Konkan region, causing floods and landslides at 11 locations and killing over 76 people in the past couple of days.The district administration in Chiplun, Mahad and Poladpur areas – which were vastly impacted – have started work to restore power and water supply, provide potable water, carry out medical check-ups and distribute medicines, officials said. In Raigad’s Mahad and Poladpur areas, over 180 villages are affected, district officials said. Most of these villages are without power supply and access to clean water. Similar scenes were witnessed in Ratnagiri district’s Chiplun area where electricity is yet to be restored for 80% of the town, districts officials informed. People in the affected areas have spent over 80 hours without adequate food and water. Their homes, shops and establishments which were submerged underwater are now filled with muck.Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhari said that water has now receded in most parts of the district, but two fresh landslides were reported. Though the landslides occurred in an uninhabited area, it is blocking the highway, thereby creating hurdles to reach out to flood-affected areas, she said.“Mahad and Poladpur are the adversely-affected areas in the district. Only one carriageway is operational on the highway between the two places due to the landslides and flood. So the relief work is taking more time. It will take some more time to restore power supply in these parts. In other talukas, the work of restoring electricity supply is on. For water supply, we are sending tankers, and bottled drinking water has been sent to all the flood-affected villages. We have some NGOs that have come forward to help. We are also utilising our funds to provide food packets, water, clothing etc,” Chaudhari said.BN Patil, Ratnagiri district collector said that around 20% of the power supply in Chiplun has been restored. “Water supply is being restored as most sub-stations that were submerged and are being cleaned. They need to heat the transformers for two days at least [before starting supply]. We are using transformers which were not affected to supply power for emergency services.”In a bid to tackle the threat of disease outbreak following the floods, the district administration has geared up its machinery with the help of local civic bodies and Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers. Authorities added that they have received help from NGOs and private hospitals to distribute medicines. Chaudhari said the district is going to conduct tests to check for water and vector-borne diseases. “We have planned to carry out a universal check-up of people in the affected villages. We will conduct four-five tests, including for typhoid, jaundice and diarrhoea, for people who have fever. Besides that, we will also do Covid-19 tests. Medicine distribution is in progress with the help of government machinery and private hospitals,” she said.Authorities in neighbouring Ratnagiri have started door-to-door surveys in Chiplun to check for influenza-like illnesses. “Our district officials, along with municipal council and gram panchayat officials, Asha workers are going door to door to check for any influenza-like illness symptoms. The local body has started disinfecting water and only then will water supply be resumed,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/post-rain-horror-in-maharashtra-efforts-on-to-fix-power-stop-disease-outbreaks-101627155436823.html

Tiwari is the technical superintendent of the company. The trio had sought bail from the magistrate court but as it was rejected, they had moved the bail plea before the sessions court.They argued that AFCONS company – which had engaged the barge and the staff thereon – and ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) were responsible for the incident and had the authority to take a decision about moving the barge. They also contended that the captain of the barge had all the weather updates at his disposal, and it was his decision to stay at the sea. They claimed the decision taken by the captain might be wrong, but the accused persons cannot be blamed for that.They said they had relied on WhatsApp chat and emails between them and the captain to claim that in the opinion of the captain, the barge was absolutely normal at all the material times, except during the last few hours, due to the extremely bad weather conditions.“They were in constant touch with the captain and did their best to take every care of the barge and the members thereon. The barge was well-equipped with all the security and safety instruments. The incident is merely an accident,” the trio contended.The police opposed the plea and claimed, “The accused persons did not exercise proper caution and control over the situation. They, despite being aware of the increasing severity of the cyclone, let the captain go ahead with his decision to stay at the sea. They had every knowledge that their decision would bring forth a disastrous result. Yet they did nothing to save the lives of the members on the barge.”After hearing both the sides, the court refused to accept the defence that the three were in constant touch with the captain and went by his decision.The court said, “Such correspondence cannot be given much significance at this initial stage, particularly in view of the fact that only the barge in question was there in the seas and all other barges and boats had already returned to the shore/shelter.”“It is also quite obvious that the accused persons too had every knowledge of the fast-changing weather conditions and still did not make any attempt to apprise the captain of the severity of the cyclone from their side. They apparently were content with whatever the captain would decide. The accused persons thus did not exercise the proper caution that was expected of them. That was more necessary since the captain was obviously not taking a proper decision of keeping the only barge in question at the sea,” read the order.The court also noted that soon after registering the case, the police found that a CPU, supposedly containing all the relevant data, was found missing.“This rather extends substantial credence to the prosecution case that the accused had every knowledge of the havoc and the impact that the cyclone was going to make and yet let the barge and its members were allowed to stay at the sea,” read the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/p305-tragedy-mumbai-court-refuses-bail-to-3-officials-of-firm-that-owns-barge-101627155136805.html

They travelled from Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh and were attempting to move to Tripura for some unknown reasons. Railway Police Force (RPF) arrested them after observing some suspicious activities. All of them were handed over to the local police. Preliminary interrogation revealed that they had been residing in Indian territory for almost a decade. RPF sub-inspector Vinod Kumar Roy informed that 15 Rohingya immigrants, including six children (four girls and two boys), six men and three females, travelled to Badarpur in Kanchenjunga Express on July 22. They took shelter in a lodge for two days and attempted to move to Agartala on Saturday morning. “At around 9:00 am we noticed that a group of people was seated at the platform, their language and activities were different. During our regular checkup, we asked them to show tickets and documents, but they failed to show tickets or any valid Indian document. With the available documents, it was found that they were citizens of Myanmar who illegally entered Indian territory. They could not buy tickets because of a lack of Indian documents. We handed them over to Karimganj police after that,” he said.People familiar with the matter at Badarpur police station informed that, in initial interrogation, it was found that this group of Rohingyas entered into Indian territory in 2012 and went to West Bengal for work. Later, they moved to Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh and started working in a construction company as daily waged labourers. Five of the six kids were born in India but they don’t have any document issued by the Indian Government.

They went to West Bengal’s Siliguri once but could not manage to get any work. Finally, they decided to move to Agartala which is near the Bangladesh border. Police are suspecting that these people were planning to cross the border from Agartala.Police have found some documents along with these people which proves that they are residents of Myanmar. According to the documents, they are residents of Arakan coastal region of Myanmar which is near to Bangladesh border. Six mobile phones and some Indian currency were also recovered from them. This is not the first time that illegally entered Myanmar nationals have been arrested in Karimganj district of Assam.

Sandhu, a native of Amritsar, is also wanted in a drug-trafficking case in which 300kg heroin was smuggled from Pakistan to Mandvi in Gujarat through sea route in 2018.In January last year, the SFT had recovered 194-kg heroin and chemicals from a house in Sultanwind area of Amritsar, which was registered in the name of former member of the Subordinate Service Selection Board (SSSB) Anwar Masih on the disclosure of one Sukhbir Singh, alias Happy, who was arrested with 6-kg heroin in Mohali.After the raid, police also arrested seven people, including Masih and an Afghan national. During investigation, many more people were named in the case, including Sandhu. The heroin was smuggled from Pakistan via a Gujarat port, the investigation had found.Besides heroin, suspected 38.2-kg dextromethorphan and 25.9-kg caffeine powder, along with six drums of chemicals, were recovered from the house. The Afghan national, who was identified as Arman Basharmal, had travelled to India and was helping the accused in processing and increasing the quantity of the contraband. Masih had given his house on rent to another accused Sukhwinder Singh since December 2019 at ₹80,000 per month.“We have received an order saying the case has been taken over by the premier anti-terror investigation agency considering its international ramifications. A team of the NIA is expected to reach Amritsar in a few days to begin its probe. We will hand over our probe records to the team,” said a senior STF official, who didn’t wish to be named.“Racket’s kingpin Simranjit Singh Sandhu is presently living in Italy. The NIA got issued a red-corner notice (RCN) through Interpol against Sandhu in a case that was registered by the Gujarat anti-terrorist squad. His extradition was also approved, but he filed an appeal in an Italian court. It is expected that Sandhu will soon be brought to India,” he added. In 2018, Gujarat ATS had seized 5kg heroin in Salaya, a city in Dwarka district. Two persons, Rafiq Sumra and Abdul Aziz Bhagad, were arrested after the seizure. The Gujarat ATS’s investigation had found that they had brought 300kg heroin in two rounds through the sea route and Sandhu’s name emerged as the kingpin of the case. The NIA took over this case in July 2020. The 300kg consignment that was smuggled by Sandhu and his men into India was transported to Punjab and other north Indian states in trucks carrying cumin. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP-STF) Amritsar, Vawinder Mahajan, who is one of the investigation officers in the 194-kg heroin case, confirmed the NIA taking over the case, but didn’t divulge details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nia-takes-over-194kg-heroin-seizure-case-from-punjab-stf-101627153757403.html

Moreover, the HAP, being an armed reserve of the state, is supposed to move in company and platoon formation. Breaking up of the HAP cops into smaller units is in violation of the standing orders issued by the police headquarters,” Virk said, in his order.He ordered HAP inspector general Hardeep Singh Doon to withdraw two cops deputed to Ambala (on May 18, 2020) by 9am on Sunday and to place the police personnel concerned of ASI rank under suspension along with a regular departmental enquiry against him for this lapse.The officer on radar is OASI or Sena Shakha Pramukh at Commandant 1st Battalion in Ambala City. However, both Akhtar and Goyal remained unavailable for comments on the matter despite multiple attempts.Sub-inspector Mansa Ram of the Jagadhari City police station, who is the investigating officer of the suicide case, said the deceased’s body was handed over to his family on Saturday after proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC were conducted.“The deceased cop was deputed in Ambala in February to control the law and order situation following farmers’ agitation and was transferred here after tensions in Jaidhar village earlier this week,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/constable-dies-by-suicide-adgp-for-action-against-ambala-cop-for-lapse-101627153277175.html
25-07-2021||Chandigarh||She isn’t a ‘woman’, says Ludhiana man seeking divorce from 3rd wife||In a bizarre incident, a man approached cops saying he wanted to divorce his wife as she was not a ‘woman’ and demanded that his new bride and in-laws be booked for cheating on Saturday. The man, who has been divorced twice, told the police officers and counsellors at the Ludhiana police commissionerate’s mega camp at Shri Ram Park in Rishi Nagar that he had gotten married 11 months ago. Three days later, he realised that his wife had a physical deformity, which made it impossible to consummate the marriage. Nine days later, his wife, who had married the complainant after the death of her first husband, returned to her parents’ house. His wife followed suit and filed a cross case of dowry harassment against the man and his parents. After hearing both parties, the police have asked the woman to have herself medically examined by a board of three doctors at the civil hospital. Counselor Surjit Bhagat said the case was one of the most unique cases they had come across. “We are counselling both parties to opt for mutual settlement. Both families knew each other for two decades.” Elderly couple seeks separation after 40 years An elderly couple also approached the mega camp and sought separation after 40 years of marriage. The 60-year-old woman Jamila accused her husband Sunil, 63, for assaulting her. She said that her husband, who had retired from a charitable hospital, had started thrashing her after his superannuation. Their son had also accompanied them to the camp. After counseling, the couple came to a compromise and agreed to live together. Husband abandons wife during lockdown A woman Leena, 37, along with her nine-year-old daughter has been making rounds of the women cell for the last four months. She alleged that her husband them and gone to Uttar Pradesh, leaving her dependent on her parents. The complainant, who hails from Delhi, said she had gotten married 11 years ago and had moved to the district where her husband was posted. “When lockdown was imposed during the second wave of the pandemic, my husband left the house saying that he was going on an official assignment. Later, he stopped answering my calls,” she alleged. “We have not paid rent for the last four months. When the landlord called my husband, he disowned us,” she said, adding that her husband had only appeared for two of five hearings. Inspector Kiran Lata, who is dealing with the case, said they had witnessed a spike matrimonial dispute cases after the lockdown.Police go for kundi connection (BOX) While setting up tents to host the mega camp to dispose of matrimonial dispute cases in the park, cops were faced with an unforeseen challenge of arranging power to plug in fans. Ultimately, they powered the fans through an illegal kundi connection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/she-isn-t-a-woman-says-ludhiana-man-seeking-divorce-from-3rd-wife-101627153100530.html
25-07-2021||Lucknow||2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Grand alliance of Opposition parties may remain elusive||A broad-based political alliance bringing all the key players together is likely to remain elusive for the Opposition ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Despite alliances, the Opposition failed to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the 2017 assembly elections. The situation was no different in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls although there were no major alliances then.As the BJP gears up for the 2022 UP assembly elections by balancing caste and regional equations, the Opposition appears a divided house as of now.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav has given indications about going for an alliance only with the smaller parties, saying the SP has had bitter experiences of aligning with major political parties (the BSP in 2019 and with the Congress in 2017).Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, on the other hand, has declared her party will go it alone in the assembly polls in UP and Uttarakhand. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has said her party is open to an alliance to achieve the objective of defeating the BJP though going it alone will help strengthen the party organisation.“All major parties are unlikely to come together. There will, however, be alliances for sure for the 2022 UP assembly polls. Major parties need to work out a common minimum programme for forming a workable alliance instead of just reaching an electoral understanding before the polls,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department of political science, Lucknow University.The BJP worked out successful poll alliances both in 2019 and 2017. Since then, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has parted ways with the BJP. The Apna Dal (Sonelal) continues to be its alliance partner and is likely to remain so in 2022.Alliances on the other hand have not worked for the Opposition. Alliance partners have parted ways soon after the elections with claims of bitter or bad experiences of joining hands. The BSP and the SP that contested the Lok Sabha elections together parted ways soon after the polls. The RLD, a partner in the SP-BSP alliance, however, had an understanding with the SP in the panchayat polls. The SP, the Congress and the RLD had contested the assembly polls together in 2017. The SP and the Congress parted ways after the elections.“Yes, alliances in the past have not been stable. The Janata Party experiment also failed eventually,” said Dwivedi.The BJP’s vote share was 49.97% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh. This is much more than the total vote share of the major opposition parties — the BSP (19.42%), the SP (18.11%) the Congress (6.36%) and the RLD (1.68%).In 2017, the BJP won the UP assembly elections with 39.67% of the total votes polled against the the BSP’s (22.23%), SP (21.82%), the Congress (6.25%) and the RLD (1.78%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2022-up-assembly-polls-grand-alliance-of-opposition-parties-may-remain-elusive-101627153097267.html

It included expenditure of foreign tours of officials, religious gurus and media persons for organising the Mahotsav.The information provided by the Kurukshetra Development Board (KDB), in reply to an RTI application filed by Panipat-based advocate Amit Rathee, revealed that of total ₹42.3 crore, ₹9.59 crore was spent in 2016.A maximum of ₹15.19 crore was spent in 2017, followed by ₹11.07 crore in 2018, and ₹6.28 core in 2019, revealed the reply.The yearly average on the expenditure remained around ₹10 crore since 2016. But in 2020, the KDB could not organise the event on a large scale due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions.But a small ceremony was held at the cost of ₹0.17 crore, including ₹3.40 lakh spent on food and refreshments.The KDB had organised Gita Mahotsav in the United Kingdom and Mauritius as well. A similar event was scheduled to be held in Australia in March last year but was put off due to the pandemic.KDB honorary secretary Madan Mohan Chhabra told HT that the expenditures on the IGM is gradually coming down. He said the money was spent by the government via KDB and included all expenditures of events organised across state and in different countries.Chhabra, however, made it clear that there are no religious motives behind the expenditure. The aim is to provide facilities and infrastructures to visitors and promote cultural activities, he said. “These expenditures occurred on organising different activities, maintenance of places including the Brahmasarovar, providing facilities to artistes and guests and activities done in different countries,” he added.The KDB officials said the event provides a platform to craftsmen and artistes to showcase their skills and talents as the fortnightly crafts fair organised at the Brahmasarovar that lakhs of people visit.

25-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra floods toll now 112; 99 missing; 135K evacuated||The death toll due to the floods and landslides triggered by unprecedented rain over the past 48 hours in the Konkan and western Maharashtra regions climbed to 112 on Saturday, official data revealed. Rescue workers combed through the mud and debris in a desperate search for survivors with 99 still missing. A total of 135,313 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas.The monsoon mayhem of the past two days has caused the worst floods in decades in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Palghar, Thane, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited the hillside Taliye village in Raigad, where a landslide left just two concrete structures standing and flattened dozens of homes in a matter of minutes, burying 49 alive. He announced that the state will work out a plan to resettle people living in landslide-prone areas. He also said the government is preparing a floodwater-management plan.On Sunday, the chief minister will visit Chiplun in Ratnagiri district, most affected by floods.The state government with the help of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Coast Guard, Navy and Army, undertook rescue operations in the most affected districts. According to official information, 890 villages in nine districts were affected due to the torrential downpour and landslides since Thursday. Most people were shifted from the Sangli and Kolhapur districts — 78,111 and 40,882 respectively — according to the statistics released by the state relief and rehabilitation department.Rescue and relief work was hampered due to poor connectivity at some places. In Mahad in Raigad district, NDRF teams could not be sent by air as the helicopter carrying them could not operate due to bad weather. Residents in the flood-affected Chiplun town of Ratnagiri, which was mostly submerged on Thursday, expressed their anguish that the pace of relief work was too slow. They complained that even drinking water was not available. Water and electricity supply was badly hit in flood-affected parts of Ratnagiri and Raigad districts. As of Thursday, 11 cases of landslides were reported in the state. Taliye, Sakhar-Sutarwadi and Kevnale in Raigad, Posare in Ratnagiri, Ranjangaon in Sindhudurg and Ambeghar, Mirgaon, Humbarli, Dhokavale, Kondavli and Mojezor in Satara saw landslides where several people were found trapped and many lost their lives. A total of 135,313 people have been evacuated and shifted to safer places. However, 99 people are still missing, said a senior official from the relief and rehabilitation department.Thackeray on Saturday visited the Taliye village, where around 50 people are still feared trapped under the debris of at least 32 houses. Thackeray assured all the help and rehabilitation of affected people. He said the state was experiencing unprecedented incidents and required smart measures as no agency can predict the intensity and quantity of rains. The hopes of finding survivors in Taliye, Mirgaon, Dhokawale and Ambeghar in Satara were fading away as the rescue operation was stalled due to heavy rain on the third day. At Taliye, loose mud prevented NDRF from resuming digging to look for the missing. Locals said the rescue operation was progressing slowly due to bad weather and difficulty.“The state government will see no such incidents will happen in future and even if they happened, no human life will be lost in future. In order to achieve this, the state government will have to rehabilitate all villages located at hillslopes and foothills. The residents of such villages will be resettled at safer places,” Thackeray told mediapersons. “This has become necessary as no agency can forecast the intensity and quantity of rain, which is pushing the state into unprecedented conditions,” he added. He also declared to prepare a water management scheme, which will help in the state in the management of excessive water so that flooding can be avoided. Three districts in western Maharashtra — Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli — are hit by floods. Earlier in 2019 too. This area saw devastation due to flooded rivers. “We have started working on formulating a water management scheme to overcome the flood situation in the state. It will ensure management of excessive water collected in catchment areas of dams due to heavy rains, which often results in floods following discharge from dams,” Thackeray said.Although floodwater is receding in many areas in Konkan, it is rising in a few districts of western Maharashtra owing to discharge of water from dams. Till Saturday afternoon, 29,960 cusecs of water was released from Koyna dam. In addition to this, 10,420 cusec from Dhom dam, 5,237 cusec from Kanher, 4,645 cusec from Urmodi, 6,810 cusec from Tarali and 3,183 cusec from Dhom Balkawadi dam was released leading to overflowing of a few rivers and rise in floodwater levels in many areas of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, the officials said.Pune-Bengaluru national highway was closed owing to flooding, which led to a long queue of vehicles on the highway.Satara district collector Shekhar Singh said that 379 villages were affected due to flooding in Satara district of western Maharashtra leading to 18 deaths and 24 missing. Of them, 167 villages were entirely affected and 212 villages were partially affected. Around 1,324 families from the district were rescued and shifted to the safer places.Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhari said that 94 villages have been affected by floods and 22,467 families will be evacuated to safer places in the district.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in Pune said the state government is coordinating with its Karnataka counterpart to ensure flood relief for the people, especially in Kolhapur district, by releasing water from Almatti dam, which is downstream.He also said the state government has decided to distribute ration kits with rice, pulses, and kerosene in ration kits. “Normally, wheat, rice, pulses and kerosene are distributed as part of ration kits but considering the current situation wheat flour may not be available and hence the state government decided to provide rice, pulses, and kerosene in ration kits, which will help people to prepare khichdi as a meal,” Pawar said further.Meanwhile, union minister of education and skill development Dharmendra Pradhan declared that students in Maharashtra from flood affected districts will be given another chance to appear for the engineering entrance test — JEE (Main)-2021 session 3. The National Testing Agency announced that the exam dates will be announced soon.“In light of the heavy rain and landslides in Maharashtra, to assist the Maharashtra student community, I have advised the NTA to grant another opportunity to all candidates who may not be able to reach the test centre for JEE (Main)-2021 Session 3,” Pradhan tweeted.“Students from Kolhapur, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Sangli, & Satara, who are unable to reach their test centres on 25 & 27 July 2021 for JEE (Main)-2021 Session 3 need not panic. They will be given another opportunity,and the dates will be announced soon by the NTA,” he added.The third session of JEE main is scheduled on July 20, 22, 25, and 27 . NTA had already conducted the JEE Main Session 3 exams on July 20 and July 22 successfully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-floods-toll-now-112-99-missing-135k-evacuated-101627152437050.html

However, by considering the Covid situation and the financial condition of hawkers, many elected members jointly requested to bring down the fine amount to ₹1,000.The standing committee of the PMC has asked advice from administration over the elected members’ demand to bring down the fine amount.The administration submitted their view which will be discussed in the standing committee meeting to he held next week.The standing committee has the power to take decisions on financial issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmccorporators-seek-reduction-in-hawker-fine-101627152436528.html
25-07-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: In harmony with nature||With the wisdom of age, retirement and time for contemplation, developing a deepening sensitivity towards nature is inevitable. One such Chandigarh couple have woven a creative partnership that reflects this evolving sensibility. Lt Col RS Gill, a retired infantry officer from the Punjab Regiment, revels in photographing the double delight of butterflies alighting on gorgeous blooms in their Sector-36 bungalow. His wife, Jyotsna, a former Kendriya Vidyalaya teacher, is so deeply moved by the flower-butterfly harmony that she lets her feelings crystallise in verse. Her poems lend the proverbial “wordsworth” to her hubbie’s photographs and complete them.The nature-loving couple also had occasion to nurse a fallen squirrel pup, whom they christened Tipsy. The pup blossomed, went on to have three pups of her own and bestowed them blindly to the Gills’ trusteeship. The couple showered all the unrestrained affection and care on the helpless creatures that doting grandparents reserve for ‘dota-dotees’ (a daughter’s kids). “Whenever I feel low, I sit in the garden. Watching beautiful flowers, butterflies and honey bees revives me. It is therapeutic as you connect to nature. Colourful butterflies sucking nectar is a message to all of us: ignore your problems, think how blessed are we with this beautiful world,” Jyotsna told this writer.Stirred by the spectacles afforded by her garden, Jyotsna’s thoughts metamorphosed into a poem titled, Rainbows of colour or a kaleidoscope! “Butterflies bring a promise of hope, A garden with blooming flowers with colours so bright, Beautiful butterflies make a perfect sight, The little fairy with delicate wings, Sits on flowers and drops the pollen it brings, In the short span of life it performs its duty, Spreading a message of love and beauty, The life cycle itself a struggle, From the egg comes a larvae that wriggles, The dormant pupa locked in a cocoon, Then emerges a beauty a heavenly boon, They unfold their mesmerising wings, We forget our woes and our heart sings.”Just blue me awayTravellers to the mountains when monsoon magic exerts its ethereal charms speedily post photographs on social media. The enchanting images provoke the viewer’s lingering eye to savour the beauty and the imagination to soar to that blessed spot in the high mountains. Marooned in the plains’ suffocating humidity, how the heart sighs it were there, too!Explorer Saurabh Ranade from Nashik was fortunate enough to travel, photograph and post on social media one of the most mystical of the high sights: Himalayan blue poppies bending like chandeliers to a drape of monsoon drops. Truly, blue is the colour of depthless desire, of a longing for the distances you never arrive in. Artists have creatively copied and innovated from a diverse cache of bird, flower and landscape images uploaded on social media. Jaipur-based artist, Anshu Kashyap Jammoria, pines deeply for a trek to the poppy mountains because she has never seen such dreamy flowers. Pending that pilgrimage, a series of poppy paintings emerged from the wandering strokes of her brush. Easily accessible photos such as Ranade’s served as a beacon to her wondering imagination, to the yearning stirred in her soul.“There is something so fragile and delicate about poppies. Their transparent petals, the way they bow to rain and dew. I have depicted dewdrops and depending on the direction of light, the dewdrops show luminosity on the poppies’ outside while those settled deep within petal folds are subdued and subtle,” Dr. Jammoria told this writer. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-in-harmony-with-nature-101627151904150.html
25-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: A thought in any other language would be as potent||Of late, I have found myself competing in the perfect-parenting race. My contenders are young parents who know exactly what they want and do not want for their child, the overachievers trying to summit still more mountains through their progeny and the ones correcting their own perceived shortcomings through their kids.Also in running is that rare variety: parents who are passive and dubitable. They are the ones learning parenting not from a textbook or the vast ocean of cyberspace resources, but through the eyes of their child and by stepping into their tiny boots.One of the obstacles in this hurdle race is primary school admissions. While I was waiting in an interview room with the other contenders, I overheard one of them confidently say, “I want my child to think in English.”In a different corner, a parent could be heard bemoaning that their child had picked up the Hindi language from the domestic help, while another commiserated saying that their son’s grandparents only spoke to him in their native language.I, on the other hand, was having a hard time processing the notion of a child ‘thinking in English’, the need for ‘perfecting-the-English language’ classes for preschoolers or the benefit of limiting the influence of those who communicated effectively in their indigenous tongue.I tried to remember what I thought and imagined as a child. Were the thoughts limited to a specific language? Did my thoughts even have a language? I was always encouraged to think freely, without being limited by societal bias or gender. I was told I could be anybody I imagined, provided I believed in myself.What became of those concepts of freethinking? Is a thought or idea in the English language superior to those in a different language? Is a child mastering a particular language the ultimate criteria of supremacy? Are we creating an army of functionally identical mindsets? Do we correct the child at a pre-school level to revise the thought that was not in English? What effect does restricting a child’s thoughts to a single language have on him? All these questions called for in-depth study and research. After all, I was in a race, remember?Popular books such as the Bilingual Edge and articles such as ‘The power of the bilingual brain’ (Time Magazine, Kluger 2013) have reiterated the advantages of early bilingualism in employment, travel, establishing and maintaining a connection with family members, their culture and history, and making friends from different backgrounds.Assorted studies have also suggested that bilingual children show higher levels of social understanding and form better, long-lasting emotional connections. Most of these attributes are taken for granted. Bilingual children have demonstrated better skills than monolinguals in understanding thoughts, intentions, and perspectives. Thus, a relatively balanced exposure to multiple languages, people and thoughts, is likely to produce a generation of free thinkers, kind beings and approachable individuals.With all this supplementary knowledge, I soon found myself in another waiting room at yet another sought-after school, overhearing another conversation between my fellow contenders, contemplating on the role parents play in creating a beautiful mind without boundaries.shazuks@gmail.com( The writer is an advocate at Punjab and Haryana high court, Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-a-thought-in-any-other-language-would-be-as-potent-101627151416994.html
25-07-2021||Jaipur||KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken reach Rajasthan amid buzz over cabinet rejig||Congress general secretary KC Venugopal and party’s Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken reached the state late on Saturday amid speculation of a reshuffle in the chief minister Ashok Gehlot-led cabinet, people familiar with the matter said.Speaking on condition of anonymity, party leaders aware of the developments said that Venugopal and Maken were set to hold a meeting with Gehlot over the cabinet reshuffle, the appointment of district heads of the party organisation and other political appointments.The demands for cabinet expansion and political appointments gained momentum after reports emerged of resentment again brewing in the camp led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.On Wednesday, Pilot said he was in touch with the Congress high command over the party issues raised by him and hoped that required steps will be taken by the top leadership.“In-depth discussions were held on the issues which were raised in the context of Rajasthan. The AICC is taking steps for the betterment of the government and party organisation. We are in touch with the high command and I believe that the AICC is going to take necessary steps required to be taken,” he said.On July 12, 2020, Pilot, the then Rajasthan deputy chief minister and state Congress chief and 18 MLAs rebelled against chief minister Gehlot, leading to a 30-day-long turmoil that saw conversations of rebel MLAs and a Union minister leaked on social media, a protracted legal battle over powers of the legislative assembly speaker to disqualify MLAs that reached the Supreme Court, and an anticlimactic compromise that ended the revolt, but which, as recent events have shown, did nothing to address the underlying issues.“It has now been 10 months. I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven’t been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard,” said Pilot in an interview to HT in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/venugopal-maken-reach-raj-amid-buzz-over-cabinet-rejig-101627151356383.html
25-07-2021||Delhi||Man kills daughter’s stalker, caught while moving body on cart||A 41-year-old private security guard, who allegedly strangled his 25-year-old former neighbour to death with a cotton towel in a building in south Delhi’s Mahipalpur on Thursday night for reportedly harassing and stalking his 21-year-old daughter, was arrested while allegedly moving the body on a cycle cart to dispose it on Saturday.After the murder, the suspect, Surmesh, who originally hails from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh and was working as a security guard at a building owned by former Indian cricketer Atul Wassan, allegedly stuffed the body in a sack and hid it in a room at his workplace for nearly 30 hours. Later, a police patrolling team spotted the suspect moving the body on a cycle cart in Mahipalpur’s A-Block around 4am on Saturday and arrested him.“The guard was employed around three months ago through a private security agency and remained on night duty. I have learnt that the guard killed the man somewhere else but hid the body for two days in a vacant room in the parking space of my building. There are two rooms that we had planned to use for running the kitchen of my hotel that could not be made operational due to the Covid-19 lockdown. As far as the murder case is concerned, we are cooperating with the police and have provided them the CCTV camera footage in which the guard is seen carrying the body on a cycle cart,” said Wassan.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said, “Although the former cricketer has nothing to do with the murder, we may serve him a notice to join the investigation, if needed, because the body was kept at his property.”Police said that the victim, identified as Santosh Kumar Jha, worked as a driver in a courier company in Mahipalpur, and lived with his family some distance away from Surmesh’s house. They originally hail from Muzaffarpur in Bihar.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said a case of murder was registered at the Vasant Kunj North police station.Police said Surmesh confessed to the murder and said that Jha had been harassing his daughter for the past three years as he wanted to marry her. He alleged that Jha used to stalk his daughter all the way to her office and other places she visited.Despite the woman’s family members telling Jha several times that they will never agree to an alliance, he was allegedly constantly pressuring them for marriage, a police officer said, quoting Surmesh’s disclosure statement.On Thursday evening, the officer said, Jha consumed alcohol with a friend and then, at around 8.30pm, went to Surmesh’s house to once again seek permission for marriage which led to an altercation.To cool the tempers, Surmesh took him to the vacant room on the ground floor of his building to talk things through. “However, the fight continued and in a fit of rage, Surmesh punched Jha and the latter fell unconscious. Surmesh panicked and strangled Jha to death using his towel, after which he locked the room, and informed his wife about the murder. Later in the night, Surmesh stuffed the body in a sack and transported it to his workplace, which is 200 metres away, on a cycle cart that he had taken from there,” said the officer.Around 4 am on Saturday, while trying to put Jha’s body on the cycle cart, the sack tore and one of his limbs poked out, the officer said, adding that he went ahead to dispose the body but was spotted by a police patrol team.Jha’s family was informed about his murder when they reach the police station to file a missing persons complaint on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/security-guard-kills-man-who-stalked-his-daughter-caught-while-moving-body-on-a-cart-101627150036250.html

The only other example of the school leaving examination not being conducted was in 1917, long before the digital generation, when, due to World War I, the examination papers that were sent via sea mail from Cambridge, UK, could not be received.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/icse-isc-results-lucknow-students-excel-look-forward-to-college-admissions-101627149918573.html

The government is going on an overdrive. It is rampantly announcing new offices and projects without budgetary provisions,” he said.He further claimed that the state government was turning a blind eye to norms’ violations by tourists, which may ultimately lead to the third wave of the pandemic.Rathore also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.He claimed the Congress will win the Mandi parliamentary elections as well as Fatehpur, Jubbal Kotkhai and Arki byelections. In Arki, he said that the family members of Virbhadra Singh will be consulted before the party decides on the candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-accuses-jai-ram-govt-of-wasteful-expenditure-for-electoral-gains-101627133714441.html

25-07-2021||Noida||Chorus grows for public transport services in Greater Noida West||The lack of public transport facilities in Greater Noida west, that is a hub of affordable housing, makes commuting a harrowing experience for residents as they have to depend on private vehicles and unruly autorickshaw drivers, most of whom refuse to take them to their desired destinations.Several representations to the UP government have failed to move authorities. Residents said a safe public transport system that will be affordable for all sections of the society and ply to all the housing projects is the need of the hour.“There is no public transport service in Greater Noida west, which is home to at least 4 lakh housing units. We have demanded public transport facilities in meetings with officials and also written to top authorities, but nothing happened. Autorickshaw drivers demand ₹150-200 for a distance of 5km and most of us cannot afford private vehicles,” said Anita Prajapati, a resident of Gaur City of Greater Noida West.“In the absence of zero public transport facilities, travelling from one sector or group housing to another is a daily struggle in this area. All sections — be it domestic helps, school or college going students, elders and many others — have no alternative other than depending on unruly autorickshaw drivers, who refuse to go to all the areas. We recently demanded from the Greater Noida CEO to make sure all areas are covered by the public transport system,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association, who has written to the UP government and other officials demanding public transport services.Spread on an area of about 4,000 hectares and home to many housing groups, the Metro connectivity in Greater Noida West is a distant dream as the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC), that has been entrusted the responsibility of building the Metro project here, is yet to hire an agency. The nearest Metro station from Greater Noida West’s sector 1 or Gaur City is the one at Noida’s Sector 51.“To travel from Gaur City to Sector 51 metro station of the Blue Line, autorickshaws throw tantrums and demand exorbitant fares. Daily office goers and other commuters have no choice but to travel in autorickshaws,” said Rani Mahajan, a resident of sector Techzone-IV in Greater Noida West.Earlier, the NMRC was running a city bus service with 50 air-conditioned buses on 21 routes covering Noida and some parts of Greater Noida West. However, the buses plied only to a few main roads.“We have communicated the need for a public transport system in Greater Noida West to the NMRC, which has the mandate to run this service. We hope that the NMRC will soon address this issue,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of the Greater Noida authority.“We had to stop the bus service in February last year because of issues with the contractor, whose work order was terminated. Now, the service will be restarted only after a new agency is hired. The decision to hire a new agency has been delayed because of the Covid-19 outbreak,” said Gopal Sharma, an officer on special duty, NMRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chorus-grows-for-public-transport-services-in-g-noida-west-101627062009659.html

25-07-2021||World||Pelosi names second Trump critic from GOP on panel probing Jan 6 violence at US Capitol||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday named a second Republican critic of Donald Trump, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, to a special committee investigating the Capitol riot and pledged that the Democratic-majority panel will “get to the truth.” Kinzinger said he “humbly accepted” the appointment even as his party's leadership is boycotting the inquiry.Also Read | Pelosi blocks Trump allies from Jan 6 panel, GOP may boycottWith the committee set to hold its first meeting, hearing from police officers who battled the rioters, Pelosi said it was imperative to learn what happened on Jan. 6, when insurrectionists disrupted the congressional certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory, and why the violent siege took place. That mission, she said, must be pursued in a bipartisan manner to ensure “such an attack can never happen again.”Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, will bring "great patriotism to the committee’s mission: to find the facts and protect our Democracy,” she said in a statement.He joins Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, as the two committee's Republicans, both selected by the leader of the opposition party. Kinzinger and Cheney were among the 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump’s second impeachment. They were the only two Republicans who voted last month to form the special committee.Also Read | Pelosi names Republican Liz Cheney, a Trump critic, to panel probing Jan 6 riot“For months, lies and conspiracy theories have been spread, threatening our self-governance,” Kinzinger said in a statement. “For months, I have said that the American people deserve transparency and truth on how and why thousands showed up to attack our democracy.”“I will work diligently to ensure we get to the truth and hold those responsible for the attack fully accountable," he said.House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has said the GOP will not participate after Pelosi, D-Calif., refused to accept two of the members he picked.McCarthy, R-Calif., has said the committee was a “sham process” and withdrew his five members when Pelosi rejected two of them, Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio. Both voted on Jan. 6 against certifying Biden’s election victory over Trump and both are outspoken allies of the former president.Kinzinger and Cheney have faulted Trump as a factor in spurring the insurrection with his persistently false claims that the 2020 election was “stolen” due to voting fraud.In recent weeks, Kinzinger has suggested he would be open to serving on the committee, despite threats from McCarthy that Republicans who accept a spot could be stripped of their regular committee assignments as retaliation for participating.“It's clear that Pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative. That’s why she’s picked the group that she’s already picked,” Banks said on “Fox News Sunday.” He said that “anyone that she asks to be on this committee, from this point moving forward, will be stuck to her -- her narrative, to her point of view. There won’t be another side.”The House voted in May to create an independent investigation that would have been evenly split between the parties, but Senate Republicans blocked that approach. Pelosi said the new panel was being created only because a bipartisan commission was no longer an option.Currently Cheney sits on the committee along with seven Democrats — ensuring they have a quorum to proceed, whether other Republicans participate or not.Pelosi expressed confidence that the committee’s work will be seen as bipartisan and credible even with McCarthy’s effort to boycott the panel.“We have to, again, ignore the antics of those who do not want to find the truth,” she said. “We will find the truth.

However, on Friday it reimposed a “stricter” 14-day nationwide shutdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.Health Minister Zahid Maleque said that everyone should abide by the restrictions during the ongoing lockdown to reduce fresh cases, The Daily Star newspaper reported."We do not want the number of patients to increase. To reduce the number of patients, we have to reduce the infection," Maleque said after visiting the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Convention Centre here.Expressing concern over the increasing infection rate in many cities across the country, he warned, “If the infection continues to increase like this, there will be no place left in hospitals.”"If the coronavirus situation is not brought under control, it will harm the country's economy, which we do not want. Therefore, there is no alternative to following the health safety rules," the health minister said.The BSMMU field hospital with 1,000 beds, including 200 intensive care units and high dependency units, will start operation from next Saturday, said the report.On Saturday, India sent a consignment of 200 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen on an Oxygen Express train to Bangladesh.Giving details about the Covid-19 cases in Bangladesh, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) said on Sunday that 228 people died from the contagion in the past 24 hours, taking the country’s death toll to 19,274.Dhaka counted 69 deaths, the highest among the eight divisions, followed by Khulna with 50 fatalities.It said that 11,291 new cases were reported during the last 24 hours with an infection rate of 30.04 per cent, taking the national tally to 11,64,635.The government had reimposed the lockdown on Friday and said everyone must stay indoors as offices, courts, garment factories and all other export-oriented industries will remain closed.Junior minister for public administration Farhad Hossain said: "this lockdown will be stricter than the one imposed last time".Army troops, paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh and elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion personnel have joined hands with police in enforcing the shutdown on the streets of the capital Dhaka and other cities and their entry points.The security personnel in uniform have set up makeshift checkpoints to restrict peoples’ movement without emergency needs.The health experts have said the lifting of the ban allowed millions to travel to their home, crowding public buses and ferries and warned it could heighten the toll and infection cases in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-continue-to-rise-hospitals-may-run-out-of-capacity-bangladesh-govt-101627229755126.html

President Joe Biden had set a goal to administer at least one dose of the vaccine to 70% of the adults in the country by July 4, but it remained unfulfilled. Biden urged people to get vaccinated and lashed out at social media companies or allowing vaccine misinformation to remain in circulation.Reports of vaccination rates going up have been emerging from states with a high number of cases, which the White House confirmed on July 22. "In the past week, the five states with the highest case rates — Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri and Nevada — had a higher rate of people getting newly vaccinated compared to the national average," Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said during a White House briefing.Fauci also praised Republican politicians Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Ron DeSantis of Florida, and the second-ranking House leader, Representative. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, for encouraging their constituents to get vaccinated, these states have been reporting low rates of vaccination since the drive was started. “What I would really like to see is more and more of the leaders in those areas that are not vaccinating to get out and speak out and encourage people to get vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-anthony-fauci-cautions-us-is-moving-in-the-wrong-direction-urges-unvaccinated-individuals-to-take-the-jab-101627229586868.html
25-07-2021||World||China gets new World Heritage Site with links to Hinduism, Tamil Nadu||As many as 22 sites in the southeastern Chinese city of Quanzhou including a temple with links to Hinduism were included to the Unesco World Heritage List on Sunday.The new listing of “Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China” by the world’s top cultural organisation boosts the credentials of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s maritime silk road, the sea route part of the Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI), which aims to link China with Asia and beyond through infrastructure projects on land and sea.China has been promoting the coastal province Fujian and the city of Quanzhou as an important ancient sea trade zone where multicultural communities including from Tamil Nadu mingled a millennia ago.Xi served as governor of Fujian between 1999 and 2002, and also visited Quanzhou.The listing decision was made on Sunday during the Unesco World Heritage Committee’s 44th online session chaired from Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian, the same province where Quanzhou is located.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi had decided to establish “sister-state relations” between Tamil Nadu and Fujian during the latter’s visit to Mamallapuram for the second informal summit in October, 2019 - it was because of Quanzhou’s ancient links with Tamil Nadu.Key sites in the listing include Kaiyuan Temple with Hindu and Buddhist links, Luoyang Bridge, Qingjing Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in China and an archaeological site of an old maritime trade office, said to have been first established in 1087, according to state-run China Daily newspaper.China’s submission document to Unesco applying for Quanzhou’s heritage status, surprisingly, did not specifically mention the city’s ancient links with Tamil Nadu but only mentioned Hinduism.“Historic monuments and sites of ancient Quanzhou (Zayton)” is directly associated with the significant events of (Chinese general) Zheng He’s voyages to the west and tangibly associated with the spread of Islam, Manichaeism, Hinduism, and Nestorianism in the southeast coastal area of China,” the document said.Wang Liming from the Quanzhou Maritime Museum shared more details. “Today, anyone who talks about the relationship between ancient Hinduism and China cannot do without mentioning the city of Quanzhou…Its past prosperity left the city with a great number of precious cultural relics. Among them, the carving art of Hinduism presents people opportunities to understand Hindu scriptures and myths and exhibits the friendly exchanges between Quanzhou and India’s Tamil Nadu which started more than 1,000 years ago,” Wang wrote in a recent article, which she shared with HT on Sunday.“With Quanzhou’s growing popularity globally, people with different religious beliefs from all over the world came to the city. While Christianity, Islam, and Judaism arrived one after another, Hinduism also came with Indian merchants. Followers built magnificent Hindu temples and sacrificial altars in the metropolis,” Wang wrote.The temples, however, have gradually been destroyed.About a specific temple, Wang wrote: “Today, this very temple, which was described as ‘extremely magnificent’ in the local historical annals, has long been destroyed. Although it is impossible to see its original appearance, a large number of exquisite stone carvings have been unearthed in Nanjiaochang, where the temple was probably located. Hindu architectural components have also been found at many locations in the city.”Following Sunday’s listing, China now has 56 Unesco World Heritage sites, one less than Italy with the most such locations globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gets-new-world-heritage-site-with-links-to-hinduism-tamil-nadu-101627225226902.html

Hundreds of cars washed away in floods have piled up in different parts of the city.

The crisis also increased due to water shortage in the Rawal and Khanpur dams as they touched the dead level causing water shortage in one of major cities of Pakistan, according to a report by Express Tribune.The citizens of Rawalpindi continue to face difficulties as the gap grows between water supply and demand. This has also led to a thriving water tanker business in the city with one tanker selling at PKR 3,000 to PKR 4,000. Out of the 460 tubewells which are functioning under the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), three of them have halted extracting water from 350 feet underground. The pressure of water which was being supplied from the 600 feet deep tubewells has also declined.The report also highlights that the population of 1.6 million people continue to face difficulties as civic bodies are currently supplying 46 million gallons of water daily against the requirement of 59 million due to depleting water level in Rawal and Khanpur Dam. At least 150 tubewells of Rawalpindi Cantonment and Chaklala have started drying up due to depleting groundwater levels. Incessant load shedding has also added to woes as it has stopped tubewells from working to their full capacity.WASA managing director Raja Shaukat Mehmood said that due to the crisis authorities are now understanding that Rawalpindi needs futuristic plans to mitigate its water needs. Mehmood also said that Rawal and Khanpur dams along with the tube wells are not capable of meeting the future water demand of Rawalpindi.Experts warned the Pakistan government earlier that famine-like situations may arise in Pakistan due to water scarcity across the country if the issues remain unresolved.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rawalpindi-faces-acute-water-shortage-amid-scorching-heat-report-101627223327702.html

The US has been in negotiations with Tehran to rejoin the international nuclear accord that former President Donald Trump quit, though talks are now on hold until after the Islamic Republic’s hardline president-elect, Ebrahim Raisi, takes office in early August.Zarif and al-Thani were to discuss Iran-Qatar ties and “the most important regional and international issues”, according to a statement from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs that gave no further details.In January, al-Thani told Bloomberg TV that Qatar was ready to broker talks between Iran and its Arab neighbors in the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, in order to end the crisis triggered by the unraveling of the nuclear accord.Qatar Says It’s Time Gulf Arabs Start Talks with Iran (1)An unsourced report in Iran’s reformist Etemad newspaper on Friday said Tehran and Riyadh will soon formally re-establish ties and that Saudi Arabia plans to send a representative to Raisi’s inauguration next month.Saudi Arabia broke off ties with Iran in 2016 over Riyadh’s execution of a revered Shiite Muslim cleric, which provked an attack on the kingdom’s embassy in Tehran.

Don't denigrate people for trying to keep themselves and their families safe," said Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy.Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Munira Wilson said Javid's tweet was "outrageous" while thousands remain in hospital with Covid-19."His careless words have insulted every man, woman, and child who has followed the rules and stayed at home to protect others. He owes them all, especially the millions who are shielding, an apology," she said.Hours later, Javid took to Twitter again to issue an apology for the use of the word cower, which means to crouch down in fear. His updated tweet reads: “I've deleted a tweet which used the word ‘cower’. I was expressing gratitude that the vaccines help us fight back as a society, but it was a poor choice of word and I sincerely apologise."“Like many, I have lost loved ones to this awful virus and would never minimise its impact,” he said.The minister, among those in the ruling Conservative Party who have been in favour of easing lockdown restrictions, will return to work as England enters the second week since all legal lockdown restrictions were lifted on July 19.On Saturday, daily coronavirus cases fell in the UK for the fourth day in a row, with 31,795 infections and 86 deaths. Some scientists have cautioned that the data did not yet capture the impact of the so-called “freedom day” last Monday when lockdown restrictions were significantly eased across all parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-sajid-javid-apologises-for-his-comments-about-covid-recovery-101627214551522.html

Men were forced to grow beards and wear a cap or turban. Music and other forms of entertainment were banned.Anyone not abiding by this code risked being publicly lashed, beaten or humiliated. Women who disobeyed these rules were sometimes killed, wrote Sher Jan Ahmadzai, in Asia Times.Taliban is re-imposing repressive laws and retrograde policies in areas captured by them, they are imposing laws that defined its 1996-2001 rule when they enforced their version of Islamic Sharia law.During peace negotiations and on visits abroad, the Taliban's leadership has expressed both a belief that women have rights under Islamic laws and a desire to reduce violence in Afghanistan.The group has also pledged to protect such public infrastructure as government buildings, roads and schools, which it has often attacked.But in newly captured areas their policies are more hard-line, says Ahmadzai.According to reports by the Afghan stations Radio Liberty and Radio Salam Watandar, Taliban rulers in Afghanistan's north and northeast have asked families to marry off one girl per family to their fighters; said women should not leave home without a male relative, and ordered men to pray in mosques and grow beards.The Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission, an Afghan government agency, says public infrastructure has been destroyed and social services halted in many Taliban-controlled areas, leaving 13 million people without public services, reported Asia Times.All evidence suggests the Taliban still believe in restoring their old system of the emirate, in which an unelected religious leader, or emir, was the ultimate decision-maker. No one could challenge his verdicts because he was believed to have divine authority from God, says Ahmadzai."The Taliban don't believe in democracy. They just want the collapse of the government so they can reconquer Afghanistan and reimpose their system," Ahmad Rashid, a Pakistani journalist who has covered Afghanistan for 20 years, told Germany's Deutsche Welle newspaper in July 2021.The Taliban's revival of its extremist policies in rural areas has filled many women in the cities with dread."I'm worried that women could return to the dark days of the past when we were just housewives and banned from taking part in society, culture, politics, and even sport. What happens when the Taliban takes over the cities? What will happen to women then?" asked Sanam Sadat, an activist in Faryab's provincial capital, Maimana, which is under government control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-prepares-to-restore-dark-days-in-afghanistan-re-impose-repressive-laws-101627209097919.html

This has been designated as a variant under investigation on Wednesday, The Independent has reported. The variant is known as B.1.621. The authorities have clarified that not much has been known about this variant and there is no evidence to suggest that it might make vaccines less effective or lead to more severe illness so that the new strain does not spread fears among people.The B.1.621 variant of SARS-CoV-2 might be a new variant in the United Kingdom, but this is not new in the world, In January, the variant was first identified in Colombia."Most of the cases have been linked to overseas travel and there is currently no evidence of community transmission in the UK," the Independent reported.The Covid-19 situation in the United Kingdom worsened in the last few weeks which has been attributed to the Delta variant of the virus. Despite the surge in the cases, Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in the UK this week. On Saturday, Britain reported 31,794 coronavirus cases.Reports said the R rate of coronavirus in the UK is around 1.2 and 1.4 which means one infected person can spread the infection to more than one person. The infection rate in private households of England has also been the highest since January.What is the variant under investigation?Before classifying any variant as of interest (variants of interest) and concern (variants of concern), variants are first investigated. As of now, this new strain is being considered as a signal and its risk is being assessed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-variant-found-in-uk-16-cases-detected-so-far-what-we-know-101627210297146.html

Ley said, “We ask for only two things: time for experts to see first-hand our commitment to the reef, and for the final climate policy to provide a consistent framework for addressing the impacts of climate change on all World Heritage properties.”Also Read | Great Barrier Reef downgraded: Other UN World Heritage sites in dangerA full-fledged adoption of the Australian-proposed amendments to the committee’s draft report, at a meeting held in China on Friday, would have postponed any possible downgrading till 2023. However, amendments moved by Norway put the Great Barrier Reef on the committee’s agenda for its next annual meeting, scheduled for June 2022. The proposal to downgrade the Great Barrier Reef’s status as a World Heritage site was moved in June this year. In a draft report, the World Heritage Committee had recommended that the reef’s status be downgraded to “in danger,” citing the damage caused to it due to climate change. However, reacting angrily to the proposed move, Australia had called it “flawed,” also hinting at the “politics behind it.”Once a heritage site is downgraded to “in danger,” it is just one step away from losing all World Heritage standing.Australia was first informed in 2014 that the downgrading of the reef to this listing was being considered, prompting the federal government to respond by developing a long-term initiative called the “Reef 2050 Plan.” However, in 2016, 2017 and 2020, the Great Barrier Reef suffered “significantly” from coral bleaching caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures.

Main opposition Conservatives had won 121 seats – and a larger share of the votes – in the 2019 polls.When Trudeau first became PM in 2015, he had come to power with a majority government, having then secured 184 seats.Canada’s next round of federal elections are scheduled for October 2023.Lately, his administration has been negotiating a wide range of issues in the build-up to a possible snap election this year, some which include his handling of the pandemic, administration of Covid-19 vaccines, economic recovery, recent discoveries of unmarked graves of indigenous children at former church school sites, and deaths from an unprecedented heatwave in western Canada.A new poll from the firm Ipsos, conducted for the outlet Global News, has concluded that “a Liberal majority is now in doubt given tight races in seat-rich provinces and only a six-point lead nationally”.Trudeau, however, is still in prime position to lead the next government, regardless of the number of seats his party wins if there’s a snap election.According to Ipsos, the ruling party has lost 2% support over the last one month, while the Conservatives have gained 4%. Trudeau’s party continues to lead by 36% support against 30% backing for the Conservatives. While 58% of the respondents are “closer to the opinion that it is time for a change in Ottawa”, if the 42% who believe Trudeau deserves re-election vote accordingly, Liberals “would cruise to a majority victory”.Another recent poll, conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute (ARI), noted that the Trudeau administration’s “handling of the pandemic has been a relative strength for the Liberal government over the last year and a half. Now, just one-in-five (19%) identify it as a top issue, down from 45% in March”.According to the ARI survey, issues that are taking over voter consciousness include the climate crisis, economic recovery, size of the deficit, and indigenous issues, with the latter picking up “notable traction in recent months”.The ARI poll also places the two main parties in a “statistical tie”, with the Liberals at 33% and the Conservatives at 31%.A key challenge for Trudeau before he decides to go ahead with snap polls is gauging the mood of the voter base, which as of now seems not to favour federal elections. As much as 37% of the electorate is “upset at the thought of a fall election”, 34% is “unsure about it”, and just 26% is “happy” with the prospect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polls-show-trudeau-won-t-form-majority-govt-if-canada-holds-snap-polls-this-year-101627193184150.html

She developed a fever and cough on June 16 but did not seek medical attention until she was taken to National University Hospital on June 18, where she tested positive for Covid-19 the next day, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement.In a video posted on social media on Saturday, Prime Minister Lee said, “Don’t wait till it’s too late."“Most people your age are already vaccinated, including many of your friends and neighbours. Protect yourself, and your family too,” said the Prime Minister."There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected," the MOH added.Singapore reported 130 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, 127 of whom were from the community and three were imported (or people who arrived here from abroad).As of Saturday, Singapore has reported a total of 64,057 Covid-19 cases.A 27-year-old Indian national, who works as an engineer at Ecoxplore, and a 32-year-old Indonesian domestic worker are linked to one of the closed clusters, according to a Channel News Asia report.The MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has increased from 238 in the week before to 1,027 cases in the past week.A total of 490 cases are in hospital, with most well and under observation. Six of the new cases are people above the age of 70 years who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated (first dose of injection) and are at risk of serious illness, the MOH added.Nine people above 60-years-old, who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, have fallen very ill, said the MOH.There are 12 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and one in critical condition in the intensive care unit. None of the 13 cases is fully vaccinated.Meanwhile, a popular Indian restaurant, Samy's Curry at Dempsey, has been shut for two weeks until August 8 for cleaning as it became a cluster of Covid-19 cases."Our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at the restaurant," media reports quoted the MOH.All staff at the restaurant have been placed on quarantine. Free Covid-19 tests will also be offered to people who had visited the restaurant between July 19 and 23.The MOH said all visitors to the Dempsey area, where a wide range of eateries and restaurants operate, should monitor their health closely and minimise social interactions as much as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.There are currently 26 active Covid-19 clusters in Singapore, ranging between three and 741 infections, according to the news channel's report.Over the last 28 days, 11 local cases required oxygen supplementation and were admitted to ICU or passed away. Six are unvaccinated, five are partially vaccinated and none was fully vaccinated.Mandatory Covid-19 testing is conducted across apartment blocks where coronavirus-linked cases are detected.This is done to uncover community infection cases, the MOH said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-pm-assures-senior-citizens-of-vaccine-safety-urges-them-to-get-jabbed-101627185129566.html

Alcala was 77 at the time of his death, the authorities confirmed in a statement, adding that he died of natural causes at the San Joaquin Valley Hospital.Alcala, dubbed "The Dating Game Killer", was sentenced to death in 2010 for five slayings in California between 1977 and 1979, including that of a 12-year-old girl. However, authorities suspect that he may have killed as many as 130 people across the country.Alcala's modus operandi was luring women by offering to take their pictures. He later strangled or beat his victims to death after sexually assaulting many of them.“There is murder and rape and then there is the unequivocal carnage of a Rodney Alcala-style murder,” the brother of an 18-year-old victim of the serial killer told the Associated Press, shortly after Alcala was sentenced to death.Investigators say his true victim count may never be known.Alcala received an additional 25 years to life in 2013 after pleading guilty to two homicides in New York. However, he was charged again in 2016 after DNA evidence connected him to the 1977 death of a 28-year-old woman whose remains were found in a remote area of southwest Wyoming.Alcala earned the moniker of "The Dating Game Killer" after appearing in 1978 as "Bachelor No 1" on an episode of "The Dating Game", an American television show where a "bachelorette" would be asked to accompany eligible "bachelors" on a date, with the roles being reversed occasionally.Although Alcala won the contest, the woman playing the bachelorette later decided not to go on a date with him because she found him "disturbing", according to several news reports.Authorities say Alcala continued killing even after he appeared on the television show. He stalked women like prey and took earrings as trophies from some of his victims, prosecutors said while presenting his case at the court.“You're talking about a guy who is hunting through Southern California looking for people to kill because he enjoys it,” Orange County, California, prosecutor Matt Murphy said during his trial. Two of his victims were posed nude after their deaths, one was raped with a claw hammer and all were repeatedly strangled and resuscitated to prolong their agony, prosecutors said.After the sentencing, authorities released more than 100 photos of young women and girls found in Alcala's possession in hopes of linking him to other unsolved murders around the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rodney-alcala-dating-game-killer-dies-in-california-hospital-101627178557236.html

"Now we're not energy independent," Trump said.Earlier this month, the OPEC countries decided to extend the agreement on oil production cuts until the end of 2022. The US does not participate in OPEC talks, but Washington has expressed support for the negotiations.Trump also criticized Biden for allowing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project to go ahead, and laughed at claims of reported Russian involvement in the Hunter Biden laptop hack. "Russia did it again," Trump told the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Phoenix, pointing out that "it's always Russia" because "they are getting rich from China" but not from Russia.Trump also criticized the current administration in Washington for not doing enough to stop the spread of Covid-19 and once again blamed the pandemic on China, saying it should "pay us retribution."The former president reiterated his claim that the presidential elections last year were rigged, saying that the Democrats cheated with "millions of votes" in 2020. Trump called the election a "disgrace" and told the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit that "our nation is being destroyed."The former US president pointed to increasing violence and crime in the US, saying that defunding the police and weakening law enforcement is going to make the situation worse."Hundreds of people are being shot every weekend" in Chicago, Trump said, stressing that the city is "worse than any war zone." He also emphasized that crime rates are at unprecedented high in New York."We're becoming a communist country," Trump emphasized, adding that the current leadership is allowing the US to get "pushed around" by other countries.He said that the current administration is responsible for the influx of immigrants who continue crossing the southern border.Trump also criticized the Green New Deal (GND) on climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-criticises-biden-for-approach-to-energy-covid-internal-security-101627173536308.html

Please protect yourself and your loved ones – get vaccinated,” Biden said in a tweet.Florida made up about one in five cases as the number of infections rose to 73,199 from 45,584 for the week ending on Thursday, after almost doubling in the previous seven days. Along with Texas and Missouri, the three states accounted for 40% of cases this week.Texas hospitals have started to run low on beds for the sickest virus patients as caseloads climb. Texas recorded more than 5,000 new virus cases in the past 24 hours, state data showed.Meanwhile, US government health officials increasingly think vulnerable people will need Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, the New York Times reported, without saying where it got the information.People who are 65 and older or who have issues with their immune systems most likely will require a third shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, according to the newspaper.More than 50 people were arrested and being charged with offences after anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police in Sydney, Australia, while Vietnam announced a 15-day lockdown in the capital Hanoi starting on Saturday as coronavirus infections surged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-vaccinations-as-us-sees-surge-in-covid-cases-101627154068844.html

The curfew will be effective between 10pm and 4am local time, Ahmad Zia Zia, deputy interior ministry spokesman said in a separate audio statement to reporters.Since early May, the Taliban have launched a widespread offensive across the country that has seen the insurgents capture border crossings, dozens of districts and encircle several provincial capitals.Biden assures Ghani of continued US supportWith the withdrawal of American-led foreign forces all but complete, the resurgent Taliban now control about half of Afghanistan’s roughly 400 districts.But on Friday, US President Joe Biden assured President Ashraf Ghani of US diplomatic and humanitarian support despite the withdrawal set to be completed by August 31.In a phone call, Biden and Ghani “agreed that the Taliban’s current offensive is in direct contradiction to the movement’s claim to support a negotiated settlement of the conflict”, a White House statement said.Biden on Friday authorised up to $100 million from an emergency fund to meet “unexpected urgent” refugee needs stemming from the situation, the White House said. He also authorised the release of $200 million in services and articles from the inventories of US government agencies to meet the same needs.Separately, Pakistan has deployed regular troops at forward positions along the Afghan border due to the fluid security situation in the neighbouring war-torn country in the wake of the withdrawal of foreign troops, a media report said on Saturday.Interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that Pakistan Army soldiers have replaced the Frontier Constabulary (FC), Levies Force and other militias from the frontline positions, the Dawn newspaper reported.Meanwhile, the embassy of India in Afghanistan on Saturday reiterated the June 29 security advisory for Indian nationals in the country, urging them to exercise the utmost caution with regard to their security.

Attendees carried signs and banners reading "Wake up Australia" and "Drain the Swamp".In France, where police deployed teargas and water cannon against some protesters, an estimated 160,000 took to the streets in nationwide protests against President Emmanuel Macron's health pass that will drastically curtail access to restaurants and public spaces for unvaccinated people.- 'Don't touch our children' -"Freedom, freedom", chanted demonstrators in France, carrying placards denouncing "Macron, Tyrant", "Big Pharma shackles freedom" or saying "No to the pass of shame".The demonstrations highlight the conflict globally between people caught between the advice of the World Health Organization and other public health agencies and the need to earn a living -- or simply to return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle.In Indonesia and the UK, governments have pressed ahead with easing of restrictions even in the face of surging.Meanwhile, around 5,000 people demonstrated in Athens, carrying placards touting slogans such as, "Don't touch our children", according to an AFP journalist at the scene.And in Italy protesters gathered in Rome to demonstrate against a mandatory "green pass" for indoor dining and entertainment.Earlier in Sydney, demonstrators pelted officers with pot plants and bottles of water as they defied a month-long stay-at-home order, a day after authorities suggested the restrictions could remain in place until October.New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was "utterly disgusted" by the protesters whose "selfish actions have compromised the safety of all of us".Police said they issued nearly 100 fines and arrested 57 people.In Melbourne, meanwhile, six people were arrested. police said.- 'Morons' -New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott said a team of detectives would be scouring footage to identify and charge as many people as possible in the coming days."Sydney isn't immune from morons," he said.Sydney, a city of over five million people, is struggling to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant, first identified in India and now spreading globally.After escaping much of the early pandemic unscathed, around half of Australia's 25 million people are now in lockdown across several cities.There is growing anger at the restrictions and the conservative government's failure to provide adequate vaccine supplies.Just 11 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.In France, as elsewhere in Europe, the government is making it harder for reluctant citizens to put off getting the jabs.Legislation now being considered by lawmakers will make vaccinations compulsory for certain professions, while the controversial health pass will severely restrict social life for holdouts from the end of July.There were signs the tougher measures announced on July 13 were having the desired effect: 48 percent of the population were fully vaccinated as of Friday, up eight percentage points from July 10.While more than three-quarters of French people backed Macron's measures, according to a July 13 Elabe poll for BFMTV, a sizeable and vocal minority do not. Elodie, 34, a care assistant at a Strasbourg nursing home, denounced "the blackmail of caregivers who were at the front line" during the first wave and who are now threatened" with "no more pay" and even being fired."They've been lying to us since the beginning," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-restrictions-over-delta-variant-trigger-protests-in-europe-australia-101627152365258.html
25-07-2021||India||AIADMK’s top two to meet PM Modi today||Chennai: In a first, AIADMK leaders Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam will together meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Monday, in which party leaders say they would discuss recent developments in Tamil Nadu after the DMK defeated the NDA alliance and formed the government in May. The meeting also comes in the backdrop of the DMK initiating raids against former AIADMK minister for transport, MR Vijayabhaskar, last week. Officials from the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) raided 26 places linked to him on July 22, seized ₹25,56,000 in cash and incriminating documents, and filed a case including charges of disproportionate assets. The AIADMK had called it a political vendetta. One of the DMK’s election promises is to establish a special court to prosecute top AIADMK ministers, including Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, on charges of corruption. In retaliation, the AIADMK plans to protest across Tamil Nadu on July 28 against the DMK not fulfilling its election promises, such as abolishing NEET and cutting fuel prices.“The meeting has been in discussion for about the past 10 days and we received an appointment now,” said a senior AIADMK leader not wishing to be identified. “They are likely to speak about the raids and the political situation since local body elections are also coming up.”The meeting will be keenly watched as the AIADMK was criticised as being puppeted by the BJP’s central leadership when Panneerselvam and Palaniswami occupied the chief minister’s chair, analysts say. Panneerselvam had confirmed much of this speculation when in 2018 he said that he patched up with Palaniswami on Modi’s advice. While their dual leadership continues in the party and as they stay united amidst the threat of expelled leader VK Sasikala, the tensions between the two have still not completely resolved, analysts say. Sasikala has been making the AIADMK uncomfortable with her attempts to take over the party reins. After her phone diplomacy, last week Sasikala went on a first political outing to a hospital to visit AIADMK’s presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan who was in the ICU. Palaniswami, who was also in the hospital at the same time, had left immediately when he knew of her coming. Madhusudhanan had rebelled against Sasikala and sided with Panneerselvam back in 2017 when the party was divided following J Jayalalithaa’s death in office in 2016. Madhusudhanan was also the petitioner who succeeded in getting the Election Commission to allot the AIADMK party name and two-leaves symbol to the Palaniswami-Panneerselvam camp.Panneerselvam who left for Delhi on Sunday morning is said to be with his family as his son and member of parliament OP Ravindranath has moved to the government-provided residence in the capital. Palaniswami has followed him and the meeting is scheduled for 11am.“It’s a courtesy call,” said AIADMK’s spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan. “We haven’t received any information on the agenda as yet, but this is the first time that the two leaders are meeting together in Delhi.” Recently the AIADMK had to quickly douse a problem with the BJP when former law minister CV Shunmugam blamed the national party for their poll debacle by saying that they lost minority votes. The state BJP leaders immediately retorted that the AIADMK was to blame. The AIADMK then sought to clarify that their alliance with the BJP will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmks-top-two-to-meet-pm-modi-today-101627237768911.html
25-07-2021||India||DMK allies Congress, VCK accuse TN governor of discrimination||Chennai: The allies of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Congress and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) have accused the Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit of being a member of the Sangh Parivar after the Raj Bhavan released photos of his with new JP state president K Annamalai on Friday.Criticising Purohit, Congress and VCK leaders said that the governor was behaving with a political bias as he refused to take photos with them earlier in July when they had visited him to submit petitions. The governor, they said, informed them that he has stopped clicking pictures of his meetings.“We can’t insist that he take photos with us but if it is his policy, he has to be consistent. This is a clear case of discrimination,” said VCK MP D Ravikumar. “By taking photos only with BJP leaders and releasing them he is openly showing his political alliance which is in contradiction to his post. A constitutional authority should be neutral,” he said.Tamil Nadu Mahila Congress also condemned the governor and asked him to explain why he was acknowledging only one political party. “Governors are constitutional entities who must transcend political and communal affiliations but he posed for a photograph with the BJP like a committed Sangh Parivar member,” said R Sudha, state president, Tamil Nadu Mahila Congress. A Congress delegation of two MPs, S Thirunavukkarasar, S Jothimani, legislative party leader K Selvaperunthagai and Sudha had met the governor on July 8 to submit a petition against fuel price hikes. She said that their phones were also taken away to be sanitised.Ravikumar said that even back in 2019, they were not allowed to take photos with him. “We had met him in September 2019 to submit a petition for the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and we requested for a photo because it is news and we wanted to keep a record. We do that when we meet union ministers also,” he said. On July 8, VCK founder president and MP Thol Thirumavalan met the governor to submit a petition to give representation for Adi Dravida community while appointing vice chancellors in universities that are under the Department of Higher Education on the basis of social justice. “Because the governor is also the chancellor of universities, this petition was submitted to him,” says Ravikumar who wasn’t present at this meeting. “Is the Raj Bhavan a Sanghi retreat,” tweeted VCK’s deputy general secretary, Vanni Arasu.An official from the Governor’s office who did not wish to be named said that they are aware of the issue but they have no comments on it.Purohit was appointed as governor of the state in September 2017 and he has been embroiled in controversies in the past particularly with the DMK staging several protests in the past when they were in the opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-allies-congress-vck-accuse-tn-governor-of-discrimination-101627237707546.html

The weather department has issued a red alert for seven districts in the coastal areas of Karnataka, predicting three more days of rainfall. As many as 22,417 people have been rehabilitated in 237 relief camps set up in this region in the rains. According to the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority, as many as 283 villages in 45 taluks were the worst affected due to widespread rains, which have impacted more than 36,498 people. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday visited the flood-affected areas along with R Ashok. “I assure the people that the government is with them. I have spoken with all concerned officials and compensation will be given to all those affected due to the floods,” the CM told reporters during an interaction in Belagavi. He also said that officials are in touch with the Maharashtra government over the release of water from dams in the neighbouring state that have a direct impact on the flood situation in the northern districts of Karnataka. According to the data released by KSDMA, more than 3,502 electric poles have been uprooted and 342 transformers were damaged due to which electricity supply in several villages has been disrupted. R Ashok said that 59,000 hectares of agriculture crops and around 2,000 hectares of horticulture crops were submerged due to excess release of water and heavy rains in the north Karnataka region. “As many as 134 houses have collapsed, 2,480 houses partially, while 213 schools have been partially damaged due to excess rains in the region,” he further explained. Thousands of people were evacuated from danger zones after eight landslides, including one that derailed a train, were witnessed a day prior. Karnataka sounded a red alert on Friday night in the districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, and Kodagu. An orange alert was also raised in the Belagavi and Dharwad districts. The CM on Saturday had directed the district in-charge ministers to stay put in their respective districts and monitor the relief and rescue operations in the areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-situation-in-k-taka-remains-grim-10-dead-till-now-101627237648718.html
25-07-2021||India||Graphic artist Anand Radhakrishnan wins prestigious Eisner award||Mumbai-based graphic artist Anand Radhakrishnan, 32, has won the prestigious Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, considered the Oscars equivalent of the comics world.The Eisner Awards are given out annually and the award won by Radhakrishnan -- Best Painter/Multimedia Artist (interior art) -- recognises the creator of a graphic novel’s art and images. Radhakrishnan shares the award with UK-based colourist John Pearson. They won for their work on UK-based author Ram V’s 145-page graphic novel Blue In Green, published in October 2020 by Image Comics.The mixed-media images, created using pencil, ink and acrylic paint, are hauntingly realistic portrayals of a young musician’s self-doubt and struggles in pursuit of creative success. “Blue In Green is about existential dread, an artist’s insecurity. The story is slow-paced and subdued and the images complement the narrative,” Radhakrishnan told HT. “They are very realistic in terms of the proportions and anatomy and the images are a little hazy as well.”Winning an Eisner is great validation, he adds. “I work from home and very few people get to see what I do. But when Eisner acknowledges you, you realise that people are looking at your work. It’s made me feel that what I do has meaning.”He’s hoping the recognition will draw attention to the graphic novel in general too. “I strongly believe that if there is a consolidated effort to push graphic novels, they have the potential to become as big in India as Manga is in Japan,” Radhakrishnan says.The Mahim resident is currently working on another graphic novel, Radio Apocalypse, also with Ram V. It is the tale of a radio station and crew that have survived the apocalypse. The book is set for release in October.The Eisner Awards were founded in 1988 by American comics editor Dave Olbrich, in response to the discontinuation of the popular Kirby Awards for comics in 1987. The Eisners are named in honour of the pioneering writer and artist Will Eisner. The awards are announced each year at the San Diego Comic-Con.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/graphic-artist-anand-radhakrishnan-wins-prestigious-eisner-award-101627237467587.html

25-07-2021||India||Afghanistan, Pak support to terror on visit agenda||New Delhi The fallout of the drawdown of US troops on the security situation in Afghanistan and the need to pressure Pakistan on terror financing and sanctuaries for terrorists will be on the agenda for US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit to India this week. The two sides are expected to discuss ways to deepen defence collaboration, including exercises, defence transfers and technologies, as part of preparations for the fourth 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers to be held in the US later this year, people familiar with planning for the visit said on condition of anonymity on Sunday. Blinken is the third senior member of the Biden administration to visit India after defense secretary Lloyd Austin in March and special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry in April. During his two-day visit, he will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on July 28. The situation in Afghanistan is expected to be one of the main topics on the agenda for Blinken’s discussions with his Indian interlocutors because of the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the country in the aftermath of an offensive by the Taliban to capture territory and crucial border crossings with Pakistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. India is concerned about the instability in Afghanistan spilling over into parts of the region and Pakistani terrorists from Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed currently fighting alongside the Taliban turning their attention towards Kashmir. “On the regional security situation, the implications of the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan over terror financing and terror havens will be part of the agenda,” one of the people cited above said. India attaches considerable importance to Blinken’s visit, which will be an opportunity to take forward the conversation with the US on bilateral and regional issues and tackling the Covid-19 crisis and other international developments. With regard to Covid-19, the people said discussions will cover containing the pandemic, supply of vaccine raw materials, and economic recovery efforts. “India will continue to push for ensuring open and consistent supply chains for materials and items needed for vaccine production, as the country ramps up production for both domestic vaccination and global supplies thereafter,” the person cited above said. The need for resilient supply chains for critical medicines and healthcare equipment is also likely to come up, the person said. The Indian side will also press for gradual resumption of international travel while maintaining health protocols, especially easing the mobility of students, professionals and business travellers, and allowing travel for family reunions and humanitarian issues. As part of the focus on the Indo-Pacific region, the two sides will discuss ways to deepen engagement under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, including the possibility of a meeting of foreign ministers of India, Australia, Japan and the US later this year. The two sides will also take forward the Quad vaccine partnership, which was launched at the first virtual summit of the group in March, to enable the supply of made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines to countries in the Indo-Pacific from early 2022, the people said. The two sides will exchange assessments about the Indo-Pacific region, with the focus on Covid-19-related assistance, economic slowdown and the security scenario. The latest developments in West Asia and Central Asia are also likely to be covered. This is Blinken’s first visit to India after assuming office and it reciprocates external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s trip to the US in May. The two ministers have also met in the UK on the margins of a G7 meeting and in Italy on the sidelines of a G20 meet. Other issues that are expected to be part of the discussions are augmenting trade and investment and tapping opportunities in healthcare, education, the digital domain, innovation and security. Climate change too will be a key area, especially the potential for green collaborations, climate finance and transfer of clean technologies to developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-pak-support-to-terror-on-visit-agenda-101627236987525.html

Ramappa temple was India's only nomination for the UNESCO World Heritage site tag for the year 2019.1. The temple was constructed in 1213 AD during the Kakatiya Empire by Recharla Rudra, a general of Kakatiya king Ganapati Deva.2. The presiding deity of the temple in RamalingeswaraSwamy.3. The temple was named after Ramappa, the chief sculptor. According to the Telangana government's website, this is probably the only temple in the country to be known by the name of its sculptor.4. It is said that the temple is built with bricks that are so light that they can float on water. The bricks were believed to be made spongy using something like saw-dust.5. It took nearly 40 years to complete the temple, according to the Telangana government's website.6. The temple stands on a 6-feet high star-shaped platform with walls, pillars and ceilings adorned with intricate carvings which are the hallmarks of the Kakatiya sculptors.7.

Experts highlighted the need for following Covid-19 preventative measures strictly to avoid a second wave-like crisis.AIIMS Delhi’s Dr Yudhyavir Singh who manages the Covid-19 ICU said the lifting of restrictions is necessary to resume economic activities at a time when cases are low but he highlighted the need of following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Singh also said that Delhi may have already achieved herd immunity, considering the massive number of cases seen during the second wave, according to a report by news agency PTI.Dr Pooja Khosla who is a senior consultant, department of medicine, at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said Covid-19 second wave taught people that an increase in cases can happen suddenly.“There are warning signs from different parts of the world. In India too, a small increase in cases has been recorded. Infections can increase exponentially at any time. I think one should not assume anything and make all efforts to prevent a second wave-like crisis, which was a nightmare,” Khosla was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. She further added that reopening everything is not appropriate since everyone is speculating that the third wave is not so far away.However, another expert said that despite breakthrough infections among vaccinated people the severity of the infections will be lesser. “Even if there are breakthrough infections among vaccinated people, the severity will be less and hospitals will not be overwhelmed,” Pragya Sharma, professor at the department of community medicine at the Maulana Azad Medical College said. She pointed out that preventative measures, as well as pace of vaccination, will be vital in decreasing the severity of infections among people in the third wave.Sharma also highlighted that people have a callous approach towards Covid-19 preventative measures. “People either don't wear masks or don't wear them properly. Most of them use cloth masks, which doesn't serve any purpose. There is hardly any vigil being maintained in crowded areas,” Sharma further added. She also said that people are not turning up for vaccination as expected.Dr Jugal Kishore said that 80% people have immunity against the virus either due to previous infection or due to vaccination. “The Delta variant of coronavirus was responsible for up to 60 per cent of the cases during the second wave. We haven't observed any major difference between 'Delta' and 'Delta Plus' variants. So, a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases is not expected, until a new, more infectious variant emerges,” Kishore who is head of the community medicine department said.Kishore highlighted that at least 30% of the population of Delhi, who have either not been infected or did not develop enough antibodies despite getting vaccinated due to various reasons, could get infected.“Two cases are possible – first, the virus continues to infect people slowly until herd immunity is attained, and second, a new, more infectious variant leads to an increase in cases till everyone has immunity. But it seems the third wave won't be as severe as the second,” Kishore said.He further added that the possibility of a new variant bypassing immunity achieved through vaccination and previous infection could lead to major problems. He also said that if people from rural areas are coming to Delhi and those who have remained isolated so far are stepping out into crowded places there is a possibility of a spike in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-infections-can-increase-any-time-doctors-on-third-wave-101627233878866.html
25-07-2021||India||'Moment of pride': Pakistan's Sikh body hopes Sidhu's elevation will help reopen Kartarpur corridor||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu's elevation as the Punjab Congress chief has made Pakistan's Sikh body proud and it hopes that Sidhu would be instrumental in reopening the Kartarpur corridor after it was closed owing to the Coronavirus pandemic. Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee's general secretary Amir Singh in a video message congratulated Sidhu and said the 'lehnda (West) Punjab' is equally happy for Sidhu's new appointment."This is the pride of the entire Sikh community," Amir Singh said adding that Sidhu played a crucial role in the opening of Gurdwara Kartarapur Sahib in 2019. "But I have an appeal as well. Sidhu should also take up the matter of reopening the corridor from the Indian side. We hope that you will address this issue with the same enthusiasm.""I also hope that like you went to seek the blessings from Golden Temple after becoming Punjab Congres chief, you will come to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib through this corridor to seek blessings," Amir Singh said.On November 9, 2019, Sidhu attended the inauguration ceremony of the Kartarpur Corridor in Pakistan and stole the show displaying bonhomie with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. His speech in which he equally praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Imran Khan for the Kartarpur project, went viral. "I came to thank mera yaar who transformed mere babe da ghar (my Guru’s place) into heaven in months...Punjabis on both sides suffered the pain of Partition. Modi and Khan have applied balm...I may have political differences but I will give Modi a Munna Bhai MBBS ki jhappi (hug)," he had said.The corridor was closed from both sides on March 16, 2020 in the wake of the Covid-19. While Pakistan had opened the shrine in October 2020, India is not allowing pilgrimage registration. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee already urged the government to reopen Kartarpur pilgrimage when all other religious sites in the country reopened after the first wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistans-sikh-body-hopes-sidhu-s-elevation-will-help-reopen-kartarpur-corridor-101627231848672.html

25-07-2021||India||Vijay Diwas: Kargil is more than a place and war for me, says battle hero’s daughter born three months after sacrifice||Aparajita Acharya was born three months after her father Maj Padmapani Acharya, MVC, was killed in action in the Kargil war. But not having him around never came in the way of her bond with him. “I have never met or seen my father but have conversations with him in my mind since childhood. I am told that our choices in a lot of things are quite similar. I think we would’ve bonded very well if he were alive and I would have endless things to tell him. But one thing that remains the same despite his presence or absence in physical form is the fact that I love him, I am proud of him. He is my hero and the best father in the world,” says Aparajita, a law student in Hyderabad. “While it is simple genetics at play when people say I look like him, I am blessed that my face reminds people of someone so great. My family believes that there is a bit of him living in me. Our food choices, the way we laugh, the kind of books we enjoy, some of our hobbies and surprisingly – our handwriting in Hindi is very similar. These are things I was not aware of but revealed by my family eventually. It makes me happy,” adds Aparajita, who grew up on stories about her father, how he was an absolute prankster, admired for his sense of humour, loved for his charisma and of course, the valiant soldier he was. “I admire his optimism even in the face of death. Until Maj Vivek Gupta’s news came on TV, the family did not know that the unit was fighting in such a heated sector in the war. He never spoke about the kind of danger he was in and his letters spoke of joyous things, beautiful values and concern for the family,” she says. Beyond the battlefield, he had a magnetic personality that left a lasting imprint on people he met. “I am told that he loved animals and reading books. In his letters, he would very fondly talk about our pet boxer Kajal (his first daughter by all means), who people actually mistake to be my elder sister. This love for animals is an integral part of our entire family. My biggest learning from his life, his journey is how he played multiple roles at one given point of time so well. An excellent leader, spirited soldier, dutiful son, doting husband and brother, and a fantastic father. He made sure the 5 minutes he probably found once in a few days with sleepless nights in the face of such danger, he was there for his family. He believed in the duty and dharma of a warrior; a soldier inspired from the Gita that he told my mom to read when she was expecting me.They did not know my gender back then, but he lovingly referred to me as Mowgli from Jungle Book,” says Aparajita , who will soon turn 22.Growing up, every year on Vijay Diwas, she would see her grandparents giving several interviews motivating people to join the armed forces. People put garlands on her father’s bust and tributes poured in from across the nation. “Kargil, to me, is more than a place and war. It’s an aching, proud, yet landmark memory in the history of our soil. Kargil symbolises the spirit of fighting till victory - courageous, undefeatable spirit despite all odds. A quality I aspire to imbibe,” shares Aprajita.However, she points out that it is problematic that so many are clueless about the war. “I was born 3 months after my father’s martyrdom. Yet, growing up, most people in and around my age were and are unaware of the war and its significance. I think there must be an inclusion of the 4 wars India fought after becoming a Sovereign Republic. This also raises a point of accountability and surfacing of the truth. The generations to come must know why Kargil happened. The cost that this soil paid, with the lives and blood of its brave sons, to recapture our own posts in our Kargil. Only when we talk more, will Pakistan’s violative actions be brought to limelight,” she says. Aparajita has also written a book on her father, titled Our Babloo - The hero of Drass. “It was a journey of me discovering my father’s journey like never before. The stories my family, his friends and senior officers told show his growth and personality as a whole. His journey started ordinary but he ascended to heaven in glory. I believe he knew how to life his life to the fullest - every moment. He shows how nobody is born a hero and how it is simply one’s decisions and determination that define them.” Maj Acharya’s letters to his family are well remembered, and even available online. Aparajita says that the best thing in her book are indeed those letters. “ I love how he painted a vivid picture and captured one’s imagination with his choice of words. His letters reflected his concern for family, sense of humour, a brief yet witty reflection of his situation and his ability to see the beauty and small moments of joy around him - no matter what. His letters over the years right from his early days as an officer to his last letter show how he has grown as a person.”A few years ago, Aparajita visited the site where her father sacrificed his life. “The whole place feels powerful, the energies and spirit of the Indian Army echoing those mountains. I was overwhelmed and filled with pride. I left a message for my father somewhere in the range because I felt him holding my hand, giving me strength throughout,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-diwas-kargil-is-more-than-a-place-and-war-for-me-says-battle-hero-s-daughter-born-three-months-after-sacrifice-101627230931219.html
25-07-2021||India||28% Indians plan to travel during Aug-Sept amid fear of Covid third wave: Report||Amid the possible threat of a third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as many as 28 per cent Indians are planning to travel during August to September, a new survey has projected.Online platform LocalCircles conducted a survey in order to gauge the risk of a probable third wave of Covid-19, and also to understand people’s travel plans in the upcoming months. More than 18,000 responses from citizens living in 311 districts, with 68 per cent being men and the rest being women, were recorded.LocalCircles stated that while 28 per cent are planning to travel between August and September, five per cent have already made their bookings for accommodation. Meanwhile, as many as 9,146 people (63 per cent) said that they don’t have any plan to travel during these months. “Nine per cent said they’re undecided,” the platform said in a statement.“The government must continue to create awareness among people about limiting non-essential travel till the time the risk of a third Covid-19 wave greatly reduces,” the statement added.LocalCircles also said that it will submit the survey findings to both central and state governments in order for them to use the same as an input in formulating policies to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 third wave.Notably, a report by the State Bank of India (SBI) released earlier this month indicated that the third wave of coronavirus may hit the country from August, reaching its peak in September. “Going by the current data, India can experience daily Covid-19 cases around 10,000 somewhere around the second week of July. However, the cases can start rising by the second fortnight of August,” the report titled “Covid-19: the race to finishing line” and prepared by SBI Research, stated.India recorded 39,742 new cases on Sunday, up from Saturday’s 39,097 – thereby taking the country’s cumulative tally of the infection rates to 31,371,901, according to data shared by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).Why do citizens want to travel amid a possible third wave?The LocalCircles survey also aimed to understand the reason why people travelled during the second wave of Covid-19 in order to analyse their travel plans in the forthcoming months. It found that many faced teething issues to cancel their plan due to the travel agent or the airline not refunding anything while some entirely lost their ticket amount. Some citizens were unable to retrieve a partial amount, and others were told to re-book the ticket for a later date, the survey showed.What kinds of travels do citizens plan?The LocalCircles survey found that 13 per cent of people want to enjoy a “holiday destination”, while 39 per cent said that they would like to “visit family and friends.” A total of 22 per cent citizens said that they have “other travel” plans.The report further stated that on an aggregate basis, of citizens with plans to travel during August to September, 54 per cent will be visiting friends and family and 26 per cent will be travelling to “holiday destinations”. Another 32 per cent citizens will be undertaking other kinds of travels, the statement noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-indians-plan-to-travel-during-aug-sept-amid-fear-of-covid-third-wave-report-101627229589624.html
25-07-2021||India||‘Senior citizens have right to property; son, daughter-in-law are licensees’: Calcutta HC||The Calcutta high court on Friday upheld the right of a senior citizen from Taherpur in Bengal’s Nadia district to reside in his house and said his son and daughter can be evicted as they are “at best licensees” living in the property. The right of a senior citizen to exclusively reside in his own house must be viewed from the prism of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the court said. The order was passed on July 23 by Justice Rajasekhar Mantha after he virtually heard lawyers representing petitioner Ramapada Basak and the state. “A nation that cannot take care of its aged, old and infirm citizens cannot be regarded as having achieved complete civilization,” the judge said. Acting on an order the court passed on July 12, the Taherpur police had escorted the petitioner’s son and daughter-in-law out of the property. The petitioner moved the court seeking their eviction. “It is now well settled that the children and their spouses living in the senior citizen’s house are at best “licensees”. Such licence comes to an end once the senior citizens are not comfortable with their children and their families,” Justice Mantha said in his order which referred to orders earlier passed by the Delhi High Court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court in similar cases. “Two issues would come up for consideration. The first of which is the availability of an alternative remedy under the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents Senior Citizens Act, 2007. The other is a right of a daughter-in-law of residence to be provided by either the husband or the father-in-law, if directed by a competent court under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005,” said the order. Referring to an order from the Supreme Court, the high court order said, “In the instant case, it is seen that no right of residence has been sought under any statute by the daughter-in-law. Hence, this court is of the view that there is no impediment in allowing exclusive residentiary rights to the senior citizens and to direct eviction of the son and daughter-in-law.”“However, the right of a senior citizen to exclusively reside in his own house must be viewed from the prism of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. To compel a senior citizen to approach either a civil court (the jurisdiction of which is any way barred under Section 27 of the 2007 Act) or take recourse to a special Statute like the 2007 Act would in most cases be extremely erroneous and painful for a person in the sunset days of life,” said the order passed by Justice Mantha. “This court is therefore of the view that the principle of an alternative remedy cannot be strictly applied to senior citizens and a writ court must come to the aid of a senior citizen in a given case,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-citizens-have-right-to-property-son-daughter-in-law-are-licensees-calcutta-hc-101627227567304.html

25-07-2021||India||Vijay Diwas Special: Major Deep Singh Sengar who defied death twice recalls fighting the Kargil war||Major Deep Singh Sengar (retd) had once said, “For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to join the armed forces, wear the uniform, defeat the bad guys, and live happily ever after.” A war veteran and recipient of a Gallantry Award, having fought at the Kargil and defied death twice, he quit the armed forces in 2001 after an injury in combat put him out of action. But that wasn’t the end of the road for him, as he didn’t lose hope and started his corporate career and reached new heights. On Kargil Vijay Diwas, Major Singh recalls his days on the battle ground, fighting the war, and how life gave him a second chance.A Kargil war veteran, a Kargil hero — what’s the essence of these words and phrases when people address you with these?Uncomfortable! The ‘hero’ part makes me uncomfortable. I’m a lucky one, but there are thousands of gallant soldiers who’re not with us today. Everyone who contributed to that war effort is a hero and it’ll be great to celebrate them. Having said that, reference of Kargil brings about a sense of pride for every Indian. For me personally, it brings back memories of victory as also of loss of friends and colleagues who made the supreme sacrifice. I’m fortunate to have been able to contribute at that juncture.The pain and suffering that the Kargil War left behind continues to be a part of many people’s lives. What’s about those two months that still sends shivers down your spine?Let me narrate an incident. That time we didn’t have cellphones. Some of our teams got satellite phones. In one sensitive case, there was a call home and here is how part of the conversation went with the parents.Mom: (crying) We see an officer on TV one day and next day we hear about his martyrdom. We’re worried for you son.Dad: Son, don’t worry about us. We’re fine. Don’t come back till you teach a lesson to those buggers. Give them a bloody nose.Thinking about all the mothers and fathers who worried then and worry today about safety of their children who have chosen this noble profession of arms, sends shivers down my spine. Even the parents who stood strong and still carry the burden for all the sons who never came back.Any vivid memory from the war that you’d never forget or any words that stayed with you?I spoke about one of our soldier (let’s call him Bravo) in one of my TED talks. We were on a tough mission where he was critical to the success. It was one of those mission where all of us had left letters for the family in case we didn’t come back alive. But just a couple of days before the attack, I got news about something very personal for this soldier and I asked him to go back. Despite knowledge of the seriousness of the personal issue, Bravo didn’t want to go back and said something on the lines of, how will he be able to face his child if he leaves the team just before the final attack.We had to literally force him to be sent back to attend to his family requirement. The izzat of the regiment and love for own team makes these amazing soldiers perform extraordinary valour... routinely. Such selfless acts and bravery of team members has stayed with me and always motivates me.Today when people celebrate Kargil Vijay Diwas, as a retired armed force officer, what do you think is its relevance, especially for the younger generation?I look at Kargil Diwas celebration as an opportunity to honour the men who made the supreme sacrifice, those who were fortunate to come back to their families, those who directly and indirectly supported the ones in uniform and most importantly the army behind the army — the families who had their sons and daughters fighting for the nation. At the same time, this occasion reminds us of vast porous borders of India, which makes the country vulnerable to infiltration. This behooves huge responsibility on all its citizens to be vigilant. It’s not only the defence forces but every citizen, who needs to be vigilant to avoid external or internal threats. Celebrations like Kargil Diwas are also a reminder of this huge responsibility of all the citizens. Just hope that these lessons of Kargil are integrated into school curriculum some day.You’ve defied death not once but twice. First in 1998 and then in September 1999, two months after the Kargil war was over. Looking back, do those incidents break you and make you feel weak inside, or do you derive strength from them even today?I was fortunate to serve the nation as a soldier. Being part of Special Forces, we were constantly in operational areas. While the first time I had critical injuries, I was able to recover and join my team within three months. This gave me immense confidence and self-belief.[In 1999], after our operations in Kargil, we immediately moved to Srinagar and were inducted into the counter insurgency operations. We conducted series of operations and in one such operation, I got injured the second time. And this injury forced me to be in hospital for almost a year and the medical prognosis was that I’d never walk again. It was life changing. From my childhood, I had never thought of anything other than the armed forces. For the first time in life I was forced to think of things outside of the Armed Forces. Having overcome that phase, today I derive lot of strength from that period of my life.You’ve been an inspiration for many out there — not just those in the army — that giving up is not an option. In life, there’s always a choice and a second chance. After Kargil War and this near-fatal injury, how did life change and what exactly did you do?I’ve been fortunate to get support from family, friends and colleagues whenever life threw a challenge at me and whenever there was need for support. Fact is that, my life changed completely after the second injury. After I was told that I’d never walk again, I had to rethink my whole life. I was in late twenties, engaged and had no life skills to survive outside the Armed Forces. Had my own moments of despair and hopelessness. I underwent multiple surgeries. Got great set of doctors who reconstructed the hip joint even as I plunged myself, into preparing for my career transition. I kept my focus on my studies, which also helped keep my mind off the pain. I put in all energy to clear CAT, The Common Admission Test, which is the prerequisite to join the best B Schools of the country. Had to relearn my math from Grade six to grade 12. Kept preparing from the hospital bed where I lay for almost a year. Got help from everyone around; other patients, nursing staff, even the eight grader son of my physiotherapist. It wasn’t an easy journey but a hugely satisfying one. Getting to IIM Ahmedabad was one part, the more important part was how the shift of focus to test preparation changed the whole perspective. After every surgery, I used to be thinking of the next chapter to be completed rather than thinking about the aches and pains. It personally helped me in the recovery process. While at the hospital, I started rigorous physiotherapy and yoga, which I continue to date. I had appeared for CAT while on a wheelchair. By the time I joined my MBA class, I was already on two crutches and moved to one crutch thereafter.We saw your journey through the series Jeet Ki Zidd that released earlier this year. How well do you think it represented your life on screen?As starters, both my biceps put together probably are less than biceps of Amit Sadh (actor who portrayed Major Deep Singh Sengar onscreen). And I am yet to meet a Col Chaudhary (smiles). To be fair, I’ll give credit to the whole Jeet ki Zid team for all their efforts, which spanned more than five years. Show has been made well and the portrayal of different characters is as real as it can be, for a piece of art. Kudos to perseverance of Boney Kapoor, Akash Chawla for not relenting when I initially refused, and to Amit Sadh for all the hard work. Not only did the team spend time in the overall production of the series, but also spent considerable amount of time interviewing those related to different incidents to recreate the scenes. Each character played their part well. Of course the show has taken artistic liberties. Some nebulous concepts and experiences are difficult to portray. Some level of exaggeration is there for the audience to be able to relate to the actual situation in a short span of time. I grew up listening to the stories of my Mama who was martyred in 1965 war — Lt Shashindra Singh Vrc. The show modified it to bring it closer. Similarly experiences like PTSD and concepts as abstract as like motivation, leadership under stress etc, are portrayed in an artistic manner. These concepts are been given a physical form. And that becomes Col Chaudhary; my alter ego which is egging me to rise after every fall, to stretch and to continue on to the path of victory — the Zid. So, the show is real in portraying the essence. It’s just that messengers are different in some cases.Follow the author on Twitter/@monikarawal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-diwas-special-major-deep-singh-sengar-who-defied-death-twice-recalls-fighting-the-kargil-war-101627226310112.html

NK Kalia, the father of Kargil martyr Captain Saurabh Kalia, paid his respects to the many martyrs like his son and insisted that the government didn’t punish the Pakistani army adequately for the brutal torture they inflicted on Indian soldiers.“I bow my head in reverence to martyrs who gave their lives for the nation. The government's steps weren't sufficient for Pakistan Army's brutal torture. India should raise this issue on an international level,” Kalia told ANI.Captain Saurabh Kalia of the 4 Jat Regiment was just 22 years old when he and five others were captured on May 15, 1999, by the Pakistani army on a reconnaissance off Bajrang Post in the Kaksar sector of Jammu and Kashmir, where they had gone to investigate reports of incursion. Despite being prisoners of war they were subjected to torture by the Pakistani army contrary to all international conventions on war.Kalia, a retired scientist who worked with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), received his son’s mutilated body on June 10 and vowed to fight against war crimes “Eyes punctured, eardrums pierced, vital organs chopped off and body bearing burn marks. I had never heard or seen such brutality,” he had told Hindustan Times.“The day he returned home wrapped in the tricolour, I vowed to fight for justice against war crimes. Whether we achieve success or not, this war will end with our death,” said Kalia.Kalia, now well in his 70s, continued to fight for his cause and moved the Supreme Court in 2012, seeking direction to the Centre to take up his son’s case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Centre told the court in 2015 that since this was a bilateral issue between two countries, Pakistan’s consent was needed. The matter is now pending and has not been listed for hearing yet.He continues his fight for justice even today.“Successive governments have failed to do what should have been done back in 1999. Still we are thankful for what they have done for our cause and do not regret what they [haven’t done],” he said on Kargil Vijay Diwas in 2019.“My fight is not only for Saurabh or the five soldiers but for the respect and honour of the Indian Armed Forces,” he added.GL Batra, the father of late Captain Vikram Batra, told news agency ANI that the country should focus on “troublemaking neighbours” and be ready to sacrifice for the nation. “Government has fulfilled all commitments made during (Kargil) war. The Kargil war was one of the toughest wars in the world. We should be aware of trouble-making neighbours and be ready to make sacrifices for the nation,” ANI said quoting Batra.Captain Batra was just 24 when he was martyred fighting the Kargil war. He was given the highest wartime gallantry award Param Vir Chakra posthumously, his father received the honour for his deceased son. He was the driving force in Operation Vijay and the capture of the crucial peak - Point 4875, one of his most difficult feats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bow-in-reverence-fathers-pay-tribute-to-their-martyred-sons-a-day-before-kargil-vijay-diwas-101627224180704.html

Virendra Singh told news agency ANI that the local community does want development in the region, but not at the cost of harming forests.“The authorities are saying that just 2,900 trees would be cut for the project. [However], since the small plantation is not considered, I fear that the actual number will be over 20,000,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.The Public Works Department (PWD) has proposed to build a road stretching 8-kilometre from Taroud to Daihan in the Balod district of Chhattisgarh. Singh has also requested the villages to come forward and help him in saving the forest as it is very essential to preserve the environment, ANI reported him saying.#WATCH | An environment activist pastes photos of Gods on trees to save them from felling for a proposed road project in Balod, Chhattisgarh"The project will lead to felling of 2,900 trees. We want development, but don't want forests to be harmed," said Virendra Singh yesterday pic.twitter.com/b2kcMIse7J“We have not received rainfall yet,” Singh said, adding that while several parts of the country are receiving “incessant rains”, Balod isn’t even getting its “due share.”The activist further stated that they first began the Chipko movement, and followed it up by putting up poster banners at street intersections. Later, they tied Rakshasutra around the trees, and have now resorted to pasting photos of Gods to save them from being cut.“Both global warming and pollution are causes of deforestation. We have to save the trees to save the planet,” Singh told ANI.Last month on World Environment Day, a few environmental activists and citizens in Nagpur staged a silent protest in Nagpur against the plan to chop off 4,930 trees in Ajini area. The trees are proposed to be cut for the Inter Model Station (IMDS) – a collaborative venture between Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), according to a PTI report.The felling order was issued by the garden department of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in May in the form of a newspaper notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-pastes-photos-of-lord-shiva-on-trees-to-save-them-from-being-axed-101627223298375.html
25-07-2021||India||'I used the illegitimate children jibe because...': Salman Khurshid explains||Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid said his illegitimate children jibe about Uttar Pradesh's draft population control bill was aimed at "grabbing eyeballs".Khurshid was speaking to Hindustan Times' Kumkum Chadha on 'The Interview' where the veteran politician talked about the snooping of individuals through the Pegasus software, the future of the Congress party, the Uttar Pradesh population control bill and other issues.On the recent reshuffle of the Union Cabinet, Khurshid said that ministers were dropped like "hot potato" ahead of the cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Though he agreed that cabinet reshuffle is the prerogative of the Prime Minister, Khurshid said the move leaves a lot of questions.Here are the excerpts from the interview:'Snooping scandal just tip of the iceberg'Salman Khurshid called the snooping scandal involving the Pegasus software a very serious matter. "I think there is a very sinister element in this kind of snooping. And we probably have heard just the tip of the iceberg," said Khurshid.The government has been a target of the opposition over alleged snooping of some of the politicians and business people through the Pegasus software.On sudden exit of ministers from the Union Cabinet"Khurshid said that the exit of certain ministers from the cabinet leaves a lot of questions. "They were the frontline ministers for the government, performing no worse or better than anyone else in the Cabinet. They would have been surprised that they were being dropped," the Congress leader said."And it wasn't like they were being moved to do party work or they were being asked to do something more important. But they just dropped like a hot potato," said the veteran politician, adding, "You feel a little sense of empathy of what one must go through when this kind of thing happens."Will he empathise with Union Minister Amit Shah if he is shown the door?Khurshid said that people can feel bad for anyone. "But I think in terms of political analysis, there is a great deal of disquiet about his style of politics.""But Amit Shah has made it. He obviously had support both from the top and from the bottom, in the sense that he wasn't just picked up from nowhere. And therefore, we have to acknowledge that he's not a person without roots," added Khurshid.Watch the full interview below:'No Dhritrashta syndrome in the Congress'He also denied that the party is suffering from the 'Dhritrashtra syndrome' - a reference to members of only Gandhi family acquiring the top post: "There is nothing written in stone that says that there cannot be a Congress leader other than the Gandhis. The Gandhis have also never proclaimed that. But you have to accept the ground reality - that thousands of people feel a special attachment to the Gandhis," he added while advocating a policy of consensus rather than organisational elections which he said are “divisive”.He also questioned the intent of Group of 23 leaders of the party who expressed unhappiness with the functioning of the party and sought its rejig. "Why didn't they raise these questions when they were climbing up the ladder? He added that you don’t kick the ladder after reaching the top.'UP population bill anti-humanitarian, against the poor'Short of directly saying that the recent draft population control bill by Uttar Pradesh government is “anti-Muslim”, Khurshid said that the draft Bill is “anti humanitarian”. Khurshid said he isn't calling the bill communal "unless the BJP thinks it is", but anti-poor”. He said that the measure will deprive many less privileged communities of government benefits. "Atom bomb was progressive, but ultimately led to incidents like Hiroshima and Nagasaki."When asked about his 'illegitimate children' jibe, the Congress leader said that since he is asked about these issues, he decided to give an answer which is provocative: “You cannot be boring” he said.On comment asking the Congress to think big 'like the BJP'"I never dream of saying 'Let's be like the BJP'. Ideologically, we must not, we cannot. Even if we can't get into power for 100 years, we must not and will not be a BJP," said Khurshid. But he said that there are some things about the BJP "or any political party for that matter" which we should take inspiration from. "If BJP goes to a barren land and says here is where my next harvest will be, why is it that we can't say something similar where we have a lot more going for us than just simple, barren land?" said Khurshid. He further said that if the BJP can have audacity of ambition, we can at least have audacity of hope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-used-the-illegitimate-children-jibe-because-salman-khurshid-explains-101627221629704.html

Dismissing speculations of any trouble in Karnataka, the party chief said this is what the media thinks. "It is your thinking, we do not think this way," Nadda said as he was asked about the Karnataka crisis during his Goa visit on Sunday.Specifically commenting on Yediyurappa, Nadda said, "He has done good work. He is running Karnataka well. Yediyurappa is handling things on his own."Speculations about a possible change of guard in Karnataka were rife as Karnataka BJP has been facing a factional feud. Yediyurappa has been accused of corruption, of pushing for his younger son Vijayendra, the state vice president of the party.Who may replace Lingayat strongman Yediyurappa in Karnataka? List of frontrunnersLast week, Yediyurappa visited New Delhi and met Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, and Rajnath Singh, strengthening the speculation. After returning from New Delhi, Yediyurappa himself hinted at his exit and said he will work according to the instruction of the national leadership of the party which, as he said, he was supposed to receive on July 25, a day ahead of the two-year completion of the BJP government in Karnataka.On Sunday too, Yediyurappa reiterated that he was waiting for an instruction from Delhi. "By evening once it comes, you will also get to know about it. Once it comes I will take an appropriate decision," he said."I got most of the positions in the party, which no one else might have got in Karnataka, for which I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and party president J P Nadda," he said. Earlier, the four-time chief minister of Karnataka said he shares a close relationship with the BJP national leadership and that's why he was given the duty two years ago, despite his age.Meanwhile, Veerashaiva-Lingayat seers have thrown their weight behind Yediyurappa and said that Yediyurappa should not be removed from the CM's post. The seers organised a conclave at the Palace Grounds in Bengaluru and passed a resolution in favour of Yediyurappa. "It is not proper to remove Yediyurappa. We have congregated here to boost the morale of the chief minister. We are neither in favour or opposed to anyone. Our sole objective is to see that the Chief Minister, who is doing good work, should be allowed to continue," Dingaleshwar Swami said, as reported by PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-is-running-karnataka-well-nadda-ahead-of-bsy-s-speculated-exit-101627220802242.html
25-07-2021||India||Ramappa Temple: How a site is selected for World Heritage List||The extended 44th session of UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee is currently underway in China’s Fuzhou. The session began on July 16 and will conclude on July 31. On Sunday, Telangana’s iconic Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple was inscribed by the committee as a World Heritage site, thus becoming the latest site in India to be included on the World Heritage List, joining 38 other locations from the country already on the list.Excellent! Congratulations to everyone, specially the people of Telangana. The iconic Ramappa Temple showcases the outstanding craftsmanship of great Kakatiya dynasty. I would urge you all to visit this majestic Temple complex and get a first-hand experience of it’s grandness. https://t.co/muNhX49l9J pic.twitter.com/XMrAWJJao2Here’s the procedure for a property to be inscribed as a World Heritage site:(1.) Submitting an Inventory: Also known as a “tentative list,” an inventory is an initial list of properties, located within a country’s boundaries, that a state party can submit for inclusion as a World Heritage site. This list can be updated from time to time and is important because the World Heritage Committee can consider for inscription only those properties that are mentioned on this list.A “state party” is a country which has ratified the World Heritage Convention. India ratified the convention on November 14, 1977. As of October 23, 2020, a total of 194 countries have adhered to the World Heritage Convention.(2.) Presenting the Nomination File: The World Heritage Centre assists a state party in preparing this file, which needs to have the necessary documentation, including maps. The file is then submitted to the World Heritage Centre for review, after which the document is sent to the advisory bodies for evaluation.(3.) The Advisory Bodies: The World Heritage Convention mandates two advisory bodies to independently evaluate a nominated property. These are the International Council on Monuments and Sites, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A third such body is the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property.(4.) The World Heritage Committee: After nomination and evaluation, the final decision to inscribe a site as a World Heritage site is taken by the World Heritage Committee. The committee meets once every year to decide which properties to include on the list. It can also request state parties for further information on a site.(5.) Eligibility criteria: Any nominated site should meet at least one out of ten selection norms. These are updated regularly to reflect the very concept of World Heritage.Overall, more than 1100 properties from various countries are on the World Heritage List. The Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Qutub Minar, Ajanta Caves, Ellora Caves, Fatehpur Sikri etc. are among the monuments from India which feature on this list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-heritage-list-how-a-monument-is-inscribed-as-world-heritage-site-101627218467403.html

25-07-2021||India||Kargil Vijay Diwas: It took 13 days to retrieve my father’s body, says Kargil hero’s daughter born 4 months after the war||Until she was ten years old , Megha Yadav had no clue she is a war hero’s daughter. Whenever she asked her mother about her father, she was told he worked in another city. “One day, I just pestered her to tell me because I wanted to know why he never called or visited. It was then that she told me that my father, Lance Naik Rajendra Yadav, SM (P), had sacrificed his life in the Kargil war. I was obviously overcome with emotion, but I also felt very proud,” says Megha, who was born exactly six months after her father’s death. “That day my mother shared a lot about papa. She said that in their last few conversations, he spoke about securing his children’s future. He even said he wanted his kids to join the army,” she says. So, did she aspire to join the forces? “I wanted to, was an NCC cadet too, but mummy refused. I even said ‘mummy, main kaunsa border pe jaaungi’, but she said no. Woh darr gayi,” laughs Megha, who is pursuing her graduation in Indore and preparing for civil services too. Her connect with the army remains through her father’s colleagues who are still in touch with the family. “All the uncles tell me that my father was a very friendly person. Woh jaha jaate the usi mahaul mein dhal jaate the. One of them told me that it had taken them 13 days to bring back my father’s body because the firing was so bad. It hurts, but I feel proud,” says Megha.On Kargil Vijay Diwas too, she wakes up feeling a sense of pride every year. “So many soldiers gave up their life in the war. And I feel nothing but pride that my father was among them. Everywhere I go, people know I am a war hero’s daughter,” she says. But of course, there are times she wished things were different. “In school, when I would see fathers coming to pick up their kids or when families went shopping and mothers refused to buy their kids something and fathers bought it for them... sometimes I missed those moments. But overall,my mother never let me feel anything was missing,” she says. One day, Megha hopes to read the letters her father wrote to his family during service. “Mummy said thodi badi ho ja phir dikhaungi. I’m waiting,” she smiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kargil-vijay-diwas-it-took-13-days-to-retrieve-my-father-s-body-says-22-year-old-born-6-months-after-the-war-101627216768635.html
25-07-2021||India||Ahead of US secretary of state Blinken’s visit, India says ready to engage on human rights||India has signalled that it is open to engaging on human rights and democracy with those who recognise the value of diversity against the backdrop of reports that US secretary of state Antony Blinken will raise these issues during his visit to New Delhi this week.Ahead of Blinken’s visit, US acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asian affairs Dean Thompson said last week that both human rights and democracy would be raised during the secretary of state’s engagements in India.“With respect to the human rights and democracy question, yes, you’re right; I will tell you that we will raise it, and we will continue that conversation because we firmly believe that we have more values in common on those fronts than we don’t,” Thompson said in response to a question during a news briefing on July 23.“And we believe India is going to be a really important part of continuing those conversations and building strong efforts on those fronts in partnership as we go forward,” he added.People familiar with planning for Blinken’s visit said on condition of anonymity on Sunday that India, as a long-standing pluralistic society, is open to engaging those who recognise the value of diversity.“Issues such as human rights and democracy are universal and extend beyond a particular national or cultural perspective. India is proud of its achievements in both domains and is always glad to share experiences,” one of the people cited above said.The Indian side will also raise global issues such as political and cultural rebalancing, especially New Delhi’s support for a multi-polar, democratic and diverse world order. The Indian side expects international conversations on these issues to reflect this evolution. “We believe in equity and fairness, whether in development, climate change or global decision-making,” the person cited above said. Discussions during Blinken’s visit will also cover working together at the UN, especially with India holding the presidency of the Security Council in August.Despite the growing convergence between India and the US on security and strategic issues as well as the fight against Covid-19, human rights and freedom of expression have emerged as potential irritants between the two sides. Following the scrapping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, the US had called for the easing of restrictions on the region.In February, during his first phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after assuming office, US President Joe Biden had “underscored his desire to defend democratic institutions and norms around the world and noted that a shared commitment to democratic values is the bedrock for the US-India relationship”.Also in February, the US had urged the Indian government to resume talks with protesting farmers who have gathered on the outskirts of New Delhi since late 2020. The American side has in the recent past also expressed concerns over India’s amended citizenship law. The Indian side has usually rejected such criticism by foreign governments, including the US, and said the country’s institutions and Constitution provide adequate safeguards for human rights....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-us-secretary-of-state-blinken-s-visit-india-says-ready-to-engage-on-human-rights-101627214065949.html

25-07-2021||India||Bill allowing change of power connections like telecom in queue in Parliament||The Union cabinet is expected to take up for approval the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the ongoing Monsoon Session of Parliament in the next few days, news agency PTI reported. The Bill, once passed, will allow consumers to choose from multiple service providers and change one as per their convenience on the lines of mobile connections, government officials familiar with the development told the news agency.The Centre has listed this bill as one of the new 17 bills that they plan to introduce during the Monsoon session, scheduled to end on August 13.The proposed amendments in the electricity Act include the de-licensing of the power distribution business, and introduction of competition, appointment of a member from legal background in every commission, strengthening of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), and penalty for non-compliance of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO), the bulletin mentioned, according to the PTI report.The RPO is a tool using which the power distribution utilities or distribution companies are obligated to buy a certain percentage of electricity from renewable energy sources – as a percentage of the total consumption of electricity.Last month, power and renewable energy minister RK Singh said that the de-licensing of power distribution was proposed “just like the generation.”“The cabinet note on the bill was circulated and all concerned ministries have approved it. But the law ministry has one or two queries,” he added.The PTI report suggests that the de-licensing of power distribution is aimed at cutting down entry barriers for private players for introducing competition in the industry, thereby permitting consumers to choose from several service providers. Furthermore, the bill prescribes the electricity consumers’ rights and duties too.The proposal to seek the cabinet nod for the bill was circulated in January this year, and the draft law was to be pushed for passage in the Budget session.Notably, Singh has issued the bill that constitutes a new set of rules, in December 2020. At the time, he had said that if these rules are not followed, there would be a “penalty” for discoms. “Now the consumer is not powerless,” he had told reporters in a virtual briefing.Singh had also said that the rule “emanate from the conviction that the power systems exist to serve the consumers,” and that the latter have the rights to receive reliable and quality electricity, PTI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-allowing-change-of-power-connections-like-telecom-in-queue-in-parliament-101627210953778.html

25-07-2021||India||Tamil Nadu reservoirs swell as heavy rainfall lash Western Ghats||Overflowing rivers in southern Tamil Nadu’s Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts swelled dams and reservoirs after heavy rainfall lashed mountainous catchment areas of Western Ghats.On Saturday, the areas surrounding the Servalaru dam received 46 millimetres of rainfall while Papanasam, Manimuthar and Kodimudiyaru dams received 43mm, 20.6mm and 15mm rainfall, respectively. Other dams such as Kalakkadu and Cheranmadevi got 2.6mm and 3.2mm rainfall, according to a report published in Hindu Tamil on Sunday.With torrential rainfall in catchment areas, the Papanasam dam, which was flowing at 110.2 feet, has reportedly been receiving 3,047 cubic feet of water every second while it is discharging 1,264 cubic feet of water per second. Manimutharu dam is receiving 871 cubic feet of water per second and discharging 150 cubic feet per second.Adavinayinar dam also recorded 52mm of rainfall till Saturday morning while Karuppanadhi dam and Gundarau dam areas received 25mm of rainfall each. Kadana Nathi and Ramanadhi dams recorded 15mm and 10mm rainfall, respectively.Tenkasi district bordering the Western Ghats recorded incessant rainfall this year after the southwest monsoon set in.While the hilly terrain witnessed heavy showers so far, the other areas of the district experienced mild showers turning the locality pleasant. Other places in the district such as Sengottai (22mm), Aykudi (18mm), Tenkasi (13.40mm), Sankarankovil (3mm) and Sivagiri and (2.2mm) recorded heavy to moderate rainfall.The heavy rainfall contributed to increased water levels at the dams in the Tenkasi district. At Kadana Nathi, it increased by two-and-half feet to touch 71.50 feet while Ramanadhi and Karuppa Nadhi dams saw their water level rise by 2.75 and 5.5 feet in a span of 24 hours.

Soon after, the Bengal ruling returned the favour by replying to the tweet with the party’s successful campaign tag “Khela hobe (game on)”.#KhelaHobe ⚽️ https://t.co/yi8bs0Q3XVThe exchange of tweets came a day ahead of the Bengal chief minister’s visit to the national capital wherein she is scheduled to meet a couple of opposition leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, and is likely to strategise a plan for the 2024 Lok Sabha election. "Khela hobe" has been a winning slogan for the Trinamool Congress during the bitterly fought Assembly election and even BJP leaders used the phrase to hit back at Banerjee and her party.Banerjee, who is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind, has been keen on giving shape to a united opposition to take on the BJP. She even exhorted the opposition to join hands against the BJP during her speech on Martyrs’ Day (July 21). The talk of an anti-BJP front got revived after leaders of various parties and prominent individuals congregated at NCP chief Sharad Pawar's New Delhi residence last month. However, there was no tangible movement forward in that direction at the meeting hosted by Pawar and called by former union minister Yashwant Sinha, who is now in the TMC. Sinha, a former BJP stalwart, is a strident critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The speculation was further duelled after election strategist Prashant Kishore held a series of meetings with Pawar and the Gandhis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khela-hobe-congress-tmc-display-bonhomie-ahead-of-mamata-s-delhi-visit-101627209393600.html

A member of Parliament from the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) representing the Mahbubabad constituency, Kavitha Maloth was sentenced to six months of imprisonment by a special court and slapped with a fine of ₹10,000 in the cash-for-vote scam. Maloth and her associate Shaukat Ali, have been granted bail and the MP would next move the high court against the convicted.Police said a case was registered in Bhadradri-Kothagudem after a flying squad of the Election Commission caught Ali red-handed distributing cash ( ₹500 each) among residents and seeking votes in Maloth’s favour in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.According to a report in Times of India, during interrogation, Ali confessed to committing the crime at the behest of Maloth. While Ali has been named as the first accused, the MP is the second accused in the case.This is the third case the special sessions court, which was set up in March 2018 following a Supreme Court order for expeditious trial of lawmakers, has awarded jail terms to public representatives.

25-07-2021||India||Half of all Covid deaths in India took place in April-May, shows government data||Half of India’s Covid deaths since April 2020 took place in just two months, April and May 2021, according to latest government data, highlighting how deadly the two months were and the sort of impact it had across states.41% of total Covid deaths in April and May in India came from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi, the three states that recorded the highest deaths in this period. Close to 60% of total Covid deaths in 14 months in Delhi, Karnataka and Punjab happened in April and May, shows the data shared by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in reply to a Right To Information application by this reporter.The NCDC said that of the total 329,065 Covid deaths between April 2020 and May 2021, 166,632 took place in April and May 2021. As many as 120,770 people died in May and 45,882 in April, the two months with highest Covid deaths since April 2020.In June, 69,354 Covid deaths were recorded which includes reconciled deaths, which the authorities failed to mention in April and May data. Before April-May, the highest deaths reported for a month was in September 2020 with 33,035 deaths. September-October was considered the peak of the first Covid wave. And, after that the Covid deaths came down to 2,777 in February 2021.Experts said that indication of another Covid wave started emerging in March when the Covid deaths more than doubled nationally with a spike in deaths seen in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat. Covid cases in all these states were also rising at a rapid rate. This was also the time when political party leaders were aggressively campaigning for assembly elections in Assam, Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu and preparations were being made for super spreader Haridwar Maha Kumbh.Post assembly election results on May 2, Covid deaths in the poll states rose up five times, the RTI reply shows. Deaths went up from 921 in West Bengal in April to 4,162 in May, from 177 to 2019 in Assam, from 1,233 to 9,821 in Tamil Nadu and 653 to 3,382 in Kerala for the same period. “One reason for higher cases during this period could be more testing in May. The deaths indicate that state governments ignored the third wave signs and reacted late,” said Dr Shaheed Jamil, who had earlier headed the Central government’s advisory group on Covid genome sequencing.The NCDC is the health ministry’s nodal agency for maintaining all Covid-19 disease records under Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). However, non-Covid deaths are not reported to IDSP, the NCDC joint director Dr Vinay Kumar Garg said in the RTI response. And he added they don’t have data on the cause of deaths reported during the pandemic. The information shared by NCDC shows the impact of the second Covid wave in different states and indicates that the actual number of deaths may not have been reported in some high population states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, having large rural populations, where recording of deaths is not as structured as in cities. “Bihar and UP having such strange Covid figures despite telling signs of high spread are a mystery,” Jamil said.Uttar Pradesh, which reported 20,346 deaths between April 2020 and May 2021, recorded 8,108 deaths in May, 2021, and 3,438 in April, 2021. Its neighbour, Uttarakhand, which has one-tenth of UP’s population, as per Census population projection for 2021, reported 3,899 deaths in May, which is 48% of the total deaths in Uttar Pradesh for that month. Close to 1,100 Covid deaths that took place in April and May in Uttarakhand were reconciled with June Covid death data and not reflected in NCDC’s May Covid death data.Uttar Pradesh’s another neighbouring state, Haryana, whose population is one-eighth of UP’s, reported 4,103 deaths, according to the RTI reply. Bihar, which reported 2,624 deaths in May, added 3,951 deaths in the first week of June during the second Covid wave, taking the death toll to 6,575. These cases were added after Patna high court asked the state government to conduct an audit of all deaths in the state. “This includes deaths that took place in April and May,” said a senior Bihar health department official, wishing not to be quoted.Madhya Pradesh reported low death numbers- 2,500 and 2,020 deaths in May and July respectively. There were also news reports that five times more death certificates were issued in some districts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh during April and May compared to the official Covid casualty figures. Dr DS Negi, director general medical health Uttar Pradesh, said they followed the strategy to test, treat and trace suspected Covid patients, helping in quick isolation of positive cases and tracing of contacts. “This helped us to identify positive Covid cases and isolate them early; ...we could save many lives,” he said. If Covid deaths of all states are compared, Maharashtra reported highest Covid deaths (26,859) among Indian states in May followed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Covid deaths recorded in the month of May in these states were double the deaths in April, showing that the states failed to control the spread of the virus even a month after it started devastating families across India.Some states argued that their death counts were higher due to greater population density and HT found that to be true to some extent. The highest death rate for a million people during the entire Covid period and also during April-May was of Goa followed by Delhi, Puducherry, Maharashtra, Chandigarh and Uttarakhand, showed the analysis of the NCDC’s death data with 2021 Census population projection. “We are reporting all the deaths because our surveillance is stringent and our machinery is robust. Not just Covid, we are topping deaths due to Swine Flu. This is nothing to be proud of but shows that we report all deaths. This year we have reported around 80,000 deaths due to Covid-19,” said Maharashtra surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate.Delhi health minister Shri Satyendar Jain, said: “While we understand the gravity of the situation, it is also important to understand that the data presented by the Delhi government has been completely transparent at all points, even if it gave others the opportunity to take jibes at us.” Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said despite the spurt in Covid cases the state was able to save a lot of lives because of adequate health facilities.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha on July 20, said that health was a state subject and the Central government has provided all help to the state governments. “Due to concerted actions of Central and state governments, the isolation bed capacity and ICU bed capacity which was merely 10,180 and 2,168 before the first lockdown as on 23rd March 2020 could be increased to more than 1.821 million isolation beds and 121,671 ICU beds as on 16th July 2021,” he said.All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria said the devastation of the second Covid wave should prepare people for the third wave, if new variants emerge. “As of now, there are no signs to indicate that the third wave would be as lethal as the second one,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/half-of-all-covid-deaths-in-india-took-place-in-april-may-shows-government-data-101627204345380.html
25-07-2021||India||Who may replace Lingayat strongman Yediyurappa in Karnataka? List of frontrunners||Replacing four-time chief minister BS Yediyurappa amid the strong support from the Lingayat community will not be easy but as the 77-year-old chief minister has already dropped enough hints that he is on his way out, the guessing game has started. Though the politicians whose names are being speculated have dismissed any such possibility and attributed such speculations to mere political rumours.Here is the list of frontrunners:Murugesh NiraniThe mines and geology minister of the state cabinet, Murugesh Nirani, is said to be one of the top contenders for the CM post as, like Yediyurappa, he also represents the Lingayat community. He is also the chairman of Nirani Group which includes Nirani Sugars Ltd, Sai Priya Sugars Ltd, MRN Cane Power India Ltd., Nirani Cements Pvt. Ltd, and Bilagi Sugar Mill Ltd. The 56-year-old minister has recently said that there was no instruction for replacing Yediyurappa. "I never lobbied for any post in my life. I will shoulder the responsibility bestowed on me by the party. Our national leaders will choose the right person for the CM post after considering all the factors," he said.As BSY hints at exit, buzz over the next CM beginsUnion minister Pralhad JoshiUnion minister Pralhad Joshi is 58 years old and a veteran BJP politician who has been representing Dharwad in Parliament since 2004. "No one has spoken to me about it (succeeding Yediyurappa). It's only the media, which is discussing it. As no one has spoken to me, there is no need to react to it," Pralhad Joshi has said in reaction to speculations of becoming the next chief minister.Basavaraj S BommaiThe 61-year-old home minister of Karnataka is another probable on the list but Basavaraj S Bommai has refuted speculations and said nothing is official. "I don't want to answer any speculative question," the home minister said.C T RaviCT Ravi is the party's national general secretary and is a four-time MLA from the Chikmagalur constituency. Before becoming the national general secretary of the party, he was a minister in the state cabinet. He is 54 years old.B L SanthoshAnother national joint general secretary of the party BL Santosh's association with the BJP began in 1993 when he started as an RSS pracharak. In 2006, he moved to the BJP as Karnataka general secretary.Arvind BelladAnother Lingayat community leader, Arvind Bellad is a young face and he comes from a political family -- his father is Chandrakant Bellad. He is a two-time MLA from the Hubli-Dharwad West constituency.Jagadish ShettarJagdish Shettar, a minister of Yediyurappa's cabinet, served as the state's chief minister between 2012 and 2013. He too represents the Lingayat community.Apart from them, Karnataka Assembly Speaker Vishveshwar Hegde Kageri, Karnataka deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan are also in the race.Factors deciding Karnataka's next CMYediyurappa in his current term faced open rebellion from the party against the alleged intervention of his son BY Vijayendra in the administration. As Yediyurappa's age and health are also some factors possibly driving the change, the national leaderhsip may go for a young CM this time. Another crucial factor will be the community as the BJP enjoys the massive support of the Lingayat community in the state. On the other hand, the state has not seen a Brahmin CM since 1988, after Ramakrishna Hegde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-may-replace-lingayat-strongman-yediyurappa-list-of-frontrunners-101627203592010.html

25-07-2021||India||Afghanistan, terror sanctuaries in Pakistan on agenda for Blinken’s visit||The fallout of the drawdown of US troops on the security situation in Afghanistan and the need to pressure Pakistan on terror financing and sanctuaries for terrorists will be on the agenda for US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit to India this week, people familiar with planning for the visit said on condition of anonymity on Sunday. The two sides are expected to discuss ways to deepen defence collaboration, including exercises, defence transfers and technologies, as part of preparations for the fourth 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers to be held in the US later this year, the said. Blinken is the third senior member of the Biden administration to visit India after defense secretary Lloyd Austin in March and special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry in April. During his two-day visit, he will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on July 28. The situation in Afghanistan is expected to be one of the main topics on the agenda for Blinken’s discussions with his Indian interlocutors because of the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the country in the aftermath of an offensive by the Taliban to capture territory and crucial border crossings with Pakistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. India is concerned about the instability in Afghanistan spilling over into parts of the region and Pakistani terrorists from Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed currently fighting alongside the Taliban turning their attention towards Kashmir. “On the regional security situation, the implications of the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan over terror financing and terror havens will be part of the agenda,” one of the people cited above said. India attaches considerable importance to Blinken’s visit, which will be an opportunity to take forward the conversation with the US on bilateral and regional issues and tackling the Covid-19 crisis and other international developments. With regard to Covid-19, the people said discussions will cover containing the pandemic, supply of vaccine raw materials, and economic recovery efforts. “India will continue to push for ensuring open and consistent supply chains for materials and items needed for vaccine production, as the country ramps up production for both domestic vaccination and global supplies thereafter,” the person cited above said. The need for resilient supply chains for critical medicines and healthcare equipment is also likely to come up, the person said. The Indian side will also press for gradual resumption of international travel while maintaining health protocols, especially easing the mobility of students, professionals and business travellers, and allowing travel for family reunions and humanitarian issues. As part of the focus on the Indo-Pacific region, the two sides will discuss ways to deepen engagement under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, including the possibility of a meeting of foreign ministers of India, Australia, Japan and the US later this year. The two sides will also take forward the Quad vaccine partnership, which was launched at the first virtual summit of the group in March, to enable the supply of made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines to countries in the Indo-Pacific from early 2022, the people said. The two sides will exchange assessments about the Indo-Pacific region, with the focus on Covid-19-related assistance, economic slowdown and the security scenario. The latest developments in West Asia and Central Asia are also likely to be covered. This is Blinken’s first visit to India after assuming office and it reciprocates external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s trip to the US in May. The two ministers have also met in the UK on the margins of a G7 meeting and in Italy on the sidelines of a G20 meet. Other issues that are expected to be part of the discussions are augmenting trade and investment and tapping opportunities in healthcare, education, the digital domain, innovation and security. Climate change too will be a key area, especially the potential for green collaborations, climate finance and transfer of clean technologies to developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-terror-sanctuaries-in-pakistan-on-agenda-for-blinken-s-visit-101627201225310.html

Regarding appointment of an individual belonging to the Dalit community as his successor, the 78-year-old veteran Lingayat leader, also known as BSY, said he was not concerned about the same."By evening once it comes, you will also get to know about it, once it comes I will take an appropriate decision,” the chief minister, fighting months-long dissent within the party, said.Also read | 'Supreme leaders will decide': Pralhad Joshi on if he would replace YediyurappaTo a question on pontiffs holding a mega conclave in Bengaluru on Sunday, which is seen as an event to express solidarity with him, he said, "There is no need for pontiffs to hold any meet, I have confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national President J P Nadda."Indicating that Monday could be his last day in office, Yediyurappa had recently said that based on the instructions that the central leaders will give him on July 25, he will get on with "his work" from July 26, the day his government is scheduled to complete two years in office.On Saturday, Yediyurappa, who became the chief minister for the fourth time after toppling the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) government in July 2019, said he had faced a lot of challenges ever since coming to power, but was satisfied with the “honest efforts” made during his tenure to improve people’s lives. "From the day I took charge as the chief minister till now, I had to face several challenges like natural disasters that the state had never faced in the past and the coronavirus pandemic, which ravaged lives. Now, once again there is a flood-like situation," he said.After relinquishing the CM's chair, he will work for the party, Yediyurappa has said. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and BJP chief JP Nadda have a special love and faith towards me. You are aware that no position has been given to those who have crossed 75 years of age," he said.Meanwhile, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai said the next CM is yet to be officially announced and talks about him succeeding Yediyurappa are all speculation.Union minister Pralhad Joshi, whose name is also doing the rounds as the next CM, has said no one has spoken to him about this and he was not aware if Yediyurappa was putting in his papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waiting-for-high-command-orders-will-decide-soon-bs-yediyurappa-as-exit-talks-101627200196561.html

It’s an effort on [the] part of the ministry of culture to have a maximum number of Indians sing the national anthem together…I hope you connect yourselves with this novel initiative,” the Prime Minister said. He added that a website- Rashtragaan.in has been created for individuals to upload their own renditions of the national anthem on the website.Modi began the radio address with best wishes to the Indian contingent participating in the Tokyo Olympics and urged all the citizens to support the team through the Victory Punch Campaign.“You also share your victory punch along with your team and cheer for India,” he added.As the country gears up to celebrate Kargil Diwas on Monday, Modi said the Kargil war, when Indian forces recaptured crucial strategic heights and Indian territory that was surreptitiously captured by Pakistani forces, was a symbol of valour and discipline of the country’s armed forces.The Prime Minister also shared several examples of people following unique ideas for their livelihood. He talked about farmers cultivating apples and ‘Ber’ (Indian jujube) and a food stall-owner in Chandigarh who offers Chole Bhature for free to those who have got themselves vaccinated against Covid-19 on the same day.Among other issues, the Prime Minister also highlighted the importance of water conservation. Pointing out that he faced water scarcity during his childhood, Modi said, “We used to yearn for rainfall and therefore saving every single drop of water has been part of our customs.”Modi also said that a government study had found that Mann Ki Baat gets very good response from the youth and said it showed that the radio programme had positivity and sensitivity and it also served as a medium for the PM to understand the young generation.“A recent study by MyGov found that about 75% of those who send their message and suggestions to Mann Ki Baat are below 35 years. It means Mann Ki Baat is being guided by the views of the youth of India. Mann Ki Baat is a medium where there is positivity and sensitivity,” he saidReminding people of coronavirus, PM Modi asked people to follow all Covid-related protocols. “During festivals and gaiety, do remember that corona is not yet gone from amidst us.

25-07-2021||India||India found relics of Georgian queen 400 years after her murder. PM shares tale||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday shared how Indian researchers in 2005 uncovered the relics of a 16th-century Georgian queen, Ketevan the Martyr, from the Saint Augustine Church in Goa. "India handed over the holy relic or icon of Saint Queen Ketevan to the Government of Georgia and the people there," the Prime Minister said while addressing the nation through the Mann Ki Baat monthly radio programme.India sent the holy relics to Georgia in 2017 for a period of six months to celebrate the 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. On July 9 this year, the relics were permanently handed over to Georgia by external affairs minister S Jaishankar."The words that were said in praise of India in this ceremony are indeed very memorable," the Prime Minister said on Sunday, lauding the strong diplomatic ties between the two countries.Ketevan, the queen of Kakheti, a kingdom in eastern Georgia, was murdered at Shiraz in Iran in 1624, nearly 400 years ago now. Queen Ketevan earned the title of 'martyr' because it is believed she gave up her life defending the Christian faith and refused to convert to Islam, even after prolonged tortures by the Safavid suzerains. After her death, Ketevan was canonised as a saint by the Georgian Orthodox Church.A key icon for the Georgian people, Ketavan inspired a new-age holy grail search, where followers of the faith went on a "hunt" for the queen's holy relics across the world. Goa was one of the chief locations where Georgian delegations would often frequent, trying to interpret centuries-old Portuguese documents that provided clues to Ketevan's burial place.In a series of searches between 2004 to 2005, a group of Indian archaeologists, accompanied by a Portuguese architect, uncovered a number of relics and bone fragments that were confirmed to be of Georgian descent on a DNA test. Additional tests confirmed that the U1b bone came from a woman. So, in 2013, it was established that the bone found in two pieces in 2005 was consistent with being from a Georgian woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-found-relics-of-georgian-queen-400-years-after-her-murder-pm-shares-tale-101627197129307.html

25-07-2021||India||Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut wants to know who funded Pegasus ‘snooping’ project||Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha parliamentarian Sanjay Raut has called for a probe into funding of the suspected hacking of 300 phones of prominent Indian politicians, ministers, journalists and activists using Israeli spyware Pegasus and alleged that it could have cost at least $48 million in 2019 alone.“The Pegasus app was used to spy over 1,500 people including political workers, human rights activists, two Central ministers and 30 media personnel. According to a report, one licence used to spy on 50 phones costs $8 million per year. If 300 phones were spied on then it cost at least $48 million dollars in 2019. There could [have been] more spending in 2020 and 2021. From whose pocket [was] the money spent? Will there be an investigation on this whole issue?,” Sanjay Raut said in his weekly column Rokhthok, published in party mouthpiece Saamana.The Pegasus row erupted last Sunday night before the beginning of the current monsoon session of parliament after an international investigative consortium reported that India was among countries that used Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software to potentially target politicians, journalists and activists.The first report alleged that 38 Indian journalists, including three current Hindustan Times staffers and one from sister publication Mint, were among 180 journalists potentially targeted worldwide. Subsequent reports said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and two sitting Union ministers including Ashwini Vaishnaw were on the list of potential targets. A highly invasive malware, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy.However, the presence of a number on the list of potential targets does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. In the absence of digital forensics of specific devices, it is not possible to conclusively establish that the phones linked to these numbers were hacked. The opposition has targeted the government in the parliament over snooping allegations and demanded a probe to establish if the government was complicit in the project. The government, however, has denied the allegations as figment of imagination.In his column a week after the snooping scandal first broke, Raut drew a parallel between the alleged use of the malware to spy on citizens and political opponents and the Hiroshima atomic bombing. “This incident is not very different from the Hiroshima atomic bombing. There people had died while here the casualty is the independence,” said Raut.Carrying on with the analogy, Raut claimed that “mobile phones have now become virtual bombs” planted to keep a tab on the movement of its opponents.“The list includes over 100 journalists who have been writing against the government, one of them was from Jharkhand who exposed a tribal’s fake encounter to light. Now Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravi Shankar Prasad has asked why India alone was being targeted when more than 45 countries had Pegasus links. In a way, the BJP leader has admitted use of Pegasus in India,” Raut’s column further reads.Responding to Raut’s column, BJP accused Shiv Sena of distracting from the main issue concerning the residents of the state. “Konkan which is the stronghold of Shiv Sena is facing deluge and large scale damages. Instead of providing relief to the people, Sena despite being in power, is talking of Pegasus. The people of Maharashtra have never seen such worst government which keeps people besieged in problems and offers no relief,” said Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-s-sanjay-raut-wants-to-know-who-funded-pegasus-snooping-project-101627194624493.html

Youngest among six siblings, Patel preferred the long skirt at school uniform over the boys’ shorts, but she could express herself.Patel said her family supported her throughout without any objection and she overcame her struggles with their help and counselling by a psychiatrist. “Initially, there were some apprehensions in other people, but I have survived them all,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“My body language, interest and way of talking conveyed that I would grow up to be a woman to my family,” Patel said.Surat’s social defence officer Lalji Patel said earlier it was a lengthy process to receive a transgender identity, but things have become easier now. “It is not easily done through online registration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-a-rebirth-first-trans-woman-to-receive-identity-card-from-gujarat-govt-101627186755254.html

25-07-2021||India||Gen Rawat holds meeting of service chiefs, addresses theatre command concerns||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat held a marathon meeting on Thursday to assuage concerns of the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force over forthcoming military theatre commands and professionally addressed all misgivings of the tri-services. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to announce key changes and reforms in military architecture during his Independence Day speech this year.On July 22, General Rawat held a five-hour meeting in the presence of three service chiefs, vice chiefs and integrated defence staff officers above the rank of major general and equivalent to explain to them the proposed military theatre commands with a vision to synergise military operations for rapid response to future conflicts. China, India’s main military threat, has already reorganised its military into theatre commands and is now helping client Pakistan to shed its imperial legacy and reform its military. While India faces Chengdu based Western Theatre Command on its northern border along the LAC, Pakistan except for its Peshawar based XI Corps and Quetta based XII Corps has deployed its entire military to face India.Also read | Indian Army and Navy favour theatre commands, Air Force plays the lone rangerSouth Block sources said Gen Rawat held the meeting with the military chiefs at the advice of defence minister Rajnath Singh, who wanted all the legitimate concerns of the tri-services to be noted and valid ones addressed before the military theatre commands were announced. Thursday's meeting was the second such meeting on the issue with the Modi government all set to announce the maritime theatre command and the air defence command. Besides, three land commands will be announced next year with the western theatre command solely handling the Pakistan border and the eastern theatre command solely the Tibet-China border with northern command separately handling both the borders due to illegal land claims of both Pakistan and China over UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.According to South Block officials, the military theatre commands process is going on smoothly with Gen Rawat taking all the questions from the three service chiefs. While the future (now for over two decades) lies in jointmanship and synergy between three services, the three services are worried about their respective turfs and fiefdom with the power of the service chief getting reduced to procurement and training as is the case with theatre commands. It is the theatre commander who will be responsible for operations with all three services joining hands to counter the enemy. It was the 1999 Kargil war, which revealed the lacunae within the Indian military with both the army and the Indian Air Force on different pages when the war started in May 1999.Also read | A national security knotWhile the Narendra Modi government has decided to move towards theatre commands, the three services are worried about the division of military assets and the principal role of the permanent chairman of the Chief of Staffs Committee (COSC) in wartime conditions. Under the military theatre commands, the commanders will directly report to the chairman, COSC, who in turn will task them on the advice of the military chiefs or members of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gen-rawat-holds-meeting-of-service-chiefs-addresses-theatre-command-concerns-101627184901431.html

25-07-2021||India||After NHRC report on Bengal poll violence, 2 held for BJP worker’s murder||The Kolkata Police on Saturday arrested two men for allegedly murdering Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Abhijit Sarkar in the city’s Narkeldanga area shortly after the assembly poll results were announced on May 2, police said. The arrests were made two days after the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal said the West Bengal government had failed to properly investigate complaints of violence lodged after the May-April assembly elections. “The proceedings have become adversarial because the state has failed to properly investigate,” the bench said on July 22 while hearing public interest litigations relating to post-poll violence. The accused Sanjay Dey, 26, and Avijit Dey, 25, are residents of Mahesh Barick Lane in Narkeldanga but were hiding in a relative’s house at Chandannagar in Hooghly district from where they were arrested, said joint commissioner of Kolkata police (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “With this, seven of the eight people named in the first information report (FIR) have been arrested,” said Sharma. Sarkar was allegedly assaulted and strangled with a cable television wire by a mob. The BJP, the state’s main opposition party, which won 77 assembly seats against 213 by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the assembly polls held earlier this year, has alleged that more than 30 of its supporters have been killed till this week and hundreds attacked. It has also alleged that many women have been raped and assaulted. Abhijit Sarkar’s murder figured prominently in the National Human Rights Commission’s (NHRC) report that was submitted before the Calcutta high court on July 13. The five-judge bench had asked the NHRC to probe the allegations of post-poll violence. BJP leader and advocate Priyanka Tibrewal, who is representing many victims of the alleged violence, filed an affidavit seeking DNA test to identify Sarkar’s body which was lying in a city morgue. The court ordered that a DNA test has to be done by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory. The bench had earlier ordered a fresh autopsy of the body at the army’s Command Hospital in Kolkata. The victim’s brother, Biswajit Sarkar, is among the petitioners who moved the Supreme Court in May seeking formation of a special investigation team for probing allegations of violence by TMC workers. Tibrewal told the court on July 13 that members of Sarkar’s family could not identify the body before the autopsy at Command Hospital. The court said that DNA samples from the corpse should be matched with the DNA of the victim’s brother. Representing the state, advocate general Kishor Dutta accused Sarkar’s family of not cooperating with the police. He said several attempts were made to record their statements. On June 21, the five-judge bench of acting chief justice Bindal and justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar dismissed a petition seeking recall of its June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during the alleged violence. Dismissing the state’s plea for recall, justice Bindal observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire confidence of the court. In its report, the NHRC panel slammed the state government saying the violence “shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus”. It even recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the violence and said trials should be conducted outside Bengal. The NHRC report said at least 1,934 police complaints were lodged between May 2 and June 20. These included 29 murder charges, 12 complaints relating to rape and sexual assault and 940 complaints of loot and arson. The report said that out of the 9,304 people named as accused, less than 3% are currently in jail. “The situation in the state of West Bengal is a manifestation of the law of ruler, instead of rule of law...This was retributive violence by supporters of the ruling party against supporters of the main opposition party,” the report said. The court has directed the government to file its reply on the NHRC report by July 26. The matter will be heard again on July 28. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee dismissed the NHRC report, calling it distorted. “How many commissions and central agencies did the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) send to (BJP-ruled) Uttar Pradesh?” she said last week. She also said that the violence took place between May 2 and May 5, the day she took oath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-nhrc-report-on-bengal-poll-violence-2-held-for-bjp-worker-s-murder-101627179261283.html

25-07-2021||India||Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson may not be ‘astronauts’||In a surprise twist, billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, who recently blasted into space, may not fulfil the criteria to be “astronauts” yet, according to new guidelines issued by the US government, media reports say.A policy order from the US government’s largest transportation agency, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), added three new requirements to qualify for “commercial space astronaut wings”.The guidelines state that the spacecraft must meet basic FAA standards, as well as reach 80km above the Earth’s surface. Both Branson and Bezos have accomplished these guidelines, the BBC reported.However, the third rule is where things take a turn for the billionaires.The order states that the astronauts must demonstrate “activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety”.This would mean that space tourists like them may not necessarily qualify. According to the BBC report, these changes are the first since the FAA wings programme was started in 2004.The rules were updated on July 20, the same day that Bezos made his trip to space on the autonomous Blue Origin rocket.Branson reached the edge of space on July 11 in his piloted Virgin Galactic VSS Unity spaceplane.The FAA said it made the changes to “protect public safety during commercial space flights”, the BBC report said.All hope is not lost yet, as Branson and Bezos can still be given honorary wings at the discretion of the FAA. Those who want wings also have to be nominated, the FAA has said.The only other two ways of earning astronaut wings in the US are through the military and Nasa, BBC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jeff-bezos-richard-branson-may-not-be-astronauts-101627153458620.html
25-07-2021||India||India urges G20 nations to bring down per capita emissions by ’30||The target of reducing emissions to net zero by mid-century, proposed by some countries, will not be adequate in view of the fast-depleting global carbon space, India said in its official statement at the G20 energy and climate joint ministerial meeting, even as it urged the group of 20 developed nations (G20) with per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above the world average to reduce the levels by 2030.“We have noted the pledges made by some countries to achieve Net Zero GHG emissions or carbon neutrality by or around mid-century. However, this may not be adequate in view of fast depleting available carbon space. Therefore, and keeping in view the legitimate need of developing countries to grow, we urge G20 countries to commit to bringing down per capita emissions to the global average by 2030,” said the statement shared by the union environment ministry on Saturday.According to data provided by the Climate Watch by World Resources Institute, India emits 7.1% of global emissions and has per capita emissions of about 2.47 Tco2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), as compared to the global average of 6.45 tco2/per capita. In comparison to top emitters, India’s per capita emissions are seven times lower than that of the United States, 3.4 times lower compared to China’s and three times lower compared to the EU.Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the world should not be shifting goalposts and setting new benchmarks for global climate ambition during the G20 ministerial meeting on Friday. “We should not be shifting goalposts and setting new benchmarks for global climate ambition,” Yadav was quoted as saying at the meeting.He also made it clear that India will accelerate action on climate change only when there is enough support from developed countries. “...The momentum of climate action can only be accelerated when there is enough support through means of implementation including finance and technology,” he said.“India’s disappointment with the shortfall in climate finance is understandable. Recent emphasis on net zero targets to stay within 1.5°C warming may also feel like shifting of negotiating goalposts. But recent events have shown that even small degrees of average global warming can lead to dangerous heat waves, floods, and cyclones. For India, scaling up renewable energy and nature-based solutions can bring new jobs and better health, but much depends on clean technology partnerships for industrial production,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-urges-g20-nations-to-bring-down-per-capita-emissions-by-30-101627152729395.html
25-07-2021||India||How Lingayat community became a key BJP vote bank in Karnataka||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s constant appeal to seers and supporters from the Lingayat community, to refrain from protesting a move by the BJP high command to remove him from the post, has not exactly been received well, as the community continues to strongly oppose the decision, warning the Centre of “consequences”. The community forms around 16-17% of state’s population and over decades, has played pivotal role in the Karnataka state elections. The threat of this vote share being snatched away is creating trouble for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), something that the Congress has tried to take an advantage of. MB Patil, a Lingayat leader in the Congress lended his support to the Karnataka chief minister and said on multiple occasions that the community will not be happy with a move to replace him. Even the president of all-India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, Shamanur Shivashankarappa, threw the weight of the Mahasabha behind the chief minister, though he is a Congressman. One of the reasons for the Congress party attempting to appease the Lingayat community is because it knows that the biggest vote bank in the state was not always a BJP supporter, rather, used to back Congress for years. Over decades of political circus in the state, consisting of series of splits between Congress, Janata Party, coalition of parties and untimely deaths of major Lingayat-supported leaders resulted in the community’s vote share currently resting with the BJP. The Lingayat community traces their roots back to the 12th century. Social reformer Jagajyoti Basaveshwara, popularly known as Basavanna, formed the Lingayat way of life, which distanced itself from Veerashaivas, who followed the Vedas and supported the caste system. Basavanna taught people to move away from temple worship and other religious dogmas. The progressive nature of the new community attracted many followers from across the society. But following Basavanna’s demise, the Lingayat and Veerashaiva communities merged once again. By the 21st century, Lingayat and Veerashaiva became synonymous. The community’s large following resulted in it becoming the biggest vote bank in the state also. In the post-independence politics of the state, the Lingayat voters were loyal to the Congress party. Since the party had leaders who came from the community, it remained consolidated in the Congress itself. The situation began to change in 1969 when the Congress party in the state split following the expulsion of Indira Gandhi. Those supporting Indira Gandhi formed the Congress (I), while those opposing her became the Congress (O). Following this split, most of the senior Lingayat leaders, such as S Nijalingappa and Veerendra Patil went with Congress (O). Following the Emergency between 1975 to 1977, the Janata Party was formed in the state. In this new political scene, the Congress (O) in Karnataka merged with the Janata Party, which included the Lingayat leaders and the vote bank. While this merger had resulted in the transfer of the Lingayat vote bank, the consolidation of the Lingayat votes took place following the dismissal of the Lingayat chief minister Veerendra Patil in 1990. “Even though Patil joined the Congress (O) and subsequently the Janata Party, in 1978, he had gone back to the Congress (I) and in 1989, he became the chief minister of the state. In 1990, however, because of a series of riots in the city and considering the health issues faced by the Patil, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi removed him from power,” said Congress legislator, who didn’t want to be named. He added that Patil’s removal from power became a controversy. “The claims that the decision to remove Patil was taken at Bengaluru airport by Prime Minister Gandhi without consulting the Lingayat leader became a matter of humiliation for the Lingayat community. This led to the Lingayat vote bank firmly consolidating with the Janata Party,” he added. It was during the same time, a first division clerk with the social welfare department, who had left the job to pursue politics, was rising through the ranks. Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yeddyurappa won the elections at the Panchayat level and by 1977, became the president of the Shikaripura unit of the newly formed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 1998, he became the state president. In 1988, the Janata Party decided to merge with some smaller parties to form the Janata Dal. The Lingayat vote bank that came from the Janata Party and support from the Vokkaliga (second largest community in the state) community ensured that Janata Dal came to power in 1994 in Karnataka, under the leadership of HD Devegowda. But the Janata Dal split in 1999 due to differences within the party and Janata Dal (Secular)and Janata Dal (United) were formed. While JD(S) was led by HD Devegowda, Lingayat leader JH Patil, and Ramakrishna Hegde, who enjoyed the support of the community, became the faces of JD(U). Years later, in the 2004 elections, JD(U) lent its support to the BJP in the state elections. However, despite the BJP emerging as the single largest party, Congress and JD(S) formed a collation government. By this election, BJP had become a political party to reckon with in the state. In the coming years, JH Patil passed away, and Hegde retired from active politics. As the Congress was led by a Vokkaliga chief minister, SM Krishna, the vacuum created for a Lingayat leader in the opposition was filled by BS Yediyurappa, who has since remained the tallest leader in the party. The decision to remove Yediyurappa from the chief minister’s post now opens another chance for this vote bank to shift. “The BJP doesn’t have a big Lingayat leader apart from Yediyurappa. Even though there are attempts to projects some leaders, the community has not accepted them so far. If the Lingayat community takes this move as an insult, similar to what happened with the removal of Veerendra Patil, the equations in Karnataka’s caste politics could change,” said a Lingayat leader from the BJP, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-lingayat-community-became-a-key-bjp-vote-bank-in-karnataka-101627152016444.html

On Thursday, it posted a message on its website saying the government was scared of true journalism.The raids, which began on Thursday, continued at 32 locations – 20 residential and 12 office premises belonging to key employees and promoters of the group.The statement said fictitious transactions worth ₹2,200 crore; circular transactions worth close to ₹700 crore in the form of booking bogus expenses and siphoning profits from listed companies as well as diversion worth ₹408 crore out of a loan taken for a mall run by the group were detected.“The voluminous material found during the search operations is being examined,” CBDT said in the statement. “Cyclical trading and transfer of funds among group companies engaged in unrelated businesses to the tune of ₹2,200 crore has been found. The enquiries have confirmed that these have been fictitious transactions without any actual movement or delivery of goods. The tax effect and violation of other laws are being examined,” the statement said.Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, Digvijaya Singh, Arvind Kejriwal, Ashok Gehlot and others have said the government is targeting the media house for covering the Covid-19 mismanagement by the Centre.The CBDT statement said the group has more than 100 companies including the holding and subsidiary companies and that they have been operating several companies in the names of their employees that have been used for booking bogus expenses and routing of funds.“During the search, several of the employees, whose names were used as shareholders and directors, have admitted that they were not aware of such companies and had given their Aadhaar card and digital signature to the employer in good faith. Some were found to be relatives, who had willingly and knowingly signed the papers but had no knowledge or control of the business activities of the companies, in which they were supposed to be directors and shareholders,” CBDT said.It added that the listed media company does “barter deals” for advertisement revenues, whereby immovable properties are received in place of actual payments.The taxmen found a total of 26 lockers in the residential premises of the promoters and key employees of the group, which are being operated, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbdt-detects-rs-2-200-cr-fictitious-transactions-in-i-t-raids-on-business-group-101627151839663.html

There is also violation of the provisions of IT Act& Indian Telegraph Act for which strict penal action needs to be done after an immediate, independent and transparent,” stated the petition.It has referred to statements by Union minister for electronics and information technology Ashwini Vaishnav in Parliament, complaining that the government has neither denied nor admitted buying and using the spyware.“It is only an evasive statement from the government. The government has unequivocally accepted the statement of the company, NSO, which owns the alleged spyware technology and blindly accepted their version without any investigation,” said the petition.It further made references to news reports that indicated the possibility of a Supreme Court judge also being a potential snoop target.“As the interceptions are said to be done in the gadgets of judges and supreme court staffer there is a strong interference with the administration of justice. This is unprecedented and shocking (for) the conscience of the judicial system,” added the petition.The petition is yet to be admitted by the top court and it has not been listed for a hearing so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-case-cpi-m-mp-moves-sc-for-sit-probe-101627151836445.html

He, however, clarified that it will all depend on what the data shows and approval from the country’s apex drug regulator. “It all depends on regulatory approvals and data from trials. Unclear exactly when it will start,” Dr Guleria told HT.So far, two mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna are the only ones approved for use in people below the age of 18 years.In the Covaxin trial, children between the ages of 12 and 18 years, and 6 and 12 years have received both the jabs, whereas those between the ages of 2 and 6 years are yet to get the second jab at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Dr Guleria told PTI: “We should then start schools in a graded manner as we have been doing for 18-45 years age and that also will give more protection to the kids and more confidence to the public that children are safe.” He earlier said schools should be reopened in a staggered manner in places where the positivity rate has dropped below 5%.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that the Capital will keep an eye on reopening of schools in other states, learn from them, and then decide whether schools should be reopened. “The ideal situation would be to open schools after vaccination,” he said.The positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% for more than two months.Public health experts have said that children, like everyone else, should get vaccinated against the disease as and when they become eligible and shots become available.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccines-for-kids-likely-by-sept-guleria-101627151777031.html

The inauguration of the ISBT in Meghalaya will go a long way in fructifying the vision of our Prime Minister,” Shah said at the inauguration, which was also attended by Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K. Sangma, Union DoNER minister G Kishan Reddy and MoS science and technology Dr Jitendra Singh.He said the new ISBT will accelerate economic activities, and facilitate better connectivity for passenger and goods vehicles.“Shillong being the capital of erstwhile undivided Assam, it is natural and befitting that the city be connected with the other seven Northeastern states. This will help the economy and progress of Meghalaya and other Northeastern states,” he said.He said that good connectivity is essential to the region as a whole for its development, security and to bring back its old glory.“IT connectivity is very crucial for development and progress and the Government of India has laid emphasis to ensure that IT enabled services reach every corner in the country, so that people can reap its benefit from the comfort of their homes,” Shah added.CM Sangma thanked Shah, saying his visit to the state during the ongoing Parliament session proves that the Centre gives due importance to the economic progress of the region.“Northeast has potential for economic activities with its neighbouring nations and good transport facilities will pave the way and foster better trade and communication not only for the region but for the country as a whole,” Sangma added.Shah also inaugurated the Cryogenic Oxygen plant at Umsawli and visited the Paediatric Unit at Covid Stepdown Hospital.Earlier in the day, Shah laid the foundation for a multi-facility convention and exhibition centre at North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC), Umiam and convened a special meeting with chief ministers of all Northeastern states on application of science and technology for mapping of forest gap areas, expansion of the land area for horticulture development, identification and rejuvenation of wetlands, diversion of flood water and assessment of bamboo resources for livelihood needs.Meanwhile, after meeting Shah, Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb stressed on using geospatial technology to harness potentiality of the Northeast Region to boost tourism.“Geospatial technology can be regarded as providing a toolbox of techniques and technologies of wide applicability in the process of sustainable tourism development. Considering the enormous potential for tourism industry in all NER states, it is very much necessary to make use of geospatial technology for showcasing existing tourist spots as well as potential sites for tourism activity to the rest of the world,” Deb said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-meets-cms-from-northeast-inaugurates-connectivity-project-101627151776438.html
25-07-2021||India||CBI raids across J&K, Delhi in illegal arms licences case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday conducted raids at multiple locations, including the premises of bureaucrats, in Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi in connection with its probe into a case related to illegal issuance of arms licences.The central agency registered the case in 2018, a year after Rajasthan’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) unearthed the alleged scam and made arrests in connection with the issuance of the licences in violation of norms. According to Rajasthan ATS, at least 3,000 permits were illegally granted allegedly in the name of army personnel.Magistrates in Jammu and Kashmir are accused of issuing the licences in bulk allegedly based on forged documents to non-residents between 2012 and 2016 “in lieu of monetary consideration”, people aware of the matter said.Army officers/personnel are eligible to obtain an arms licence in the district in which they are deployed. They can also do so easily, without the requisite police verification, merely on the strength of a letter from the commanding officer. It is believed that these letters may have been forged or misused with the involvement of some army officers and jawans.The Jammu and Kashmir Police initially probed the case before it was handed over to CBI.A CBI spokesperson said the agency was conducting searches at around 40 locations in Jammu, Srinagar, Udhampur, Rajouri, Anantnag, Baramulla and Delhi, including the official and residential premises of certain public servants that also covered Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Kashmir Administrative Service officers. The raids were also being conducted on premises of gun dealers, the spokesperson added.IAS officer Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said his official residence in Srinagar was searched on Saturday. “With reference to media reports I’ve to confirm that CBI did search my residence & found nothing incriminating in ongoing arms license probe. Media friends may note the probe covers 4 years across all districts. I am fully answerable to CBI for my tenure. Stats from my tenure are below,” he tweeted, citing the number of arms licences issued by him as deputy magistrate of Reasi, Udhampur, and Kathua between 2012 and 2016.The people quoted above said CBI collected documents pertaining to the issuance of arms licences across 22 districts of Jammu and Kashmir.“During investigation and scrutiny of documents, the role of certain gun dealers was found, who in connivance with the public servants... allegedly issued such illegal arms licences to the ineligible persons. It was also alleged that the persons who got these licenses were not residents of the places from where the arms licences were issued. The investigation is continuing,” the spokesperson said.In December 2019, CBI carried out searches at over a dozen locations in Srinagar, Jammu, Gurgaon, and Noida in connection with the case.According to Rajasthan Police officials, the Jammu and Kashmir government was informed about the racket in 2017 but several letters addressed to then Chief Secretary BB Vyas remained unanswered.The Rajasthan Anti terror Squad has claimed that 1,32,321 of the 1,43,013 licences issued in Jammu region’s Doda, Ramban and Udhampur districts were to those residing outside the state. The number of licences issued for the entire state over the last 10 years is 4,29,301, of which just 10% was issued to residents in the state. The Rajasthan police further claimed they were not aware of the magnitude of the case and its serious ramifications when they began the operation, code named “Jubaida”. A sample survey of licences issued from Kupwara showed that no files or registers were maintained by the district authorities and many licences may have been issued on basis of forged documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-across-j-k-delhi-in-illegal-arms-licences-case-101627151657005.html
25-07-2021||India||Goa, Karnataka pick up pieces as rain begins to abate||After incessant rainfall for two consecutive days,residents of Goa and parts of Karnataka and Telangana heaved a sigh of relief on Saturday as the intensity of rain has started to recede, even as power supply remained disrupted in several areas.Heavy rainfall across the western coastal region, including Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka, has so far claimed the lives of 140 people and displaced at least 150,000.According to data shared by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority, nine people have died and three are missing in Karnataka so far, with torrential rains battering several parts of coastal, Malnad and north interior region of the state, causing flood like situation and landslides.A total of 31,360 people have been evacuated from low lying areas, while 22,417 people are taking shelter in 237 relief camps that have been opened by the government, it added.Chief minister B S Yediyurappa spoke to deputy commissioners of the affected districts early on Saturday, and is likely to visit the flood affected border districts of Belagavi in north Karnataka on Sunday.Revenue minister R Ashoka, who visited affected areas in Hassan district, said deputy commissioners have been directed to provide compensation under the NDRF funds. A sum of ₹5 lakh will be paid as compensation to those who lost their houses, and an initial payment of ₹10,000 will be provided as a temporary relief, he added.Rain affected Goa and Karnataka have sought immediate central assistance of ₹500 crore and ₹1,000 crore respectively, for relief and rehabilitation works.In Goa, chief minister Pramod Sawant visited the flood-affected areas and assured compensation within 15 days. Goa suffered its worst floods in decades, and the monsoons have caused “widespread damage” in the region but no casualties, he added.According to official estimates, more than 1,000 houses have been damaged by the floods in Goa, while several hundred people have been rendered homeless.Northern Karnataka and Goa last witnessed such heavy floods earlier in 1982, said officials.The India Meteorology Department (IMD), meanwhile, said that rainfall intensity along the west coast is expected to decrease over the next 24 hours. “Further reduction in rainfall intensity is very likely along the west coast, including Konkan, Goa and adjoining interior Maharashtra, during the next 24 hours,” it said.Rainfall activity will increase over the north Indian plains and hills from July 25, the weather department added.As flood waters have started receding, the rain-battered regions have also intensified operations to prevent water borne diseases.Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar instructed health officials to take all precautions to prevent the outbreak of any disease in the flood-hit regions.In Goa, too, CM has instructed district officials to spray disinfectants in villages to prevent spread of water borne diseases. “The second wave of Covid is not over yet. Ensure that free masks and sanitisers are distributed to people in flood relief centres,” Sudhakar told the officials.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-karnataka-pick-up-pieces-as-rain-begins-to-abate-101627151524283.html
25-07-2021||India||Afghanistan turmoil: India warns citizens of kidnapping threat||India on Saturday issued a fresh security alert for its nationals in Afghanistan amid a surge in violence and fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban, warning them to avoid non-essential travel as they face a “serious threat of kidnapping”.The security advisory from the Indian embassy in Kabul reiterated many of the concerns in an earlier alert issued on June 29 and said the security situation in Afghanistan “remains dangerous in several provinces”.“Terror groups operating in Afghanistan have escalated violent activities including targeting of civilians. Indian nationals are not exceptions, and they additionally face a serious threat of kidnapping,” the advisory said.The alert warned of targeted attacks such as “roadside IED blasts and magnetic IEDs against civilian vehicles”, and called for caution during all vehicular movements.“All Indian nationals visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan are advised to exercise utmost vigilance and caution with regard to security at work place, place of residence and also during movement to their places of work. It is recommended that all types of non-essential movements be avoided,” the advisory said.The advisory contained a new section calling on Indian media personnel travelling to Afghanistan to contact the public affairs and security wing of the embassy for a “personalised briefing including specific advice for the locale they are travelling to”. It added, “This will not only help media persons make a better assessment of the risks involved, but also make it easier for the embassy to render speedy assistance if needed.”This was a response to the killing of Indian photo-journalist Danish Siddiqui by the Taliban last week. The Pulitzer Prize winner was killed while covering clashes between Afghan troops and the Taliban at Spin Boldak, a border crossing with Pakistan in Kandahar province. Siddiqui was on an assignment embedded with Afghan security forces at the time.Indian nationals were also warned to strictly avoid travelling outside the main cities and movements during peak commuting hours. The advisory reiterated an earlier call for Indian companies operating in Afghanistan to make special security arrangements for Indian employees deployed at project sites.“While travelling on roads, maintain distance from possible targets like military convoys, vehicles of govt ministries/offices, high ranking officials, law enforcement agencies, and avoid visiting crowded markets, shopping complexes, mandis, restaurants and other public places. All essential movement may please be kept as discrete as possible,” the advisory said.Authorities in New Delhi have been closely monitoring all security-related developments in Afghanistan since the US administration announced plans to pull out all troops from the country by August. India evacuated some 50 diplomats and security personnel from Kandahar in Indian Air Force aircraft on July 10 after Taliban fighters seized key areas around the southern city.Currently, only the Indian embassy in Kabul and a consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif are fully functional. According to the external affairs ministry’s data, there are around 3,100 Indian nationals in Afghanistan, mostly engineers and staff working on hundreds of development projects. India is the largest regional donor in Afghanistan, with pledges of around $3 billion.The Taliban has enhanced efforts to wrest control of territory from Afghan government forces as the US continues withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. The Taliban have said that civilian and non-military foreign nationals, diplomats, embassies and workers of humanitarian organisations won’t “face any problems or security risks” from the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-turmoil-india-warns-citizens-of-kidnapping-threat-101627151596423.html
25-07-2021||India||UAPA can’t remain in current form, sedition law must go: Former SC judges||Former Supreme Court judges Aftab Alam, Madan B Lokur, Gopala Gowda and Deepak Gupta on Saturday expressed concern over the misuse of anti-terror legislation in India while stressing it was time to do away with the law on sedition in the country.The remarks came amid outrage over the death of 84-year-old activist Stan Swamy, who was arrested under the anti-terror law in the Elgar Parishad case last year. He died in Mumbai recently while his bail plea on health grounds remained pending before the high court there.Speaking at an online public discussion organised by NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR), the retired judges were unanimous in holding that the death of the tribal rights activist was an instance of how the anti-terror law was being misused.Swamy was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, (UAPA) for his role in what the National Investigative Agency (NIA) said was an alleged Maoist conspiracy that led to caste clashes near the Bhima Koregaon village four years ago.Justice Lokur said the demise of Swamy was a result of “soft torture”. “Everybody has talked about Stan Swamy. Why could he not be given medical treatment earlier? Isn’t that torture? It is soft torture. It is not physical torture where you beat up a person. But it is certainly a form of torture.”Justice Alam said: “Where has this most draconian law in world’s largest democracy taken us? The results are all there for us to see; it stares us in face in death of Stan Swamy without a trial.”Speaking on the issue, justice Gupta said: “Father Stan Swamy, 84 years old, suffering from Parkinson’s disease...I mean are we not human? Have we lost all touch of humanity that this man required bail even if there is Sections 43D or 43E of UAPA?”“What is the purpose of bail? The purpose is that he should not influence and run away from justice. Court had adequate means to place such restrictions if Stan Swamy was granted bail. But what stands in way was Section 43D of UAPA,” the retired Supreme Court judge added.Section 43D(5) of UAPA makes the grant of bail extremely difficult. It lays down that an accused charged under UAPA shall not be released on bail if the court thinks that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such a person is prima facie true. The Supreme Court’s 2019 judgment in the case of Zahoor Ahmed Shah Watali also laid down that a court cannot go into the merits of a case or scrutinise admissibility of evidence at the time of deciding a bail plea, thereby lowering the bar for courts to examine the veracity of agency’s case.A few weeks back, Assam leader Akhil Gogoi walked out of jail after spending 17 months behind bars in connection with a case under UAPA against him over violent protests against a contentious citizenship law.The former judges said that Section 43(D)(5) of UAPA needed to be either amended or given a completely different interpretation by the Supreme Court, since it had become a tool to keep people incarcerated without trials.“Grant of bail is rendered almost impossible until the end of the trial which could take generations, a wholly unconstitutional interpretation of UAPA that strikes at the root of the fundamental right to life, personal liberties and speedy trial guaranteed under the Constitution. The Supreme Court judgment in Watali case needs to be reconsidered,” said justice Gowda.Justices Gowda and Gupta maintained that a law should be there to deal with terrorist activities but a vague definition of “terrorist activity”, as provided under UAPA, had to go and the Supreme Court must lay down necessary safeguards.About sedition, as provided under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, the retired judges said that there was no place for the sedition law in India since the offence was already punishable under various laws.“In sedition, there is no case whatsoever for retaining this. This law should be shown the door as soon as possible,” said justice Gupta, adding the recent observations by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on scrapping it gave hopes that the sedition law will have to finally go.Justices Lokur and Gupta emphasised that it was time the authorities were made to pay compensation for illegal and unlawful detention of people to fasten financial accountability on the errant officials apart from bringing penal charges against them for the abuse of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uapa-can-t-remain-in-current-form-sedition-law-must-go-former-sc-judges-101627151536429.html

However, missing from the new list are dignitaries such as the state’s chief minister, the Governor, the Chief Justice of the Calcutta high court and the Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, among others. “The chief minister, Governor and other dignitaries are above this list. This list only defines who are in emergency and disaster management duties. CM, Governor, Chief Justice will also have a red beacon light. The notification is being misinterpreted,” Firhad Hakim, state transport minister told the media. A senior official of the state transport department said that the new list was issued to check the misuse of beacons. This comes days after the police detected a few cases wherein imposters were found to have been using beacons.In June, the Kolkata Police busted a fake vaccination racket being run by a man who was masquerading as an IAS officer. Thereafter, a few others were arrested for illegally using beacon lights. The new list of VIPs of those who can use beacon lights atop their vehicle include ministers, the chief secretary, the director-general of police and fire brigade, municipal commissioners, superintendents of police and district magistrates, among others. “The state government is hereby pleased to notify… the general public that the vehicles of the following authorities, while on duty, are designated for the emergency and disaster management duties and are allowed to use the light on top of their vehicle in the state,” the notification read. A senior official of the state transport department also said that the notification didn’t specify which colour of beacon lights the dignitaries would use. “This government does not believe in rule of law. The NHRC report has also pointed out this fact and has said that it is the Law of the Ruler that exists in the state. The officers know this and act in a similar manner,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinterpreted-says-bengal-transport-minister-as-guv-cm-not-in-vip-list-of-people-who-can-use-beacons-101627151477628.html

On Thursday, it posted a message on its website saying the government was scared of true journalism.The raids, which began on Thursday, continued at 32 locations – 20 residential and 12 office premises belonging to key employees and promoters of the group.The statement said fictitious transactions worth ₹2,200 crore; circular transactions worth close to ₹700 crore in the form of booking bogus expenses and siphoning profits from listed companies as well as diversion worth ₹408 crore out of a loan taken for a mall run by the group were detected.“The voluminous material found during the search operations is being examined,” CBDT said in the statement.“Cyclical trading and transfer of funds among group companies engaged in unrelated businesses to the tune of ₹2,200 crore has been found. The enquiries have confirmed that these have been fictitious transactions without any actual movement or delivery of goods. The tax effect and violation of other laws are being examined,” the statement said.Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi, Digvijaya Singh, Arvind Kejriwal, Ashok Gehlot and others have said the government is targeting the media house for covering the Covid-19 mismanagement by the Centre.The CBDT statement said the group has more than 100 companies including the holding and subsidiary companies and that they have been operating several companies in the names of their employees that have been used for booking bogus expenses and routing of funds.“During the search, several of the employees, whose names were used as shareholders and directors, have admitted that they were not aware of such companies and had given their Aadhaar card and digital signature to the employer in good faith. Some were found to be relatives, who had willingly and knowingly signed the papers but had no knowledge or control of the business activities of the companies, in which they were supposed to be directors and shareholders,” CBDT said.It added that the listed media company does “barter deals” for advertisement revenues, whereby immovable properties are received in place of actual payments.The taxmen found a total of 26 lockers in the residential premises of the promoters and key employees of the group, which are being operated, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbdt-detects-2-200-cr-fictitious-transactions-in-i-t-raids-on-business-group-101627151476402.html
25-07-2021||India||Rescue ops take a hit in Maharashtra villages, hopes fade||The hopes of finding survivors in Maharashtra’s Taliye, where a portion of a hillock flattened most of the village late on Thursday, and Satara’s Mirgaon, Dhokawale and Ambheghar were fading away as heavy rainfall continued to stall rescue operations for the third consecutive day. Till Saturday evening, a joint team of local residents, the police and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) recovered at least 86 bodies — 47 in Taliye, 28 bodies in Satara and 11 in Ratnagiri — while around 41 people are still missing.Satara district collector Shekhar Singh said heavy rain and high flow of water gushing through nearby hills has hampered the rescue operations. In Taliye, a local resident said loose mud, bad weather and difficult terrain have prevented NDRF’s efforts to resuming digging for search and rescue.Sandhya Malusare, who lost her mother, father, and six other relatives in the Taliye incident, said she survived since she lives in a neighbouring village. “This is the biggest tragedy of my life and I have lost many of my family members... the administration is very slow in carrying out the rescue and search operations.”Mahendra Pol, a local resident, said people do not have the wherewithal to carry out the evacuation, search and rescue operations. “Fortunately, my family members were saved...but others were unlucky. Yesterday (Friday) and the day before (Thursday), there was a slow rescue process while today (Saturday) it has not even started properly.”Taliye is one of the hardest-hit areas in Maharashtra, where the toll from landslides and flooding went up to 112 on Saturday while 135,313 people have been evacuated from seven districts in the aftermath of heavy rain this week.The locals said they have been left to fend for themselves. “Even police are helpless, and many villagers are missing. The government is not sensitive. Police are also at a distance and not visiting the spot. The rescue operation has been delayed and the government officials are insensitive to our pain and anguish. Whatever bodies have been recovered was due to the efforts of locals,” said a resident.The NDRF said they were facing issues related to access and logistics. “...three teams of 25 persons are carrying out search operations. ...the area is waterlogged and very remote. Approach and access to the village are tough and difficult. It is a mud hillock and since we are working, there is a risk of the mudslide. So, we are working very carefully to avoid another tragedy,” said NDRF commandant Anupam Shrivastava.Collector Nidhi Choudhari said the additional collector, three tehsildars and NDRF is carrying out operations at the spot. “It involves a tough terrain as it (the village) is surrounded by Valleys from both sides. The road to the village was washed away. It is nature’s fury and unimaginable for us. There were access issues yesterday (Friday) and we had to clear the landslide debris to reach the village. The challenge is that we have to trace the bodies.”Choudhari said the district has nine extremely landslide-prone and 80 mild landslide villages. “This village (Taliye) is not among them. We have conducted the geological survey of the district and the village does figure on the landslide-prone village. We conduct studies to find out the vulnerable villages and plan accordingly to make life safe for the villagers as part of our disaster management preparedness.”The opposition parties have also criticised the government over the slow rescue operation.Bharatiya Janata Party leader Pravin Darekar said around 40-50 people are still missing, and the administration has failed to respond to the situation. “Heavy rainfall, waterlogging, and disrupted connectivity are hampering the operations in the village. The tragedy must be viewed seriously by the state and the administration must ensure timely relief and evacuation of the victims .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescue-ops-take-a-hit-in-maha-villages-hopes-fade-101627150756302.html

25-07-2021||Today's||Science and technology is central to strong and lasting Indo-US ties||While the India-United States (US) strategic partnership started in the second term of the Bill Clinton administration, the defining moment in the relationship was the civil nuclear agreement that the George W Bush administration championed and signed with India. Ties got a further impetus with Barack Obama declaring support for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council and the Joe Biden administration’s push to further the strategic agenda between the two nations.A new China, more aggressive and assertive internationally, pushed the US to give its relationship with India strategic importance. The bipartisan support in the US Congress, the influential India-American community, and the role of US business leaders who see India as the next big production centre and market are other factors that played a role. For its part, New Delhi wants to grow economically, militarily and geopolitically, and thinks that a stable and strategic relationship with the US is in India’s interest.However, geopolitical and geostrategic interests take precedence. The US administration wants to sell defence equipment, and India is happy to buy it. But 21st century wars will not be fought with boots on the ground or with aircraft carriers or submarines. It is science, technology, and trade that will determine who wins or loses the war. Therefore, the focus in the India-US relationship needs to shift to science, technology, and trade. What measures can both countries take to achieve this? First, India and the US need to jointly establish 100 chair professorships in frontier areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), genome technology, nanotechnology, deep ocean exploration, quantum computing, clean energy, and functional materials, and choose their best academics to work in both countries with complete freedom to move, interact and jointly work on those projects. Second, they need to establish a new joint research council with at least $10 billion funding to support such research projects. Funds for the proposed research council may come from public and private entities and individual donors, with a prominent India-American leading the effort. Third, each of India’s top 20 universities should choose a partner university in the US with a defined budget for research, joint studentships, and a mechanism of free-flowing faculty between them. Fourth, research programmes on translational areas useful in critical sectors such as agriculture, services and pharmaceuticals should be established. Fifth, discussions on science and technology will not yield dividends unless a robust trade policy is in place. Successive US administrations have indeed wanted to push trade with India to the forefront. However, India has been reluctant due to its domestic compulsions. In critical sectors such as agriculture, reform in India will take time to overcome tariff and non-tariff barriers. The recent farmers’ agitation gives an idea about the contentious nature of agricultural reforms. For the US, scientific collaborations and selling technology to boost productivity for Indian farmers should take precedence over pushing dairy and other farms produce to the Indian market. India needs to invest heavily in infrastructure, both physical and intellectual, and in technology to authenticate agricultural products to help farmers produce internationally competitive produce. India also needs to open up its services, finance, legal, health care and pharmaceutical sectors to US companies. It is unacceptable that the US goods and services trade with India is less than $150 billion compared to nearly $630 billion with China. India and the US can be true partners through joint efforts in making the next generation of quantum computers, achieving breakthroughs in the use of AI, making genome sequencing and analysis affordable, designing and building the next generation of airplanes running on clean energy, and making the first woman pair, one Indian and one American, land on Mars. This is the only way the world is going to believe in the true power of democracy.

25-07-2021||Today's||In UP, the state of electoral play||With assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP) less than a year away, all political parties have begun putting in place their strategies. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is trying to woo Brahmins once again after 14 years. The party has decided to hold a series of Prabuddh Sammelans (conference of enlightened people) across the state. This began in Ayodhya and will cover 72 districts. The BSP conducted a similar exercise in 2006-07. This resulted in a successful outcome at that time and the party got 206 seats, a majority in the assembly. Can this work again?While this appears difficult at the moment, there is no denying that BSP leader Mayawati is a political genius who has in the past shown an ability to outwit her rivals. In terms of national vote share, the BSP is the fourth largest party after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, and the Trinamool Congress. The Akali Dal has allied with the BSP for the Punjab assembly elections next year. And Mayawati has experimented with different and unique political equations. But this battle is specifically about UP, where the party indeed faces challenges. In the run-up to the assembly polls, the Samajwadi Party (SP) led by Akhilesh Yadav is among the strongest contenders. Over the last year, Yadav has been trying to woo caste-based parties, which have been alienated from the BJP. Previous coalitions with the BSP and the Congress have taught him that arrangements with national parties in UP have not been to his advantage. He plans to showcase the development work that his government undertook during his tenure as chief minister (CM). In addition, SP strategists are banking on an anti-incumbency wave against the current government. Akhilesh Yadav’s supporters believe that without the baggage of his family that dragged him down in 2017, the strength of his image alone will have a positive effect on voters. His advisers also believe that apart from Yadav and Muslim votes, the SP will also get votes from other castes and communities. To this end, the party has started exploring the possibility of fielding candidates from the most backward and Brahmin communities. However, the agreement reached between the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party could result in cutting into the SP’s share of the backward caste and Muslim vote. Yadav is also hoping to reap some benefits from the farmers’ agitation in western UP, but the path is not all clear for him at the moment. The Congress is the third player in the Opposition, but despite its past dominance in the state, it is struggling to find its space in the battle. Even though the SP got 759 seats in the last panchayat elections in the state, close on the heels of the BJP which got 768 seats, figures can be misleading. These elections took place during the second wave of Covid-19 and the culmination of the peasant movement. There was a feeling of desperation and anger among the people. Despite this, the BJP did well. CM Yogi Adityanath has an image of being both combative and hardworking. He is seen as tough on law and order issues and there are no allegations of misuse of office or corruption against him. During the last four-and-a-half years, he has proved to be a good administrator who has no hesitation in accepting and rectifying his shortcomings. It must also be kept in mind that if Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi himself chose to opt for Varanasi as his constituency, it is because he is more popular with the UP electorate than anywhere else in the country. Defence minister Rajnath Singh is also a veteran leader from UP.The saffron party has made great strides in social engineering in the state. It has co-opted smaller caste-based parties such as Apna Dal of Anupriya Patel. It is actively working to win the trust of those who have expressed dissatisfaction with it. A look at the size and type of the state cabinet provides a clearer picture. Yogi Adityanath’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya comes from a backward community and played an important role in the BJP winning a majority. The other deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma is a Brahmin. Apart from this, Swami Prasad Maurya, Anil Rajbhar, Jai Prakash Nishad, Dara Singh Chouhan and Shriram Chouhan are known for their influence over the backward classes. State party president Swatantra Dev Singh also falls into this category.The BJP will go to the polls with promises of a clean government and try and showcase the results of its social engineering. But social engineering is not unique to the BJP because its opponents seem to be playing the same card. In addition, a large section of the party’s Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assembly stayed away from their constituents during the brutal waves of the pandemic. So achievements have to be weighed against anti-incumbency and the BJP will have to do a lot of work to ensure that it blunts the edge of the latter. The party may deny tickets to a range of incumbents to retain ground. The Bengal and Bihar elections have been a wake-up call, and it is important that as poll season picks up, all parties remain sensitive and committed to the idea of delivering a clean, sensitive, democratic government.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-up-the-state-of-electoral-play-101627217246422.html
25-07-2021||Today's||Why the monsoon session matters||Protests inside the legislature are not new in India. One of the earliest walkouts occurred more than a century ago in the Bombay Legislative Council. In 1901, when the British administration was passing a law harmful to farmers’ interests, Indian members of the council such as Pherozeshah Mehta and Gopal Krishna Gokhale vehemently opposed the law. When their attempt to delay the law failed, they walked out in protest. Before walking out, Gokhale said, “I take this course with the greatest reluctance and regret ... It is only an overwhelming sense of duty which urges me to take this step because I am not prepared to accept even the remote responsibility of associating myself with this measure which my further presence here would imply.” Since then, the expression of disagreement has taken many different forms. Coordinated sloganeering, display of placards, snatching of papers and tearing them up seem to be the new normal of our legislative functioning. The two Houses of Parliament have detailed rules instructing members not to indulge in such activities. However, the washout of the first week of the monsoon session has highlighted the disregard for these rules. Parliament must function more responsibly, considering that this session is being held in the backdrop of reduced legislative functioning since the onset of the pandemic. Last year, the budget and monsoon sessions were cut short, and there was no winter session. Elections in states led to the curtailment of the budget session this year. The work of parliamentary committees also suffered because of their inability to meet physically during the lockdowns. The monsoon session is the first full opportunity for the two Houses to discuss the legislative and deliberative agenda before them. The government wants to get parliamentary approval on nine bills that are pending from previous sessions. These include the surrogacy bill, assisted reproductive technology bill, DNA technology bill and amendments to the juvenile justice and the maintenance of senior citizen laws. The surrogacy bill, which bans commercial surrogacy, started its legislative journey in 2016. It lapsed in 2019 was revived the same year in the current Lok Sabha. Over the years, the standing committee on health and then a committee of the Rajya Sabha, chaired by Bhupender Yadav, have contributed to the strengthening of the bill. The select committee recommended a surrogacy model based on compensation rather than altruistic surrogacy, allowing any woman (rather than just a close relative) to act as a surrogate mother. It also suggested the introduction of the assisted reproductive technology bill for regulating services such as in-vitro fertilisation. The DNA bill was first brought in the last Lok Sabha in 2018. It provides the framework and safeguards for using DNA technology to establish the identity of individuals in certain civil and criminal cases. After being reintroduced in the current Lok Sabha, it underwent comprehensive scrutiny by the parliamentary committee on science and technology chaired by Jairam Ramesh. The committee observed that the regulatory board for DNA technology should be independent. It also recommended the deletion of DNA profiles of individuals acquitted of a crime in 30 days and the doing away with regional DNA data banks that do not provide any additional benefits. The juvenile justice amendment bill is another bill from the last Lok Sabha. It is transferring the final authority for adopting a child from the local court to the district magistrate. Additionally, it protects children accused of committing serious offences. The amendment to the maintenance of senior citizen law expands the scope of family responsible for taking care of the elderly. It also provides for the regulation of private care homes for senior citizens. While the government’s focus will be on steering its legislative business through Parliament, Members of Parliament (MPs) will be keen on discussing critical national issues such as health infrastructure, vaccines, inflation, rise in fuel prices, floods and drought. So far, only Rajya Sabha has had a debate on the Covid-19 situation in the country. The monsoon session is also the time for Parliament to create a business continuity plan for its committees. Such a plan will come in handy if physical meetings are not feasible because of a third wave of the coronavirus. So far, there has been no political consensus on allowing committees to meet virtually. Another crucial issue requiring institutional attention is about referring government bills to parliamentary committees for scrutiny. The government intends to introduce and pass 17 more bills during the remaining 15 days of the session. This list has high-impact legislative proposals such as the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which will de-license electricity distribution and bring in competition. Such technical bills should go through detailed scrutiny and have their glitches ironed out through careful examination by a committee. Continued disruptions in the session will result in Parliament squandering the opportunity to discuss pressing legislative and national issues. The responsibility for a disruption-free session rests on political parties on both sides of the aisle. A functioning session will allow the Opposition to hold the government accountable for its functioning. Similarly, the government will receive feedback and share its perspective on its handling of the situation in the country. In the end, history will judge whether the ultimate symbol of our democracy, Parliament, guided and informed the country during one of the most challenging times the nation has faced, or whether it failed to fulfil its duty as its proceedings were adjourned due to disruptions.Chakshu Roy is the head of legislative and civic engagement, PRS Legislative Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-the-monsoon-session-matters-101627216766306.html
25-07-2021||Today's||Honour: Heroic or horrific?||1947, Lahore. Lining up his three daughters in a row, Mr. Sethi, otherwise a doting father declared, “I will have to shoot you if the mob of Muslims enter our house, rather than let them molest you. It is better you die rather than our family be stripped of our dignity.” Listening to this story, 73 years later, that my dadi (paternal grandmother), just a little girl at the time told me about her neighbor, propelled me to explore how and why violence was inflicted upon women during India’s partition, the greatest humanitarian tragedy of the time. Luckily the Sethi family along with my grandmother’s family managed to cross to India safely but thousands of others were left behind to their grim fate. Nor was this confined to just one community, authors Ritu Menon and Kamla Bhasin claim, in “Borders and Boundaries: Women in India’s Partition”, that 50,000 Muslim women were also abducted by Hindu and Sikh men on their way to Pakistan.At 17, I am the same age as so many of these young girls who lost their lives at that time. I wanted to hear their stories, their lives first hand from those who knew them and those who survived.Reading primary accounts, mainly through the works of Urvashi Butalia such as “The Other Side Of Silence,” I found, as with my dadi’s story, that the idea of dignity and pride was deeply rooted in Indian and Pakistani society. Members of the woman’s family would neglect, abandon, and even murder her if she was abused by a person of another religion. On numerous occasions, women were also coerced into committing suicide to maintain their family’s honour. This concept was so deeply embedded, that women themselves took it upon them to protect the name of their families from ruin. For instance, Butalia notes in her article, “Community, State, and Gender: On Women's Agency during Partition” that in the village of Thoa Kalasa, roughly 90 women “threw themselves into a well to preserve the sanctity and purity of their religion” since conversion was the only alternative. If not coerced into suicide, they were often brutally murdered. For example, in the oral account of Bir Bahadur Singh, a man who had witnessed his father kill his sister, “described the incident with pride in his voice, pride at, his sister’s courage and martyrdom, for now, she could be placed alongside other martyrs of the Sikh religion.”The second conclusion I drew was that violence was inflicted upon women because they were seen as pathways to bring shame to male members of other religious communities. The aim of men from differing communities, “was to abase the men of the rival religion to which the women belonged.” In his book, “Stern Reckoning” GD Khosla recalls the instance when a young girl was raped by multiple men, and her family members were forced to watch. Similarly, “Women were also mutilated, their breasts cut off, stripped naked and paraded down the streets and their bodies carved with religious symbols of the ‘other’ community.” Women were oftentimes raped in public, expressing larger ideas of mortification and indignity of the victims - the women as opposed to the perpetrators.Today as we mark 73 years of Independence, what surprises me the most is that even today, this concept has not been eradicated completely.The idea that women had rightly been sacrificed for communal, familial, and national pride persisted.In the 21st century, young women are still killed by their loved ones, in what is a twisted conception of preserving honour manifested in the appallingly termed ‘honour’ killings. Just this week, a teenager in Uttar Pradesh was killed by her uncles and grandfather because she refused to change her lifestyle choice of wearing jeans. The first step to changing this mindset is acknowledging the flawed narrative legacy of the past. If in relaying the human suffering of the generations before us, we honour and pay tribute to the disproportionate burden the women of that time had to bear, a valuable step forward towards changing the often male-dominant narrative of the past will change. An invisible thread binds me to those nameless young women of the past and as their inheritor, with a world of choices open to me, I want to learn from their courage and make sure their sacrifice is remembered today.(Yaamini Rajyalakshmi Singh is a student at The Shri Ram School, who is deeply passionate about Modern History and plans to pursue it at college.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/honour-heroic-or-horrific-101627181685697.html
25-07-2021||Editorials||Two parties, one challenge||A month ago, both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress were struggling with the political situation in two states where they were the governing party. In Uttar Pradesh, the management of the second wave triggered criticism of chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath; there was also criticism of his governance style and alleged patronage to certain castes. The BJP national leadership let the controversy play out, uncharacteristically, in public view. But eventually, it backed Mr Adityanath’s continuation as CM while making some adjustments, both at the central and state level, to accommodate leaders of other castes. With this, it hopes to tap into both the incumbency vote (in favour of the CM) as well as the vote of the discontented (who may be disenchanted with the CM but have faith in the prime minister).In Punjab, the acrimonious battle between CM Captain Amarinder Singh and rebel Navjot Singh Sidhu played out, with the national leadership allowing Mr Sidhu to undermine the CM. Eventually, a power-sharing formula was imposed with Mr Sidhu appointed as party chief. With this, the Congress too hopes to tap into both the pro-incumbency vote (of supporters of Captain Singh) and the anti-incumbency vote (with Mr Sidhu doubling up both as party chief but also chief dissenter against the state government). While the context is different, the BJP’s formula is cleaner to execute — back the CM, while ensuring the PM is seen as above the fray. The Congress’s formula is harder to execute — since the CM has to deal with an official rival in the same party structure.But both national parties have turned their focus now to two other states. For the BJP, it appears a transition in Karnataka is imminent, withBS Yediyurappa being asked to make way for another leader as CM. The veteran Karnataka leader has an autonomous base, especially within the Lingayat community, and cannot be brushed aside easily. How his possible exit impacts the party’s fortunes in the south is to be seen. For the Congress, the next challenge is Rajasthan, where Sachin Pilot has been waiting for promises to be implemented. The party leadership is now seeking to ensure the accommodating of his loyalists in the state power structure, but whether Mr Pilot’s rival, CM Ashok Gehlot, will allow this remains unclear. From UP to Punjab, Karnataka to Rajasthan, both national parties are attempting to manage state units with an eye on the next election and generational transition, while ensuring Delhi’s writ runs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/two-parties-one-challenge-101627216466186.html
25-07-2021||Editorials||Mirabai Chanu and Manipur’s sporting prowess||Mirabai Chanu’s silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics was not unexpected, but it was a joyous moment when it happened nonetheless. Chanu, who comes from a farming village near Imphal, has been one of the world’s best weightlifters in her category, 49kg, for some time now. She has won a world championship and holds the world record in one of the Olympics lifts, the clean & jerk. The Olympic silver simply adds to the aura and signals, yet again, the pioneering path forged by athletes from Manipur. Kunjarani Devi, the woman who inspired Chanu, was India’s first medallist at the world weightlifting championship. She won a silver in 1989, at a time when being a woman weightlifter in India was almost unheard of. Devi inspired, and continues to inspire, generations of aspiring athletes to take up the sport in India. MC Mary Kom did the same with boxing — opening the way for women to get into a fighting sport and dream of big medals. Six world titles and an Olympic medal later, she is still fighting, in Tokyo. From the late Dingko Singh to Sarita Devi, and an assembly line of hockey and football players, Manipur has an outsized influence on the Indian sporting scene. Much of that has to do with the love for sport and the sporting culture of the state. Yet, Manipur’s sporting infrastructure is below par, even compared to the usual less-than-ideal standards everywhere in India. Some states have, in the past decade, started to tap into sporting culture and encourage its development. Haryana has done that with boxing and wrestling at the grassroots. Odisha has done so with hockey and athletics and built world class infrastructure. Karnataka has some of the finest sporting institutes in India now. Manipur would do well to embrace its unique sporting identity and nurture it in a truly ambitious manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/mirabai-chanu-and-manipur-s-sporting-prowess-101627216108069.html
