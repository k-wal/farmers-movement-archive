Five policemen from Assam died. The violence shocked the country. Northeastern states have a history of ethnic strife. Internal border disputes go back at least a century. The triggers for them often are disputed claims over land, forest resources, perceived encroachment, ethnic differences, even rumours.Assam’s many longstanding interstate border disputes have their roots in how the state was carved up to form other states in the region. Mizoram was once part of Greater Assam.Also Read | Assam MP asks Mizoram to apologise for clashes at borderThe Northeast, a region also tethered to international boundaries with China, Myanmar and Bangladesh, was once an amalgamated region comprising three large states: Assam, Tripura and Manipur.Assam was carved up into Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. What was once known as the North-East Frontier Agency became Arunachal Pradesh in 1987. Nagaland’s formation happened in 1963. Meghalaya became a separate state in 1972 and Mizoram was declared a Union Territory the same year. It became a state in 1987. Borders were never properly demarcated or unquestionably accepted by all sides, leaving states to feud.Legal pluralism, a concept that refers to a situation where there is more than one source of law, including traditional customs, is widely practised in the region which influences dispute resolution.The Constitution’s Sixth Schedule, which applies to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, grants the region’s tribal populations considerable autonomy through autonomous councils, which have powers to enact laws on land, agriculture, forests and health etc. They have sway over political matters, including land disputes.Assam has border disputes with Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh. There have been several attempts, overseen by federal authorities, to reach settlements.The latest flare-up in Assam’s Cachar district, according to reports, began when Mizoram Police objected to an Assam Police post in the area. The chief ministers of Assam and Mizoram, Himanta Biswa Sarma and Zoramthanga, who goes by one name, sparred, each accusing the other of transgressing. The firing by Mizoram police, leading to the death of five Assam policemen, heightened tensions.Hot bordersAssam-Mizoram: Mizoram attained statehood in 1987. Chief minister Zoramthanga, a three-time head of the state, is a former militant and was deputy to Laldenga, a revered Mizo insurgent who led a secessionist movement that was peacefully settled with the signing of the Mizo Accord.Back in 1875, a colonial notification demarcated the Cachar Hills (present-day Assam) and Lushai Hills (present-day Mizoram). Mizoram disputes its current borders with Assam which go back to that year.Three districts of Mizoram, Aizwal, Kolasib and Mamit, have a 169-km-long border with south Assam’s Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts. Monday’s clashes took place in an area near Kolasib. The first recorded clashes happened in 1972.Assam-Nagaland: Assam’s most serious border dispute has been with Nagaland. Clashes there date back to the 1960s with the worst spiral in 1985 over parcels of land in Merapani, a northern subdivision half of which lies in Assam’s Golaghat and the other half in Nagaland’s Wokha. Nagaland does not agree to a 1963 border demarcation.Assam-Meghalaya: When Meghalaya was part of Assam, Assam’s capital was Shillong, an idyllic hill station the British called Scotland of the East. The main dispute spans swathes of areas in Meghalaya’s West Garo Hills and Assam’s Kamrup district that includes Guwahati. In 2010, a fatal skirmish between Khasi and Garo tribes and Nepali inhabitants of Assam erupted. Clashes recurred in 2012 and 2018.Assam-Arunachal Pradesh: A border dispute north of Assam began radiating in the late 1980s, with the Assam government approached the Supreme Court regarding its claims in 1989. Both sides started accusing each other of transgressing. In 2007, a major clash involving locals took place. The dispute before the apex court is yet to be settled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-northeast-has-hot-internal-borders-101627377129231.html
27-07-2021||News||How the pandemic and lockdown disrupted labour markets||The 2019-20 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), which was released last week by the National Statistical Office (NSO) shows a fall in unemployment rate from 5.8% in 2018-19 to 4.8% 2019-20. Since PLFS follows a July-June rather than the fiscal year (April-March) period, the 2019-20 report includes the 68-day long complete lockdown period.Does this mean that there was no distress in labour markets during the lockdown?An HT analysis suggests that the headline employment numbers in the latest report might be misleading, and a careful reading of the report and the unit-level data does show signs of pandemic driven distress in labour markets. Here are five charts which elaborate this argument.What do the headline numbers show?The three most important numbers in the PLFS report are labour force participation rate (LFPR), work participation rate (WPR) and unemployment rate (UR).LFPR is the share of population in a given age group which is either working or looking for a job. WPR is the share of population which is actually working. UR is the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.There have been three PLFS reports so far, the latest one covering the period from July 2019 to June 2020. A comparison of the three reports shows that despite LFPR being the highest in 2019-20, unemployment rate was the lowest in the last three years. But these numbers hide more than they reveal. Here is why.The pandemic forced a distress-driven rise in rural employment Images of thousands of migrant workers walking back to their villages after the lockdown are among the most graphic memories of economic distress during the pandemic. The 2019-20 PLFS offers first official proof of this distress.In keeping with established wisdom on economic transformation, the share of agricultural employment in India has been falling gradually. 2019-20 was an exception to this trend when agricultural employment actually increased from 42.5% in the 2018-19 PLFS to 45.6% in the 2019-20 PLFS. A sector-wise comparison of absolute number of jobs shows that agriculture more than compensated for the job loss in every sector of the economy in the April-June 2020 period.The picture becomes even clearer once we look at the quarterly numbers for April-June 2020 and April-June 2019. On a year-on-year basis, urban India saw a reduction of 11.05 million jobs in the April-June 2020 period and rural areas saw the addition of 14.7 million jobs.However, unemployment rate — or the share of people looking for jobs who didn’t find one — increased in both rural and urban areas. As is obvious, unemployment rate increased more sharply in urban areas (from 8.9% to 20.8%) than in rural areas (from 8.7% to 12.2%). The reason unemployment numbers did not increase on an annual basis despite a sharp rise during the lockdown months is simple. Unemployment rates had decreased sharply in the July-September and the October-December quarters, and to a lesser degree even in the January-March quarter.That there was distress in urban job-markets was obvious from the quarterly PLFS report for April-June 2020, released in March this year which covers only urban areas. Where the annual report really offers an insight is the rise in what seems to be distress-driven rural employment.What happened to wages during the lockdown? The short answer is they fell sharply. PLFS gives wage data for three kinds of employment categories: regular wage/salaried, casual workers and self-employed.The self-employed were the worst hit during the lockdown, while regular wage workers suffered a contraction only in rural areas. The plight of self-employed workers was the worst in urban areas, where real wages became 3/4th of what they were a year ago. While regular wage workers do show an increase in wages at the national level, they only account for about a quarter of total workers in the PLFS data.Underemployment increased as well To be sure, both employment and wage statistics do not capture the actual stress in labour markets after the pandemic. This is borne out by another statistic in PLFS; the average number of hours for which work was available to different kind of workers.An average worker worked for 46.5 hours in a week in the April-June 2019 period. This came down to 37 hours in the April-June 2020 period. Urban areas saw bigger reduction because both regular wage and self-employed had big decrease in hours worked. Self-employed were biggest losers in urban areas, while regular wage-earning workers were the biggest losers in rural areas.“An unprecedented increase in share of agricultural employment underlines the rise in distress driven employment during the pandemic”, said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “It is a well-known fact that more people join the workforce during periods of economic distress to compensate for the loss of incomes and the situation must have become worse given the fact that the government offered very little in terms of direct support during the pandemic”, he addedAll numbers except annual numbers are based on current weekly status (based on a 7-day recall period). The annual numbers are based on 365 day recall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-pandemic-and-lockdown-disrupted-labour-markets-101627372148741.html

Uttar Pradesh had emerged as an attractive destination for investment, he said, adding the state government had done exemplary work in the past four and a half years. The CM said this would help in attracting investors and bringing about capital investment in the state. The state government should workout short term and long term schemes for attracting investment, he said. Minister for micro, small and medium enterprise Siddharth Nath Singh said UP was second in ease of doing business ranking and it was also the second biggest economy in terms of GSDP. CEO Invest India Deepak Bagla said Invest India was extending all possible cooperation in making UP a trillion dollar economy.

The survey found that 168 of the respondents said they wanted to meet their peers in person. Around 19% of the respondents said they feared they would not be as good at interpersonal interactions on text, according to the newsletter issued by the first-year students.The IIT-B campus shut down completely on March 28 last year as the Covid-19 pandemic had raged in the city. An early summer vacation was announced on April 1. However, on June 25, the institute declared that the entire autumn semester will be conducted online in the interest of students’ safety. The new batch of engineering students was inducted online. Since then, almost all teaching and academic activities, barring research work, have been held online.In the newsletter, first-year students wrote about their experiences of attending classes and extra-curricular activities online. “First-year students always find it especially tough to navigate through the diverse and eventful world that is the campus at IITB. This is why we have multiple senior support systems to help the students find their place here. A crucial part of this support comes in informal interactions with seniors, something that has not been easy in the online mode. The writers of this article remain hopeful that the online mode will soon come to an end and that the juniors will be inducted into the campus and will begin to ask different questions,” read the newsletter.While the chief editors of Insight, the student magazine that published the newsletter, refused to comment, they have issued their statement along with the newsletter. “This newsletter is an attempt to look back and document some of what you guys [first-year students] uniquely experienced to give some perspective to all the readers, whether they be freshers or seniors. Although it was initially aimed at only the fresher batch, the final content has turned out to be relatable to every student that faced the online semesters and will stand as a fine testament to what all our batches faced in these trying times (sic),” the editors said in the statement.Even as the institute gradually reopens its campus to researchers, engineering students, especially first and second years, will continue to attend classes online. IIT-B’s deputy director S Sudarshan said, “There is no immediate plan for reopening the campus to undergraduate students. However, we will review the situation towards the middle of the semester.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/meeting-peers-offline-better-70-first-year-iit-bombay-students-101627410560117.html

An motorcycle used in the crime was also recovered from him, the police said. Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said on July 23, a snatching incident took place in MS Park. The woman filed a complaint in which she alleged that the snatcher was riding a Bullet bike and snatched her pair of ear rings. A case was registered and the investigating team obtained the footage of more than 30 CCTV cameras installed around the crime scene and the routes that the suspect took. “During analysis of the footage, the team developed some snap shots in which the snatcher was seen with the mask on his face. It was also found that both number plates of the bike were plain white. But on the basis of the footage, the team was sure that the suspect was living in a neighbourhood close to the place where the snatching took place,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.The investigating team maintained a vigil in Mandoli area to identify, and find the bike used in the crime. On July 25, the police found the bike and apprehended the rider, identified as Mohit Gautam, a resident of Jyoti Nagar. He confessed to the crime during interrogation. “Gautam told us that he works as a junior engineer in a power distribution company in Delhi on contract basis and is also addicted to narcotics. He disclosed that he snatched the gold ear rings of the woman to celebrate his birthday which falls on July 25, as he was running short of funds. His father had refused to celebrate his birthday because of his bad habits. Gautam sold the stolen ear rings to a goldsmith named Surender in Shahdara. We are looking for the goldsmith,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/engineer-arrested-for-snatching-gold-ear-rings-of-woman-in-northeast-delhi-101627410501388.html

The 173.7 km circular stretch will have 18 viaducts, 17 tunnels, and four roadways over bridges, officials from the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) said on Tuesday. The project will be developed in two phases - east and west - at a cost of Rs. 26,831 crore. It will service 29 villages by connecting highways around the city, and will also regulate pollution levels in the city by diverting heavy vehicular traffic from entering the city to reduce the existing traffic congestion. Officials said the Pune ring road will help to reduce air pollution by at least 25%. According to a recent National Emissions Inventory report, automobile emissions account for 91 per cent of the pollution in Pune’s air. The increased vehicle population in Pune has a significant impact on the infrastructure and traffic situation on inner-city roads, resulting in air and noise pollution in and around the city, especially from outbound vehicles that enter the city. The MSRDC has so far managed to complete the land measurement of over 51% of the total area to be acquired for the western part of the ring road. According to the information given by MSRDC, 695.1099 hectares is to be acquired for the western part of the ring road and the measurement of 351.3024 hectares has been completed so far in 21 villages of a total of 37 affected villages in four tehsils. Also, land acquisition for the Eastern part of the ring road has begun. Officials have started to conduct meetings in the affected villages.“We are positive of completing the land acquisition process in record time. The grievances of the locals are being addressed. Land measurement is an important part of the land acquisition process,” Sandeep Patil, sub-divisional engineer, MSRDC, had said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-ring-road-will-have-14-multilevel-interchanges-8-major-bridges-msrdc-101627410441145.html

Initially, the admissions will be done based on the CET exam results and after that, the admission process will be done based on marks of Class 10. This year a quota system will be used for the admission process. Apart from these six cities, offline admissions will be done in rest of the Maharashtra. The six cities are Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Mumbai, Nashik, Amravati and Nagpur.As per an admission-process circular issued by the director of secondary and higher secondary education department on Tuesday, the actual student registration process through login and password will start from August 9. Students need to register on the official website, to generate a login ID and password. Then student needs to fill up personal details in part 1 of the form, pay the fees, and then lock the form. From August 1 to 7, a mock demo registration facility is available on the website, so that students get familiar with the process. “In the first part of the centralised admission process, students need to fill up their personal details. But in the second part of the form which they need to fill after the CET examination is completed, there will be both the options available to students. They can either fill both CET and class 10 marks, or one of them. Preference will be given to the CET marks for junior college admissions, and then for the remaining seats admission will be done on the bases of the Class 10 marks,” said Dinkar Temkar, director of the secondary and higher secondary education department. “Students will be given an option to fill up demo registration forms between August 1 and 7. There will be management, in-house, minority quotas available this year,” added Temkar. Students are worried about the admission process this year. Rishita Mihani, a student, said, “I have applied for the Class 11 CET examination and am preparing for it, as I got less marks in the Class 10 evaluation. There are many unanswered questions and things which need to be cleared by the state board. If we score less in the CET exams, then will our class 10 marks be considered for the admission process?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/online-admission-process-for-fyjc-to-begin-from-aug-9-101627410440047.html

The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said that “political tourism” should not hamper the relief work, while Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar urged politicians in Maharashtra to avoid visiting the flood-affected areas and that only those who are directly related to an affected area should visit it. The statements from the alliance partners came ahead of Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s visit to Chiplun and Taliye, along with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ashish Shelar, on Tuesday. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis hit back saying that Koshyari was directed by President Ram Nath Kovind to visit the affected villages. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that incidents of natural disasters should not become a battle for credit. He said that opposition must not visit such spots and put pressure on the administration. “Globally, wherever such disasters occur, there is no hindrance to the relief work. In Maharashtra, when such incidents happen, there are allegations, counter-allegations and attack on administration; political tours should be stopped, as far as possible... This is not a battle for credit, and if somebody thinks it is, then they are devoid of humanity... I will say this that politicians should exercise restraint [during such times] as their visit cause a hindrance in the relief work,” said Raut. Pawar, while speaking to media at his party headquarters in Mumbai, said, “Visits of the chief minister (CM), deputy CM and leader of Opposition is necessary because their presence gives a sense of comfort to the affected families and hence, they should organise such tours. But nowadays, we are looking at a trend where many people [politicians] choose to visit the affected areas and these visits hamper the relief and rehabilitation operations.” The veteran leader said though he has been holding such visits, he is avoiding it this time as the local administration will have to wait for his tour to conclude, which is likely to affect the relief work. Koshyari in Raigad said that the state and the Central governments will jointly work to rehabilitate the families. “It is an unprecedented disaster. This may be the first incident in Maharashtra where the entire village was washed away. Families have been destroyed. We, including the prime minister (Narendra Modi) are all sad. CM, too, has visited the place. The incident has happened and now both the governments will make joint efforts to rehabilitate those who survived the tragedy and provide them with all the possible help,” said the governor. Pawar said he is hoping that Koshyari’s visit will help in getting more funds from the Centre. “It’s okay if the governor is visiting the flood-ravaged areas. He may help the state in making available more help from the Centre as he has good contacts,” Pawar remarked. On Tuesday, an editorial in Saamana also stated that relief and rehabilitation work can be expedited if such political visits stop. While CM Uddhav Thackeray was sitting in the state secretariat and instructing the administration, Opposition leader in the legislative Council Pravin Darekar and former minister Girish Mahajan attempted to reach Mahad but were stuck due to heavy rains and had to be rescued through boats by authorities, said the editorial. “After CM, Union minister Narayan Rane and Fadnavis reached Taliye village. Now, the governor is also going there. The relief work is underway. While the government authorities are involved in the relief work, such tourism is creating a lot of confusion there,” remarked the editorial on Tuesday. The mouthpiece added that the opposition should not try to gain advantage over the government during a crisis. Fadnavis backed the governor and said, “Yesterday tour the governor told me that he was directed by the President to hold a visit to the areas hit by floods and landslides. To ensure it is a non-political tour, he has also invited one senior legislator from all the four parties (BJP, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress). I don’t know why others didn’t go with the governor. Shelar is accompanying him and there is nothing wrong in it.” Referring to Fadnavis’s statement that the victims will get the required help from the Centre, the editorial said that his statement was not of a sensible leader. “Should a former CM of the state make a statement that the Centre will help the flood victims? The Union government is supreme for the states and there is no reason to have a different opinion on it. But his stand that they do not recognise the state’s elected government is not in the interest of the state. The state government has not made any complaints against the Centre. Despite this, how appropriate is it for the Opposition to take the stand that they recognise only union government?” asked the editorial. Speaking to reporters on the issue Raut further said, “The state is capable enough but the Union government also has its responsibility towards the states. The state and Centre are coordinating; CM is speaking to the Centre. We are confident that the Centre will provide a package. If it [the package] is less, then leader of Opposition is there, we have Union ministers from Maharashtra, they will take up the issue [of relief package].” Pawar announced that his party, through NCP Welfare Trust, will provide relief aid worth ₹2.5 crore to around 16,000 families affected by the floods. The kits will comprise utensils, cooking materials and bedsheets and medicines. Five ambulances and a team of 250 doctors will also be deployed in the affected districts. Pawar likely to meet West Bengal CM today Pawar said that he is likely to meet All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday in Delhi. “She informed me about her visit to New Delhi and her willingness to meet. I think we are likely to meet tomorrow in Delhi,” Pawar told reporters. He, however, refused to comment on reports related to the alleged Pegasus snooping. “This is not the time and place to say anything else. We will raise the issue at the right place in the Parliament,” the former Union minister said. Uddhav can lead country with patience, patriotism and Hindutvawadi leadership: RautRaut on Tuesday said that Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray is capable of leading the country and will do so one day. Wishing Thackeray on his 61st birthday on Tuesday, Raut said he has been sharing a great rapport with the Sena chief from the past 40-45 years. “He’s a popular CM. People feel that he is a member of their family. Even the country has expectations from Uddhav ji. If in the future the country needs Uddhav ji’s patience, hard core patriotism and Hindutvawadi leadership, he is capable,” said Raut. When asked specifically if Thackeray would could become the PM of the country, Raut answered “Let’s see.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stop-flood-tourism-for-political-credit-say-ncp-sena-bjp-hits-back-101627410381912.html

The situation was chaotic for traffic police due to on-going road repair works in the area.People flouted all Covid norms as they were not wearing masks and due to the rush, there was no space for social distancing.This was the second Angarki Sankashti Chaturthi of the year, considered as an auspicious day for rituals. The Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust had already issued a circular asking devotees to take e-darshan and a link was shared on social media platforms and on the trust’s website.Temples across the city have not been allowed to open because of the second wave in the city. Even though Covid cases have gone down, administration has not taken any decision on the reopening of the temples.“We had appealed to people to not rush outside the temple. However, people still came in numbers. Traffic police and constables were doing their best to control the rush,” said Ashok Godse, president of the Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust.Traffic police officer Atul Shelke said, “ Two lines (from the left and right side of the temple) were made to avoid traffic congestion. The rush went out of control after 11am as vehicle traffic also increased and the number of people coming for worship also increased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crowds-traffic-congestion-at-dagduseth-halwai-ganpati-temple-send-covid-norms-for-a-toss-101627410322473.html

Despite official guidelines permitting only 50 people to attend such functions in the state, the two ceremonies held by Raut had over 2,500 people in attendance, according to police officials. That’s not all; most of the guests were seen without masks and flouting social distancing norms, the police said. Some BJP leaders too, including state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, were among the attendees. A case has been registered against one Yogesh Pawar, described by the police as the “organiser” of the ceremonies, under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.As per the first information report (FIR) filed in the case, while granting permission to Pawar for the ceremonies, he informed that not more than 50 guests would attend and that all attendees would wear masks and follow social distancing norms.Meanwhile, Dinanath Katkar, a social activist from Barshi, expressed surprise over registration of the case against Pawar instead of the parents of the brides and grooms. “The case has been registered against a person who is not well-known. It should have been registered against the parents of those who got married and who own the premises where the events were held,” he said.According to S D Girigosavi, senior inspector, Barshi city police station, Pawar is one of the directors of the Laxmi Sopan Agriculture Produce Committee, the premises of which were the events’ venue. “Since he had applied for permission and was the organiser of the ceremonies, we registered a case against him. However, we are also considering adding the names of the grooms’ parents after checking the legalities,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fir-against-organiser-of-solapur-mla-s-sons-weddings-for-covid-violation-101627410321627.html

These students, however, are not eligible for a second shot of the Covid-19 vaccine, if the first shot taken has been taken less than 84 days earlier. This is the mandatory gap between the two doses. At least 100 students are likely to benefit through this vaccination drive, wherein students need to only show their interview letter and do not need an online appointment. An estimated 100 students will be attending their interviews for the UPSC, after clearing their prelims in October 2020, and then the main exam in January 2021, will now go for interviews in August 2021. This year’s prelims exams are likely to be conducted on October 10. Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “This special drive would help students as they would not require the mandatory negative RTPCR test report, as even a one-shot vaccine certificate is enough to enter at airports, as per current rules. It will also help students focus on their studies as they do not need to worry about getting an online booking or waiting in queue. I have instructed the administration to take up this special drive and I appeal to students to get vaccinated.” The drive will be conducted on Wednesday at the Kamla Nehru hospital between 10 am and 5 pm. Students will be required to bring the interview letter and Aadhar card to get registered. UPSC aspirants will also have to wait for their second shot, while those who have got their first shot at least 84 days earlier, can also get their second shot at this drive.Additional commissioner Ravindra Bhiwade said, “The drive would be conducted along with the special drive in place for students and employees who want to travel abroad for study or work. The students are not yet eligible to get the second shot before the 84 days mandatory gap between two doses, but even one shot of the vaccine would make it easier for them to get access to the airport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-hold-special-vax-drive-for-students-going-to-delhi-for-upsc-interviews-101627410320501.html

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Only 3 containment zones in Mumbai; 60 buildings sealed||As the city is reporting a drop in the number of cases, the data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows there are only three containment zones in the city at Kandivli, Chembur and Bhandup. Moreover, 60 buildings and 1,730 floors are completely sealed in the city. A containment zone covers areas of slums and chawls. As of July 25, in the three active containment zones in the city, there is a population of 25,000, 19,000 in the 60 sealed buildings in the city and 218,000 in over 1,700 sealed floors. This is the lowest number of containment zones and sealed buildings in a long time in the city, said civic officials. During the peak of the second wave in the city in the second week of April 2021, when around 10,000 cases were being reported, the city had 80 active containment zones, 800 sealed buildings and more than 9,000 active sealed floors, where a population of around two million was residing with several restrictions. However, with the number of cases starting to fall from April-end, the number of containment zones, sealed buildings and sealed floors also has gone down. Currently, 64,000 citizens are under home quarantine, compared to over 610,000 during the peak of the second wave. Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of the BMC’s public health department, said, “The containment zones and sealed buildings are going down as the cases are also going down. We have to continue testing, tracing and taking precautions. We can breathe easily once we say that 70% of the city’s population is fully vaccinated. Currently, we can say that around 50% of the total population in the city has taken at least one dose.” On Monday, 297 cases were reported, the lowest number since April 2020. Of the over 17,600 beds in dedicated Covid centres and hospitals, only 2,755 are occupied. Further, the weekly growth rate in the city on an average is 0.05% and the doubling rate is 1,025 days, according to the civic data. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the city reported 344 cases, five deaths, taking the city’s tally to 734,759 and toll to 15,850. The city’s mortality rate is 2.15% and recovery rate is 96.59% with 709,753 recoveries. There are 6,783 active cases in the city. On Tuesday, 28,058 tests were reported resulting in a daily positivity rate of 1.24%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-3-containment-zones-in-mumbai-60-buildings-sealed-101627409480570.html
27-07-2021||Other||Rahul’s tractor march: Police trace vehicle owner, register FIR||New Delhi: The tractor that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi drove to Parliament along with other party MPs in protest against the three farm laws on Monday belongs to a person in Haryana’s Sonepat, the Delhi Police’s internal inquiry into the alleged security breach has found, senior police officers aware of the matter said on Tuesday. They also said that the container truck in which the tractor was brought to Lutyens’ Delhi was also from Sonepat.A senior officer confirmed on Tuesday that an FIR has been filed in the case but did not divulge under what sections the case has been filed or who has been named in the report. “Through the tractor’s engine and chassis number, its ownership was established in the name of one Ajay from Sonepat. The registered owner of the container truck is Surender, who is also from Sonepat. A separate notice will be served to both of them, seeking their explanation on who booked the vehicles and on whose directions the tractor was delivered at the Rajya Sabha MP’s office,” a senior police officer said, asking not to be identified.During the enquiry, the officers said, it emerged that the container truck loaded with the tractor had started from Sonepat, with the occupants of the vehicle -- investigators didn’t made it clear how many people were in the truck -- using a permission letter allegedly issued by Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Dr Amee Yajnik, to enter the Lutyens’ zone, where no heavy commercial vehicle is allowed unless it has obtained permission from the police department.“The occupants of the container truck produced the permission letter when they were stopped by the police personnel in central Delhi and claimed the truck contained the MP’s household stuff that were being moved to her new address in Lutyens’ zone. Since they showed the MP’s permission letter, the police personnel did not check the vehicle or stop it,” said another senior police officer associated with the inquiry, requesting not to be named.Even as police are trying to find out if the MP’s letter was genuine or forged, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “It has nothing to do with Dr Amee Yajnik who is actually from Gujarat and is new in Delhi. It was I who organised the tractor from Haryana. I have already offered the Delhi Police to take action against me in the matter.”Police are also trying to ascertain the exact routes the vehicle took to reach the restricted zone.Investigators have not yet located the container truck though the tractor was seized on Monday morning after Wayanad MP Gandhi, who drove the vehicle allegedly from the office of KTS Tulsi, another Rajya Sabha MP, was stopped by police personnel 70-80 metres away from the Parliament.Ten Congress leaders, including Surjewala and Youth Congress chief Srinivas BV, were detained and taken to the Mandir Marg police station even as Gandhi walked inside the Parliament. The detained leaders were released late in the afternoon.Another police officer said that the tractor was driven for 1.5-km -- reportedly from Tulsi’s office to the Parliament -- allegedly without a registration number plate.On police’s allegations that the tractor was kept at his office, Tulsi on Monday said that he was unaware of all the details because he was out of Delhi. “But if it has happened, I am proud of it. While the whole country is aghast over the manner with which the farmers of this country are being treated, this (tractor rally) will draw the attention of the central government. The Congress party is actually doing a great job. Everyone should put their heads together to resolve this (farmers) issue. It’s a matter of life and death for the farmers,” said Tulsi.On Monday, police officers said that the internal inquiry was launched to look into the security breach in the wake of the ongoing farmers’ protest at the Jantar Mantar, the monsoon session of Parliament and the Independence Day, for which nearly 5,000 personnel have been deployed in central Delhi.The objective of the inquiry is to also look into the failure of the police to prevent the entry of a tractor in central Delhi without prior permission by the authorities. Tractors have been barred from entering central Delhi, especially Lutyens’ zone, since September last year when a tractor was set on fire at the India Gate by some Punjab Youth Congress workers to mark their protest against the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rahuls-tractor-march-police-trace-vehicle-owner-register-fir-101627409481231.html
27-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 more cases of Delta Plus Covid variant; 1 of them is fully vaccinated||Two more cases of Delta Plus variant have been identified in Mumbai, which takes the total number to three in the city and 23 in the state. Both the patients were women healthcare workers, one of whom was fully vaccinated while the other was not vaccinated, said officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) and detected in the state during the second wave. The Union Health Ministry categorised the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19, as a ‘variant of concern’. Swab samples of the healthcare workers were sent for genome sequencing to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in the first week of July after they contracted the infection in June. One is 28-year-old who was diagnosed with Covid-19 on June 28 after she had fever and headache. She hasn’t taken a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The second fully vaccinated patient aged 57 tested positive on June 29, but was asymptomatic. As per the BMC, she had taken both the doses of Covishield. “Both the patients were hospitalised, but didn’t require any oxygen on admission. They have completely recovered without any health complications,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, adding that both didn’t have a travel history. “As samples of their f four close contacts came positive for Covid-19, we sent their samples too for genome sequencing. Their results are awaited,” said Dr Gomare. Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. In April, the state signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with CSIR-IGIB to undertake genome sequencing of 4,000 positive swab samples. A civic health official said identification of the variants in the city is likely to increase further as the BMC is in the process of starting genome sequencing at its affiliated Kasturba Gandhi Hospital from next month. The main machine for genome sequencing will arrive in the city next week which will help conduct more tests and timely delivery of reports. “We have sorted out the problems with the transportation of the US-made machine. It will reach the city this week and we will be able to start genome sequencing at Kasturba Hospital by the first week of August,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. In June, the union health ministry announced that 48 patients were identified with the Delta Plus variant in the country, of which Maharashtra led the chart with 21 cases. The patients were from Ratnagiri, Jalgaon, Thane, and one each from Mumbai, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts. A total of nine patients were identified from Ratnagiri, the highest in the state. The health department has been instructed by the government to send around 3,000 samples for genome sequencing. More samples have been collected from the districts that recorded ‘Delta plus’ variants of the coronavirus considering the variant is more transmissible. But so far, the state health department has not observed any spike in Covid-19 cases from the pockets where it was reported in May in the state. “We have sent 177 samples for genome sequencing. So far, we haven’t been informed about any positive case of Delta plus from the laboratory,” said Dr Sanghamitra Gawde, civil surgeon from the district. “Also, the positivity rate which was 17.32% between May 26-June 1 has dropped to 6.1% in the last seven days,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-2-more-cases-of-delta-plus-covid-variant-1-of-them-is-fully-vaccinated-101627409479970.html
27-07-2021||Mumbai||60-69 age group worst-hit in both Covid waves: Mumbai civic body data||An analysis of mortality data has shown that senior citizens in the 60-69 age group were the worst hit by Covid-19 during both the waves in Mumbai. Most experts consider the period between March and December 2020 broadly as the first wave, even as the number of cases sharply declined by November. Mumbai recorded over 293,436 cases and over 11,116 deaths during this period. The city is currently experiencing a receding second wave. During the period between January and July 15 this year, the city has recorded 48% more cases (436,359), however, the number of deaths dropped to 4,551. Of the 11,159 deaths analysed by the civic body between March and December last year, nearly 3,177 or 28% deaths were in the 60-69 age group. Even as the absolute number of deaths decline this year, the trend has remained the same. Of the 4,490 deaths analysed between January and July 15 (the second wave), 1,142 or 25% were among the 60-69 age group. This age group falls under the high-risk category. Medical experts say age and presence of co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, among others, have been linked to severe forms of Covid-19. “The high mortality is the result of high risks carried by senior citizens or those with underlying ailments,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “A lot of thought is being given to reducing deaths in this category. The push to speed up vaccinations and introduction of monoclonal antibody cocktail drug are some of the measures aimed at reducing the mortality in the high-risk category,” he said. Mumbai’s death numbers indicate the second wave was handled in a better way by the civic administration. Mumbai’s Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among identified confirmed cases – stood at around 1% in the second wave, while Maharashtra’s CFR was at 1.8%. “Mumbai saw a lot of deaths during the April-May period last year, when the medical fraternity knew little about the infection and its management,” said Dr Avinash Supe, head of the Covid-19 death audit committee. “The average of city’s deaths is definitely better during the second wave, despite more cases,” he said. Another important trend seen in BMC’s age-wise death analysis is the drop in the number of deaths among children. The civic body recorded 18 deaths in the 0-9 age group and 35 deaths in the 10-19 age group between March and December 2020. Between January and July 15, these numbers dropped to zero and five, respectively. One must note the civic data is constantly under reconciliation and there is often a mismatch between the BMC and state government’s numbers. For example, even as the 0-9 age group shows zero deaths, some hospitals have recorded deaths in this group, which may be under review and yet to be reconciled. The civic-run BYL Nair Hospital has recorded three infant deaths and the SRCC Children’s hospital has recorded one death this year. The BMC’s mortality data may present a positive picture, but the true impact of the pandemic can be analysed only by considering the all-cause mortality and the excess deaths in the city. In 2018, the city recorded 88,892 deaths due to all causes, according to the statistics updated on the BMC website. The number rose by 2.6% to 91,223 in 2019. In 2020, the year when the pandemic hit Mumbai, its all-cause death toll jumped by 23% to 111,942. Taking into account an average of 3% yearly rise in deaths and adding the Covid-19 toll (11,116 deaths) to it, Mumbai has recorded at least 5,000 excess deaths in 2020. “It is hard to say that all excess deaths are due to Covid-19, but one must not simply attribute these deaths as non-Covid,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “A deeper analysis of this data is needed. Ideally, the government authorities should commission an institution to study this,” he said. The stringent lockdown, mainly during the first wave, made it difficult for many to access hospitals. Elective procedures and treatment for existing ailments were delayed which led to severe health implications in patients. Experts also point that accident-related deaths came down substantially during the lockdown. “It is important to analyse the cause of excess deaths to come closer to reality. These deaths cannot be ignored,” said Ghosh. The stringent lockdown, mainly during the first wave, made it difficult for many to access hospitals.

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Contractor gets BMC notice for delay in work on 16 oxygen plants||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said that it has issued a notice to the contractor, warning of penalty for allegedly delaying the work of setting up oxygen plants in the city, amid the anticipation of the third Covid-19 wave.The BMC has warned of a penalty to the contractor, in case of failing to complete work on time. The civic body has planned to set up 16 oxygen plants at nine locations in the city at the cost of around ₹90 crore that will generate an estimated 43 metric tons of oxygen daily, on the site.The nine locations where 16 plants will be set up includes nine civic-run hospitals wherein two plants at BYL Nair Hospital, two at Cooper Hospital, one at Bhabha Hospital, one at VN Desai Hospital, two at Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, three at KEM Hospital, two plants at GTB Hospital, two plants at LTMG Hospital and one at Kasturba Hospital. These plants will work on the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology.For this, the BMC had appointed Highway Construction Company last month and handed over to them the above sites between June 16 and June 25, 2021, giving them a month to complete the work. However, civic body officials said they have issued a notice as the contractor has not completed the work on time.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC confirmed issuing a notice to the contractor. In the notice, the BMC has said, “Considering the work progress sites, the period of completion .i.e. 30 days was already expired. You are hereby instructed to complete the work immediately without fail, otherwise, a penalty will be levied to you, as per terms and conditions of the tender.”Romin Chedda from Highway Construction Company said, “It is not a notice but I have received a letter from the BMC. The majority of work at all the sites is completed and I will hand over the plants soon in the coming days to the BMC.”Meanwhile, the BMC is also in the process of setting up its own oxygen bottling plant to fill jumbo cylinders in the city at Mahul at the cost of ₹21 crore. This plant will fill around 1,500 oxygen cylinders with a capacity of 7.1 cubic meters daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-contractor-gets-bmc-notice-for-delay-in-work-on-16-oxygen-plants-101627409299915.html

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Road accidents in Mumbai up by 15%: Data||Road accidents in the city have increased by 15% during the past six months, as compared to the number of accidents during the corresponding period last year. Deaths due to accidents in the state have increased by 22% between January and June 2021, as compared to last year.As per statistics compiled by the Maharashtra Highway Police, Nashik tops in deaths by accident, while Mumbai tops in people injured in accidents. However, the police said that the number of accident cases as compared to pre-Covid levels is 37% less in the city and 20% less in the state.As per statistics, for the period of January to June 2021, there were around 14,245 accident cases reported in the state. In the same period, 6,708 accidental death were reported, while 10,879 people were injured.“Mumbai contributed around 6.7% cases, with 956 accidents, 131 deaths and 809 people reported injured,” said a police officer from the state Highway Police department. From January to June 2020, the city had seen around 809 accident cases, in which around 141 people had died and around 822 people were injured.However, the accident cases last year were less due to strict Covid-19 lockdown.Most numbers of the fatalities in accidents happened in Nashik Rural jurisdiction with around 454 deaths, followed by Pune Rural with 418 deaths. Ahmednagar reported 367 deaths, Jalgaon 267, Solapur 255, Satara 243 and Nagpur 242 deaths.“We have been continuously working on the factors and studying them to reduce the number of accidents, most importantly fatalities. We have identified several black spots and are working on them to correct the problems. We are making people aware of over-speeding, which is a major cause of accidents. Due to the pandemic, we can’t concentrate on drunk driving, which is another major problem. At several spots we have studied that people drive on the wrong side which is one of the important reasons for accidents,” said Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police, traffic, Maharashtra.Upadhyay said they have also trained 1,000 locals, like garage owners, toll booth staff, puncture shop owners and even some dhaba staffers as Mrityunjay Doot’s, to provide immediate relief and medical attention to accident victims.If we compare the accident cases with 2019 figures, there are 20% fewer accident cases, 5% fewer deaths on roads and 30% less injured people.In a normal year like 2019, there were around 32,925 accident cases in the state, 12,788 deaths and 28,628 injured people due to accidents, said Upadhyay.Accident cases have decreased in cities like Buldhana, Palghar and Thane.“This year due to several restrictions and local trains still being closed for people, they tend to come out for work via their private vehicles. Several mail express trains have been cancelled. Those wanting to travel outstation can’t travel without reservations. Hence, more people are using their private vehicles, leading to more accidents. The government needs to concentrate more on improving public transport, especially making special bus lanes for government buses and increasing their frequency,” said Ashok Datar a transport expert from the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/road-accidents-in-mumbai-up-by-15-data-101627409179917.html
27-07-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Tendulkar comes to medical student’s aid||Nineteen-year-old Dipti Vishvasrao, a resident of Zarye village in Ratnagiri district, is on the course to become the first woman doctor from her village. Even though Vishvasrao has been a brilliant student, her goal has never been too easy. Despite her modest means, with the support of her farmer father and homemaker mother, she worked hard for the examinations. During the lockdown, Vishvasrao would travel a kilometre everyday, as her village is remotely located, so she could get a network connection to be able to continue her studies online. Her hard work paid rich dividends as she performed exceptionally well in her board examinations, and also successfully cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) to secure admission in the Government Medical College at Akola. But financial constraints were creating hurdles for Vishvasrao. She was unable to afford the expenses for the medical college. While her relatives contributed to the fees, she was still short of funds for the hostel and other expenses. However, legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, through his foundation, along with officials of Seva Sahyog Foundation (SSF), ensured that the required funds were arranged within a short span of time. Tendulkar, through his foundation and Vidyarthi Vikas Yojna (VVY) – a project of SSF – has helped several such beneficiaries. Their project works towards providing financial support to students from the underprivileged section of society to pursue higher education. It also provides support to schools in remote areas to upgrade their educational infrastructure. Over the past 12 years, SSF has supported 833 students across four states and 24 districts. After receiving the aid, Vishvasrao in a video message said, “I am thankful to Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for awarding me the scholarship. The scholarship has lightened my financial burden which allows me to focus more on my studies. My lifelong dream of becoming a doctor is now becoming a reality at Government Medical College, Akola. I promise I will work hard and one day I will be able to help other brilliant students for fulfilling their dreams just as the Foundation helped me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-tendulkar-comes-to-medical-student-s-aid-101627409120513.html

27-07-2021||Mumbai||SIT to probe two FIRs linked to Param Bir Singh: Mumbai Police||Mumbai Police have formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the two first information reports (FIR) linked to former Mumbai Police commissioner (CP) Param Bir Singh and others.The SIT will probe two FIRs, one of which is registered at the Marine Drive police station against Singh, a crime branch deputy commissioner of police (DCP) and five other policemen, by a Bhayander-based builder Shyamsunder Agrawal alleging ₹15 crore extortion by Singh and his subordinate officers.The other is the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) case registered by the Juhu police against Agrawal for his alleged links with the underworld gangster Chhota Shakeel. Agrawal had alleged that based on this false case, Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of his former business partner Sanjay Punamiya, who is presently in the custody of Marine Drive police.“A DCP rank officer would head the SIT and an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) rank officer would be the chief investigation officer of the two cases linked to Singh,” said a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer.Since senior police officers and some powerful and influential people are linked to the case, an SIT would ensure a transparent, fair and time-bound investigation. The SIT will directly report to CP Mumbai Hemant Nagrale and joint CP, law and order, Vishwas Nangre Patil, another police officer said.Singh is facing three FIRs; one is of Marine Drive police station, while two FIRs are being investigated by the Thane police.In Marine Drive police’s FIR the complainant Agrawal, 57, claimed that he had done several real estate projects in Borivli, Bhayander and Gorai between 2016 and 2011, in partnership with Punamiya, but due to complications, conflicts and profit-sharing disputes, the two ended their partnership in 2011. He alleged that Punamiya has been registering false cases against Agrawal since then and has filed 18 cases against him in Mumbai and Thane. Agrawal has cleared his name in 14 of these cases. According to the FIR, on February 17, 2021, registered against Agrawal at Juhu police station on the complaint of Punamiya who alleged that Agrawal threatened him for extortion at the behest of gangster Chhota Shakeel between November 2016 to December 2020. Later in March 2021, MCOCA sections were invoked in the case. A few days later Mumbai crime branch unit 9 officers raided Agrawal’s Bhayander and Vile Parle residences. Based on this case of Juhu police, Agrawal’s nephew Shubham was threatened by Punamiya, Jain and other accused at Punamiya’s Fort office demanding ₹15.5 crore and share in some properties in Gorai and Mira-Bhayander. They allegedly threatened to put Agrawal behind bars for five years under MCOCA charges if the demands were not fulfilled. The accused also forcefully took Shubham’s signature and threatened the complainant with a narcotics case. Shubham, meanwhile, recorded the conversation that took place in this meeting on his phone and presented it before the police as evidence. Based on the audio clip and some monetary transaction records, the Marine Drive police registered the case, sources said. Agrawal, in his complaint, claimed that he had paid ₹15 crore to Punamiya through cheque and ₹50 lakh in cash. He also allegedly paid hefty amounts to crime branch police officers to help him get out of the criminal case.He further added that Punamiya continued to harass him for the remaining payment of ₹11 crore from the previous settlement deed, in which, Singh was also involved. Following this, he approached the police. Now the SIT will thoroughly probe the Marine Drive extortion case against Singh and the MCOCA case of the Juhu police, which Agrawal claims, is a false case filed to implicate him.Besides three FIRs, Singh is already facing multiple enquiries after he was shunted out from the post of Mumbai Police chief in March this year for improper handling of the Antilia bomb scare case. Maharashtra criminal investigation department (CID) is probing multiple allegations against Singh on the complaint of cricket bookie Sonu Jalan and other two alleging extortion at the hands of Singh and his subordinates while Singh was heading the Thane police. CID has submitted their enquiry report to DGP Sanjay Pandey and, sources said that another extortion FIR may be registered against Singh soon. The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has also initiated an open inquiry against Singh pertaining to corruption allegations made against him by police inspector Anup Dange. The ACB has issued a Look Out Circular (LoC) against Jeetu Navlani, an accused in the complaint filed by Dange and a friend of Singh. The 1988 batch IPS officer Singh, was earlier booked in an Atrocities Act case in April this year on the complaint of a serving inspector from Akola police.The third FIR against Singh is registered under charges of extortion and kidnapping at the Kopri police station in Thane last week.Singh is presently in his hometown in Chandigarh and is on leave owing to some health conditions. He has not responded to allegations made against him in multiple complaints. Singh, after his removal as police commissioner, on March 20, 2021, wrote an explosive letter to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray claiming state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed controversial crime branch officer API Sachin Vaze (now dismissed) and other Mumbai police officers to extort monthly ₹100 crore from the 1750 bars, pubs, hookah parlours and other establishments in Mumbai.Based on this allegation first Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and then the Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched investigations against Deshmukh on charges of corruption and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sit-to-probe-two-firs-linked-to-param-bir-singh-mumbai-police-101627409059897.html
27-07-2021||Lucknow||NCP to tie up with SP for UP assembly polls||: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will contest the 2022 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with the Samajwadi Party.Addressing a press conference, NCP national general secretary KK Sharma and state unit president Uma Shankar Yadav said NCP chief Sharad Pawar met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav at Delhi to seal the alliance pact.The decision over seat sharing will be taken later, the NCP leaders said.The aim of the NCP-SP alliance is to defeat the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) in the 2022 assembly election.Terming the BJP government insensitive, the NCP leaders said it failed to fulfill the aspirations of the people.The BJP government was trying to hide the deaths due to oxygen crisis during the Covid second wave. The youths, farmers, traders and labourers are being exploited under the BJP government, the NCP leaders said.“NCP chief and the SP chief have also talked on phone to discuss the alliance for the assembly election. Both the parties will organise rallies across Uttar Pradesh to highlight the anti-people policies of the BJP government. The alliance will also raise the farmer issues and increase in the prices of essential commodities,” the NCP leaders said.Pawar has called upon the like-minded political parties to join hand to defeat the BJP in the assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. Talks are being held with other opposition parties to form a united front against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.Akhilesh has also said the SP will form alliance with the smaller political parties active in UP and other like-minded parties for the 2022 assembly election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ncp-to-tie-up-with-sp-for-up-assembly-polls-101627408459880.html
27-07-2021||Gurugram||More rains predicted even as city receives lower rainfall than Delhi||The city is likely to get heavy rain on Wednesday, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a “yellow alert” and asking authorities to be prepared.A weather warning bulletin issued by the IMD’s meteorological centre in Chandigarh predicted a “heavy rain with thunderstorm or lightning” at isolated places in Gurugram on Wednesday.On Tuesday, when 18.6mm of rainfall was recorded, the city witnessed a slight drop in temperature. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 30 degrees Celsius (°C), which was four degrees below the normal and a minimum temperature of 25.4°C, which was one degree below normal. According to the weekly forecast, the minimum temperature in Gurugram over the next three days is likely to be around 25°C, while the maximum temperature will be around 29-31°C.Meanwhile, despite heavy rain all over Delhi-NCR, rain in Gurugram was comparatively lower. From Monday 8:30am till Tuesday 5:30pm, Palam observatory in Delhi received 127.4mm of rainfall, while in the same period, Gurugram recorded 18.6mm, according to IMD.“Rain in Gurugram and nearby areas is likely to intensify on Wednesday, as per predictions of heavy rain. We cannot pinpoint any cause for why rainfall recorded in Gurugram is lesser compared to Delhi, but the city is getting sufficient rain,” said an official from IMD Chandigarh.Independent experts analysing weather patterns, however, said that the difference could be because of the positioning of the part-time observatory of Gurugram.Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said that rainfall distribution on the radar of IMD shows that areas adjoining east Gurugram, like Palam and Ayanagar, have received over 50mm of rainfall, while other parts have received lower rainfall.“The recently started part-time observatory of IMD is situated in west Gurugram (exact location not disclosed by IMD Chandigarh), so there will be a difference in the rainfall data recorded. As the IMD radar shows, distribution was more near the eastern side. The rainfall data being recorded now is not able to capture the data from the eastern side, which covers areas close to Palam,” said Dahiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/more-rains-predicted-even-as-city-receives-lower-rainfall-than-delhi-101627408403380.html
27-07-2021||Gurugram||Five years since Gurujam, agencies meant to resolve city’s rain mess are adding to its woes||On July 28, 2016, Gurugram received just 52mm of rain. While that was not much when compared to other rain days — like the 19th of this month when the city received 185mm of rain — it was enough to bring Gurugram to its knees; enough to overwhelm a skeletal drainage network; enough to cause the infamous “Gurujam” when commuters were stuck on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway for nearly two days; enough to flood all arterial roads, enough to inundate houses, and enough to wash away the moniker of “Millennium City”.In its aftermath, plan after plan was made by the Haryana government to make Gurugram “rain ready”, to carry away rainwater from the highways and busy intersections, to ensure that the city never got inundated that badly again. Five years on, all those plans have come to naught. On July 19, 185mm of rain left the city battered yet again; four underpasses were flooded, low-lying homes and offices were inundated, and multiple road cave-ins were reported from across the city.In 2016, the main stormwater drain, the Badshahpur drain, overflowed near Hero Honda Chowk and the severe waterlogging had a domino effect. The arterial roads were soon clogged and they took on knee-deep water. Many commuters had no option but to abandon their vehicles on the roadside and complete their journey on foot.In the aftermath of the severe flooding, the Haryana government identified three main solutions to the problem. The widening of the Badshahpur drain at Khandsa village; the construction of a parallel drain to reduce the carrying capacity of the overfilled Badshahpur drain; and the formation of a new agency to end the multiplicity of agencies and streamline work through proper coordination.The three solutions are either still on paper, under construction or have resulted in minimal impact.While the construction of a parallel drain next to the Badshahpur drain, to reduce its carrying capacity, remains on paper, the widening of the Badshahpur drain is currently underway. The formation of a new agency, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), has failed to evoke any change in the workings of the city and has only compounded the prevailing issues.GMDA’s chief engineer, Pardeep Kumar, said since 2018, when the GMDA started its drainage operations, the number of citywide critical points has consistently reduced each year. According to him, this reflects the “on-ground success”.“Recently, the construction of check dams and cleaning of creeks led to minimal waterlogging on Golf Course Road, even when the rest of the city was underwater following the heavy rain. We are aiming to replicate such localised success measures across the city and ensure that all plans formulated to fix the city’s drainage issues, post-Gurujam, are completed,” said Kumar.The deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Yash Garg, said since ”Gurujam”, the administration has carried out preparations, both preventive as well as long-term, to stem waterlogging.“Prior to this monsoon, 113 points were identified across the city, where counter waterlogging measures were initiated. Along with taking preventative measures, the administration is also working with all public bodies to set up infrastructure and revive the natural drainage channels to fix the city’s drainage issues,” said Garg.Experts called on the authorities to come up with a comprehensive citywide plan to combat waterlogging.“The biggest problem with Gurugram is that drainage solutions so far have been done according to residential pockets rather a citywide comprehensive one. In Gurugram, drainage has been fixed according to individual needs of the developer colonies, townships, Huda colonies, societies and condominiums. Instead, a master drainage plan needs to be made, one that creates natural rainwater holding structures, and subsequently, addresses localised drainage issues,” said Sanjukkta Bhaduri, professor of urban planning and dean research at the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi. Widening of Badshahpur drainIn the immediate aftermath of ‘Gurujam’, a 600m stretch of the Badshahpur drain at Khandsa village, where the width of the 27km stormwater drain reduced from 30 metres to a mere 10 metres. The Badshahpur drain carries nearly 70% of Gurugram’s rainwater and this reduction in width was identified as the main cause for the flooding of the expressway in 2016.The drain water overflowed onto National Highway-48 (NH-48) and areas near Hero Honda Chowk, completely cutting that area off from the rest of the city.In the three years that followed, the government acquired from villagers most of the land required for widening the drain. However, a 33m stretch of Khandsa village, where the carrying capacity of the Badshahpur drain reduces from 2,300 cusecs to 800 cusecs, remained stuck in litigation and could be acquired only this May, after the GMDA invoked the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The GMDA started widening that portion last month but by then, the monsoon reached the city. So the construction of a retention wall will not happen only after September.“The 33m stretch was acquired only by end-May and the widening work started immediately. Due to the monsoon, work had to be halted indefinitely. A retaining wall that will ensure the drain water does not overflow onto the highway will be built in September, after the rains subside,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.Parallel drainThe Badshahpur drain has a limited capacity, as evidenced from the spell of heavy rain on July 19, when the drain was filled to the brim in four hours. With the rain continuing for over 15 hours that day, the administration cautioned residents to brace for waterlogging, unless the drains water level recedes.However, the construction of a parallel drain continues to remain on paper. The latest development in this regard took place last December when GMDA officials said they have formulated a plan to build the drain in collaboration with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).According to the plan, a culvert will link the Badshahpur drain at Vatika Chowk with the new drain that will flow along the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and Dwarka Expressway.The project, estimated to cost ₹50 crore, will carry the extra run-off from the Badshahpur drain up to Choma village, thereby reducing the load on the main drain by 40-45%, said officials.Kumar said the authority will construct the parallel drain from Vatika Chowk till the cloverleaf on NH-48, near Central Peripheral Road (CPR), from where the NHAI will construct the remaining portion. “Due to Covid-19, cost of construction materials has increased by 15-20%. Hence, the DNIT [detailed notice inviting tender] had to be revised. We will be floating tenders for this project by September and construction will start soon after,” he said.Ineffective nodal authorityAfter the ”Gurujam”, the Haryana government decided to form a new public authority that will serve bring about better coordination among various public bodies, end multiplicity, and fast-track major development projects, without having to wait for a nod from Chandigarh.A year later, the GMDA came into being. But four years on, the GMDA is riddled with problems of its own that have only added to the city’s civic mess.The main problem affecting the functioning of GMDA is its skewed revenue model, which has left it struggling for funds, thereby stalling development projects. The main source of GMDA’s revenue is the funds it receives from the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), and Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) — the very agencies it was formed to govern. This has affected key infra projects, including drainage.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in January announced that the GMDA is running at a ₹300 crore loss. Since its formation, the main source of its revenue has been the external development charges (EDC) receipts from the DTCP, amounting to around ₹250 crore a year, which is equivalent to the amount the MCG rakes in from property taxes.“On paper, the concept of GMDA makes complete sense in regards to clarity in communication and helming a joint effort for large-scale projects such as drainage augmentation and cleaning. The biggest problem, however, is GMDA’s financial model. For want of funds, it is heavily reliant on other public bodies, which gives those agencies leverage to do things their own way,” said a senior GMDA official, asking not to be named.According to the GMDA’s working structure, it has multiple divisions such as infra 1 and infra 2, with the former largely looking after roads and the latter looking after drains, leading to multiple positions, where one would suffice. Realising this, last September, then GMDA chief executive officer (CEO) VS Kundu formulated a think tank to bridge the communication gap between departments.The GMDA has also faced multiple issues of jurisdiction with various departments such as NHAI, MCG, DTCP, and HSVP, which have resulted in confusion and stalled progress on major projects.As for drainage, the MCG and GMDA formed separate drainage committees to identify reasons and solutions to the city’s waterlogging mess after the rains on August 19 and 20 last year, when seven underpasses were flooded and the city’s most high-profile stretch, the Golf Course Road, had gone underwater.Due to lack of communication, the MCG and GMDA committees worked separately for nearly two months before realising that they were working on the same objective and subsequently, formed a joint committee for the task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/five-years-since-gurujam-agencies-meant-to-resolve-city-s-rain-mess-are-adding-to-its-woes-101627408402181.html
27-07-2021||Gurugram||Agencies given week to fix waterlogging problems||While reviewing waterlogging issues in the city, deputy commissioner Yash Garg on Tuesday gave officials a week to resolve issues at key points in the city. Referring to heavy waterlogging witnessed last week, Garg said, “In the first rain of this season itself, some places got waterlogged, which should not have happened.” He sought a report from all the officers concerned and directed the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take steps. While reviewing the area-wise points, officials from GMDA and MCG informed Garg cited damage to the master drain because of the Basai flyover construction as the reason for waterlogging. Till the master drain is repaired, trenchless pipes will have to be laid from under the cemented roads before the flyover. Garg directed the GMDA to carry out the drain work and the MCG to install a pump by making a sump to the south of cemented roads. MCG officials said that a kachha drain has been dug to extract rainwater from Sector 9 and the sewerage line was cleaned by installing a super sucker machine. The issue of waterlogging in Sector-15 Part-2 was also raised in the meeting, to which, GMDA officials said that all the water from the Signature Tower side fills this sector through the national highway. It was suggested that the culverts of the highway be closed and to connect the surface drains of the highway with one of the main drains of GMDA. Garg directed the officials of GMDA and NHAI to jointly see where the surface drain can be connected and to solve problems in Sector 31, Signature Tower, Rajiv Chowk and Sector 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/agencies-given-week-to-fix-waterlogging-problems-101627408400488.html
27-07-2021||Gurugram||Four-hour rain spell leaves Gurugram waterlogged||A four-hour spell of around 19mm of rainfall early Tuesday left several main roads and low-lying residential areas inundated. However, the underpasses remained largely unaffected this time.A spell of rainfall from around 5.30am till around 9am led to waterlogging at Kanhai Chowk, Ram Chowk in Udyog Vihar, Gold Souk Mall, Bilaspur Chowk, Shyam Chowk Jwala Meel T-point, Mayfield Garden, Galleria Market and Pasco signal. Officials said that the rainwater receded through stormwater drains at most places once the rain stopped.Officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that underpasses, four of which were shut last Tuesday after heavy rain, were not flooded this time as the amount of rainfall was lower.From 8.30am on Monday to 8.30am on Tuesday, Gurugram received 18.6mm of rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while trace rainfall, at scattered locations, was recorded between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Tuesday. Trace is an amount of rainfall that is greater than zero but too little to be measured.“Today (Tuesday), we observed that there was more rain in newer sectors than the older parts of the city, but as the rain was for a short span, the water cleared out within two hours at most places. So, there was no major problem reported. Unlike last week, none of the underpasses was waterlogged this time; there was standing water till the time it rained but the water drained out on its own after it stopped raining,” a senior official of the infrastructure-II division of GMDA said.On Tuesday, residents took to social media to raise concerns over waterlogging at Golf Course Road, where the GMDA had claimed to have resolved the issue by building check dams in the Aravallis. Waterlogging was reported for around two hours from Suncity, Ansal Chowk, sectors 54 and 55, and the Golf Course Road.Pradeep Kumar, the chief engineer of infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said, “We learnt that there was an issue reported from Suncity area on Tuesday, but this is not because of water from the Aravallis reaching the road and flooding it. It is because the drains in the region have not been connected to the master drain of GMDA by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram. However, as many officials were busy with the chief minister’s visit to the city on Tuesday, we will get it examined to find out what could be the cause.”Waterlogging was also reported from Sector 29, where chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was present to attend an event. “In Sector 29, around 100-200 metres from where the chief minister was attending the programme, there is a manhole connected to our master sewer line, but it was overflowing on Tuesday as the whole line was carrying excessive water. The situation was managed, but we will check why there was an overflow, whether it was due to lack of cleaning,” said Kumar.Around 1,000 traffic police personnel were also deployed on roads, but there was no major jam was reported. Around 25-30 cranes and tractors were also deployed at key waterlogging points of Medanta Road, Subhash Chowk and Jwala Meel T-point.Officials from GMDA said that the Jwala Meel T-point was waterlogged as the master drain was already flowing at full capacity and the level of the road is slightly lower than that of the drain.Sanjeev Kumar, the assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “Initially, waterlogging was reported from six to seven areas in the city, but traffic personnel were deployed at all places on time. Traffic jam was not reported from any part of the city and there was smooth movement mostly. Water had entered an underpass in Subhash Chowk due to slope, but it drained out on its own.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fourhour-rain-spell-leaves-gurugram-waterlogged-101627408340593.html

The success of the conference has alarmed the rival parties, and many have lost their sleep. They are using various tactics to stop the Brahmin conference. The people should be alert of their ploy,” she said.A BSP leader said the party’s decision to invoke social engineering formula of Dalit-Brahmin alliance had forced the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) to redraw the election campaign strategy.To woo the Brahmin community, the SP has announced to launch Prabuddh Class conference at Ballia on August 24. The SP has formed a committee of the five senior leaders coming from Brahmin community to mobilize the community.

Speaking to media, Indore Superintendent of Police (SP) Mahesh Chandra Jain said the three were part of a group of friends which attended a liquor party at a city bar last week."A group of seven friends consumed liquor and had dinner at a licensed bar in the Chhota Bangarda area till late night on Friday. However, on Saturday, one of them, a 30-year-old man, passed away and a day later, another man, also 30 years of age, too, died," Jain told the media. The officer further said that in the autopsy report of the second youth, doctors mentioned "suspected poisoning" as the cause of death.Jain, however, cautioned "it is not right to reach any conclusion now," adding that even if true, it is yet to be ascertained whether the deceased died due to spurious liquor or consumed some toxic food during the party. "Samples of liquor and food items have been collected from the outlet and sent for laboratory examination," he said.The condition of a third member of the group, meanwhile, is "very serious," a friend said, adding that doctors have said he has shown symptoms of consuming spurious liquor. Speaking on the issue, assistant excise commissioner Rajnarayan Soni said a detailed probe is being conducted into the incident. "Around 100 others consumed alochol and ate food at the same outlet that night. However, nobody else has so far complained of any health-related complications," Soni said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/2-die-1-ill-after-liquor-party-in-indore-suspected-poisoning-say-police-101627403946812.html

He said, “We wrote the letter before the monsoon and warned about potholes as the repair work was shabby. A few years ago PMC framed guidelines for road works, including repairing potholes. Despite that the officers neglected the work.”Velankar alleged that now the civic body will repair the potholes “hurriedly in the rainy season”, and within a month it will need to carry out the same work again. “It is a waste of tax payers money,” he said.

While the state leadership of the ruling JMM and the opposition BJP have come out in open pitting trading charges against each other over recent arrest of three persons by the Jharkhand police for allegedly hatching conspiracy to destabilise the Hemant Soren government and buy out Congress legislators, the state leadership of the latter has largely remained mum over the entire episode. Sources said the development has further set a sense of unease in the already faction-ridden Jharkhand Congress. While the two Congress MLAs, whose names appeared in media reports as potential targets, have dismissed the allegations, few other MLAs have come out in defence of these legislators. Jamtara legislator Irfan Ansari, one of the legislators whose name figured in media reports, has accused rivals in the party of allegedly trying to frame him. With party legislators being under scanner, the central leadership has sought a report on the issue. Sources said state president and CLP leader could also leave for New Delhi in next few days.“The fact that this entire case is based on information provided by a Congress legislator makes it more complicated. The state president and the CLP have started discussion with party legislators and other senior leaders. On Wednesday, all ministers and MLAs are expected to be in the state capital for a rally. An informal meeting is possible after that rally,” a party legislator said. When contacted, Jharkhand Congress in-charge RPN Singh refused to comment on the entire episode. “I don’t think it would be prudent to comment on the issue as of now, as police are yet to come out with exact details of the case,” Singh told HT from New Delhi. Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Alamgir Alam said he consults party legislators whenever required. “We keep holding consultations. Yes, certain issues have cropped up now, but I would like to assure that the Congress party is intact and there is no threat to the government,” said Alam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-cong-state-prez-legislative-party-begin-consultations-as-central-leadership-seeks-report-101627403599448.html

27-07-2021||Patna||Patna HC seeks details of vaccination, health infra||The Patna High Court has directed Principal Secretary (Health), Government of Bihar, to file a supplementary affidavit focusing broadly on two aspects i.e. vaccination and availability of health infrastructure at the district/sub-divisional level generally and for dealing with Covid-19.Responding to the affidavit filed by the additional chief secretary, department of health, Pratyaya Amrit, the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar said that “with the government substantially relaxing the condition of lockdown, it has resulted into the people/general populace letting off their guard by not wearing masks and maintaining social distancing at public places.”“It is here, we find that the role of media becomes imperative in sensitizing the people of the need to continue to maintain their hand, respiratory and social hygiene, most significantly maintaining social distancing at public places. The significant role played by the media can certainly help in preventing the pain, suffering and anguish of the people in Bihar during the anticipated third wave of Covid-19,” the bench said.The affidavit stated that 71% of the urban population of the state stands vaccinated. “But then it is conspicuously silent about the eligible population falling within the rural area,” the judges observed in their order, dated July 27, describing the affidavit as “vague”.“No doubt, much work has been done by the state in sensitizing the people, cautioning them of taking all precautions for adhering to the advisories issued by the experts and the state, more specifically about hand, respiratory and social hygiene. However, we find the affidavit on the issue of vaccination to be vague, as much as it does not specify the number of persons eligible to be vaccinated, more specifically in the rural areas. Also, whether a sufficient number of doses of vaccines are available with the Government or not? If not so, then as to whether a request for enhanced quota for allotment stands made to the Union of India or not?” the bench added.The court wanted to know if the speed of vaccination needed to be further increased. “We also find that though the government has put in place enhanced systems for testing, for some reason the number of tests conducted on the daily basis is just 75,000(approx). In April/May 2021, the testing had gone up to almost 1.25 lakh, but why this sudden drop in testing is not clear from the affidavit. However, what is heartening to note is that the positivity rate for July 2021 stands reduced to almost 0.05% (average),” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-hc-seeks-details-of-vaccination-health-infra-101627403419361.html

Ranjan was the only son of a functionary of panchayati raj institution of Karakat in Rohtas district.Rising above party lines, members supported Sanjeev Shyam Singh and urged the chair to be take note of the incident, which they said had become common at private hospitals that generally indulged in fleecing the unsuspecting people.

27-07-2021||Patna||Child care leave to women teachers in varsities on the table, says Bihar education minister||Bihar’s education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary on Tuesday told the state Assembly that the government will soon take a favourable decision of granting child care leave for women teachers in universities across the state, as is applicable for women officials in the state government. “We are studying the matter. A favourable decision will be taken soon and applied to all universities,” the minister said while replying to a short notice question raised by BJP member Janak Singh. In 2015, the state government had made a provision to grant 730 days of child care leave for women employees. The maternity leave was also extended to 180 days in 2015 for women staff in the state government. Both maternity leave and child care leave could be availed by women employees for two children in their entire career. Meanwhile, the state Assembly witnessed uproarious scenes when ruling and opposition members cornered the government over non-creation of management committees in high schools, alleging that principals at the government educational institutions were not keen to form the committees. Many members also alleged that lack of managing committees at the schools was one major reason why there was financial impropriety and decisions pertaining to purchase of school furniture and other equipments were being taken arbitrarily. The education minister tried to assure the members that corrective steps would be taken. Intervening in the matter, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha gave a ruling that managing committees in all schools should be formed within a month. Replying to another question, education minister Chaudhary refuted allegations levelled by the leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav that scholarship of ₹50,000 for girls doing graduation under Mukhyamantri Kanya Utthan Yojana was not reaching beneficiaries. The minister said the government had given scholarships to 16,802 eligible beneficiaries against total applications of 17,311 in 2018-19 and to 51900 beneficiaries in 2019-20. “Yes, in 2020-21, there has been some delay in giving scholarships because of the disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government is committed to giving scholarships to all eligible beneficiaries and we are fast- tracking the process,” the minister said. Yadav also took potshots at the state government over the recent Niti Aayog report in which the state had been ranked low in the education sector. He said the government was doing little to improve the educational standard in the state, which prompted the education minister to assert that the state had made big strides in the education sector and improved the standard qualitatively as compared to previous times.“We are also pressing for changing the system of ranking of states under various parameters by the Niti Aayog. The developed states and under developed states cannot be ranked on the same parameters,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/child-care-leave-to-women-teachers-in-varsities-on-the-table-says-bihar-education-minister-101627403359336.html

But today, our demand for debate was rejected. All GA members will boycott the House sittings in the ongoing monsoon session. We feel there is no point in going to the House which is being treated as some people’s fiefdom,” Yadav told reporters outside the Assembly soon after opposition members staged a walkout in the post-lunch session.On March 23, Opposition members were staging a protest against Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, when police were called to assist marshals to forcibly evict them. Some RJD and Congress members alleged they were brutally assaulted by policemen. Earlier on Tuesday, during the pre-lunch session in the state Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav had demanded a debate on the March 23 and said the suspension of two policemen was not enough. “How could police beat up MLAs inside the House? On whose orders was it done?” he said. Parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, in his reply, said that the March 23 incident was unprecedented and Supreme Court had recently made strong observations over legislators indulging in unruly behaviour inside assemblies. The minister urged the Speaker to look at the video footage of the ruckus inside the Assembly on March 23 and take necessary action against police as well legislators. Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha said the March 23 episode, when members indulged in turning tables and jostling to demonstrate dissent, was unprecedented but nothing new as such unruly behaviour had happened in the past in the state assembly and in Parliament. “Whenever such unruly behaviour has happened in the Bihar Assembly, action has been taken against erring legislators based on motion brought by the government. For instance, on August 6, 2015, Jyoti Rashmi was suspended from the house and committees on a motion brought by the government. On August 2, 2010, 71 legislators were suspended on a motion by the government,” the Speaker said. Sinha said the March 23 episode was a manifestation of heightened impulsive behaviour for which some strict action was required to control the situation. “The incident has been referred to ethics committee while a high-level committee has been formed by the state police to look into conduct of policemen. Two policemen have been suspended. We will get the reports soon,” the Speaker said. Opposition members immediately rushed to the well of the House to demand more action. The protests continued in post lunch session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/oppn-to-boycott-rest-of-monsoon-session-tejashwi-101627403239319.html

The two IPS officers suspended are former Aurangabad superintendent of police (SP) Sudhir Kumar Podika and former Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey. Others police officers suspended are subdivisional police officer (Dehri) Sunil Kumar Singh, Paliganj deputy SP Tanvir Ahmad, Sadar DSP (Aurangabad) Anup Kumar, DSP (Ara) Pankaj Rawat and DSP (Dehri) Sanjay Kumar.The suspended administrative officials are Koilwar circle officer Anup Kumar, Paliganj circle officer Rakesh Kumar and Barun circle officer Basant Ray, besides a motor vehicle inspector and six officials ff mines and geology department.Sand mining in Bihar is banned since May 1, 2021, when the company that had won mining rights for major quarries fled the scene, citing losses. However, illegal sand mining remains a thriving business in major riverine areas, officials said. On July 9, state’s home department wrote to Bihar Police’s Economic Offences Unit (EoU), requesting a probe against the suspect government officials. In its probe, officials said, EoU found that the mining mafia has started sophisticated technology to carry out their illegal operations. During a recent crackdown in Sone river in Patna district, police seized high-tech boats fitted with dredging equipment.EOU has also started gathering details of assets allegedly amassed by over 42 officers, including the 17 who has been suspended on Tuesday, with the connivance of illegal sand mining mafia in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/illegal-sand-mining-two-ips-officers-among-17-suspended-in-bihar-101627403179521.html

Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, on Tuesday, said he will speak to Union minister Nitin Gadkari about the possibility of building flyovers on the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway stretch passing through Kolhapur, for uninterrupted vehicular movement during flooding. Pawar was in Kolhapur to assess the flood situation in the district, which witnessed heavy rains last week. He also called for strict action against encroachments on natural water bodies flowing into the Panchganga river. The Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway was reopened for vehicular traffic near Kolhapur on Monday, after remaining shut for four days due to water-logging. The highway stretch near the western Maharashtra district was closed for traffic on Thursday due to which around 2,000 Karnataka-bound vehicles, including trucks and small cars, remained stranded. Pawar said he would talk to Gadkari about the possibility of building flyovers on stretches of the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway near Kolhapur where flooding takes place. “I will talk to Gadkari saheb. The national highway should always be open for vehicular traffic. I will talk to Gadkari saheb about the possibility of building flyovers at different stretches in the district so that vehicular traffic on the (Mumbai) Pune-Bengaluru highway is not interrupted in case of flooding,” he said. Pawar also said a lot of people have blamed constructions and encroachments on nullahs and drains for flooding in Kolhapur city and elsewhere in the district. “I have given instructions to the Kolhapur civic and district administration to take stringent action against such encroachments and remove them from the natural course of the water bodies. If officials show laxity in taking action against such structures, action will be taken against them also,” the NCP leader said. He also said generally flooding in Sangli and Kolhapur is attributed to the Almatti dam in neighbouring Karnataka. “However, a committee formed during the previous (BJP-led) state government concluded that flooding was not taking place due to the Almatti dam,” Pawar said. He further said the state government is planning to form an expert committee that will suggest long-term measures to deal with and minimise the danger of landslides. He also said in view of certain orders from courts and environment department, sand mining auctions did not take place in Kolhapur. “The possibility of increase in sand and silt on the Panchganga river bed in Kolhapur can be checked. We can check if we can lift the silt and sand and increase the flowing capacity of the river,” he said. Such measures were being taken up as part of the national river rejuvenation programme, he added.

All the suspended officers will face departmental proceedings. Officials in the general administrative department said on condition of anonymity that a motor vehicle inspector (MVI) along with six officers of mines and geology department were also suspended allegedly for aiding and abetting the illegal sand mining mafia.The officials said that the illegal mining business was thriving in Bihar since many law enforcement officials had turned mute spectators due to pressure from a politically backed strong illegal mining lobby. They said mostly a customary show of action was made through police raids, which rarely led to any arrests. And if someone did get arrested, no inquiry would follow.Bihar home department, on July 9, had expressed concern over the illegal mining in Bihar and asked the economic offence unit (EoU) to conduct a detailed probe against suspicious government officers, several of whom were found to be complicit by the probe.The EoU found that the mining mafia used sophisticated technology to carry out their operation. Recently, during a crackdown at an illegal sand mining and smuggling site at Patna’s Sone River, police seized high-tech boats fitted with dredging equipment.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has repeated on multiple occasions that his government has “zero tolerance towards crime and corruption in the state” and has called out the police department from crime and corruption in its ranks.The EOU has begun a preliminary inquiry in disproportionate assets allegedly amassed by 42 government officers, including the 17, who were suspended on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-illegal-sand-mining-nexus-17-officers-including-2-sps-4-dsps-suspended-101627402391832.html

27-07-2021||Delhi||Exorbitant interest rates cannot be charged by online lending platforms: HC||The Delhi High Court Tuesday said online lending platforms offering short-term personal loans through mobile apps cannot be allowed to charge exorbitant interest and processing fees and asked the Centre and RBI to look into the issue.An expert body is required to look into the issue, the high court said, added that it expects that the Centre and RBI will come out with some solution by the next date of hearing, August 27.“Rate of interest should not be exorbitant. Just look at the difficulties. An expert body is required. If you people are so slow in taking action, we will do it with our order with the help of an expert committee,” a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said.The bench further said, “This much of exorbitant rate of interest and processing fees cannot be allowed.”The court was hearing a PIL seeking regulation of online lending platforms offering short-term personal loans at exorbitant interest rates through mobile apps, and allegedly humiliating and harassing people in case of delay in repayment.During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia said the government will look into the issue and sought some time for it.Advocate Ramesh Babu MR, representing RBI, said the Reserve Bank of India regulates banks and non-banking finance companies and it does not regulate online lending platform and that the central government has the power to do so.He further said a committee has already been constituted which has to give its report and sought time to place on record the report and an additional affidavit.The petition has been filed by Telangana-based Dharanidhar Karimojji, who works as a freelancer in digital marketing, claiming there are more than 300 mobile applications which provide instant loans ranging from ₹1,500 to ₹30,000 for 7 to 15 days.However, these money lending platforms deduct almost 35 per cent to 45 per cent of the loan as platform fees, service charges or processing fees and only transfer the remaining money to the borrower's bank accounts, the petition has said.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Karimojji, told the court that these entities pose a menace as they charge exorbitant interests rates of 1 per cent or more per day and in the event of non-payment of delay in repayment of the loaned amount, they call up everyone on the borrower's contact list to humiliate and harass them into making payments.He said the prayer is to stop charging exorbitant rate of interest from borrowers and added that the RBI is fully aware of the problem but no action has been taken.During the hearing, the court appreciated the petitioner for filing a “nice petition” and said this is one of the finest petitions and is genuinely filed for the welfare of people.The high court, in January, had earlier issued notices and sought responses of the Centre and the Finance Ministry on the petition which has claimed that such lending platforms charge exorbitant interests on the loans given by them.The plea has said that even the RBI has issued a press note cautioning the general public about these platforms.It has sought directions to the ministry and RBI "to regulate and control working of online digital lenders doing business through mobile app or any other platform" and stop them from charging exorbitant interest on loan from borrowers.The plea has also sought directions to the ministry and RBI to stop the harassment of the borrowers from recovery agents, fix a maximum rate of interest chargeable by the online digital lenders and to set up a grievance redressal mechanism in every state to resolve the problems faced by borrowers within a specific time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exorbitant-interest-rates-cannot-be-charged-by-online-lending-platforms-hc-101627393109268.html

27-07-2021||Patna||Bihar assembly passes 4 Bills via voice vote as Opposition walks out||The Bihar legislative assembly on Tuesday passed four Bills via voice vote without any debate after the Opposition staged a walkout. The Opposition wanted a debate on police action against legislators on March 23 this year during the Budget Session over a discussion on the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021.As soon as the House assembled for the second half of the day, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalit Prasad Yadav demanded a debate over the police action in March. Other Opposition members also joined him and stood up. As Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha asked the members to allow the House to function as per rules and continued with the listed business, the Opposition trooped into the well, shouting slogans. They then staged a walkout.Moving the Bihar Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2021, Panchayati Raj minister Samrat Choudhary said the government had to come up with an ordinance to maintain the continuity in third-tier governance, as the old Act had fixed the tenure of elected representatives to five years and it could not be extended. “This calls for a new mechanism of advisory committees with the same set of people at the helm; hence the amendment,” he added.

Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary moved the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (Amendment) Bill, 2021, necessitated due to the government’s plan to create separate universities for engineering and medical education. “The objective behind setting up Aryabhatta Knowledge University in 2009 was to encourage studies and research in non-conventional subjects and new frontiers of knowledge. There is a plan to have 12 different subjects, which are related to Bihar’s needs and have great significance globally. In three or four subjects like nano technology, river studies, climate change, etc. things have already moved ahead, while new subjects will be added. The procedure of appointment of vice-chancellor has also been changed to ensure that experts in different fields will join the university,” he added.The third Bill was the Bihar Health Sciences University Bill, 2021, moved by health minister Mangal Pandey. Pandey said it was needed in view of the growing needs and rapid expansion in the field of medical education and allied fields.

The 2-judge bench, comprising chief justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, further directed the government to explain how periodic medical check-up is conducted on the inmates.Appearing for the Delhi government, standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi submitted he will file a fresh affidavit on the number of prisoners in jails who have already been administered shots. The bench then listed the matter for hearing on September 16.Of the two petitions, one has been filed by a woman convict seeking vaccination for all prisoners, particularly those above 60 years of age, as well as for the jail staff and security persons. The second plea has been jointly moved by four lawyers who have urged the court to direct the Delhi government to arrange for inoculation of all prisoners who were out on bail.The petitioners have sought vaccination for inmates on the grounds that since Delhi's jails accommodate more prisoners than their capacity, and with more prisoners scheduled to surrender in the coming days, space may not be available for 14-day quarantine of those who test positive. According to the two petitions, there were 16,396 inmates in three jails in Delhi as of January of 14; the jails, however, together have a capacity of 10,026, the pleas said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/file-affidavit-on-covid-19-vaccination-of-inmates-hc-directs-delhi-government-101627385504340.html
27-07-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Inclusive partnerships to ensure cities pass the “climate tests”||PUNE Climate change is taking its toll with intense rainfall and urban floods in Kolhapur, Mumbai and parts of Pune, as well as heat waves in Europe and northern America. What should cities do to reduce their contribution to climate change and adapt better to the impacts? A webinar last week with a conversation between Maharashtra environment minister Aditya Thackeray and renowned industry leader Jamshyd Godrej, and board members of the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, New Delhi, had several interesting pointers. The minister reiterated the need for a focus on cities and climate change, noting that cities contribute greatly to the problem and also hold important solutions. He opined that the biggest hurdle for human development is now climate change. Maharashtra spent over Rs39,000 crore in compensation for climate change-induced calamities last year. The state’s Environment department is now looking to update its climate change action plan. It also aims to promote the participation of five cities from Maharashtra in a global initiative called the Race to Net Zero. A focus on green buildings is needed. Maharashtra should make it mandatory for new buildings to be green and to retrofit the existing buildings, Jamshyd Godrej suggested. Discussions with architects, urban planners and the construction industry would help give this a fillip. In my view, an essential step is for the state to mandate the adoption of the Energy Conservation Building Code that has been prepared by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Carlos Moreno, a French-Colombian scientist has proposed the idea of the “15-minute city”, which envisions that people in a city should be able to meet most of their needs within a short walk or bicycle ride from their home. Minister Aditya Thackeray suggested that our cities could adapt the concept as “15 minutes with public transport” – this was music to the ears. Plantations with native trees, creating urban thickets, using even small spaces like traffic islands, and along highways, are of course always a welcome action. Vegetation can help reduce the urban heat-island effect, as well as trap atmospheric carbon. The minister mentioned how cities elsewhere apply a “climate test” for government decisions, to check whether and how any proposed initiative or project helps in climate mitigation and adaptation. As mentioned in this column some weeks ago, matching the mandatory functions of the municipal government to the Sustainable Development Goals can be a good way to start. The need for partnerships is clear. The pandemic has seen many such entities coming together for relief work and healthcare. Similar community spiritedness is needed for climate action. Schools, colleges, corporates, residential groups, voluntary organisations, and local governments do need to work together for greening, improving walkability of neighbourhoods, enhancing recycling, water harvesting and conservation initiatives. The pandemic also showed us the need for inclusivity with the realisation of how integral migrants are to the city. Climate action too needs inclusive approaches, within the city, as well as with regions and states that support the functioning of cities. Recognizing the interdependence of states like Maharashtra and Bihar, governments and other actors should create programmes for communication, learning and cooperation. Better solutions must be developed in cities for migrant families, especially in distress situations, for living and work conditions, and to access education and healthcare, in discussion with them. Converting these inspirational deliberations into actual projects and partnerships is essential, with a sense of urgency.

The infant is struggling for survival at Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. Exposed to the elements, the infant’s cries caught the attention of neighbours, and he was rushed to a local hospital in Yamunanagar district from where he was referred to PGIMER. Also read: Covid: Vaccination for kids likely to begin next month, says health ministerThe infant’s mother was traced to the civil hospital in Jagadhri, officials said on Tuesday. The matter came to light when the woman, who is a migrant from Bihar, was taken to the hospital and doctors found that she had given birth on Monday. In the meantime, the local authorities were informed about baby by neighbours and the woman accepted that she had left the child on the roof after giving birth to him alone in the toilet. Dr Anju Bajpai, the district coordinator of Childline, an NGO that operates a 24-hour helpline for children in distress, said that the young woman’s parents are migrant labourers, and she was visiting her maternal grandmother’s house on Sunday. “We went to the spot and were told that she had been frequently going to the toilet on Monday. She told her relatives that she had diarrhoea. Her parents say she is 19 years old, but we are investigating,” Dr Bajpai said. Yamunanagar Childline has received at least eight such complaints in July alone where minor girls are found to be six-eight months pregnant without their parents knowing about their pregnancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/newborn-boy-abandoned-on-roof-in-rain-in-jagadhri-101627381149581.html
27-07-2021||Bhopal||MP govt responsible for Ujjain temple’s stampede-like situation, says Congress||Congress leaders attacked BJP-led Madhya Pradesh government for mismanagement for a stampede-like situation at Mahakaleshwar temple on the first day of the auspicious month of Sawan this Monday. The situation allegedly got out of control due to VIP visits to the temple.Controlling the crowd became an issue when over 30,000 devotees arrived at the temple, one of 12 Jyotirlingas in India, while the district administration had made arrangements for 3,500 devotees only as per Covid-19 protocol, said a temple management official. This happened hours before chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan reached the temple for puja. Later, former chief minister Uma Bharti also offered prayers at the temple. Some videos of the stampede-like situation went viral on social media. “The situation went out of control at gates 3 and 4 of the temple. Several devotees were seen pushing and jostling. Many of them fell down and were injured. Even police and temple security personnel could not control the crowd for a few minutes. Later, district and temple administration decided to allow the devotees inside the temple,” said a temple priest. Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary said, “Devotees from across the nation visit the temple to offer prayers. Despite knowing this, the district administration didn’t make any arrangements. Had an untoward incident occurred yesterday, who would be responsible for that? BJP leaders.” “The state government wants to contain the spread or check it? The videos are horrifying and we all can see people falling on each other, inviting infection. The state government put the life of devotees at stake due to mismanagement,” said MP Congress Committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia. While admitting the crowd did go out of control at gates 3,4, Ujjain district collector Ashish Singh said no one was injured in the incident. “Within 10-15 minutes, the security officials and police controlled the situation. We have issued clear instructions that more than 50 people will not be allowed on the temple’s premises at a given time to maintain Covid protocol but devotees overlooked it,” he said. “We will block all the connecting roads and will deploy police at the temple for better crowd control from next Monday,” he added.

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Sena slams political tourism as BJP leaders visit flood-hit areas of Maharashtra||Shiv Sena on Tuesday said that “political tourism” should not hamper relief work in flood-, and landslide-hit regions of Maharashtra. This comes amid visits of Opposition leaders to flood and landslide hit areas and now, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is set to visit Chiplun and Taliye along with BJP leader Ashish Shelar. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Tuesday added that such tourism should stop to expedite relief and rehabilitation work. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said Opposition must not visit such spots and pressure the administration. “Globally, wherever such a disaster occurs, there should not be any hindrance to the relief work. In Maharashtra when such incidents happen, allegations, counter-allegations, attack on administration, political tours should be stopped, as far as possible... This is not a battle for credit, and if somebody thinks it is, then they are devoid of humanity... politicians should exercise restraint [during such times] as their visit hinders relief work,” said Raut.The editorial also stated that relief and rehabilitation work can be expedited if such political visits stop. While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was sitting in the state secretariat and was instructing the administration, Pravin Darekar, Opposition Leader in the Legislative Council and former minister Girish Mahajan attempted to reach Mahad but were stuck due to heavy rains and had to be rescued through boats by authorities, it said. “After CM, Union minister Narayan Rane and [Opposition leader in Assembly] Devendra Fadnavis reached the Taliye village. Now, the Maharashtra governor is also going there. The relief work is underway there. While the government authorities are involved in the relief work, such tourism is creating a lot of chaos,” it said.Referring to Fadnavis’s statement that victims will get the required help from the Centre, the editorial asked, “Should a former chief minister say that the Centre will help the flood victims? The Union government is supreme for the states and there is no reason to have a different opinion on it. But his stand that they do not recognise the state’s elected government is not in the interest of the state. The state government has not made any complaints against the Centre. Despite this, how appropriate is it for the Opposition to take the stand that they recognise only the Union government?” asked the editorial.Speaking to reporters on the issue, Raut added, “The state government is capable enough, but the Union government also has its responsibility towards the states. The state and Centre are coordinating; the CM is personally speaking to the Centre. We are confident that the Centre will provide a [relief] package. And if it is less, then Leader of Opposition is there, we have Union ministers from Maharashtra, they will take up the issue [of relief package].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-slams-political-tourism-as-bjp-leaders-visit-flood-hit-areas-of-maharashtra-101627375508817.html

The AWBI secretary, Dr SK Dutta, has directed Gill, a resident of Rauli village in Moga district, to submit a written explanation within seven days of the receipt of the notice. Also read: MBAs, LLMs queue up for constable’s job; 4,358 posts, 1 lakh apply and countingThe notice was issued after Pandit Rao Dharennavar, an assistant professor at Government College, Chandigarh, informed the AWBI about the violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act by the singer. “It is submitted that in the video, a horse has been promoted and shown as a medium of entertainment, which is as offence under Section 11 (1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and also, the animals have been shown in the video without pre-shoot permission on NOC from the board in violation of the Performing Animals (Registration) Rules,” the board said. Dharenavar said, “This is common practice in the Punjabi music industry. Nobody bothers to adhere to the law, and they don’t take permission to film animals in music videos. My motive is to send a message to everyone that they have to follow the law and take the NOC under rules.” A board official said, “It is mandatory to take permission from the board to shoot animals in the video. A sum of ₹25,000 per application is to be deposited with the board for this purpose. The permission is necessary to ensure that no animal is harmed and depicted in an inhuman manner during the making or in videos.” When contacted, Gill’s manager Narinder Singh said, “Sippy is not available for comment on this issue as he is busy elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-singer-sippy-gill-gets-notice-from-animal-welfare-board-101627375148935.html
27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Pregnant women need bail, not jail: Himachal high court||Observing that every pregnant woman deserves dignity, the Himachal Pradesh high court has allowed the anticipatory bail petition of an accused booked under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The single judge bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara held that pregnant women deserve bail not jail. “What is so urgent to execute the sentence? Heavens will not fall if the incarceration is postponed. Courts must restore the due and sacrosanct freedom of women in motherhood pro tanto (to that extent). Even when offences are grave and accusations severe, they still deserve temporary bail or suspension of sentence, extending to a year after delivery,” observed Justice Chitkara. Also read: Traffic restored on landslide-hit Chandigarh-Manali highwayThe petitioner’s husband and mother-in-law were arrested after the recovery of 259g of heroin and 713g of tablets containing Tramadol from their house at Damtal in Kangra district on November 29, 2020. The petitioner is accused of conspiring with her husband in the drug trade. During the recent hearing, the court observed that nutritious food in jail may ensure physical health but cannot substitute the stress that confined spaces might cause. “Giving birth in jail can be a cause of tremendous trauma. What difference will it make to the State and society if the incarceration is postponed?” said the court. The petitioner had filed a bail petition before the court of special judge, Kangra, which was dismissed on January 19, 2021. The court held that Section 37 of the NDPS Act implies that the accused should satisfy its twin conditions and come out clean. “The evidence collected by the investigator is legally insufficient to deny bail to the other accused in the absence of any other incriminating evidence or allegations, further mellowed down by the criminal history of her husband. Thus, the petitioner has satisfied the first condition. To meet the second, stringent conditions would suffice,” the court said. On this ground alone, instead of limited period bail, she has satisfied the rigours of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. Thus, the petitioner makes a case for release on bail during the trial, the judge held. The possibility of the accused influencing the investigation, tampering with evidence, intimidating witnesses, and the likelihood of fleeing justice, can be taken care of by imposing elaborative and stringent conditions, the court said. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of ₹10,000 and surety bond of ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pregnant-women-need-bail-not-jail-himachal-high-court-101627374608677.html

27-07-2021||Bangalore||BJP legislative party to meet today to decide on Karnataka's next CM||A day after BS Yediyurappa stepped down as Karnataka chief minister, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's legislative party is set to meet and finalise the name of the state's next CM.The meeting will see Union minister of education Dharmendra Pradhan and minister of development of northeastern region of India G Kishen Reddy in attendance as observers, according to people aware of the developments.Senior party leaders told HT that list of probables for the chief minister's post includes contenders like Union minister Pralhad Joshi, BJP national general secretary CT Ravi, national organising secretary BL Santhosh and assembly speaker Vishveshwar Hegde Kageri. Joshi, Santosh and Kageri are Brahmins; Ravi, the MLA from Chikkamagaluru, is a Vokkaliga, Karnataka’s second-largest community concentrated in southern Karnataka, where the party is trying to make inroads.Names like mining minister Murugesh Nirani, industries minister Jagadish Shettar and MLAs Arvind Bellad and Basanagouda Patil Yatnal have also surfaced if the party plans to give Yediyurappa's seat to another leader from the dominant Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, which has not taken the exit of Yediyurappa kindly.A politically unlucky Yediyurappa resigned as the chief minister of Karnataka on Monday, bringing the rife speculations of turbulence in BJP's state unit to an end, almost a year before the southern state is set to witness Assembly elections.The 78-year-old made the announcement in an emotional speech at an event celebrating two years in power before submitting his resignation to governor Thawarchand Gehlot. The four-time chief minister, who battled criticism and public attacks from within his party and cabinet over the past three months, said he quit “voluntarily” and thanked the BJP.“I’m not sad. I’m happy. I can’t thank in words PM Modi, Amit Shah, and JP Nadda to let me be the chief minister even though I was over 75 years,” said Yediyurappa. “There is no question of political retirement for any reason, I’m with the karyakartas and the people.”A Lingayat strongman, Yediyurappa is credited with having built the BJP from the grassroots in the 2000s and leading the party to its first victory in a southern state in 2008. He has pan-state appeal and nurtured the Lingayats -- comprising roughly 16% of Karnataka’s population -- as a reliable vote bank for the BJP. Even in his last days in office, he rallied support from influential Lingayat seers and mutts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bjp-legislative-party-to-meet-today-to-discuss-names-of-karnataka-s-new-cm-101627370915836.html

From Dighwara to Chhapra NH-19, hundreds of trucks and tractors are parked on either side of the road and at times, business is also carried out in the middle of the road, leaving barely enough space for traffic.Students, university staff and locals say they have complained about it but Saran district administration is yet to take action. Raja Ram Paswan, a driver from Gorakhpur in UP, claimed that he, along with others, was detained in the university premises for not paying penalty on being caught for overloading. “We are here for the past eight days. We cook under the parked vehicle and sleep right there,” he said. Also Read | Healthcare workers in Bihar’s Buxar report 94.1% seropositivityThe police personnel deployed at the university gate said he was positioned there by the order of the district administration. “Overloaded vehicles coming from Dighwara and Doriganj areas of Saran besides Bhojpur district are stopped and made to park in the university campus till they pay the penalty,” one of them said. Saran district magistrate Dr Nilesh Ramchandra Deore said heavy vehicles were parked on only one stretch from the main gate to the building for want of another alternative but it was not causing inconvenience to anyone. “We are looking for another parking lot even if it requires rent. From May 1 till date, ₹11 crore has been collected through penalty and 90 FIRs have been lodged. The government earns ₹12 crore revenue from sand annually,” he added. JPU registrar Dr Ravi Prakash Babloo said vice-chancellor Faruque Ali has raised the issue with the police, suggesting that they use the area behind the university building for parking of heavy vehicles. River activist Jitendra Kumar alleged that sand mafia enjoys the support of politicians and police. “Illegal sand mining takes place in rivers across the state in broad daylight and in full knowledge of authorities,” he said.Sand mining was banned for three months from July 1 to September 30 last year in the state as per the order of the National Green Tribunal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/trucks-parked-on-bihar-university-campus-101627368590643.html

27-07-2021||Delhi||Noodle love: Adapting global flavours||The content that we consume for entertainment can affect our eating habits too! Surprised? Don’t be. According to a new survey by market research firm Euromonitor, the popularity of Korean series and K-pop music has led to a rise in the consumption of Korean food in India. “With the Korean wave blowing in India, interest and demand for various Korean foods are growing, ramyun being the most popular,” says Junghun Yoo, a chef from Korean Culture Centre India, Dalgrak.The history of Korean ramyun dates back to 1963, when it emerged as a cheap filler food during the post-Korean war age, says chef, Rani Lee from Seoul restaurant. “Ramyun, the Korean word for instant noodles is based on traditional Japanese cuisine. It often comes in cup or packet form. One of the major reasons behind ramyun’s popularity is the fact that it is easy to make and quick to eat,” says Lee.Japanese style ramens are called ramen, while the Korean variant is called ramyun. Though there is more difference than just the name, many noodle lovers prefer to try both depending on their craving. “Japanese ramen is more subtle in flavour as compared to Korean ramen as it has a stronger taste, and is generally spicy,” says chef Kazuhiro Koizumi from The Westin Gurgaon.Both ramen and ramyun come in variety of flavours, and it’s the usage of different elements that give them their unique taste. “Sauce (tare), soup, toppings, noodles and oil – the harmony and balance of these five elements makes a perfect ramyun,” says Tushar Alagh, a consultant with Mensho Tokyo, while adding that ramen on the other hand is more diverse and can even be prepared using desi ingredients. “We serve spicy lamb ramen which has a sesame minced lamb, rich chicken broth, carrots, eggplant and kasturi methi. This gives the whole Japanese bowl of ramen, a pop of Indian flavours,” he says.These noodles are known for their versatility also. “There’s a ramen for almost every pallet.Variety of noodles, various types of broths and toppings can be used,” says chef Ritesh Tulsian. And there are ways to make it healthy too. Just replace wheat noodles with buckwheat noodles, mung bean noodles or rice noodles and add veggies to it. “Consider adding some broccoli to your ramen for a boost of vitamin C and healthy fibre, or maybe some chopped carrots for an added dose of vitamin A and vitamin C. You can add veggies raw, steamed or cook them in the broth itself while heating the noodles,” says Koizumi.When it comes to seasoning, freshest of ingredients are used to complement flavours of the ramen bowl. “The ingredients depend on the type of ramen you are making, some of the toppings are scallions, edamame (beans), ajitama (soft boiled egg marinated in soy), garlic (fried or raw), chopped onions (fried or raw), bok choy , among others. You can even add caviar and lobster to a ramen if you like,” suggests Alagh.RecipeTantamenIngredients 30ml - Sesame paste 40ml- Soy sauce 10ml- sesame oil 20ml- Chilli Oil (add red chillies and chilli powder to some oil and cook on low.

27-07-2021||Delhi||The other side of honey||Known as one of nature’s greatest healers, honey has been used as a home remedy for many years. And with the onset of a pandemic, it has become a favourite for natural therapy, like many other organic products. “I highly recommend honey in my daily diet. I have been consuming honey from a long time now and its been a routine. I highly recommend honey to my clients unless they are diabetic or are prone to any allergy,” says Hasti Singh, fitness coach from Hasti Transformations.While it is often used as a substitute for sweeteners, one should be aware of its risks too. The first step to understanding honey and its properties better is identifying an unadulterated batch of the product. “It is a combination of fructose and glucose. Glucose tends to freeze in cold and dry environments, or when kept in the refrigerator. It is the most basic characteristic of pure and raw honey. Pure raw honey also contains pollens and has a slightly thick inconsistent texture,” says Prriti Paayal, who sources honey from the Himalayas for her range of organic products, Ishwarii. While the pandemic popularised the consumption of honey further, believing that it will not harm even in excess is a myth. “It has extra calories than table sugar. Excess consumption might affect blood sugar levels and weight gain,” says Rakshita Mehra, dietician. According to ayurvedic texts, 30-35 grams of honey should be taken during the day and 25-30 grams at night, informs Preeti Seth, nutritionist. “Do not take honey in large quantities at once. Take one teaspoon of honey two or three times a day. Honey is best consumed with hot tea or milk. When you consume honey, keep it in your mouth for some time and do not swallow it immediately. Over and excess of honey can upset your stomach,” adds Seth. Honey is also known for its therapeutic role in the prevention and treatment of many diseases due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. But, it is not for everyone. “Honey is unsafe for infants and young children under 12 months of age due to the chance of botulism poisoning. Also, honey should not be consumed by people with pollen allergies,” advises Garima Goyal, dietician.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/the-other-side-of-honey-101627361831063.html

HCWs (health care workers) had marginally higher seropositivity as compared to Bihar’s cumulative seropositivity of 22.41% among the general population in the state’s six sample districts,” said an official.Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Prabhat Kumar Singh said the difference in seropositivity is higher this time because HCWs were vaccinated first. “They have had increased exposure to Covid-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic.. as a result, many of our healthcare workers were infected, leading to the formation of natural antibodies,” he said. “Seropositivity of 91.45% is very good for healthcare workers. Their vaccination coverage has also been good. This means most health care workers are protected either through vaccination or after infection. Given the sample size and area covered, seropositivity of 73% among general population indicates that Bihar is moving closer towards developing herd immunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/healthcare-workers-in-bihar-s-buxar-report-94-1-seropositivity-101627361330246.html
27-07-2021||Lucknow||UP gives interest-free loans to women SHGs to buy vehicles, generate income||The UP government is providing interest-free loans to women’s self-help groups (SHGs) in rural areas for the purchase of four- and three-wheelers to generate employment under the Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY). “The target is to provide 400 vehicles – goods/passenger carriers, mini four-wheelers and e-rickshaws. SHGs across the state have already purchased 265 vehicles under the scheme,” said Bhanu Chandra Goswami, managing director, Uttar Pradesh State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM).Many SHGs are using these vehicles to earn by ferrying food under the government’s nutrition mission.UPSRLM has been awarded a gold medal for this scheme, a government spokesperson said. So far, nearly ₹18 crore has been given to members of selected SHGs under AGEY. Under the scheme, a maximum of ₹6.5 lakh without any interest can be provided for a four-wheel vehicle and a maximum of ₹1.5 lakh for an e-rickshaw.A beneficiary is mandated to return the loan amount in 72 instalments in six years and it is up to her to drive the vehicle herself or hire a driver.The scheme gets extended to another SHG member once a beneficiary returns the loan amount. To be eligible for the scheme, it is necessary that the member of the group has been associated with the mission for at least two years and has taken the benefit of other principal funds from the mission.Goswami said the scheme has been implemented in 73 blocks of 34 districts of the state and this year, vehicles will be distributed in 120 blocks of 50 districts.“Rural areas benefit from AGEY in numerous ways. It provides employment to the women of SHGs. It also increases the average income by at least ₹8,000 per month. Moreover, under the plan, those routes and tasks are selected where there is a need for such vehicles. So it provides mobility. Loans are given for at least eight-seater vehicles such as Winger, Bolero, Tata Magic, Omni etc,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-gives-interest-free-loans-to-women-shgs-to-buy-vehicles-generate-income-101627359104355.html
27-07-2021||Lucknow||Lack of junior engineers in UP sub stations affects power supply||Lucknow’s electricity supply is hit due to a shortage of staff and technical manpower at nearly half of the power substations in Uttar Pradesh’s capital. The response time to attend any complaint lodged by a consumer is longer than usual because some of these power substations don’t even have a full-time junior engineer (JE). At many substations, contractors are running the show, according to officials of the Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA).They said that over 60 substations of the 140 in Lucknow don’t have a full-time junior engineer, which means that around 50 junior engineers are overseeing more than two substations each.Also Read | Trillion-dollar economy goal: 13 months on, Uttar Pradesh still weighing its options“There are only 79 junior engineers working in various substations of LESA,” said an office-bearer of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited JE Association. “JEs are soft targets for everyone but they are supposed to work 24X7. They are supposed to attend to every fault in the lines, inside the power substation, ensure proper collection of bills etc. Can you imagine there are some junior engineers who are looking after supply of more than three sub stations? Despite that, JEs are suspended for every little thing that goes wrong,” the office-bearer added.Meanwhile, chief engineer (Cis Gomti zone) Madhukar Verma said, “We are aware of this problem and officials are trying to fill the vacant posts . I have also written to the officials concerned about the need for junior engineers in the department for better power supply.”“All our engineers are working overtime to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the city. They are the ones who are always under stress. If there is a power failure, a JE has to give an explanation,” Verma added.However, Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Varma said, “According to the data available, there is shortage of more than 1,050 junior engineers and other technical manpower in Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. We have written a number of times for the appointment of junior engineers in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lack-of-junior-engineers-in-up-sub-stations-affects-power-supply-101627358804411.html
27-07-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee to meet PM Narendra Modi today||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been in Delhi since Monday, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday at 4pm. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief is also likely to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday. “Banerjee is scheduled to meet Modi today [Tuesday] at 4pm. She is also scheduled to meet some senior Congress leaders, including Kamal Nath and Anand Sharma. On Wednesday, she is likely to meet Sonia Gandhi,” said a senior TMC leader. The TMC leader also said that this would be the first proper meeting between Modi and Banerjee after the party returned to power in West Bengal for the third consecutive time. The two leaders had met for a brief 15 minutes in the aftermath of Cyclone Yaas when Modi held a review meeting. Banerjee just handed over a report of the damage inflicted by the cyclone. The Centre-state relations took a nosedive after the Centre recalled Alapan Bandyopadhyay, then chief secretary of the state, for skipping the PM’s review meeting. Also Read | Lawyers protest Calcutta HC chief justice’s decision to reassign case“Banerjee could raise a range of issues, starting from hike in fuel prices, shortage in supply of vaccines and the Central funds that are due,” said a TMC leader. Tuesday’s meeting between Modi and Banerjee is being held at a time when the Parliament is rocked by the Pegasus surveillanceware issue and the sessions are being adjourned repeatedly. On Monday, West Bengal ordered an inquiry into the Pegasus issue, becoming the first state to do so. “West Bengal is suffering from multiple issues, including post-poll violence, fake vaccines and imposters. She has gone to Delhi to take a break and relax. I heard that she is also going to meet the PM. May be she wants the PM’s help as she is not being able to run the government. They also need to make a pact with the Congress for 2024,” Dilip Ghosh, Bharatiya Janata Party president in West Bengal, told media persons. With the monsoon session going on, Banerjee is also likely to visit the Parliament and is expected to meet several political leaders during her stay in the national Capital. The list may include Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “I will also try to meet the President. Several political leaders have requested that they want to meet me. I will try to adjust and accommodate as far as possible in two to three days,” Banerjee had earlier said. This meeting with heads of political parties becomes all the more important because Banerjee is keen to see the TMC play a decisive role in the next Lok Sabha polls. On July 21, when the TMC was observing Martyr’s Day, the party’s flagship programme, leaders of regional parties assembled at the Constitution Club of India in New Delhi to listen to Banerjee’s speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-to-meet-pm-narendra-modi-today-101627358324654.html

The 31 people still missing will be declared dead following due process, she said.The village, in Mahad taluka of Raigad district, was flattened out after a portion of a hillock collapsed after heavy rainfall burying several houses last Thursday.The operations to search for the 31 missing people have been officially called off, Chaudhari said, respecting the sentiments of the survivors and relatives of the missing people.Inter-state travel has been restored in some areas as the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway reopened for vehicular traffic near Kolhapur in Maharashtra on Monday after remaining shut for the last four days due to water-logging caused by heavy rains and floods in adjoining areas, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rainfall-likely-in-maharashtra-for-next-3-days-death-toll-rises-to-192-101627352204382.html
27-07-2021||Mumbai||Pornography case: Bombay high court to hear Raj Kundra’s bail plea today||The Bombay high court will hear on Tuesday the petition filed by actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra, challenging is police custody and seeking bail. On July 20, a metropolitan magistrate court remanded Kundra to police custody in connection with the alleged pornography racket.The police sought remand on the grounds of suspicion that Kundra may have used the money earned in the pornography racket for online betting and hence, they needed to interrogate him with regards to the financial transaction between him and two banks.Kundra’s police custody which expired on July 23 was extended by a metropolitan magistrate till July 27. Kundra’s petition, filed through Parinam Law Associates, pointed out that after the alleged incident of creating and publishing pornographic content came to light, a number of people were arrested in connection with the case and later released on bail. The petition states that crime branch officials visited his office on July 19 and after conducting a search, called him to their Byculla office on the pretext of recording his statement. However, he was arrested when he reached there. Referring to the arrest, the petition states that the mode in which he was arrested violated the procedure laid down under Section 41A of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) which mandates that the police have to issue a proper notice to the accused before arresting him. The petition states that as the law was violated, an application was made before the magistrate court opposing his detention. However when the remand application of the police came up before the magistrate, he did not consider Kundra’s application and granted remand till July 23. The petition adds that while there are clear orders of the Supreme Court against arresting and detaining persons against whom offences are registered with punishment of less than seven years in light of the Covid situation, the magistrate remanded him to custody. Kundra’s petition states that as the cumulative punishment for the offences that he has been booked for is less than seven years, the magistrate had erred in allowing his police remand and hence the remand order should be quashed and he should be released. The petition will come up for hearing after it is numbered and its circulation is granted. On July 20, Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said through a statement that Kundra and 10 other people were arrested for their alleged involvement in the creation of porn films and publishing them through mobile apps. Nagrale said there was sufficient evidence that Kundra may be the key conspirator and there was sufficient evidence regarding that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pornography-case-bombay-high-court-to-hear-raj-kundra-s-bail-plea-today-101627356464224.html

At least 50 policemen and civilians were also injured in clashes.Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana earlier accused Assam Police of entering his state’s territory.In response, an Assam government statement said, “In another breach of existing agreements and the existing status quo, Mizoram began constructing a road towards Rengti Basti in Assam, destroying the Inner Line Reserve Forest in Lailapur area. Simultaneously, the Mizoram side also set up a new armed camp on a hillock next to the camp of the neutral force, CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force), in the same vicinity.”Also Read | Assam, Mizoram CMs spar on Twitter over border clashes; Amit Shah intervenesIt added a team of Assam’s administrative and police officers visited the area on Monday morning to urge the Mizoram side not to “disturb the status quo” in an attempt to resolve matters.“However, they were surrounded and attacked by a mob of miscreants from the Mizoram side, which was visibly supported by the Mizoram Police. The aggressive behaviour and posture of this mob along with the fact that they were brandishing weapons and wearing helmets is clearly seen in all available video footage.”The statement added the mob threw stones on the Assamese team and destroyed three vehicles. “... the Mizoram Police simultaneously fired tear gas shells on the delegation,” it said.

It added when discussions were underway, firing started from the Mizoram side.“Even while SP (superintendent of police), Kolasib (Mizoram) was in talks with the Assam officers, the Mizoram Police opened fire on the Assam officials and civilians, who had by then gathered there, from two dominating high features with automatic weapons including LMGs.”The statement said Assam is committed to maintaining cordial relations and requested Mizoram to restrain its people and police personnel from “indulging in wanton violence” and work towards restoring peace.Lalchamliana earlier accused 200 Assam police personnel of damaging vehicles and arson. “Upon learning of the arson committed by Assam Police, residents of Vairengte town, Kolasib district proceeded to the site to inquire. These unarmed civilians were assaulted by Assam Police by lathi charging them and firing tear gas, thereby causing injuries to several civilians.”Lalchamliana said the confrontation continued and a volley of tear gas canisters and grenades were launched at Mizoram Police followed by firing from the Assam side. “Mizoram Police responded spontaneously by firing back at Assam Police.”The clashes came two days after chief ministers of the two states discussed the border dispute in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah in Shillong.Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and his Assam counterpart, Himanta Biswa Sarma, blamed each other for the border clashes. Shah later spoke to the two and the two states agreed to maintain the status quo.Mizoram was a part of Assam till 1972 when it was granted union territory status.

27-07-2021||Mumbai||At 61, Maharashtra CM Uddhav braces for challenges||In 2019, Uddhav Thackeray, who turns 61 today, was termed an accidental chief minister and perceived as a dynast in politics. However, in the past one-and-a-half years, the Maharashtra CM has come out of the shadows of his charismatic father Bal Thackeray as the Shiv Sena chief, and created his own identity as the CM.As he completes 20 months in office, Thackeray has earned appreciation over handling the Covid situation better than some other states, headed a tricky alliance of three parties that come from different ideological backgrounds without losing its control and has been dealing with Central government led by a party which has not forgiven him for ditching its alliance to form a government with its political rivals.Political analysts pointed out that Thackeray began to reshape his party since 2014, when he got fought the Assembly polls solo against the BJP amid the ‘Modi wave’. In chalking out his party’s path for survival, Thackeray created his distinct voice and identity in state politics. In 2019, he chose to snap ties with the BJP and formed an alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, something his father would have never done. Further, he took up the job of chief minister, again something which his father chose to never do.Four months into his chief ministership, Thackeray was facing a health crisis. With no administrative experience at any level, Thackeray surrounded himself with the right advisors and set up teams of health experts. His handling of the pandemic in Maharashtra – the most-affected state in India – has earned him the acceptance, although there has also been criticism of the high number of Covid cases in the state.Surendra Jondhale, political analyst, said Thackeray never emulated his father or tried to match up to his cousin Raj Thackeray, who has charisma and ability to captivate people with fiery speeches similar to the Sena patriarch. “Thackeray did not have the charisma, nor did he try to copy his father. He remained true to his nature and it has paid off. He is popular due to his state addresses. People consider him as their family member,” he said.Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “Had he followed Bal Thackeray’s policies, he would have not snapped alliance with the BJP and formed an alliance with the Congress-NCP.”Jondhale said Thackeray senior “lacked pragmatism”. “Bal Thackeray’s pragmatism was restricted to political opportunism. But Thackeray has displayed realistic approach in taking his party forward.”Thackeray, who was questioned over his ability to lead the state as he did not have any administrative experience, has managed to largely contain two waves of Covid infections. Jondhale said he has learnt the ropes of administration, while Desai said, “These challenges – Covid, cyclones and floods – became his shield to counter political opponents.”Politically, Thackeray has also managed to keep the ‘unnatural’ alliance going well, but not without its share of squabbling. Maharashtra Congress leadership has created unease within the MVA after state unit chief Nana Patole said the Congress will go solo in local polls as well as the state elections. The CM took up the matter with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Thackeray has the backing and guidance of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, who has emerged as troubleshooter for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi in its time of crisis.However, Thackeray has ensured that he doesn’t seem like a ceremonial CM, acting merely on the direction of Pawar to keep the government intact. Despite pressure from alliance partners and opposition to ease the restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19, Thackeray is seen to be cautious in his approach to give relaxations, including allowing general public to use local trains in Mumbai, opening malls and multiplexes, etc, even as many other states have relaxed the restrictions.He is maintaining a balance in his attacks on the Centre. Even when he joined hands with the Congress-NCP, he maintained cordial relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which helped him secure a seat in the Maharashtra Legislative Council to keep his chief ministership unhindered. The attacks are, however, diverted through Sena mouthpiece Saamana.The Sena that had the charisma of Bal Thackeray, who fashioned himself as the messiah of Marathi-speaking people, has found a new mascot in Thackeray to take the legacy forward.A senior Sena leader said, “Ever since he was chosen to lead the Shiv Sena in the early 2000s, people within the party, political opponents, the media, etc. all painted him incapable of taking the Shiv Sena forward. It was said he was no match to Balasaheb’s oratory, he is not as aggressive as Raj [who was still with Sena till 2005]. But Uddhav ji proved everybody wrong. Under his leadership, we have grown and we will continue to grow. Balasaheb and our party’s core identity – Hindutva and Marathi agenda-- are the roots of our large tree; our branches are now spreading under Uddhav ji’s leadership as the CM and Sena chief,” the leader said, requesting anonymity.Amid the praise, his style of functioning has been questioned and criticised from various quarters. Thackeray is known to start his meetings post noon and for limited hours. Party insiders said that Thackeray has an elaborate ritual in the morning of yoga and exercise which he does not sacrifice. The opposition has been critical of the CM saying he operates out of Varsha, the official residence of CM. He is also criticised of not going to Mantralaya or have any visits to review Covid handling. However, Thackeray has made some visits in Pune and north Maharashtra to see the handling of the pandemic. Following the cyclone and flooding, he visited Konkan region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-61-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-braces-for-challenges-101627354628293.html

The cab driver arrived and asked me for my drop location. I had opened the door and was about to board the car when the driver started to drive away saying he could not drop me. I was dragged for around a kilometre but he did not stop and I fell on the road. A speeding Pajero SUV ran over me,” Yadav said.As of Monday evening, only the cab driver was traced.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “Crime teams are investigating the case and have identified the Uber driver, but he is yet to be arrested. The other driver, who was behind the wheels of the Pajero, is not identified but they are scanning CCTV footage and the SUV will be identified soon.”Amit Kumar, station house officer of Sector 56 police station, said that they are investigating the identity of both the drivers and are scanning CCTV footage from the area of the incident. “The victim has undergone surgeries and is out of danger. A case could not be registered earlier as he was not fit to give a statement. We are questioning a few people who were at the spot,” he said.Yadav said that he was heading back to his lodging after meeting a few friends for dinner when the incident took place. His friends informed the police control room, after which a police team reached the hospital.Yadav alleged that the driver of the SUV was drunk and was driving in reverse. “I was screaming in pain but he did not pay any heed to it. My friends who were running behind me shouted at him to stop but he ran over me three times and fled the spot,” he said.A police officer said they suspect that the cab driver tried to drive away, without realising that Yadav was halfway in, but later fled the spot.A spokesperson for Uber, the cab aggregator app used by Yadav, said, “Safety is a top priority at Uber. This is an unfortunate incident and we have removed the driver’s access to the Uber app following the rider’s complaint. We stand ready to assist the law enforcement authorities in their investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-suffers-multiple-fractures-after-falling-off-cab-being-run-over-by-suv-101627339601553.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Second coming: Delhi works to resurrect 22 native plant species||The Peelu or the Toothbrush tree was a common sight in Delhi four decades ago. The bushy tree, which grows to a height of around 8-10 feet with scabrous and cracked branches, would be used as an alternative to modern-day toothbrushes and its small red fruits were a favourite among animals and birds. But years of focus on ornamental trees that look good but are not native to Delhi, the march of invasive species, and the pressures of population and development have taken their toll. It is among at least 22 native species of trees that are on the verge of disappearing from the Capital’s landscape according to forest department officials.But a five-month old nursery in Delhi’s only wildlife sanctuary could change that.Delhi’s forest department is working with the Bombay Natural History Society to resurrect at least 22 native plant species that are on the verge of disappearing from Delhi’s landscape, senior officials said.Sohail Madan, centre manager of BNHS at Delhi’s Asola Bhati Wildlife Sanctuary said that the efforts to “bring back Delhi’s native trees” first started around five years ago with the Delhi seed bank project. But the initiative acquired fresh momentum in March when the Delhi forest department inaugurated a nursery inside the sanctuary, which is managed by BNHS.The endangered native tree varieties will be grown in the nursery, and once ready, planted in the sanctuary itself. The species include Adusa (Malabar Nut), Barna (Three-leaf Caper), Bistendu (Bombay Ebony), Dhau (Axle Wood Tree), Goya Khair (Sickle Bush), Gangeti (White Crossberry), Guggal (Indian Bdellium), Gunja (Indian Ash Tree), Inderjao (Indrajao), Indrokh (Roundleaf Axlewood), Jaal (Large Toothbrush Tree), Jungli Moringa (Konkan Moringa) and Kankera (Red Spike Thorn).“All this started when we were working on creating butterfly parks in the city. To help increase the number of butterflies you have to plant a lot of native plant species so that they can feed on them. If you get a plant from say South America, the butterfly will not be able to identify it. So, when we started off with it, we realised that the availability of native plant species was a big problem,” Madan explained.He said that over the past few months, the nursery has become home to around 100 plant species, including at least 22 that were once native to the national capital, but which are rarely seen now.Pradip Krishen, author and tree expert, said that native trees are not only easy to grow and maintain, it also contributes towards improving a city’s ecology. Some of the trees that are on the forest department’s list have also been featured in Krishen’s book, ‘Trees of Delhi’, a guide to over 250 native tree species of Delhi.“It is very important, especially in a city like Delhi, to plant the right varieties of trees. Over the years, our greening agencies have strayed away from natives and only focused on foreign, pretty-looking varieties. That needs to change, and in some areas, it is changing,” Krishen said.Amit Anand, deputy conservator forests (south division), added that the department is trying to create a seed bank for these plants in Asola.“Considering that there is a shortage of such plants here, the seeds were procured from neighbouring states with similar soil make and landscape, where these plants were available in abundance. Once these saplings attain a certain height, we can plant them in the sanctuary. This is being done to ensure that there is a high chance of their survival. Compared to young saplings, if plants have attained a certain height, it is easier for them to survive,” Anand explained.He said that if successful, these saplings can be made available in other government nurseries in the city.Officials said that years of apathy and mindless plantation drives have resulted in these native species reaching the verge of disappearance. For decades, road-owning agencies in Delhi focused on ornamental plants to line roads, parks and other public places, decreasing the number of natives.Other reasons for their reducing numbers are over-exploitation for traditional and medicinal uses and invasive species such as Vilaiti Kikar or mesquite.“This project has a long-term vision. In a few more years we will have a deep database on all such types of trees and we will be able to regenerate the genetic stock from the native Aravalli. These varieties are native and will not require much care and beyond a point, will start multiplying,” Madan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/second-coming-delhi-works-to-resurrect-22-native-plant-species-101627338416994.html
27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to get 2.17 lakh vaccine doses in August||The central government on Monday allocated 2,17,200 vaccine doses for Chandigarh for the month of August, which the UT health department feels would be enough to vaccinate the city’s eligible population with at least the first dose by mid-August.Of the total, around 1,69,160 vaccine doses will be given to the government sector for free inoculation while private hospitals in the city can purchase up to 48,040 doses in the coming month.According to the latest electoral list, around 7.1 lakh people are eligible to be jabbed in Chandigarh of which 83% have so far, received the first dose while 25% have been fully vaccinated. The UT health department aims to vaccinate the entire eligible population, with at least the first dose, by August 15. For the remaining days of July, the UT health department is left with 57,250 doses in government vaccination centres. Besides, private hospitals are having a total of 36,740 doses with them, for paid inoculation. On an average, the city is vaccinating 9,000 to 10,000 beneficiaries every day, with the count crossing the 10,000-mark on some days.If it goes with the same pace, the UT health department may fall short of doses in the last couple of days in July.2.27 lakh doses administered in July From July 1 to July 26, the UT health department administered 2,27,553 vaccine doses, including the first and second doses, to eligible beneficiaries. Initially, the central government had allocated only two lakh doses for Chandigarh for the month of July, of which 50,000 were meant to be used in private hospitals.Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director health services, Chandigarh, said, “The Centre regularly reviews the vaccination figures, and sends a fresh stock as soon as vaccine availability starts to go down. We have enough vaccine doses available in government and private hospitals and a fresh stock will be received soon. The vaccines will be enough to meet the vaccination target in the set deadline.”Door-to-door vaccination picking up paceDr Kang further added that the UT health department has got two more mini-buses, which are going to be converted into vaccination buses to enter Chandigarh’s colonies.“People often feel hesitant to enter ambulances for inoculation. To provide better facilities to public, we had converted two AC-buses into vaccination buses and now, two more mini-buses will be used for the same purpose. We are vaccinating around 1,000 people daily as part of the door-to-door vaccination drive,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-get-2-17-lakh-vaccine-doses-in-august-101627333241657.html

After retiring from athletics, he played golf regularly, mostly at the Chandigarh Golf Club.Milkha died of post Covid complications on June 19 at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.On the constitution of the trophy in Milkha’s memory, CGC president Ravibir Singh Grewal said “It will be a club-organised tournament. Milkha Singh was an integral part of the club; he used to play here almost every day. He was a national legend. We have instituted the trophy to honour his memory and long association with the club.”The club plans to have it as an annual event. “We are planning to organise the event in the second week of August this year. Tournament details will be finalised soon.”Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, who has agreed to be part of the event and present the trophy, said, “Milkha Singh loved the sport and had been playing golf regularly for the last 40 years.”Keeping the legacy alive Welcoming CGC’s decision, Milkha’s son and professional golfer Jeev Milkha Singh, said, “It is a very proud moment for the Milkha family that Chandigarh Golf Club is honouring him. We are grateful to the Club and the committee for keeping the legacy of Milkha Singh alive.”“After he retired from athletics, his passion was golf. He used to play for fun. It was the best exercise for him and kept him going. He used to be with his friends and was the happiest at the golf course. He had a great four-ball play with RS Mann, Randeep Nabha, Alamgir and others. There were five to six people with whom he used to play regularly. He had a great love for the game,” said Jeev. With several national and international golf trophies under his belt, Jeev remembers, “Dad gave tips all the time. In fact, mom and dad used to watch all golf tournaments on television. They used to talk and discuss with me also. It was one of the finest topics in our house.”They used to play golf at the Chandigarh Golf Club but on days when it was closed, they would go to Panchkula or Chandimandir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-golf-club-institutes-trophy-in-memory-of-legendry-sprinter-milkha-singh-101627333061677.html

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Estate Office ready to auction residential, commercial, institutional plots||With the long stalemate between the UT Estate Office (EO) and the UT engineering department over clearing of vegetation from vacant EO plots finally getting resolved, the decks have been cleared for EO to auction residential, commercial and institutional properties.“We are planning to auction around 10 residential properties. In addition, there will be commercial and institutional sites on offer,” said Manish Lohan, assistant estate officer.Last year, the Estate Office had planned to auction properties in December, but there was heavy vegetation in the plots. The EO had then written to the horticulture wing of the engineering department to clear trees and shrubs from the plots so that these could be offered free of all types of encumbrances.In response, the horticulture wing had asked the EO to plant trees in lieu of the trees cut. For every tree cut, the EO had to plant four trees on its own land in some other location, the horticulture wing had stated.Meanwhile, the EO officials reportedly contended that the department did not have vacant land of its own except for residential or commercial plots located in the various developed sectors of the city.After nearly 10 months of the back and forth, the UT engineering department decided to clear the vegetation. CB Ojha, UT chief engineer, said, “We got the approval to cut the trees recently and we have started the removal of vegetation.”Last auction had fetched doubleThe department had conducted its last auction in November 2019 when all of the residential properties on offer were sold, even though there were no takers for commercial and industrial plots. The department had generated a revenue close to ₹44 crore from the auction of 11 residential properties with a total reserve price of ₹27 crore.A 1,014-square-yard (about 2 kanal) plot in Sector 33 had fetched ₹15.3 crore against a reserve price of ₹7.53 crore. All residential properties were in the southern sectors: a built-up house on a 4-marla plot in Sector 32-A went for ₹1.68 crore against a reserve price of ₹1 crore; remaining plots, priced between ₹1.25 crore and ₹7.53 crore, were in Sectors 33, 35, 37, 38, and 40.Recently, the Chandigarh Housing Board auction of residential freehold dwelling units had also received a positive response indicating an upward trend in the city’s real estate market.“The auction of properties is a crucial revenue generation option for the administration. Last year, after expenditure cuts were imposed by the Centre on administration spending, it was emphasised that all UT departments should improve their revenues. But, while the CHB could successfully auction its properties, the estate office has been stuck up in red-tapism,” said a UT official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-estate-office-ready-to-auction-residential-commercial-institutional-plots-101627332402849.html

The gate was finally opened more than two hours later.”“This is a dictatorial act by the police. I had to request SSP Kuldeep Chahal, who ordered the SHO to open the gates of the societies and let residents move about,” said another Congress leader Sandeep Bhardwaj, who is also a resident of the sector.Due to the barricading, residents had to take a detour to reach their homes. “Maids in our society said they couldn’t come as police had blocked the roads,” said a resident of Universal Society, who didn’t wish to be named.Police not taking any chancesAs many as 200 cops from the entire sub-division were deployed on Monday to ensure that no law and order situation arises. Though no shops were closed, the venue was completely cordoned off.After the July 17 attack, allegedly by anti-farm laws protesters, the police were not taking any chances, ensuring heavy deployment at functions involving the mayor or Sanjay Tandon.Even earlier on July 20, a section of Kajheri village was cordoned off for securing an event attended by the mayor. Similarly on July 19, when Sharma visited Sector 45 to inaugurate a couple of civic projects, the road starting from the Government Model School of Sector 45, right next to the traffic light-point of Sector 44/45, was blocked and barricaded by the Chandigarh Police and even the shops in the area were closed.The UT police on July 24, too, had deployed around 900 personnel for preventing any law and order situation during four functions attended by senior BJP leader Sanjay Tandon at a government school in Khuda Ali Sher village, at the government school in Sector 40A, in Sector 29, and at Daria village.“We had closed unauthorised entry to the area in the wake of the programme. The movement of residents was allowed through another gate to ensure no untoward incident is reported,” said the station house officer of Sector 49, Surinder Singh.The police had diverted traffic and even blocked the entry from the side of the Motor Market, where the mayor’s vehicle was attacked on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-heavy-police-deployment-barricading-leave-sector-48-residents-harried-101627332401725.html

Grewal is to submit a report within 15 days.On July 11, Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari had raised the issue of ‘real estate mafia’ in the district and assured that he would take up the matter with chief minister Amarinder Singh, following which Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had swung into action and asked the SSP to register FIRs against erring builders.On July 15, police had registered a case against 48 builders, who had developed unauthorised residential colonies at Jhampur, Badmajra and Behlolpur villages of Kharar area. The case was registered under Section 36(1) of the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA). There are around 15 illegal colonies that have come up without the permission of GMADA. No change of land use (CLU) has been carried out here and most of these colonies have come up on agricultural land.SSP Satinder Singh said, “We will not tolerate any illegal activity by any builder. We have formed a SIT, and on the basis of its report, strict action will be taken against the erring builders.” Apart from Grewal, the SIT will have two DSPs — Manjeet Singh and Joginder Pal Singh—as its members.While raising the issue with GMADA, MP Tewari said people are losing their hard-earned money to such builders. A senior official of GMADA said, “We conduct anti-encroachment drives regularly and have demolished several structures. In most cases, it was found that the builders offer land at low rates, due to which people from low-income groups get interested in the scheme. They pay ₹5 to 7 lakh to the builder for a 100 square yard plot and build their houses on it, and ultimately get caught in the nexus.”Committee was formed last year tooIn October last year, Mohali deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan constituted a five-member committee to redress the grievances of the public against promoters/builders for non-provision of basic amenities. The committee was headed by Mohali additional deputy commissioner (general) and had a superintendent of police (designated by the SSP), GMADA additional chief administrator, and municipal commissioner/EOs as its members. The assistant commissioner (grievances) was the member secretary. The committee, however, could not meet due to the prevailing pandemic situation.Stating that various real-estate projects of residential and commercial nature have come up over the last few years in the district, the DC urged residents to come forward and lodge complaints against erring builders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sit-formed-to-probe-real-estate-mafia-in-mohali-101627331981755.html

The parents expressed their reluctance during the parent-teacher meetings organised by the government schools on Monday. The principals stated that many parents are not ready to send their children to school, fearing that their wards may catch the infection as none of them are vaccinated. Parents said that during the second Covid wave, many people lost their near and dear ones, and the third wave is expected in September, so they want their children to attend classes online from the safety of their homes.During the PTMs, parents reached schools with their wards during the time slots allotted to them. At many government schools, only those who were wearing masks were given entry. In the meeting, school teachers informed the parents about the performance of their children in the tests that were held in July, and their preparation for the National Achievement Survey. Many teachers said that a majority of the students had started working amid the Covid-19 pandemic to support their families financially and now are unwilling to attend offline classes.Navdeep Romana, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Multipurpose, said, “We had asked the parents to submit written consent for offline classes. Only 40% of them have shown willingness to send their children to attend the same. We have also asked the parents to ensure that their wards wear masks and attend the classes as per the schedule sent to them by their respective class teachers.”At Government Senior Secondary School, Gill (Girls), only 50% of parents turned up to attend the PTM on Monday.Smriti Bhargav, the principal, said, “Parents are reluctant to send their wards to school. Many of them have refused to sign the consent form. During the parent-teacher meeting, I informed the parents that we are taking all safety precautions in the school and that the students should be motivated to revise concepts daily to improve their performance in the upcoming exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-parents-reluctant-to-send-wards-to-school-101627331261441.html

The 40 million-litres-per-day (MLD) capacity treatment plant will be made functional in a phased manner. Trials are expected to begin next week. Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials and representatives of the dyeing industry inspected the ongoing work on Monday.The project to setup the plant was completed last year, however, the project hit a snag after the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) failed to provide a power connection, saying that the project will overload the power substation. While reviewing the projects initiated to clean the Buddha Nullah, a seasonal rivulet that passes through Punjab’s most populous district, Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan had directed officials to ensure that the CETPs in the city were working by July 31.

All three youngsters had concrete plans for their future and were working hard to make their dreams come true. Trisha’s father Brijesh Saini of Delhi, said chills run down his spine when he thinks how her mother would react on seeing her daughter’s dead body. “They would talk on the phone everyday. Trisha wanted to be a scientist. She had come to Ludhiana one-and-a-half months ago for an internship at ICAR-Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET). She was career oriented and very hardworking.” Pahulpreet had just celebrated his 18th birthday last month.

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Judicial order for voice sample does not violate right to privacy: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that judicial order compelling a person to give voice sample does not violate right to privacy. The high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan upheld the additional sessions judge, SBS Nagar, decision of allowing the Vigilance Bureau to take voice samples of two accused for comparing with their recorded calls. The matter in court had been brought by two people working at Banga tehsil office. The accused, both typists, were allegedly collecting money for getting the sale deeds registered from the tehsildar and other revenue officials, vigilance bureau had told the court, adding that after taking approval, mobile phones used by the petitioners were tapped and later a case registered against them. The VB then sought permission from the trial court to take voice samples for comparison, which was allowed. This decision of the trial court was challenged in the high court, arguing that it was in violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India and infringes the right of privacy. Article 20(3) of the Constitution states that no person can be compelled to be a witness against himself. The high court observed that voice samples in a sense resemble fingerprints and handwriting. “The samples are collected after having permission in accordance with the law. The sample taken itself would not be an evidence, rather they are for comparing the evidence already collected,” the court said, adding that the infringement of the fundamental right to privacy cannot be raised to create a bubble to scuttle the investigation, nullifying the evidence collected by merely denying that the voice of the tapped phone calls is not of the petitioners and there being no comparables. “With the advancement of technology, the modes of communication are changing. To keep pace with the change, new technology is required to be used for collecting and comparing evidence. One method being tapping of communication devices but after compliance with the procedure laid down. It is in that context that taking of voice samples is necessitated,” the bench further observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/judicial-order-for-voice-sample-does-not-violate-right-to-privacy-hc-101627329761434.html

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal arms business: MP’s Sikligar community under police gaze||Police in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, in recent months, have arrested many members of the Sikligar Sikh community for manufacturing and providing arms and ammunition to anti-social elements, including gangsters in Punjab and even Maoists. Traditionally ironsmiths, the community that once earned praises and were called ‘patriots’ for providing weapons to the army of Tenth Sikh Guru Gobind Singh has gone astray since. A section of the community honed their skills and shifted from making farm tools and sharp-edged weapons to firearms, said police officers of Punjab and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta said MP has emerged as a hub of illegal firearms as in the past seven months, at least six people of the Sikligar community, settled in four districts of MP, have been arrested for supplying arms to criminals in Punjab. “In January, police arrested two Sikligar members from Khargone for supplying illegal .32 calibre country-made pistols and they informed that the kingpin of the gang was in contact with one Akashdeep Singh, the prime accused in the drone module busted by Punjab police in 2019,” said the DGP. Not only Punjab, but the MP Police, which recently arrested 10 sympathisers and suppliers of illegal weapons to Maoists, found magazine of AK 47 made by Sikligars from the house of one of the accused, Ghanshyam from Gondia in Maharashtra. Some of the Sikligars are wanted in more than six states. According to MP police, a section of Sikligars living in at least 40 villages of Khargone, Khandwa, Barwani, Burhanpur and Dhar districts manufacture illegal arms. “Earlier, they used traditional methods to make weapons but now they have set up lathe machines to make automatic guns. Not only in manufacturing, they have adopted technology in marketing the weapons through WhatsApp and YouTube channels. Despite regular raids, they are not ready to give up this work,” said HN Mishra, inspector general (IG) of police, Indore division. In July first week, Punjab Police arrested two brothers — Sweety Singh and Sumer Singh — from Umrethi village of Barwani for running a Youtube channel (Azad Group Munger) where they showcased guns and fixed deals. “This is a new modus operandi which we have seen for selling weapons,” said Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh, SSP, Kapurthala. Members from the community say the families ignored for years and many of them have also been implicated wrongly in criminal cases. There are about 35,000 Sikligars in Madhya Pradesh, according to the community leaders. They used to live in Punjab and Rajasthan initially, but after the Independence, arms manufacturing was declared illegal and many of them shifted to western Madhya Pradesh near the Narmada river for farming. “But they didn’t get the promised land and jobs. They were not able to live a respectful life,” said Gyani Dileep Singh, head of MP Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. MP Sikligar community vice-president Jitender Singh said, “I won’t deny the fact that some Sikligars have chosen the wrong path and in at least 40 villages, the illegal weapon business has flourished. The youth are mostly uneducated and have no land for farming. They can’t start a business as banks don’t give them loans.” “More than 400 people are either in jail or facing charges under the Arms Act. This is the fact which we are not shying away from accepting, but the reasons behind this should also be discussed,” he added. In 2003, then MP chief minister Uma Bharti promised to help the community through education and skill development, but nothing happened. MP home minister Narottam Mishra said, “We won’t allow anyone to malign the image of MP. It is a social problem and we have been making efforts to bring them in the mainstream for years. Now, we are doing strict planning to address this issue once and for all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-arms-business-mp-s-sikligar-community-under-police-gaze-101627329521505.html

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu asks defunct party cells to chalk out roadmap for revival||Newly appointed Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday asked the heads of party’s frontal organisations and various cells of the state unit to come back within 15 days with a roadmap for their revival ahead of the assembly polls early next year. Sidhu, who, along with four working presidents, held the first meeting with the heads of frontal organisations and chairpersons of all 35 departments and cells of the state Congress, asked them to outline the work they can do at grassroots levels and details of important issues that needed to be addressed before the state elections. “We have been asked to put all this in bullet points and then one-on-one meetings will be held for revival of the defunct set-ups for reaching out to people of different segments,” two party leaders present in the meeting said. The state president, who took charge of his assignment on Friday, gave these directions after some of them complained that their cells and departments were ignored and rendered defunct in the past four-and-a-half years. “The common grouse of several of them was that they had worked really hard before the state elections (2017) but then people from other parties were given positions or adjusted after the Congress formed the government. The state chief assured them that the hard work put in by them will not be ignored,” one of the persons quoted above said, pointing out that the meeting did not have any agenda. The marathon meeting at Punjab Congress Bhawan here lasted more than five hours and was attended by working presidents Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala, Kuljit Nagra and Pawan Goyal, Punjab Youth Congress chief Brinder Singh Dhillon, Punjab Mahila Congress president Mamta Dutta and National Students Union of India state president Akshay Sharma, among others. The state chief and four working presidents were appointed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on July 18 after a two-month-long tussle in the Punjab unit that saw Sidhu and chief minister Capt Amarinder publicly hurl accusations at each other. A party statement on the meeting said that Sidhu had detailed discussions with working presidents about rebuilding the organisation and strengthening the party further at the grassroots level. They also discussed with heads of all departments and cells of PPCC their working and steps needed for their revival, it added. Besides stressing on his “Jitega Punjab” mission and “Punjab model”, the new state chief also asked the party leaders about the perception among people about him, said sources. Gilzian said that at least one of them would be present at the party headquarters daily to meet party leaders and workers. Another suggestion discussed at the meeting was to visit the religious deras for their blessings, but no schedule has been firmed up. Sidhu also met the office staff of Punjab Congress Bhawan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-asks-defunct-party-cells-to-chalk-out-roadmap-for-revival-101627329041623.html

Amarinder assured a farmers’ delegation that he would soon meet Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari demanding revision in compensation for land. The farmers have rejected the meagre compensation awarded by the district revenue officers who have been designated as competent authority for land acquisitions (CALA). After meeting a delegation of the Road Kissan Sangarsh Committee in Chandigarh, the CM asked the financial commissioner (revenue) to issue detailed instructions not to credit the compensation amount into the accounts of farmers against their will. He also directed the director general of police (DGP) to ensure that the farmers’ land is not seized forcibly. The issue relates to 25,000 acre land in 15 districts across the state. The land is under process of acquisition for the project covering multiple expressways, viz. the Delhi- Amritsar-Katra, Ludhiana-Ropar, Bathinda-Dabwali, besides Jalandhar and Ludhiana bypass. The Road Kissan Sangarsh Committee delegation was led by state president Sukhdev Singh Dhillon. The CM directed his principal secretary to seek early appointment with Gadkari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-nhai-doesn-t-acquire-farmers-land-forcibly-for-road-projects-amarinder-to-dgp-101627328921786.html
27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-SIT head questions exclusion of dera chief’s name from new challan on Bargari sacrilege||Former inspector general of police (IGP) Ranbir Singh Khatra, who previously led the special investigation team (SIT) probing the Bargari sacrilege incident, on Monday questioned the incumbent SIT for allegedly excluding the name of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in the chargesheet that it filed in court recently. Addressing a meeting of representatives of Sikh organisations and intellectuals called by Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to discuss the sacrilege issue, Khatra said, “If it was a conspiracy, then who was the conspirator? The name of the dera chief was in the FIR number 63 registered for theft of Guru Granth Sahib’s holy saroop. The SIT has now submitted the challan in the FIR number 117 (pasting of derogatory posters) and 128 (scattering of pages of the holy saroop at Bargari village) and did not include the name of the sect head in list of the accused, even as the three FIRs are interlinked as per the court,” “I had nabbed the ones who executed the conspiracy. Now, the question is who will nab the conspirator,” he added.On a clarification given by the present SIT chief SPS Parmar (IGP) that the investigation is still underway, Khatra said, “It will be good if they are doing so”.He also targeted Moga-based brothers Rupinder Singh and Jaswinder Singh who were arrested on charges of the sacrilege in 2015, but released later, for their role in the episode.On the pending interrogation of the dera chief, the former DIG endorsed the version of the new SIT, saying there is no use of quizzing him until the dera’s three national committee members, who are key accused in this case, are arrested. “If we take the dera chief on remand without arresting the three wanted men, it will be a waste of time and as per rules we will not be able to secure his custody for the second time.” Giani Harpreet Singh and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Jagir Kaur also addressed the meeting. A resolution was also passed on checking frequent sacrilege incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exsit-head-questions-exclusion-of-dera-chief-s-name-from-new-challan-on-bargari-sacrilege-101627328863688.html

The Akali MPs, including Sukhbir, Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Rajya Sabha members Balwinder Singh Bhundar and Naresh Gujral, continued their protest outside Parliament, raising slogans against the three laws. Speaking to the media, the SAD chief said the SAD-BSP alliance had followed a pro-farmer agenda from the first day of the Parliament session and would continue to raise this issue for the remaining period. “We are committed to ensure justice for farmers of Punjab and other parts of the country. We also appeal to other political parties to unite to ensure the cause of the ‘annadaata’ is not weakened in any way,” he said. He condemned alleged attempts being made by the Centre to portray the farmers in a poor light by creating an impression that it was ready to hold talks but the unions were not coming forward for the same. He added, “It is strange as to why the Union government wants discussion on the farm laws which were completely rejected by the farmers of the country. The government is showing insensitivity towards the sufferings of the farmers by feigning ignorance about the human tragedy unfolding at the Delhi borders. More than 550 farmers have lost their lives participating in the ‘kisan andolan’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/make-joint-push-for-repeal-of-farm-laws-sukhbir-badal-to-opposition-parties-101627328862736.html

Prof Pushpinder Singh Gill, dean, external centres, said the Mehraj campus is likely to have a new post of director for an efficient administration. “A university panel found that the courses offered at CoEM were obsolete that had fewer takers for the past several years. Poor choice of academic courses led to a dismal response from students in southern Punjab. The management courses were discontinued within 2-3 years of starting the campus. Moreover, the centre administration was found inefficient that affected the academic environment,” said Gill.Campus in-charge Lakhwinder Singh Rakhra did not respond to phone calls and text messages. The campus was started in 2005 by then Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to provide better opportunities in the academically backward south Malwa belt. The panchayat of Mehraj, the ancestral place of Amarinder Singh, donated about 25-acre land to build the campus. The CoEM was offering 11 courses, including a master’s in computer application, two BTech programmes, three diplomas, BSc and lateral admissions in various courses.The campus has 17 faculty members, including 12 regular teachers.A faculty member said more than half of the 60 BTech seats remained vacant for the last several years. “Computer applications was the only sought after programme in which 30 seats each for a post-graduate degree and a diploma course were filled,” he added.Prof Gill said the new courses will be decided to meet the aspirations of students from southern Punjab. “The infrastructure of CoEM will be utilised for better academic programmes that open job opportunities for students. The faculty will be adjusted at Tapasavi Puran Dass Malwa College, the university’s constituent college, at the campus in adjoining Rampura Phul subdivision, and other institutes,” said Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/admissions-suspended-punjabi-varsity-s-mehraj-campus-to-start-new-courses-from-next-session-101627328861293.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: In search of Basant Lok past||It’s a small space but it doesn’t matter. You are stepping inside Delhi’s most eclectic bookstore. Here’s the owner poring over The New York Review of Books. Walk straight, reach the end and look left—loads of travel books. If you are into contemporary fiction, turn to the rotating shelf near the glass door. The poetry section lies… well, today it’s all a rubble of bricks if you peer through the shuttered grills. Fact & Fiction shut down years ago.Certain places can be revered not for what they have, but for what they had. That’s what makes an excursion to Basant Lok market so poignant. It is filled with the ghosts of its much-loved landmarks, whose existences, until some years ago, were taken for granted.Today, as the coronavirus pandemic deeply cuts through our lives and sensibilities, making the immediate past look profoundly distant, the older losses that unfolded a few years ago have turned into legends of an extraordinary past. This gives Basant Lok market the patina of a fairy tale.The area’s signature landmark is Priya cinema. No queue of cinema-goers waiting to enter the hulky edifice (theatres and multiplexes in the Capital reopened after 3 months with 50% occupancy from Monday).The broad passage that connected the market’s two plazas was dotted with a series of snack joints serving super-spicy momos and thukpas—you needed a napkin to wipe your nose continuously. They’re all gone. Metal benches lie where they stood.This market was also the site of India’s first TGIF—it is history. The country’s first McDonald’s opened here as well, and still exists. But the Om Book Shop, tucked near the burger place, is gone. It had steep stairs leading to a spacious basement stacked with thousands of books. The guard at the bottom of the stairs would always ask you to leave your bag with him.But back to Fact & Fiction. Bookseller Ajit Vikram Singh wouldn’t smile as you entered. He had the reputation of not being particularly friendly. “Most of my differences happen with customers who ill-treat the books,” he once explained. “A bookshop requires a certain amount of sanctity, and sometimes I have people rushing in with dripping ice cream cones.” His presence lingers on in Basant Lok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-search-of-basant-lok-past-101627328675990.html

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Nehru’s weakness was he wanted to be messenger of peace, says Maharashtra governor Koshyari||Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Monday criticised former Prime Minister the late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru saying his policies weakened the country. Except for the tenure of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the security of the country was neglected by previous governments, Koshyari said, at an event organized to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of ‘Kargil Vijay Diwas’ at Raj Bhavan.“I admire Pandit (Jawaharlal) Nehru, but he had the biggest weakness. He wanted to become a messenger of peace and release pigeons. His contribution towards the country is huge, but due to this weakness, the nation has become too weak and remained in the same position for a long period,” Koshyari remarked.He then alleged all successive governments at the Centre, led by the Congress, were weak and scared of pressure over national security. “Except for of Vajpayeeji’s (Atal Bihar Vajpayee) tenure, the focus of the previous governments towards national security was minimal. I remember Vajpayeeji conducted a nuclear test in 1998, which could have been conducted 20 years ago as our scientists were ready, but the previous governments were afraid of conducting the test. Many countries such as the United States, United Kingdom etc. imposed a ban after the test was conducted in 1998, but Vajpayeeji trusted the people of our country,” the governor claimed.The Congress slammed the governor, saying his comments are unfortunate and a distortion of reality. “Being a proponent of peace doesn’t mean being weak. If that is the case then former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who took Sada-e-Sarhad bus to Lahore (Pakistan), former deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, who visited the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who reached Lahore in an unscheduled visit to greet then Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif will also be called as weak,” said Ashok Chavan, state public works minister.He further said many institutions were merged under the leadership of Pandit Nehru after the country got independence. “Pandit Nehru also marked the beginning of the dream of a modern, scientific India. His contribution in building the infrastructure and deciding the foreign policy of the country under very adverse conditions is unforgettable,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nehrus-weakness-was-he-wanted-to-be-messenger-of-peace-says-maharashtra-governor-koshyari-101627327300453.html

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra grants Rs1.93 crore for fire safety measures at Bhandara hosp||Months after a fire at the Bhandara district hospital in Nagpur killed 10 babies in the sick newborn care unit (SNCU), the state health department has granted ₹1.93 crore for fire safety measures at the hospital. In January, a baby warmer caught fire due to a short-circuit, which spread to the whole outborn section at the hospital’s SNCU, where 17 newborns were admitted. Seven babies were rescued. Following the incident, several loopholes in the fire safety measures were identified during the inspection at the hospital. Some fire extinguishers were found expired, the emergency fire alarms were dysfunctional and the electric wiring of the hospital was faulty, among others. “The hospital didn’t even have luminous fire exit signs in case of a fire. Also, fire exits in many departments were either locked or turned into store rooms for unused furniture and machines. After inspection, we submitted a complete report to the public health department with the requirement amendments,” said a senior officer from the Nagpur health department. “We have accorded administrative approval and work will be done soon through the state PWD with the state budget. A government resolution (GR) regarding the same has been issued recently,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), government of Maharashtra. Additionally, the state has also granted ₹96.19 lakh for procuring essential equipment for the SNCU. “This amount was granted in January as all the equipment got destroyed in the fire. The process of repair is still underway,” said the officer. Following the incident, several officers, including district civil surgeon Dr Pramod Khandate, on-duty medical officer of the hospital Dr Archana Meshram, and nurse in-charge Jyoti Bharaskar were suspended. While additional civil surgeon Dr Sunita Bade was transferred, the contract of paediatrician Dr Stuti Ambade and two staff nurses – Smita Sanjay Ambil Duke and Shubhangi Sathavane – of the hospital were terminated. Although health activists have welcomed the move of the state government in revamping fire safety measures at the hospital, they criticised the officers for their negligence. “This is the story of all government hospitals, especially in rural areas. The hospitals run on skeletal staff and there is no mechanism to implement fire safety rules. The electric wires keep hanging from the roof, fire extinguishers are expired. In fact, staffers aren’t even trained how to handle fire extinguishers or rescue patients in case of a fire accident,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, founder of the non-government NGO—Doctors for you.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-grants-rs1-93-crore-for-fire-safety-measures-at-bhandara-hosp-101627327180375.html

State board students will be given preference over others at the time of admissions to FYJC colleges. A week after solving technical issues that had been plaguing the registration website, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) managed to smoothly launch https://cet.11thadmission.org.in/ on Monday at 3pm. “The site is working very smoothly, and we haven’t received a single complaint ever since the registration process commenced at 3pm on Monday. In order to control the flow of students, we have requested only state board students to finish registration on Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday onwards, all non-state board students can start the registration process,” said an official from MSBSHSE. He added that nearly 140,000 students who had already completed the registration process last week need not opt for registration again. Originally, registration for the optional CET exam for admissions to FYJC colleges was scheduled to take place between July 20 and Monday. As per the new schedule, students can complete the process of registration till August 2. This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch were given out based on students’ performance in Class 9 and Class 10. While the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) results were announced on July 16, the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced ICSE results on July 24. According to the circular released by the state board earlier this month, an optional CET exam based solely on SSC syllabus and consisting of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks will be conducted offline on August 21 from 11am to 1pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cet-registration-process-for-fyjc-seats-starts-no-glitch-reported-101627327120437.html

Thirty-one more deaths were reported in Raigad after a few more bodies were recovered from the landslide site in Taliye village on Monday, taking the toll in the district to 95. Also, the search operation for the 31 people missing in Taliye was called off on Monday, officials said. Raigad district collector Nidhi Chaudhari said that those still missing will be declared dead following due process. The Konkan and western districts in Maharashtra have witnessed heavy rainfall since last week, triggering unprecedented floods and landslides.Meanwhile, the toll in Satara touched 45, while 21 deaths were reported in Ratnagiri. Thane (12); Kolhapur (7); Mumbai (4); and Sindhudurg, Pune, Wardha, Akola (2 each), too, reported rain-related fatalities since July 22Among 25 people still missing from eight flood-hit districts, 14 are in Ratnagiri with most of them said to have been trapped in a landslide in Porase in Khed tehsil. Thane, Satara and Pune have four, three and two people yet to be traced. Barring Porase in Khed, Ratnagiri and Jor in Satara, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescue teams have called off their operations after possibility of their tracing faded. The NDRF and armed forces have started withdrawing the rescue teams from flood-affected areas as water in almost all districts have receded. An NDRF official said 12 of 34 companies are being withdrawn. “As proposed by the local administration in consultation with the state government, 12 companies are being withdrawn. The remaining 22 teams on field will undertake restoration work in the respective districts. Barring two locations — Jor in Satara and Posare in Khed, Ratnagiri —rescue operations have been called off. The remaining companies, too, will be withdrawn gradually,” the official said. Sunil Thorave, resident deputy collector, Satara, said except for the landslide site of Jor, all other rescue operations at six landslides have been called off. “A 10-month-old girl is missing from Ambeghar landslide location, while two others are missing from Jor. In consultation with the villagers that reported landslides, operations have been called off as almost all missing people have been traced. The situation in the district has come to normal with the water level in all rivers coming down below their warning level. Barring a few roads in Mahabaleshwar, all state and district highways have been opened up for the traffic,” he said. Around 290 state and district roads in flood-affected districts have been completely shut down, while vehicular traffic on 469 roads has been affected. 140 bridges in Konkan and western Maharashtra are still submerged. Public works department minister Ashok Chavan has asked his department to assess the losses and take steps to ensure that the roads are opened at the earliest.More than 3.10 lakh households in flood affected districts are still without electricity owing to the damage caused to the infrastructure. 960,00 households in 1,927 villages and towns suffered power outage since Thursday. 67 sub stations, 474 electricity lines and 14,737 transmitters had damaged in the flooding and downpour. Of them, more than 70% have been restored, according to a statement by the office of energy minister Nitin Raut. A total of 375,178 people have been evacuated to the safer places in eight districts. 206,619 people in Sangli, 150,365 in Kolhapur, 7,530 in Satara have been taken to either shelters or homes of their relatives. Though the water level in major rivers in Konkan and western Maharashtra has receded below the warning level, Panchganga in Kolhapur is still flowing above its danger level. The water level of Panchganga at Rajaram weir dropped to 48.3 ft from more than 54 ft two days ago, against its danger level of 43. NH-4 national highway between Pune and Kolhapur was opened on Monday, after closure for four days, for the essential services like fuel, gas supply and healthcare services. State government is expected to take a call on a special package for the flood-affected areas by widening the scope of the set National Disaster Response Fund norms. The government is considering to add a few more categories, including small-time traders, labourers to extend the compensation. Before the cabinet, chief minister Thackeray has convened a meeting with deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday. The decision over the widening of the relief package is expected to be taken during the meeting.“The norms for the compensation for the losses of housing structures, belongings and crops were changed during Nisarg and Taukte cyclones in last two years. On the same lines, the ex-gratia amount will be increased for the flood-affected people in Konkan and Western Maharashtra. The previous Fadnavis government had also added a few more factors by announcing compensation to the traders and rent for the people who have lost their roof until the new houses were build. The package is likely to have these additions too,” said an official from Mantralaya.During a review meeting on Monday, CM Thackeray asked the respective departments to repair the roads on a war footing so that the traffic is resumed, clean up flooded areas to avoid epidemic diseases and restore supply of the drinking water. The water supply in 17 villaes in Ratnagiri and 20 in Sindhudurg has been affected, while 746 water supply schemes have sustained damages. The district authorities have deployed 459 medical teams in 496 affected villages for the medical help at doorsteps. District authorities have also been directed to complete the assessment of the losses at the earliest. The assessment is expected to take at least 10 days, though the preliminary estimates are expected to be submitted in next few days. The water resources department has been directed to install Real Time Decision Support system on 26 river basins in Konkan for the early alarms of the flooding. Seven of such systems will be installed in next three months. The state has also planned floodwalls for the towns like Chiplun which has river flowing from middle of the habitat. Similarly, the CM has also asked the relief and rehabilitation department for setting up the centres of State Disaster Response Force in every district. The respective departments also have been directed to expedite the process of the landslide affected villages. “The construction of the houses will be done by Mhada and other government agencies with the funding from CSR of corporate houses, central government schemes like PM Awas Yojana. Departments have also been told to identify more such landslide-prone villages and habitats in rural and urban parts and chalk out plans for their rehabilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-floods-toll-now-192-taliye-search-called-off-101627327060433.html
27-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 10 million citizens fully vaccinated against Covid||Maharashtra on Monday became the first Indian state to administer both Covid-19 jabs to 10 million citizens. The state on Monday recorded 4,877 fresh infections, even as its tally of fully vaccinated citizens reached 10,099,524. The total number of doses administered in state has touched 41,766,482.“Maharashtra has once again achieved an important milestone. We have till now administered first doses to 31,666,958 people. Today [Monday], in this vaccination drive, we managed to reach the figure of vaccinating more than one crore (10 million) people with two doses,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, public health, Maharashtra. Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, said vaccination is the only solution to counter the Covid-19 pandemic. “We need to use the carrot-and-stick approach and encourage more people to vaccinate themselves,” said Dr Mandot. “People who are fully vaccinated should be given relaxations like allowing to travel in trains or conducting their businesses,” he added. The state has been asking for a monthly quota of 30 million from the Central government to vaccinate maximum citizens. The Maharashtra legislature even recently passed a resolution recently demanding 30 million doses every month on the plea that it has the infrastructure to undertake this feat. State health minister Rajesh Tope has pleaded that maximum vaccinations will be an effective tool to fight the impending third wave.Mumbai on Monday recorded 297 new cases with eight deaths with its toll reaching 15,845. The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,269,799. There were 148,138 tests done on Monday, while the number of recoveries clocked 11,077.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 88,729, while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 131,605. There are currently 88,729 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 15,550 patients, followed by Thane with 11,321 active patients. The toll has now reached 131,605 with Pune leading with 18,384 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,845.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-10-million-citizens-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-101627326880402.html

He used to visits all over India and was a frequent flyer. He also took online classes on vastu,” said his cousin Milind Vedpathak. The family is now taking help of a cousin from New Delhi to bring his body back. “We are trying to fly the body to Mumbai by Tuesday morning,” said a neighbour of the Vedpathaks. “Tomorrow when we bring his body back to Mumbai it will be his birthday. He used to celebrate it in a lavish way,” said his neighbour who did not wish to be named.“He was a joyous person. I just came to know him during the trip. We were having a great time. It was a very sudden incident. I was thrown out of the vehicle and survived. He was not that fortunate,” said Navin Upadhyay, a Mohali resident who survived the accident.The trip was arranged by a Delhi-based tour operator and people from Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra were among the travellers.A video of the landslide has gone viral, in which huge boulders and stones are seen coming down from mountains towards Sangla Valley and even breaking a bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-resident-among-nine-killed-in-himachal-landslide-101627326401544.html

27-07-2021||Mumbai||10% of active Covid patients in Mumbai are critical||As Mumbai’s daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 500, the number of critical patients in the city has also come down. Of the 5,610 active cases as of Monday, 552 or nearly 10% patients are currently in critical condition as per data from the civic body. On July 1, the number of critical patients in Mumbai stood at 761 or 9% of total 8,498 active cases. Since then, there has been a 27% decrease in the number of critical patients as of Monday.Medical experts said many of these patients are arriving late in the hospital when their symptoms are already severe. “Some of them are transferred late from other centres, while some spend too much time at home, self- treating, till their condition worsens,” said Dr Maharudra Kumbhar, the officer on special duty at SevenHills Hospital — a 1,850-bed Covid-19 facility in Marol. The hospital has 29% occupancy. It has a 300-bed ICU which currently has 180 critical patients. “Recovery rate in ICU improved tremendously since the first wave,” said Dr Kumbhar. Doctors said overall criticality and duration of hospitalisation has reduced among Covid patients. “Exposure to the virus, vaccination and newer treatment options such as the monoclonal antibody cocktail has brought down the rate of hospitalisation as well as the number of critical patients,” said physician Dr Jalil Parkar, who practices at Lilavati Hospital, Bandra. “Around 70% to 80% Covid beds in our facility are now unoccupied, and most hospitals like ours have resumed their non-Covid work,” he said. Of the total 21,434 Covid-19 beds in Mumbai including DCHs, DCHCs and CCC2s, 14% or 2,966 beds are currently occupied, according to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard. ICU occupancy currently stands at 38% with nearly 1,400 beds vacant. “The city’s situation is now better, but we should not let our guard down,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, adding that the civic body is focussing on two things — vaccination and preparation for the third wave. Mumbai has been recording less than 500 cases daily since July 16. The city currently has only three active containment zones and 60 sealed buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/10-of-active-covid-patients-in-mumbai-are-critical-101627326340353.html

Farmers are seeking repeal of the three farm laws that Parliament passed in September 2020, since November 26 last year. The Samyukt Kisan morcha (SKM), comprising 31 farmer bodies, is leading the protest at the Delhi borders. Balbir Singh Rajewal, who heads a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), on Monday, said, “We would not allow him (Sidhu) to share stage with farm leaders or address our rallies.” Rajewal was reacting to Sidhu’s announcement on the day he took charge that he would reach out to the protesting farmers, stand in their support and hold discussions with farm leaders. Rajewal added that Sidhu could join farmers who are sitting on protest at the borders of Delhi, but no special treatment would be given to him. “SKM has resolved not to mix politics with the protest in any way,” he said, adding that to date Sidhu had not contacted any farm leader. Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the largest farm bodies in Punjab in terms of number of protesters, said, “Sidhu can join our protest as an ordinary farmer, but not in any political capacity. We will not allow him to come near our stage or give him the mike to address farmers. This has been an SKM resolve since the protest started.” Overall, too, the mood among farmers is not to involve Sidhu in their protest, though a section of leaders wanted a rethink on the idea. Responding to comments of farmers, Kuljit Singh Nagra, one of the four new working presidents of the state unit, said, “No one among us is aspiring to be on the farmers’ stage. I work with farmers the entire day and am ready to sit in the last row among protesters. We feel the pain farmers are undergoing and want that their issues are resolved at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sidhu-may-join-stir-but-no-sharing-stage-or-addressing-rallies-farm-unions-101627326161123.html

But following the Covid-19 restrictions and to restrict gatherings the fairs were called off this year. “All four melas organised on four Mondays of the holy month are called off in compliance with Covid-19 pandemic guidelines,” stated Dr Prabha Kant Awasthi, the additional district magistrate (ADM) Agra city. As per the tradition, the four melas (Fairs) are consecutively organised, at four Shiv temples in four corners of the city, during the month of Shravan. The first fair is organised at Rajeshwar Mahadev temple followed by the second at Balkeshwar Mahadev Temple, at banks of river Yamuna.The most important fair, the Kailash fair, is organised at Kailash Mahadev Temple in the outskirts of the city near to the bank of river Yamuna, on the third Monday. The last fair is organised at Prithvinath Mahadev temple. But due to the continuing pandemic and Covid-19 restrictions, all four fairs stand cancelled this year.Despite that, a large number of devotees turned up at the Rajeshwar Mahadev Temple on the first Monday of the holy month to offer prayers, water and milk to the deity.

The main demands of the ambulance drivers included job security, end of contract system, inclusion of 102, 108 and ALS employees into NHM service, ₹50 lakh insurance for staff, if they die of Covid and overtime payment after eight hours’ duty. After the recent tender to run 250 ALS ambulances in UP was bagged by Ziqitza Healthcare Limited, ambulance staff were apprehending that many of them would lose their jobs. The workers went on strike to pressurise the government to get all the old staff working on ALS ambulances deployed in the new firm without any riders. “The issue was related to the selection of staff for running ALS ambulances with the new company,” said TVS Reddy, vice president, GVK EMRI that runs the ambulance services 108 and 102. “After talks with the authorities, we have decided to allow 10 ambulances to run in each district. But our agitation will continue till our demands are met,” said Hanuman Pandey, leading the agitation of ambulance staff.Keeping in view the crisis, the health department in Lucknow deployed additional ambulances. There are 4,720 ambulances in UP, including 2,270 being run under the 102 service, 2,200 ambulances under the 108 service and 250 ALS ambulances. On an average, 102 ambulances cater to about 26,000 calls and 108 ambulances attend to 9,000 calls from across UP while over 1,000 calls are received for ALS ambulances. With majority ambulances not operating, hardly a few patients could get the services. In Lucknow, 78 ambulances are deployed, including 44 under 108 service and 34 under the 102 service. “Instead of waiting for an ambulance, I used a friend’s car to reach the hospital. I had got a message about the strike from the ambulance staff in the morning,” said Rakesh, a resident of Gomti Nagar. For the past three days, some of the ambulance staff had been on protest near the PGI Trauma Centre in Vrindavan Yojna. “Finding no answer to our demands, we decided to hold a massive protest,” said Shahdab, spokesperson for the agitating ambulance staff. WHY THE STRIKE The workers went on strike to pressurise the government to get all the old staff working on ALS ambulances deployed in the new firm without any riders. Though Ziqitza Healthcare Limited has said they would give preference to experienced staff, the workers are apprehensive about their jobs with the new company. GVK EMRI would continue to run the 108 and 102 ambulances in UP.CMO deploys additional ambulances Keeping in view the strike by the ambulance staff, Lucknow chief medical officer deployed a fleet of ambulances for hospitals. Mobile numbers of staff were also issued for people to call and get the ambulance services. Till the strike is on, Vijay Kumar can be contacted on cell phone number 9335213689 and Rishit Yadav on 9798282727 to get ambulance services. “We have deployed ambulances at all CHCs in rural areas.

27-07-2021||Other||Maharashtra forest dept proposes to seek Ramsar tag for Thane Creek||The Maharashtra forest department has moved a proposal to seek the Ramsar certification for Thane Creek, including the area currently protected as the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS) as well as the surrounding eco-sensitive zone (ESZ). Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell, made the announcement during an online town hall meeting organised by Climate Voices – a consortium of three organisations working in the climate and environment space – along with the environment department’s Majhi Vasundhara initiative on Monday, July 26, observed as World Mangroves Day.“A proposal to declare Thane Creek as a Ramsar site has been submitted and we are working on it with the Maharashtra environment department. We are waiting for its approval by the state wetland authority, headed by Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Following this, it will be sent to the Union environment ministry,” said Tiwari.A Ramsar site is a wetland area designated to be of international importance – especially for water birds – under an intergovernmental environmental treaty known as the Ramsar Convention. The treaty provides a framework for nations to conserve such wetlands while seeking international cooperation and resources where required.There are only two Ramsar sites in Maharashtra – the Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana and the Nandur Madhmeshwar Bird Sanctuary in Nashik – while overall, India has 40 such sites. If accepted by the Ramsar Convention, Thane Creek will be the first such site in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. On July 8, Tiwari had written to principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Sunil Limaye with a draft of the official Ramsar Information Sheet (RIS) required for submission to the international authority. Limaye then forwarded the request to the principal secretary (forest department) on July 14, seeking that the proposal be sent to the Central government for approval.“Thane Creek is fringed by mangroves on both the banks and comprises around 20% of the total Indian mangrove species. These comprise of true mangroves (13 species) and mangrove associates (36 species)... The high species diversity of birds in TCFS and presence of many globally important species along with the rich abundance of lesser flamingos (near threatened) and greater flamingos (makes) this area globally significant and the site has also been categorised as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It is an important part of the wetland complex of the Central Asian Flyway of the birds (sic),” the forest department said in RIS, a copy of which is with HT.Besides flamingos, the creek harbours more than 202 bird species, many of which are considered as threatened and endangered. The other fauna includes 18 species of fish, crustaceans and molluscs, 59 species of butterflies, 67 species of insects, 35 species of phytoplankton, 24 species of zooplankton and 23 species of benthic organisms. “Owing to the uniqueness of the habitat for lesser flamingos located amidst the three chaotic megacities (Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), its biodiversity, and plethora of services (both tangible and non-tangible) associated with site at local, regional and global levels, makes the protection and management of Thane Creek a conservation priority,” the forest department submitted in its proposal. Environmentalists have also been campaigning for other important birding areas such as Panje wetland in Uran to be declared as Ramsar sites.Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, lauded the move, which he said is “10 years too late”. “As a protected bird sanctuary, it is still easy to divert land for infrastructure purposes. But as a Ramsar site, both the state and Central governments will be accountable before an international body. So the stakes for conservation are certainly higher,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-forest-dept-proposes-to-seek-ramsar-tag-for-thane-creek-101627325980286.html

The BJP also announced state level functionaries of the party’s OBC wing. They include 8 vice presidents, 3 general secretaries, 8 state secretaries, treasurer and co-treasurer, a state office in-charge, a state media in-charge, social media in-charge and a researcher. At the various meetings at the party office, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal said though strongly placed for 2022 UP polls, the party required its cadre to remain vigilant. The BJP leaders have also been visiting booth committee members. For instance, the state BJP chief visited a sculptor Pawan Prajapati, an OBC booth president, in Lucknow’s Telibagh area on Sunday. “All the cadre have to maintain booth-level people connect,” a party leader said.“The opposition is clueless, rudderless and is trying to set a false narrative, full of lies and deceit, against the government. We need to expose the opposition,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said. State general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal said the cadres have to remain in touch directly with the masses. “This direct connect would help you take the various initiatives of the government, both at the centre and in UP to the people, make the poor aware of them. It would also help achieve the objective of exposing the opposition,” Bansal said. “The idea is to galvanise all our foot soldiers for the mission 2022,” a state BJP leader said while admitting they were expecting a direct contest mainly between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party. The BJP leader didn’t attach much importance to the BSP’s Brahmin meets. “You can’t cash a cheque twice,” the leader said referring to 2007 when the BSP had put in place a remarkable Brahmin-Dalit social chemistry to come to power on its own for the first time in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-tasks-cadre-with-booth-level-peopleconnect-101627325861884.html
27-07-2021||Other||Maharashtra’s mangrove cover: Reports by state and Centre differ||Two different reports on mangrove cover in Maharashtra – one by the Union environment ministry and the other commissioned by the state forest department – show a discrepancy of 33sq km (equal to 6,111 football fields) in the extent of mangroves. Though experts said the discrepancy falls within the acceptable realm of error for satellite imagery analysis, environmentalists have expressed concern over this difference from an administration and conservation standpoint.A survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), at the behest of the Maharashtra forest department, showed a mangrove cover of 353.1sq km. The survey used satellite data up to the year 2019. HT had reported the data on March 4.In contrast, the Forest Survey of India’s (FSI) biennial report (last released in 2019), pegs the total extent of mangrove cover in the state at 320sq. This report, however, used satellite data only between October 2017 and January 2018. A comparison between the sensors, scale, resolution and minimum mappable units used in each of the above surveys is not publicly available. “While an increase in the mangrove cover between 2018 and 2019 would have certainly happened, it can’t be 33sq km in such a short period of time. And even if the discrepancy is plausible due to differences in the scale and spatial resolution of images used, it only shows that there is no real substitute for an on ground assessment of the true figure,” said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti, who has recently filed a fresh plea over non-compliance of the Bombay high court’s 2018 judgment on mangrove protection in the state.Virendra Tiwari, APCCF, mangrove cell and independent mappers attributed the discrepancy to differences in methodology. “The difference is most likely due to different spatial resolutions used for analysis,” Tiwari said.Raj Bhagat, a remote sensing expert currently working with the World Resources Institute (India), explained, “There will always be differences in the result when different organisations conduct the same assessment. It is not just the resolution of images. Seasonality of the images and the definitions of coastal boundaries, for example, will also make a difference. I have always maintained that satellite imagery is only an alternative to better quality data, which can be gathered from a local assessment of the grid boundaries. In the present instance, the 33sq km difference is within the acceptable 5-10% margin of error for remote sensing, but from an administrative standpoint, it is not a fair number.” There is also a more significant discrepancy in earlier data. For example, the IIST report pegged the total extent of mangrove cover in Maharashtra for the year 2005 at 304sq km, while FSI’s 2005 report pegged the state’s mangrove cover at nearly half that number, at 158sq km. This indicates an on ground discrepancy of more than 27,000 football fields. Even accounting for differences in data collection periods and methodology, experts said this difference is too large to be rationally explained.Nevertheless, experts were in agreement that the total extent of mangroves in Maharashtra is seeing a rapid increase. Going only by FSI reports, between 2005 and 2013, the mangrove area in Maharashtra grew by 17%. In the past six years alone, the increase has been a whopping 72%, as stated by the mangrove cell in an email to Hindustan Times on July 24. However, if one were to consider the IIST report from March, the growth of mangroves between 2005 and 2019 was only 16%. HT had reported this increase on March 4. This large inconsistency, and contradictory statements made by authorities, has drawn the ire of environmentalists. “Ground truthing is a bit harder in terms of mangroves because they are not accessible on foot, but there are still more reliable ways to go about this than just relying on remote sensing data: carry a handheld GPS (global positioning system), mark the grid boundaries, and then calculate the distance between coordinates using a geographic information system. It’s inexpensive, and moreover it is the duty of authorities to provide rigorous, trustworthy data to the public,” said Stalin D.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtras-mangrove-cover-reports-by-state-and-centre-differ-101627325860305.html

In Hisar, Rampal and his aides are facing four criminal cases.Hisar police spokesman Vikas Kumar said they had registered a case against Rampal and others in connection with recovery of 134 types of allopathic drugs from ‘Prathmik Chikitsayla’ at Satlok Ashram in Barwala town of Hisar in 2014 when the police had arrested Rampal after a week-long operation.Pronouncing the verdict, the court of ADJ Ved Prakash Sirohi stated that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against accused Rampal and others -Rajender, Baljit and Bijender - while acquitting the accused of the charges levelled against them.A team of the drug control department prepared an inventory of the allopathic medicines, ayurvedic medicines and equipment during their inspection of the Satlok Ashram on November 28, 2014. The drug control officer had filed a complaint with the court in March 2016.Advocate JK Gakhar, counsel for the accused, however, argued that the team of drug control officers carried out an inspection of the Satlok Ashram and found that neither any doctor was practising on the premises in question at the time of inspection nor any prescription slip/OPD slip and receipt of sale was recovered by the police.No patient came forward to depose before the court of undergoing treatment at ‘Prathmik Chikitsayla’, he had argued in court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rampal-aides-acquitted-in-case-under-drugs-and-cosmetics-rules-act-101627325801895.html

Now we are taking that work forward and turning our attention to important wetlands in the interior regions,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell.“Migratory birds coming to Maharashtra mainly use the Central Asian Flyway (CAF) which is one of the major migratory routes for birds visiting the Indian Subcontinent from Central Asia and this study will help in understanding the population dynamics, movement and dispersal patterns, and threats to various migratory birds using CAF,” the mangrove foundation said in a statement Monday.State to set up task force to assess wetlandsThe environment department announced on Monday that it will be setting up a task force to conduct a fresh assessment of wetlands in the state. In September 2017, the Union environment ministry notified the new Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, which excluded wetlands in coastal regulation zones (CRZ) as well as salt pans from their ambit. The rules also imposed the responsibility of identifying wetlands on states themselves, based on the National Wetland Atlas. Recently, the state government told the Bombay high court that there are no wetlands in Nandurbar, Parbhani and Nagpur and even in Raigad’s Uran taluka, despite the National Wetland Atlas clearly marking out such water bodies in these districts. The move had raised the hackles of activists who saw it as an attempt to open up man-made wetlands and salt pans for real estate.“We will be looking at all the wetlands, even those that may have been left out in our own assessments, for our latest inventory in an attempt to protect as many wetlands as possible across Maharashtra. The environment minister is already planning to meet collectors from all the districts in the state to conduct a fresh exercise to identify and demarcate wetlands that are left out. We will be setting up a task force to get this done in a time-bound manner,” said Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bnhs-to-study-migratory-birds-at-six-wetlands-in-maharashtra-101627325800260.html

The police said the accused, Bharat Makwana, committed the crime because the victim interfered in his marital life. Police officers said that at 5.40pm on Sunday, they received a call from locals about a man lying in a pool of blood near Naytodi ground in Eksar at Borivli (West). The police reached the spot and took the man to the hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. On checking his pockets, the police found a driver’s licence, which revealed his identity as Sandeep Rajput, a resident of Borivli. After recording the statements of Rajput’s relatives, the police found that at 5pm on Sunday, the victim’s brother-in-law had taken him out for drinks. “We found out the address of Makwana, the husband of Rajput’s sister’s, as he was the last person who was seen with the victim,” said an officer from MHB Colony police station. On Sunday evening, the police arrested Makwana after he confessed to the crime and revealed that he wanted to kill Rajput as he was interfering in his marital life. Makwana told the police that he had married Rajput’s sister a few years ago. However, from the past 18 months, his wife was staying at Rajput’s place and he did not let her return to her matrimonial house. Makwana further revealed that whenever he went to pick up his wife, Rajput used to ask her to stay back and not go with him, which irked him. On Sunday, when Rajput refused to let his sister go with Makwana, the latter invited the victim for drinks to talk about the problem. The two went to Eksar Nagar and bought a few beers and sat to drink in Makwana’s rickshaw. While drinking, Makwana removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed Rajput on his stomach and thighs. When Rajput did not die, Makwana picked up an empty beer bottle and smashed the victim’s head several times and left the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/30yrold-kills-brother-in-law-in-mumbai-for-interfering-in-his-marital-life-101627325680272.html

It is important that the candidates do not attempt more than 10 questions because only the first 10 attempted questions will be considered for evaluation/marking,” said the response shared by the official NTA email. This is the first time since its inception that the exam pattern for NEET-UG has been changed.Until 2020, the NEET-UG paper pattern consisted of 180 objective-type questions from physics, chemistry and biology (botany and zoology) that had to be answered on a specially designed sheet using a ballpoint pen only. Each correct answer gave students four marks and each wrong answer deducted one mark. According to NTA, the new paper pattern will comprise of two sections under each subject.Section A will consist of 35 questions which students have to attempt compulsorily, and section B will consist of 15 questions from which the candidate can choose to attempt any 10 questions. “As students have to choose and attempt only 10 out of the 15 questions, the utilisation of time will remain the same, thus clarifying that the total time given for the exam remains the same this year as well (sic),” stated NTA response.“We are glad that NTA has reverted to our emails and specified the marking scheme, clearing all doubts in the minds of the aspirants. Many were confused about the change in paper pattern and this response from NTA has given much required relief to more than 1.5 million NEET aspirants,” said Ruiee Kapoor, parent and activist.In a statement released earlier this month, NTA clarified that the changes were introduced keeping in mind the reduction of syllabus by various school education boards for their Class 12 students in 2020-21, considering the loss of academic time due to Covid-19. “To rationalise the decision of reduction in the syllabus by various school education boards, NTA has taken the decision to provide choice in Section “B” for each of the four subjects,” clarified NTA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/neetug-nta-gives-clarity-on-exam-and-marking-pattern-101627325560262.html

In June and July 2020, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) received around 315 complaints related to potholes that went up to 437 this year till July 25.According to data reported on MyBMC Pothole Fixit mobile app, the civic body had attended to 264 complaints 8 in 2020, while this year, of the 437 complaints, only 262 have been attended to so far. Apart from the app, citizens can also register their complaints via email and on social media.Shantanu Kulkarni, director of Probity Soft, the firm which operates BMC’s app for reporting potholes, said, “The complaints reported this year were a little more than last year, and it could be further more. However, due to lockdown and people working from home, not many complaints have gone unreported.”On July 13, HT had reported that there was a 76% drop in the number of potholes during 2020-2021 as compared to 2019-2020. Since June 1 to July 13, a total of 239 potholes had been reported in the city, according to data. However, the number of complaints increased drastically in the past two weeks owing to heavy rainfall.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal held a meeting with BMC officials on Friday over the issue of potholes and directed the road department to attend to the complaints of potholes proactively and also prepare report of the complaints. “During the peak of the second wave in April and May, many officials were on Covid-19 duty and due to this the entire process of repair and maintenance of road works went for a toss,” a BMC official said. BMC maintains around 2,055km of roads in the city, and every road is repaired or resurfaced using asphalt or concrete cement from the existing paver blocks. According to estimates presented in the budget 2021-22, BMC proposed to improve the road network of 157km during financial year 2021-22, which is less than the target of 289km set in 2020-21.Dahisar resident Animesh Vora said, “In our area, BMC repaired one road as it was in bad shape, but started work on the very next road to it to fix the drainage line. The drainage line is fixed, but now there are big potholes on the road, which was a smooth one earlier. Hence, it is not just the rain, but civic officials also end up creating potholes in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pothole-plaints-rise-as-mumbai-sees-heavy-rain-spells-101627325440228.html

His letter to the police says, “Neither I nor any Congress worker has filed a formal complaint or recorded any statement with the police against the farmers.” “I stand by the farmers in their crusade against the black farm laws and I shall always be with them raising their voice,” another tweet on his handle read.Sidhu, along with Channi and PCC working president Kuljit Singh Nagra, had visited Chamkaur Sahib to pay obeisance at gurdwara Katalgarh Sahib, when they faced farmers’ wrath, who showed them black flags. Following the protest, a case was registered against district president of the Kirti Kisan Morcha Jagmandeep Singh, Kulwant Singh Saini, Jagdeep Kaur, Satnam Singh Sohi, sarpanch of Behrampur Jimidaran, and 45 unidentified persons under Sections 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint),148 (rioting) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code on a complaint from one of the cops. Farmers, however, protested on Monday as well. Seeking the cancellation of FIRs, they protested at the Solkhian toll plaza in Rupnagar. Jagmandeep Singh, district president of Kirti Kisan morcha, said that in its complaint, the police had alleged that farmers assaulted Congress leaders at the local gurdwara and attempted to block the cavalcade of Sidhu and Channi. “It is a fabricated complaint registered at the behest of Congress leaders. We only raised slogans against Sidhu and showed him black flags, seeking an apology from him for his comments against farmers,” he said. Another farm union leader Parminder Singh said senior police officials visited them during their protest in which they were briefed that the case registered against them was false. “We lifted our protest after officials assured us that the process of cancellation of FIR will be initiated soon,” he said. SP Ajinder Singh said he was aware of Channi’s letter. “We listened to farmers, who have told us their side of story. We assured them that the investigation will be carried and if required, the process of cancellation of the FIR will be started,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/protest-against-sidhu-channi-writes-to-police-to-cancel-fir-against-farmers-101627325201505.html

Schools had been shut in March amid a surge in Covid-19 cases. Attendance, however, remained a mixed bag. Patiala recorded had just about one-third attendance, with Jalandhar and SBS Nagar districts seeing 15% strength, according to their district education officers. The state government has allowed only those teachers and staff to return to schools who are fully vaccinated. It is mandatory for schools to seek written consent from parents for sending their children to attend classes. Virtual classes are also continuing.“No student is allowed to enter the school without a mask. Social distancing is being maintained,” an official of a school in Amritsar said. Thermal scanning is being conducted at school entrances and hand sanitisers have been provided to students. Only one student is allowed to sit on a desk, school authorities added.“I am happy to be back in school. Though we were studying through the online mode, we can understand better in the classroom,” said an elated student in Ludhiana. Another student in Amritsar said, “I am very happy to return to school today. We can now interact with our teachers in the classroom.” The state government has said that schools will also be opened for the remaining classes from August 2, if the Covid situation remained under control. “There are nearly 1,600 students in the school, but the school administration is allowing only 15 students per class. All Covid norms are being followed,” the principal of a school in Amritsar said. “I want that the school never get closed as our studies were disrupted. Since the school administration has made sure that all safety arrangements were followed,” said Simranjeet Kaur, a Class-12 student. “It’s been four months since we have entered the school.

We have announced the results of 2.21 lakh students, of which 1.14 lakh are boys. Total 5,567 students appeared for the compartment exam. We held back the results of 1,338 students as their school authorities have failed to provide their Class 10, 11 and 12 marks. We have asked the school authorities to provide us their details within 15 days,” he said.The Supreme Court had directed all boards to announce Class 12 results by July 31 and the top court had accepted the CBSE formulae to evaluate Class 12 results but the Haryana board did not follow the CBSE pattern. The Class 10 board results also stood at 100%.Board secretary Rajiv Prasad said they had developed a 30:10:60 formulae - based on students’ Class 10, 11 results and internal assessment of Class 12 in evaluating the results.Students dissatisfied with the assessment will get a chance to appear for the exams in August.

The officer had filed an appeal before the commission seeking information on illegal constructions in the forest area.The SIC order assumes significance in light of the recent Supreme Court directions on removal of all unauthorised structures on the forest land.The apex court which had ordered demolition of unauthorised structures in Khori village of Faridabad had also held that the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applied to “all unauthorised structures without any exception”, including the ones already identified by Haryana forests minister Kanwar Pal, as unauthorised structures which cannot be regularised.The SC, in its July 23 order, had said that these should be removed after due verification of the fact whether they are unauthorised and constructed on the forest land as such.“The verification will be done within the extended time specified above and if the structure is covered in the category of unauthorised structure on the forest land, the same will be removed within the same time,” the order said.Khemka’s appeal was based on the reply of state forests minister Kanwar Pal, who had told the Haryana assembly on February 27, 2020 that 50 farmhouses have been built in the Faridabad area and 10 in the Gurugram area.Pal had also told the assembly that illegal construction in the Aravalli area will not be allowed and those who have illegally maintained farmhouses have been issued notices.The minister, who was responding to a query by BJP MLA Seema Trikha in the assembly, however, replied in negative to the query on whether there is any proposal under consideration of the government to regularise or approve the said farmhouses.“In summary, the minister’s reply clarifies the existence of 60 farmhouses in Faridabad and Gurugram, which were built without any requisite permission. This points to encroachment by owners of these farmhouses. The department’s response that there is no record of such individuals is not satisfactory as it is the duty of the district town planner (enforcement) to monitor any attempts at illegal construction in its designated area,” the SIC had said in his January order.“Even after the reply given in the Vidhan Sabha, the district town planner, Faridabad and Gurugram has failed to check the ownership of these farmhouses. Ignoring the violation seems to be by design rather than neglect, considering that electricity connections have already been provided to these illegal farmhouses,” the SIC had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-farmhouses-in-aravallis-info-commission-seeks-details-on-ownership-101627324720710.html

But lapses in virus prevention measures such as not wearing masks in public places, defying physical distancing norms, eateries not strictly adhering to protocol of allowing only 50% seating capacity to dine-in, etc are recipe for resurgence of the infection and its spread,” said a health official.State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said social behaviour of people matters a lot when people start intermingling.“Easing of lockdown restrictions will have a lower impact on the virus spread if people take precautions and behave responsibly. The most important measure is wearing a mask, more appropriately, a double mask which reduces the chances of transmission by 90%. A surgical mask alone can reduce the transmission risk by 80-85% while its 40-60% for a cloth mask,” he said.As of July 25, there were 711 active cases across state with only Hisar district still having more than 100 active cases. Sixteen districts have less than 50 active cases. The number of deaths due to the infection was 20 last week.HARYANA RECORDS 3 DEATHS, 31 NEW CASESHaryana on Monday reported three more coronavirus-related deaths, taking the death toll to 9,622, while 31 fresh cases pushed the state’s infection count to 7,69,770, according to the health bulletin.The new fatalities were reported from Kurukshetra, Panchkula and Gurugram.Gurugram recorded nine of the fresh Covid cases while seven new cases were registered in Kurukshetra.Haryana has 711 active cases. The recovery count stands at 7,59,437 in state. The recovery rate is at 98.66%, the bulletin stated.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covids-downward-trajectory-in-haryana-social-behaviour-key-to-virus-resurgence-101627324600852.html

Rajesh was released from jail after filing an affidavit that he will marry Babita... Both got married in December 2020”, he said.But last month, the woman, Babita’s family reported her missing.She went missing on June 11 and her parents filed a missing complaint in Delhi’s Dwarka police station on June 15, said Vijay Mehta, the officer-in-charge of Tallital police station in Nainital.The Nainital connection to her disappearance emerged when the police checked her phone records to trace her movement. The last location that the police could find was on June 12, 2021 when the phone was near Hanumangarh temple in Nainital,” said Vijay Mehta, officer-in-charge of Nainital district’s Tallital police station.Mehta said when the police checked the location of her husband’s phone around the same time, they found he was also in the same area of Nainital.Rajesh initially denied having to do anything with his wife’s disappearance but eventually, according to police, came around.Mehta alleged that during interrogation, Rajesh claimed he decided to kill his wife because she and her mother “harassed”.According to the police, Rajesh convinced his wife to come along to Udham Singh Nagar on the pretext that he needed to check on his mother, and from there, they reached Nainital. On June 12, shortly after leaving Nainital, he switched off his wife’s phone. “About 13 km from Nainital, he expressed his desire to have a physical relationship with his wife at a secluded place. He took her to a cave. After having sex, he strangled his wife,” Mehta said, citing the investigation by the Delhi Police.“Police have arrested Rajesh, originally a resident of Udham Singh Nagar, but settled in Delhi now. A case has been registered against him under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/delhi-man-takes-wife-on-nainital-holiday-kills-her-and-dumps-body-arrestedcop-101627324240870.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi police launch probe into Rahul Gandhi’s tractor march to Parliament||Terming it a security breach, the Delhi Police have launched an internal inquiry into Congress leader Rahul Gandhi driving a tractor to Parliament along with other party MPs in protest against farm laws on Monday, senior police officers aware of the matter said on Monday.They said a first information report (FIR) is likely to be registered in connection with the “tractor march to Parliament”, and added that the inquiry will also look into the failure of the police to prevent the entry of a tractor in central Delhi without prior permission by the authorities. Tractors have been barred from entering central Delhi, especially Lutyens’ zone, since September last year when a tractor was set on fire at the India Gate by some Punjab Youth Congress workers to mark their protest against the three farm laws, said a police officer who asked not to be named.Rahul Gandhi on Monday drove a tractor to Parliament along with other party MPs Pratap Singh Bajwa, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Deepinder Singh Hooda, Gurjit Singh Aujla, Jasbir Singh Gill and other leaders like Randeep Surjewala, and demanded that the agricultural laws be repealed.“We have brought the message of farmers to Parliament. Their issue is not being allowed to be discussed in Parliament and farmers all over the country are being suppressed and that is why we are here. These black laws should be withdrawn,” he told reporters. The Congress leaders carried banners and raised slogans.Senior police officers who spoke on condition of anonymity said the tractor was brought in a container truck in the early hours of Monday, and kept at the office of Congress Rajya Sabha MP KTS Tulsi at Moti Lal Nehru Marg.Following the incident, 10 Congress leaders, including Randeep Singh Surjewala and Srinivas BV, were detained and the tractor was seized after being stopped by the police nearly 70-80 metres away from Parliament. As Gandhi walked inside the Parliament, the detained Congress leaders were taken to the Mandir Marg police station. They were released late in the afternoon.When asked about the police’s allegation that the tractor was kept at his office, Tulsi said, “I am not aware of all the details because I am not in Delhi. But if it has happened, I am proud of it. While the whole country is aghast over the manner with which the farmers of this country are being treated, this (tractor rally) will draw the attention of the central government. The Congress party is actually doing a great job. Everyone should put their heads together to resolve this (farmers) issue. It’s a matter of life and death for the farmers,” said Tulsi.Officers said the inquiry was initiated also because the tractor was allowed to pass a couple of police pickets between Tulsi’s office and Parliament where the tractor was finally stopped by the police.“Police as well as traffic personnel deployed in central Delhi are regularly briefed about not allowing any tractor in Lutyens’ Delhi. But the way a tractor reached a Congress leader’s office unnoticed, and it was driven by Rahul Gandhi towards Parliament without being stopped is a matter of serious concern. The responsibility of this police failure will be fixed through the inquiry,” the officer who was also quoted above said.Police officers said Gandhi’s tractor march is being considered a security and intelligence failure in the wake of the ongoing farmers’ protest at the Jantar Mantar, the monsoon session of Parliament and the Independence Day, for which nearly 5,000 personnel have been deployed in central Delhi.During the preliminary inquiry, another police officer said, it was learnt that Gandhi left his residence in the morning along with his party leaders with his security detail and reached Tulsi’s office at 3 Moti Lal Nehru Marg.From there, he came out driving a tractor and moved towards Sunehri Masjid roundabout and then to Rafi Marg. Gandhi drove towards Krishi Bhawan and then moved to Parliament, where it was chased and stopped by some policeman before he could reach the gate of the complex, the officer said.“The tractor was driven for nearly one and a half kilometres and Gandhi took around six minutes to reach the back gate of Parliament,” the second officer said, adding that the police are also probing if the container truck in which the tractor was allegedly brought into Lutyens’ zone had any permission from the traffic department or not.Thousands of farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws enacted in September last year that seek to deregulate the agricultural trade. Hundreds of farmers have been protesting on Delhi’s borders since December last year. They took out a tractor protest rally on Republic Day this year that descended into chaos after the farmers broke barricades and entered the capital, and clashed with the police at several points including ITO and the Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-launch-probe-into-rahul-gandhi-s-tractor-march-to-parliament-101627322739964.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||After hot weekend, IMD issues ‘orange alert’ for Tuesday||After a hot and humid weekend, Delhi saw only traces of rainfall on Monday even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an ‘Orange alert’, predicting overnight showers which will intensify on Tuesday.An orange alert is issued when there is a forecast of rain and thundershowers, along with heavy rainfall in isolated pockets accompanied with gusty winds of 30-40kmph.The Safdarjung Observatory, which is representative of Delhi’s weather, recorded just 2.4mm rainfall on Monday. The other weather stations in the Capital, including Lodhi Road, Ridge and Palam, too recorded trace rainfall.“There was light drizzle in several parts of the city on Monday while more showers are likely between Monday night and early Tuesday morning. The monsoon trough is close to Delhi and is moving further up, which is likely to result in ‘moderate’ showers on Tuesday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’ s regional weather forecasting centre.He added that isolated rainfall will continue till July 29 which is expected to help bring down the mercury by a few notches.On Monday, IMD said the maximum temperature touched 33.1°C, a notch below the season’s normal, and the minimum settled at 28.3°C, a degree above normal.Delhi experienced high levels of humidity and above normal day temperature over the weekend.Independent forecasters too said that Delhi is likely to get good rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday, adding that more frequent spells of rainfall are likely in August. They said La Nina conditions -- a weather phenomenon occurring in the Pacific Ocean -- are likely to develop in August, which may result in increased rainfall activity all over Southeast Asia.“The monsoon trough is moving north of Delhi and there are low clouds as well, which means Delhi could get moderate showers on Tuesday with light rain even tonight (Monday night),” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology), Skymet, a private forecaster.He added that although the monsoon arrived in the city on July 13, 16 days behind schedule, two good spells of rainfall earlier this month have helped cover the rainfall deficit. “Between June 1 and July 26, Delhi has a surplus rainfall of 11%,” he said.He also added that the La Nina conditions are likely to prevail over the region in mid-August. “La Nina conditions are good for southwest monsoon and may result in increased rainfall all over Southeast Asia, including Delhi-NCR,” said Palawat.According to IMD, the official monsoon season lasts from June 1 to September 30.IMD officials said that La Nina has a positive impact on rainfall all over the region. “That said, during August, easterly winds and the monsoon trough, which are the primary conditions for rainfall, are favourable and hence the city receives more frequent spells of rain during this time,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-hot-weekend-imd-issues-orange-alert-for-tuesday-101627322681181.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 Unlock: Queues persist in Delhi Metro after eased seating norms||Metres-long queues outside Metro stations in the national capital continued on Monday, even as passengers were allowed to occupy all seats on the crucial public transit service after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) relaxed its curbs on the number of commuters inside coaches amid an ease in the city’s Covid-19 caseload.However, Metro officials said they noted some instances of passengers standing inside coaches, which is still not allowed, adding that this was likely due to a lack of awareness among commuters, as they stepped up announcements inside stations relaying the new rules.Rajeev Kumar (40), a commuter who boarded the Metro from Shaheed Sthal station on the Red Line, said that the situation at the station was not as bad as it was before the seating norms were eased. “After a year, the Metro has finally lifted the cap on seats. Gates that were earlier closed have also been opened. Due to this, more people might have opted for the Metro in the morning. I didn’t find a long queue in the morning though. Otherwise, one had to wait anywhere between 30-60minutes daily to enter the metro station,” said Kumar.He added that many people were unaware of the update regarding the seating capacity. “Some people are standing because they may not be aware of the rules. In the morning, since many people were standing, the driver announced that passengers were allowed to occupy all seats. Regular announcements should be made to inform commuters,” said Kumar.DDMA on Saturday allowed the Delhi Metro and public buses to operate with 100% seating capacity from Monday, and also allowed multiplexes, spas, swimming pools, auditoriums and entertainment parks to reopen in the Capital.Shubham Singh (24) who boarded a train for Kashmere Gate from Kalkaji Mandir on the Violet Line said the social distancing labels were not removed from seats, which added to the confusion on the first day of the eased rules. “Since the sticker on the seat still reads ‘Do Not Sit Here’, my friend didn’t occupy the seat next to me. I wasn’t aware that one could occupy all the seats in the coach” he said.His friend Mayank Yadav, 23, said, “People have kept their bags on alternative seats. Since one couldn’t sit next to each other until yesterday [Sunday], I assumed that that the rule was in place. If all seats can be used by commuters, authorities should remove these stickers. People look at the sticker and don’t occupy an empty seat, fearing that a fine will be imposed,” said Yadav.Meena Gupta, 45, who boarded a metro from Badarpur on the Violet Line, said that the station was crowded in the morning. “The footfall might have increased because have lifted the seating restrictions. I couldn’t get a seat and the coach was crowded,” she said.Like most days, long queues were seen outside major stations like Rajiv Chowk and Janpath. A S Singh, a government employee, said that the new guidelines had not made any difference to the queues.“People continue to stand while travelling. Queues continue as before too. The metro authorities shouldn’t allow so many people. Amid covid, so many people queuing up with scant physical distancing is risky,” said Singh, while waiting outside Janpath metro station.Vishnhu Pada, a 30-year-old working professional, who boards the metro from MG metro station on the yellow line, attributed the crowding and daily queues to decreased frequency of trains. “The frequency of trains has reduced. One has to wait for at least 5 minutes to board the next metro. Metro authorities should increase the frequency if they want to resolve the issue of crowding,” said Pada.Niranjas Das, 67, another commuter, said that while the metro was less crowded, he had to stand in a queue. “The metro was a little lesser crowded today in comparison with other days. However, one ends up standing in the queue during the evening hours. Be it Barakhamba or Janpath or Rajiv Chowk station, there is always a queue,” said Das.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that around 1.75 million passenger journeys were recorded till 8pm on Monday, up from a daily average of around 1.6 million passenger journeys after Metro services resumed on June 7 after the lockdown till Sunday evening.Further, on Monday, DMRC said it de-boarded 432 passengers and penalised 159.In a statement on Monday, DMRC said it came across some social media posts where people were seen standing inside the train.“In this regard, it is to mention that today is the very first day of the revised guidelines and many people are still not fully aware of the fact that the Metro is offering only 1/5th (20%) of its passenger capacity in a train and not 100% as is the general impression which has been created in the past couple of days through various reports. Some people are still under the impression that alternate seats are not to be occupied and preferred to stand during travel causing such a temporary situation in certain trains in some sections,” said Anuj Dayal, Executive Director, Corporate Communications, DMRC, on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/little-respite-from-queues-outside-delhi-metro-stations-as-new-seating-rules-come-into-play-101627322679943.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi zoo to reopen for visitors from August 1||The Delhi zoo is set to reopen for visitors from August 1, more than two months after it was shut due to a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic.Delhi zoo director Ramesh Kumar Pandey said that the zoo will operate in two shifts. “We are planning to open the National Zoological Park (Delhi zoo) from August 1. Preparations are on. It will be opened in two shifts like earlier. Online booking will open from July 31, a day ahead of its opening,” said Pandey.Zoo officials said the two shifts will be from 8am to 12pm and from 1pm to 5pm.“Visitors can buy the tickets either through the zoo’s website or at the entry gates using QR codes. This time we will allow 1,500 visitors in each shift. In total 3,000 visitors are allowed inside the premises during the day,” said a senior official.The Delhi zoo was shut for visitors on March 18 last year, a week before the nationwide lockdown that lasted 68 days was imposed. Later, after an avian flu scare in January this year, the zoo finally reopened on April 1, only to be closed again on April 15, as the second wave of the pandemic struck.During the brief period it was opened in April, the zoo had allowed only 2,000 visitors -- 1,000 in each shift -- in the premises.Pandey further said that the zoo recorded only 124 animal deaths -- the lowest in the last three years -- when it remained closed for public in 2020-21. The zoo recorded 172 animal deaths in 2019-20 and 188 deaths in 2018-19. Zoo officials said that the deaths depend on many factors, such as the age of animals, senility and heterogeneity, among others.“Besides, we have now introduced cycles for staff to move around the premises and have asked them not to use two-wheelers or cars. This to keep a healthy environment for the animals in the zoo,” he said.He added that the zoo currently has 1,162 animals from 94 species. “Soon we will be increasing the number of species to 100, as part of various pending exchange programmes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-zoo-to-reopen-for-visitors-from-august-1-101627322620569.html

27-07-2021||Delhi||AAP alleges corruption in MCDs renting machines to clear landfill sites||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday alleged the cash-strapped municipal corporations were deliberately using trommel machines, used to clear landfill sites, on rent as it involves higher costs, instead of procuring which would have been cheaper.Addressing a press conference AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled MCDs have paid a rent of Rs. 26 crores in the last 1.5 years for trommel machines, even though the same machines could have been bought for ₹4 crore. The BJP, however, rejected the charge as baseless.“Last year also, the chief auditor of the three MCDs found corruption of Rs. 22 crore with regard to use of such machines. Now, the BJP-ruled MCDs are planning a three times bigger loot by taking these machines on rent. The AAP will oppose the decision in the standing committee meeting tomorrow (Tuesday),” said Bhardwaj.The AAP also called it a gross misuse of taxpayers’ money. The AAP called the move a gross misuse of taxpayers’ money. The Delhi government pays the most amount of money for the purpose of reducing the height of these landfill sites. The Delhi government gives ₹65 crore to the East MCD for this purpose, while the East MCD on its own contributes ₹40 crore. In the North MCD, the Delhi government gives ₹35 crore, while the North MCD gives ₹30 crore. The Delhi government gives ₹25 crore to the South MCD, civic body contributes ₹15 crore, the AAP said in a statement.“The price of these trommel machines in the market, as stated in the audit report as well, is ₹17.70 lakh. But, the MCD has taken these machines on rent for ₹6.30 lakh per month. This means the contractors recover the cost of these machines in merely three months even as the MCDs continue to pay the high rent, which is more than the actual price of these machines. For the past 1.5 years, 23 such rented machines have been working on these garbage piles. So if we calculate the price of 23 trommel machines at the rate of Rs. 17.70 lakh per machine, these machines could have been bought for ₹4 crore. Interestingly, the MCD has spent ₹26 crore till now to pay the rent of these machines,” said Bhardwaj.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said this is the second time in a year that the AAP has tried to “mislead” people over the trommel machines issue.“What the AAP calls rent for the machines is actually it’s operation cost. The North corporation did not hire trommel machines, and we have mentioned earlier as well that the civic body has taken trommel on maintenance contract,” said Kapoor. He added that according to the contract, trommel machines are run in three shifts with the supplier company bearing its expenses in staff, diesel and other maintenance.South corporation mayor Mukesh Suryan said the AAP is just “spreading lies”. “First of all, the AAP leaders don’t know how the corporation functions. Secondly, what they said about giving us funds for buying the machines is totally false, as we haven’t got any money for the same.”East Corporation mayor Shyam Sundar Agrawal said that the figures given by the AAP itself are not correct and even confusing. “I am ready to debate over the issue and prove them wrong,” said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-alleges-corruption-in-mcds-renting-machines-to-clear-landfill-sites-101627322619895.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Residents of Delhi’s ‘affluent’ unauthorised colonies demand ownership rights||Residents of Sainik Farms, Chhatarpur Enclave and other 69 “affluent” residential colonies have written to the Delhi Development Authority and central government demanding ownership rights for their properties just like the 1,728 unauthorised colonies are being provided under the PM-UDAY scheme.In December 2019, the Centre enacted the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act, 2019, to give ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies. A total of 1,797 unauthorised colonies were identified for the purpose, but 69 were not included in the PM-UPDAY scheme as these were termed as “affluent”.Of these 69 unauthorised colonies, a majority are located in South Delhi parliamentary constituency in areas such as Anant Ram Diary (RK Puram), Neb Sarai, Mehrauli, Bijwasan and Mahipalpur. Unlike a majority of the unauthorised colonies, which are spread across Delhi, these 69 mostly have farmhouses, big plots and have come up on privately owned agricultural land. Of the 1700-odd colonies that are being given property ownership are those that have come up on government land.“It’s been almost two years and no decision has been taken regarding our colonies. Our demand is that we should be included in the PM-UDAY scheme. We have written to the Prime Minister’s Office, housing and urban affairs ministry and DDA in this regard to expedite the process,” said Raman Aggarwal, president of 69 colonies welfare association (association of residential colonies that were not included in the Pradhan Mantri-Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana).HS Bhalla, president of Western Avenue Residential Welfare Association at Sainik Farms, said the neighbourhood came into existence in the 60s where defence personnel constructed their houses. In the subsequent years, several colonies, mainly having farmhouses, have come up on agricultural land around it.“Our colonies are located on private agricultural land. Most of the 69 colonies, which have been termed ‘affluent’ by the government, are located on private agricultural land. When the government is giving ownership rights to other colonies, which are on agricultural land, then why not us?” said Bhalla.He added, “We have waited for long to get ownership of our properties. All that they have to do is to add a slab for plots, which are bigger than 250 sq.m. If the government includes these 69 colonies in the ownership process, it will get a lot of revenue which it can use in the development of other 1,700-odd colonies.”The DDA, which is the nodal agency for implementation of the PM-UDAY scheme, said a decision regarding these colonies will be taken by the Centre. “We are currently streamlining the system to expedite the process to give ownership rights to 1,700-plus unauthorised colonies. We keep getting representations from these colonies regarding ownership rights. But the decision has to be taken at the central government’s level,” said a senior DDA official.The housing and urban affairs ministry did not comment on the matter.These residential colonies also want the government to do away with the “affluent unauthorised colonies” categorisation.Vani Aggarwal, general secretary of New RWA Chattarpur Phase-II, said, “The affluent tag should be removed. Some of the plots in our area are 150sq.m or small. All the 1,797 colonies should be treated at par. We want the government to give us ownership rights so that we can get our building plans sanctioned and ensure planned development in the future.”Residents have also approached the South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri to take up the matter with the Centre.Bidhuri said, “I have written to the ministry of housing and urban affairs in this regard. The matter is under consideration. The government will address their concerns in the new Master Plan of Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-of-delhi-s-affluent-unauthorised-colonies-demand-ownership-rights-101627322501982.html
27-07-2021||Delhi||Snags hit devices in city ration shops, some recipients return empty-handed||Several ration card holders returned empty-handed from fair price shops (FPS) in south and east Delhi on Monday, after glitches in the electronic point of sale (e-POS) devices in the stores. Officials in the food and civil supplies department said the complaints reported were mostly down to poor network coverage, even as reports seen by HT showed that the Delhi government managed to reach out 64.65% of the 1.77 million eligible beneficiaries in seven days since the launch of the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ programme in the city on July 20.Residents reported problems from stores in and around Vasant Vihar, Malviya Nagar, Okhla, Gandhi Nagar and parts of New Delhi, among others.Ramesh, a daily wage worker who lives in New Delhi’s Kusumpur Pahadi and goes by a single name, said he even took his two sons to get their biometrics authenticated. “But, the machine was not able to read our fingerprints. I lost a day’s income (nearly ₹400) today to queue up at the ration shop, but returned empty handed,” he said.Sanno Devi, a resident of South Delhi’s Jagdamba Camp, is a widow and disabled. Despite having a ration card on her, she was unable to get the subsidised food grains, due to problems with the e-POS machine.Senior officials from the food department, however, said there were no large-scale reports of such malfunctions.“It is true that teething issues are being faced in some circles, but it will be wrong to say that the system is not working in the entire city. Even if we see the latest data of Delhi’s public distribution system after the implementation of ONORC, it is one of the fastest disbursals the government has done in recent times,” said the official who asked not to be named.Owners of FPSs have been asked to put up a board outside their shops informing people if machines are not working, to limit queues in such situations.Between July 20 and July 26, government data showed, 1,150,511 (64.68%) beneficiaries of the total 1,778,527 ration card holders in Delhi received subsidised food grains under ONORC. Northwest zone was the best performing district, disbursing July’s ration quota to 215,756 card holders. This was followed by the northeast zone with 199,638 beneficiaries receiving ration. The New Delhi zone had not distributed ration to 51% of its beneficiaries till Monday evening, showed the data.ONORC, introduced in 2019, aims to add digital muscle to the country’s public distribution system (PDS) through which food grains are offered at subsidised rates to about 739 million beneficiaries under the national food security law. ONORC allows a beneficiary, such as a migrant worker, to access her share of subsidised ration from anywhere in the country regardless of the place where her ration card is registered. In other words, it allows mobility of food entitlements.In Delhi, people can get cheap grains from any of the 2,000 fair price shops. For this, the government has deployed 2,005 e-PoS devices across the capital to get ONORC going.Anjali Bhardwaj, member of the Right to Food campaign which surveys FPSs in Delhi, on Monday said the government has made Aadhaar-based biometric authentication mandatory without offering an alternate process to fall back upon if the electronic system crashes. “As a result, people are at the mercy of these machines, most of which were not working on Monday in places where our teams inspected. Many ration card holders waited for hours, but did not get the subsidised food grains. The problem is that there is no back-up option to disburse ration if the e-POS or biometric authentication fails,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/beneficiaries-return-empty-handed-as-glitches-hit-e-pos-machines-in-some-delhi-ration-stores-101627322499993.html

The judge said the petitioner, SHO of the Bhajanpura police station, and his supervising officers, have “miserably failed” in their statutory duties in this case.Challenging this order, city police have stated that the court did not give a chance to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) to justify his stand before imposing the cost, violating the principles of natural justice.The police plea also stated that the judge failed to appreciate that imposition of such cost was “not only unwarranted but uncalled for” for the reason that the court did not find the petition as vexatious and that hand imposition of such cost would “seriously affect not only the career of the government officials but would certainly cause serious dent to the reputation of the officers.”The matter will now be heard on July 28.Nasir’s complaint was clubbed with an FIR registered for gunshot injuries suffered by six others during the riots.The court said that the facts produced before it revealed “a shocking state of affairs”, and it was not able to persuade itself about the efficacy and fairness of the investigation carried out in the matter.The court said when two separate complaints disclosing cognizable offences are filed by two different complainants, there is no provision under which the investigating agency can club such complaints and carry out investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-moves-court-against-trial-court-order-calling-its-riots-probe-farcical-101627322441118.html
27-07-2021||Pune||Four dams servicing Pune filled to 78% of capacity||PUNE Rain in Pune district over the last five days has seen the water stock in the four dams supplying water to Pune district, rise to a total of 22.56 TMC, or 78.617 per cent of the joint storage capacity.On July 26, 2020, the water stock in the four dams – Khadakwasla, Panshet, Warasgaon and Temghar – was 9.83 TMC. “Last year, July was much drier and less rain had occurred in the catchment area. This year, all the areas where dams are located have seen continuous moderate and also heavy rain in the last five days, which has increased the water levels,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune.Apart from Pune, other parts of the state have also received heavy rain in the last five days, resulting in an increase in water levels in all major dams in the state.In 141 major dams across six regions of Maharashtra, total water storage is at 57.06%, as compared to 43.5% in 2020. Pune and the Konkan region have been the major gainers in the last few days in terms of water stock in dams.“For Maharashtra, it was a very good week of rain. Last year, after cyclone Nisarga in June, rainfall activity in a major part of the state dropped in July. This year, major dams have healthy water storage and it is expected to increase further with good rain expected in the next two months,” said an official from the state water irrigation department, requesting anonymity.No water was released from Khadakwasla dam on Monday. The dam is currently filled to 96.17% of capacity. On Sunday, 1,550 cusecs of water was released from the dam.“Khadakwasla dam, being small, fills up faster than other dams. If heavy rains continue next week then Panshet dam is expected to cross 95%. We have not yet made any decision on releasing water from Panshet. It depends on the rainfall activity,” said an irrigation department official, requesting anonymity. On Monday, water was released from various dams in the Bhima basin, including Kalmodi (1,271 cusecs), Vadivale (587 cusecs), Andhra (1,462 cusecs), and Kasarsai (250 cusecs).Water was also released from dams in the Krishna basin - Koyna (52,559 cusecs), Dhom (5,298), Kanher (5,005), Warana (8,720), Radhanagari (8,540); Kasari (1,439), Dhom Blakawadi (,1292), Urmodi (1,251), and Tillari (4512 cusecs).“Water releasing activity continues from dams in Kolhapur region as Radhanagari dam is 99.09% full. Koyna dam is filled to 85.06%; Last year it was 45.86% on July 26,” said the official .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4-dams-servicing-pune-filled-to-78-of-capacity-101627315359196.html

PMC officials confirmed that none of these reported 450 infected cases after taking both vaccines required hospitalisation. The civic body is collecting the information to remove vaccine hesitancy and encourage people to inoculate as vaccines do help bring down the severity of symptoms even if infected. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC said, “We have reported 450 breakthrough Covid infections or cases wherein a person has been infected despite receiving both vaccine shots. We have been collecting the data since past one month from private labs and based on the people who come for Covid testing and their replies on whether or not they have been vaccinated. The process is still on, but the good news is that none of them have been hospitalised and that the symptoms are mild. As of now, we do not know their age or which vaccine they received. However, this is just a nominal number among the people in city who have got both the doses.” As of July 25, Pune city has seen 578,269 second dose vaccines administered which accounts for 19% of the eligible beneficiaries, followed by PMC, Pune rural has fully vaccinated 17% or 585,208 of the eligible beneficiaries and PCMC has vaccinated 13% or 245,414 second dose vaccines administered. On an average, Pune district has vaccinated over 17% of its eligible beneficiaries with both the doses of the vaccine. Experts have repeatedly said that although no vaccine promises to provide 100% protection against the infection, vaccines have been known to reduce the severity of symptoms. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid adviser to the state government, who was infected after getting both the shots of the vaccine, said, “I was infected after getting the second shot, but my symptoms were mild and I did not require any hospitalisation. Despite my age, I recovered with ease hence proving that vaccines do work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-sees-450-breakthrough-covid-cases-in-a-month-none-require-hospitalisation-101627312898965.html

Since the college started last year in November, these students are demanding hostel facilities from the state tribal development department. They have written to the Adivasi Vibhag of the state government many times, and are awaiting response. “The tribal community students studying at the BJ Medical college are struggling to survive in the city along with their studies. Apart from the Covid-induced financial difficulties, we are finding it difficult seek shelter as the state tribal development department is yet to allot us hostel facilities. The college started from November 2 last year and since then we are demanding hostel facilities in Pune city by the department. Despite our repeated demands, letters and follow-ups, the officials are yet to take any action,” said Mahendra Bhoye, medical student from BJ Medical College, Pune. Many tribal community students come from remote areas across the state to study. As their financial condition is weak, the state tribal community department has set up hostels for these students. There are two hostels in Pune city, one for girls and another for boys. However, these hostels were converted to quarantine centres after the Covid pandemic outbreak, leaving students to seek alternative accommodation. “We cannot afford to stay in rented flats or rooms, as there is hardly anyone from our village to send us money. We will study, get good jobs and then only we can earn something for our family. In this situation, hostels are only our hope to stay and study in the city,” said another student Harish Kolhe. The senior officials at the state tribal development department refused to talk on the issue. One of the officials on anonymity said, “The issue is pending since last few months and we are trying to vacate the hostels to take in students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tribal-community-medical-students-demand-hostel-facilities-101627312238890.html
27-07-2021||World||US designer who won't make same-sex wedding websites loses case||A US appeals court has ruled against a web designer who didn’t want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples and sued to challenge Colorado’s anti-discrimination law, another twist in a series of court rulings nationwide about whether businesses denying services to LGBTQ people amounts to bias or freedom of speech.A three-judge panel of the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on Monday denied Lorie Smith's attempt to overturn a lower court ruling throwing out her legal challenge.The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Smith, argued that the law forced her to violate her Christian beliefs.In the 2-1 ruling, the panel said Colorado had a compelling interest in protecting the “dignity interests” of members of marginalized groups through its law.The anti-discrimination law is the same one at issue in the case of Colorado baker Jack Phillips that was decided in 2018 by the US Supreme Court.The high court decided the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted with anti-religious bias against Phillips after he refused to bake a cake for two men who were getting married. But it did not rule on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people.The Scottsdale, Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom also represented Phillips. Founded in 1994 by Christian leaders concerned about religious freedom, the group said it would appeal Monday's ruling.“The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,” the group’s senior counsel, John Bursch, said in a statement.Lambda Legal, a group that fights for the civil rights of LGBTQ people, had submitted a brief supporting the Colorado law.“This really isn’t about cake or websites or flowers,” Lambda Legal senior counsel Jennifer C. Pizer said in a statement. “It’s about protecting LGBTQ people and their families from being subjected to slammed doors, service refusals and public humiliation in countless places — from fertility clinics to funeral homes and everywhere in between.”In arguments before the three-judge panel in November, Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich asked what Smith would do if she was approached by a straight wedding planner asking her to create four heterosexual wedding sites and one for a same-sex wedding. Kristen Waggoner, a lawyer for the alliance, said Smith would not take that job.Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson questioned whether Smith should even be allowed to challenge the law since she had not started offering wedding websites yet.But if she did, Olson said, her argument would mean she would refuse to create a website for a hypothetical same-sex couple named Alex and Taylor but agree to make the same one for an opposite-sex couple with the same names. He said that would be discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.In the case of Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Olson said the Supreme Court could not agree on whether cakes are a form of expression. However, he said a subjective decision about whether a company’s service amounted to speech was not a workable way of determining discrimination.Judge Mark Beck Briscoe wrote in Monday's majority opinion that “we must also consider the grave harms caused when public accommodations discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. Combatting such discrimination is, like individual autonomy, ‘essential’ to our democratic ideals.”In his dissent, Tymkovich wrote that “this case illustrates exactly why we have a First Amendment. Properly applied, the Constitution protects Ms. Smith from the government telling her what to say or do.”In 2019, a divided three-judge panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of two Christian filmmakers who said they should not have to make videos celebrating same-sex marriage under Minnesota’s anti-discrimination law because the videos are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.The court reinstated a lawsuit brought by Carl and Angel Larsen of Telescope Media Group in St. Cloud. They also are being represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-designer-who-won-t-make-same-sex-wedding-websites-loses-case-101627406535499.html
27-07-2021||World||Facebook to restrict ad targeting of under-18s||Facebook Inc will stop allowing advertisers to target people under 18 on its platforms based on their interests or their activity on other sites, it said on Tuesday in a slew of announcements about young users.The change means advertisers will soon be able to target under-18s only by age, gender or location on Facebook, its Messenger service and its photo-sharing platform Instagram. In a blog post, Instagram said it was making the change because it agreed with youth advocates that young people might not be equipped to make decisions about targeting.A Facebook spokesman said there would be no changes to the user data the company collects.Instagram users under 16 years old will also start to be defaulted into having a private account when they join the platform, the company said, in an effort to stop unwanted contact from adults. They will still be given the option, however, to switch to a public account and current users can keep their account public.Facebook's approach to younger users has been in the spotlight after U.S. lawmakers and attorneys general slammed its leaked plans to launch a version of Instagram for children under 13. Earlier this year, a group of more than 40 state attorneys general wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to ditch the idea.The company said on Tuesday it was working on an "Instagram experience for tweens." It has said the idea of a youth-focused app is to provide parents greater transparency and controls on what younger children who want to access Instagram are doing.Several major social media companies have also rolled out versions of their apps for younger audiences, from Facebook's Messenger Kids to Alphabet Inc-owned YouTube Kids.Proponents argue that children are already on a platform and so a family-friendly version provides a safer environment, but critics say Facebook should not be trying to hook young kids on its services due to risks to their development, mental health and privacy.Age verification of children is an issue on many social media sites, which prohibit kids under 13 but often fail to identify and remove underage users. In a separate blog on Tuesday, Facebook's head of youth products, Pavni Diwanji, said it was using artificial intelligence to improve this verification and remove underage accounts.Instagram also said it was making it harder in several countries for adults who have shown potentially suspicious behavior - such as recently being reported by a young user - to find young people's accounts, either through searching user names or having the accounts suggested to them. It said it would prevent such adults from seeing comments from young people on others' posts and that the adults would not be able to leave comments on the posts of young people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-restrict-ad-targeting-of-under18s-101627406266202.html
27-07-2021||World||Antibodies from Sinovac's Covid shot fade after 6 months, booster helps: Study||Antibodies triggered by Sinovac Biotech's COVID-19 vaccine declined below a key threshold from around six months after a second dose for most recipients, but a third shot had a strong booster effect, a lab study showed.Chinese researchers reported the findings from a study of blood samples from healthy adults aged between 18-59 in a paper published on Sunday, which has not been peer reviewed.Among participants who received two doses, two or four weeks apart, only 16.9% and 35.2% respectively still had neutralising antibodies above what researchers regard as a detectable threshold level six months after the second shot, the paper said.Those readings were based on data from two cohorts involving more than 50 participants each, while the study gave third doses of the vaccine or placebo to a total of 540 participants.Researchers said it was unclear how the decrease in antibodies would affect the shot's effectiveness, since scientists have yet to figure out precisely the threshold of antibody levels for a vaccine to be able to prevent the disease.Apart from durable antibodies, other components in humans immune systems such as T cells and B cell memory elicited by the vaccine may also contribute to protection, researchers involved in the study said, although the study did not provide data on those factors."In the short-to-medium term, ensuring more people complete the current two-dose schedule of CoronaVac (Sinovac's vaccine) should be the priority," the paper said.Participants in some cohorts who received a third dose of the Sinovac shot about six months after the second showed around a 3-5 fold increase in antibody levels after a further 28 days, compared with the levels seen four weeks after the second shot.As of end-June, Sinovac has delivered more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine, a major vaccination tool in China, Brazil, Indonesia and Chile.Other COVID-19 vaccine makers are seeking to get authorisation for booster shots. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said earlier this month they had planned to ask U.S. and European regulators within weeks to authorise a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, based on evidence of greater risk of infection six months after inoculation and the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a senior health ministry official in Indonesia, told Reuters on Tuesday that clinical data from the country showed the reduced antibody level is still enough to provide protection, without providing details.She said the immunisation advisory board recommends a booster vaccination 12 months after the second dose.Indonesia has started giving booster shots produced by Moderna to medical workers this month, including those who had received Sinovac doses.Philippines' Health Secretary Francisco Duque said on Tuesday there is no recommendation yet from the country's vaccine expert panel on giving a booster shot but experts are discussing the possibility.Turkey has already started offering a third dose from either Sinovac or Pfizer to some people who have got Sinovac shots.The research paper on Sinovac's vaccine said that the study did not test the antibodies' effect against more transmissible variants, and that further research was needed to assess antibody duration after a third shot.The study was conducted by researchers at disease control authorities in Jiangsu province, Sinovac, and other Chinese institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibodies-from-sinovac-s-covid-shot-fade-after-6-months-booster-helps-study-101627401377606.html

The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful," Fanone fumed, slamming his fist on the table.The attack on the US Capitol followed a speech by Donald Trump as Capitol police scrambled to protect lawmakers busy counting electoral college votes to certify Joe Biden as the winner of 2020 presidential elections. The US House of Representatives, where Democrats had the majority, impeached Trump on the charge of inciting violence in the Capitol but the Republican leader was acquitted in an evenly-split Senate for the second time since conviction required a two-thirds vote.The House panel investigating the attack comprises seven Democrats and two Republicans who had voted for Trump’s second impeachment. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy refused to seat Republican members on the committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vetoed his two choices citing “integrity” of the probe.On Tuesday, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Trump critic, asked four officers appearing for the hearing whether the Capitol attack felt like “old history” to them. "Sometimes I get, you know, we hear out there it's time to move on, right? It's been six whole months, time to move on. Does this feel like old history and time to move on, and just say yes or no," the Illinois Republican asked.“No,” responded all four officers."There can be no moving on without accountability. There can be no healing until we make sure this can't happen again," DC police officer Daniel Hodges said.Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell told the House panel that Trump’s remarks about the “loving” crowd outside US Capitol are “insulting”, adding that Trump himself “helped to create this monstrosity.” "To me, it is insulting, it is demoralizing because everything that we did was to prevent everyone in the capitol from getting hurt," the officer said, responding to a question from Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/went-to-hell-and-back-us-officers-slam-trump-allies-for-downplaying-jan-6-riots-101627404693006.html

The Indian side had earlier also lined up a meeting with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.“The United States and India have a strong strategic partnership founded on shared values and a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the state department said in a statement. “The US supports India’s emergence as a leading global power and vital partner in efforts to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity and economic inclusion.”The statement went on to describe the Indo-Pacific as “front and centre” and recalled a Quad leaders’ summit in March that US President Joe Biden had hosted with the three prime ministers - Modi, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga. They had announced a joint Covid-19 vaccine initiative and cooperation on critical technologies, counterterrorism and infrastructure.The US state department listed out the entire expanse of ongoing cooperation between the two countries - diplomatic, economic and security issues, defence, non-proliferation, regional cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, shared democratic values, counterterrorism, the climate crisis, health, energy, trade and investment, peacekeeping, the environment, education, science and technology, agriculture, space, and oceans.On the defence front, cooperation between the two countries is reaching “new heights, including through information sharing, liaison officers, increasingly complex exercises” and the signing of agreements. As of 2020, the US had authorised $20 billion in defence-related sales to India.The statement laid out in details the work the two countries are doing in healthcare, including US assistance to India to fight the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, amounting to $200 million. Also, an estimated $400 million more was chipped in by individuals and private sector companies.The climate crisis has been another area of intense focus, the statement said, recalling US special envoy John Kerry’s visit to India in April and a climate summit that President Biden had hosted in April, which was attended by Modi and 39 other world leaders.The two countries are looking forward to launching the new Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue under the Agenda 2030 Partnership, which will be led by Kerry. And they are also eyeing a re-launch of the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership, which is to be led by US secretary of energy Jennifer Granholm later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-india-leading-global-power-and-indo-pacific-front-and-centre-101627404800174.html

Health authorities recorded 357 Covid-19 fatalities on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to 89,479 – the highest in the Middle East.The alarming spread of the variant prompted new anti-virus restrictions last week. The government ordered the closure of state offices, public places and non-essential businesses in the capital of Tehran. But as with previous government measures, the lockdown looked little like a lockdown. Tehran's malls and markets were busy as usual and workers crowded offices and metro stations.Iranian authorities have avoided imposing heavy-handed rules on a population that can little afford to bear them. The country, which has suffered the worst virus outbreak in the region, is reeling from a series of crises – tough US sanctions, global isolation, a heat wave, the worst blackouts in recent memory and ongoing protests over water shortage in the southwest.Now, health officials warn that hospitals in the capital are overwhelmed with breathless Covid patients too numerous to handle. Fewer than 3 per cent of Iranians have been fully vaccinated in the sanctions-hit country. Many front-line medical workers have been vaccinated with Iran's locally produced shots or the Chinese state-backed Sinopharm vaccine that may be less effective than other inoculations.Iranian government announced that its homemade vaccine provides 85 per cent protection from the coronavirus, without disclosing data or details. Iran also imports Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, as well as the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot through the United Nations-backed COVAX program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-reports-34-900-new-covid-19-cases-in-record-single-day-spike-101627398440863.html
27-07-2021||World||US CDC to unveil new mask guidance for fully vaccinated people amid Delta surge: Report||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to announce revised guidance on face masks for fully vaccinated individuals amid rising cases of highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus, according to news agency Reuters.The United States has been witnessing a resurgence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. But the breakthrough Covid-19 cases and uncertainty over Delta variant’s ability to escape vaccine-induced immunity has caused concerns for authorities relying on vaccination to reopen economies.The fear of a possible setback to the US' Covid-19 response has reportedly prompted the CDC to reconsider its face mask guidance. The US health agency is expected to recommend fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks in certain circumstances, but the specifics are not clear, reported Reuters citing people familiar with the development.The CDC has reportedly planned a media briefing at 3pm (12.30am IST) to unveil the recommendation.In May, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks indoors or outdoors, “except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.” The recommendation was followed by a change in rules by US states and businesses, aimed at boosting the economy. But the Delta variant, first detected in India, has threatened the gains.Nearly half of the US population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 but vaccine hesitancy has slowed down the vaccination rate which was once the highest in the world. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly been urging his countrymen to get vaccinated. Biden and CDC director Rochelle Walensky have said Covid-19 is now a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” since they make up the vast majority of infections and hospitalisations.“Folks the Delta variant is no joke. Please protect yourself and your loved ones – get vaccinated,” the US president tweeted on Saturday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-to-unveil-new-mask-guidance-for-fully-vaccinated-amid-delta-surge-report-101627399978987.html

However, a special envoy still hasn’t been appointed.“The Myanmar military’s refusal to respect the inalienable rights of the Burmese people and to defend their basic well-being is flatly unacceptable,” Austin said in a lecture in Singapore.“A military exists to serve its people, not the other way around. And so we call on the Myanmar military to adhere to the ASEAN five-point consensus and to forge a lasting peace," he added.“ASEAN obviously plays a key role, or can play a key role. We certainly will continue to encourage ASEAN to continue to work this issue,” Austin said.He said the US will work with partners in the region to urge Myanmar’s military to “move in the right direction” and release civilians it has imprisoned.Austin, who is on a tour of Southeast Asia, met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday. He also met Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen to reaffirm the countries’ longstanding ties, according to a joint statement.The retired four-star Army general hopes to strengthen relationships with other Southeast Asian allies in the coming days, and will visit Vietnam and the Philippines amid tensions in the disputed South China Sea, which is largely claimed by China.“As Prime Minister Lee has counseled, we are not asking countries in the region to choose between the United States and China,” Austin said."In fact, many of our partnerships in the region are older than the People’s Republic of China itself. That’s why we are expanding our important work with countries throughout the Indo-Pacific and with ASEAN itself, a critical body that brings the region closer together, offering everyone a voice, building deeper habits of cooperation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-chief-myanmar-military-acts-flatly-unacceptable-101627396008008.html
27-07-2021||World||Popular Chinese app WeChat suspends new registrations||Tech giant Tencent Holdings’ WeChat, China’s most popular messaging app, said it was suspending registration of new users in mainland China until early August as it was undergoing a technical upgrade.The development comes amid a widening crackdown by Chinese regulators on technology and private tutoring companies.In a social media post, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, said the suspension was related to an upgrade of security technology “according to relevant laws and regulations”.“During this time, registration of new Weixin personal and official accounts has been temporarily suspended. Registration services will be restored after the upgrade is complete, which is expected in early August,” it said.It did not elaborate on either the upgrade or what the laws or regulations were.Tencent’s stocks in Hong Kong went down by nearly 9% on Tuesday, its worst day in a decade, reports said.Recently, cab-hailing giant Didi suspended registration of new users after several departments of the Chinese government launched an investigation into alleged misuse of private data.Earlier, ecommerce giant Alibaba faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behaviour.WeChat is the latest in that fast-growing list.The app says it has around 1.2 billion users worldwide with the majority of users on the Chinese mainland.Hundreds of millions of people in China use the app to message friends, make payments, book taxis, and share highlights of their lives under a category of update called “moments”.Since its launch about a decade ago, the app has come to occupy a central place in the social media lives of Chinese citizens not only in China, but among the diaspora in the world.Its use became even more widespread through the launch of mini-programmes that allow users to carry out a wide range of functions such as paying utility bills.A mini-programme in the app played a key role in implementing China’s Covid-19 control protocols. “Over 800 million people have used the Health Code Mini Programme for checking their health status as they enter public places, while some 550 million said they have used another digital travel card in the programme that provides an overview of their itinerary in the past two weeks,” state-run China Daily wrote in an article on WeChat earlier this year.In January this year, reports said WeChat’s brand value increased 25% to $67.9 billion.Beijing-based tech consultant Zhou Zhanggui told Reuters that investors were over-reacting to the “rectification” of Chinese tech companies.“The suspension of new user registrations on WeChat has no substantial impact on Tencent in the short term,” Zhou said.WeChat was one of the 59 Chinese apps banned by India in June 2020, because as per India’s information technology ministry, they were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/popular-chinese-app-wechat-suspends-new-registrations-101627396031181.html
27-07-2021||World||'This can't go on': UN calls for Covid-closed schools to reopen ASAP||Schools closed due to the coronavirus pandemic must reopen as soon as possible, the United Nations insisted Tuesday, estimating that the education of more than 600 million children was at stake."This cannot go on," James Elder, spokesman for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), told reporters in Geneva.While acknowledging the difficult choices that governments have to make when facing the Covid-19 crisis and the possible spread of the disease, "schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen," he said, calling it a "terrible mistake" to reopen bars and pubs before schools."Reopening schools cannot wait for all teachers and students to be vaccinated," he added, calling on governments to protect their education budgets despite the economic hardship caused by the pandemic.While children in the northern hemisphere are on their summer holidays, in eastern and southern Africa, an estimated 40 percent of school-age children are currently out of school.Across that region, schools are being closed due to Covid-19 surges, with more than 32 million children estimated to be out of school due to pandemic-related closures or having failed to return after their classrooms reopened.That comes on top of the estimated 37 million children who were out of school before Covid-19 struck.In nearly half the countries in Asia and the Pacific, schools have been closed for more than 200 days during the pandemic.In South America and the Caribbean, there are 18 countries and territories where schools are either closed or partially closed, Elder said.Around the world, "education, safety, friends and food have been replaced by anxiety, violence, and teenage pregnancy", he said.Citing Uganda, he said that between March 2020 and June 2021, there was a more than 20 percent increase in pregnancy among 10 to 24-year-olds.Remote learning remains out of reach for a third of pupils around the world, UNICEF said.In southeast Asia and the Pacific, 80 million children had no access to remote learning while their school was closed.Schools in Uganda were closed for 306 days with only 0.3 percent of households having an internet connection.According to a World Bank study, the pandemic will cost this generation of students $10 trillion in lost income, Elder said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-can-t-go-on-un-calls-for-covid-closed-schools-to-reopen-asap-101627393113643.html
27-07-2021||World||Thousands of foreigners leave Indonesia amid Covid-19 crisis||Thousands of foreigners have left Indonesia in recent weeks, airport records released Tuesday showed, apparently spurred by a brutal pandemic wave and a general shortage of vaccines, which have gone to high-priority groups first.Indonesia now has the most confirmed daily cases in Asia, as infections and deaths have surged over the past month and India’s massive outbreak has waned. Infections peaked in mid-July, with the highest daily average reported at more than 50,000 new cases each day. Until mid-June, daily cases had been running at about 8,000.Since early this month, nearly 19,000 foreign nationals have left through Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in the capital, Jakarta.The exodus increased significantly in the past three days alone, accounting for nearly half of all individual departures this month, said Sam Fernando, who heads the immigration authority at the airport.Japan's ambassador to Indonesia, Kenji Kanasugi, said the difficulty of getting vaccines for foreign nationals has prompted some Japanese citizens to get vaccinated in their home country.“Amid a pandemic situation that is very difficult for all of us, some Japanese citizens in Indonesia will temporarily return to Japan,” Kanasugi said on Instagram earlier this month.Japanese and Chinese nationals made up the largest share of departures, with 2,962 and 2,219 individuals respectively, followed by 1,616 South Korean citizens. Airport figures also showed departures by 1,425 Americans, as well as 842 French, 705 Russian, 700 British, 615 German and 546 Saudi Arabian citizens.Initially, only representatives of foreign countries and international nonprofit organizations were eligible for the government's free vaccine program. The program was expanded last month to include those aged 60 and older, as well as teachers and education staff.Still, television reports showed foreigners complaining about the difficulties they've faced getting vaccinated.Wiku Adisasmito, a spokesman for the National Covid-19 Task Force, said Tuesday that limited vaccine supply remains a challenge. He expressed hope that 45 million more doses set to arrive in August would improve the situation.Indonesia, home to 270 million people, had secured at least 151.8 million vaccine doses by late July. The vast majority of doses — 126.5 million — are from the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.Indonesia's confirmed daily death toll surpassed 2,000 for the first time on Tuesday, hitting 2,069. The Health Ministry reported 45,203 new confirmed cases as the health system struggles to cope, and even patients fortunate enough to get a hospital bed are not guaranteed oxygen.Several countries have announced new bans or restrictions on travelers from Indonesia, including neighboring Singapore and the Philippines.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Taiwan and Hong Kong are among the nations and territories that have placed Indonesia on their travel ban list.Overall, Indonesia has reported more than 3.2 million cases and 86,835 fatalities. Those figures are widely believed to be a vast undercount due to low testing and poor tracing measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-foreigners-leave-indonesia-amid-covid-19-crisis-101627392237127.html
27-07-2021||World||Pentagon chief reprimanded China, promises larger role in Asia||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sought to reassure the Asia-Pacific that the US was committed to engagement in the region, while vowing to challenge what he called China’s aggression.“We will not flinch when our interests are threatened,” Austin said in a speech Tuesday in Singapore. “Yet we do not seek confrontation.”Austin’s remarks focused on US ties with Association of Southeast Asian Nations, including the millions of vaccines that Washington has donated to the region. But he also stressed that the US and its partners faced a common challenge in China.The former US Army general told the event hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies that Washington would work “with partners to deter coercion and aggression across the spectrum of conflict,” including Chinese maritime claims in regional waters and assertive military actions.“Unfortunately, Beijing’s unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law isn’t just occurring on the water,” Austin said. “We have also seen aggression against India, destabilizing military activity and other forms of coercion against the people of Taiwan, and genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.”Austin’s trip, his second to the region as secretary, comes at a time of mounting US-China tensions and as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a surge in coronavirus cases. Diplomats from Washington and Beijing held contentious meetings in the Chinese port city of Tianjin on Monday, where America’s No. 2 diplomat Wendy Sherman and Foreign Minister Wang Yi both aired a series of grievances.The Pentagon chief’s visit coincides with the US military drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq, a move that will allow Washington to shift more of its focus to the Western Pacific. That strategic shift will be part of talks during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Asia this week. The top American diplomat will travel to New Delhi to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday before flying to Kuwait.Austin was greeted by Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen after he arrived and reviewed soldiers in dress uniform. The two men discussed “the regional security environment and agreed on the importance of sustaining a rules-based order,” according to a joint statement.He later met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said in a Facebook post they “had a good discussion on regional and international developments, as well as defense cooperation.” Austin is scheduled to deliver a speech later in the day about the value America places on its regional partners before traveling to meet his counterparts in Vietnam and the Philippines.US, China Leave Room to Talk After Contentious MeetingsIn his speech, Austin said the US would help the region “build back better” after Covid-19 by helping fight the pandemic, invest in defense capabilities that can help states deter threats. But even as he referred to the “specter of coercion from rising powers,” he reaffirmed that American didn’t want a military clash with China.“I am committed to pursuing a constructive, stable relationship with China, including stronger crisis communications with the People’s Liberation Army,” he said. “Big powers need to model transparency and communication. And we hope that we can work together with Beijing on common challenges, especially the threat of climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-chief-reprimanded-china-promises-larger-role-in-asia-101627387010283.html
27-07-2021||World||IMF downgrades India’s growth projection due to second wave of Covid-19 pandemic||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has set back the Indian economy severely, according to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) projections for the world economy released on Tuesday, which also forecast a split global recovery from the crisis, with access to coronavirus vaccines making the difference.Advanced economies that have better access to Covid-19 vaccines are projected to recover faster and sooner than those struggling to inoculate their citizens, the IMF has suggested. Its report has upgraded projections for advanced economies and downgraded them for emerging and developing economies such as India.“Growth prospects in India have been downgraded following the severe second Covid wave during March-May and expected slow recovery in confidence from that setback,” said the IMF’s July World Economic Outlook update.From 12.5% growth that the IMF had projected for 2021 in a report in April – just as India was beginning to feel the brunt of the second wave - it slashed the estimate by three percentage points to 9.5% in the July update. As the same time, the IMF upgraded the projection for 2022 by 1.6 percentage point from 6.9% to 8.5%.India is not the only economy hit hard by the second wave. The IMF reported “similar dynamics” for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam - “where recent infection waves are causing a drag on activity”.The IMF warned in the report that steady economic recovery around the world will continue to be impeded by “renewed waves”, citing India as an example.On the subject of global recovery, the report said, “Vaccine access has emerged as the principal fault line along which the global recovery splits into two blocs: those that can look forward to further normalisation of activity later this year (almost all advanced economies) and those that will still face resurgent infections and rising Covid death tolls.”It added, “The recovery, however, is not assured even in countries where infections are currently very low so long as the virus circulates elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-downgrades-india-s-growth-projection-due-to-second-wave-of-covid-19-pandemic-101627392310973.html
27-07-2021||World||Chinese Prez Xi Jinping's Tibet visit 'a threat to India': US Congressman||Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting Tibet last week is a threat to India, an influential US lawmaker has said, accusing the Joe Biden-led administration of not doing enough to stop the Chinese "march".Xi on Wednesday last made an unannounced three-day trip to Nyingchi in Tibet, close to the border with Arunachal Pradesh. Xi, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, met top officials of the Tibet Military Command and reviewed development projects in the region.In an interview to Fox News, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes said: "Just last week, you had Xi Jinping, the Chinese dictator, on the border with India, in Tibet, claiming victory. This was the first time in 30 years, I believe, that a Chinese dictator had been to Tibet, and also threatening India, over a billion people also a nuclear power; threatening India that he's going to build a big water project, possibly cut off water to India."During his visit to Nyingchi, Xi visited the Nyang River Bridge to inspect the ecological preservation in the basin of the Brahmaputra river, which is called Yarlung Zangbo in Tibetan language.China this year approved plans to build a huge dam over the Brahmaputra river during the current 14th Five-Year Plan, which raised concerns in the riparian states of India and Bangladesh.“So, no matter what you plug into the propaganda machine, you can build all the narratives you want here in Washington, D.C., but then there's reality. The reality is that the Chinese are on the march, and the (President Joe) Biden administration is letting them do whatever they want," Nunes said.A senior Republican in the House of Representatives representing the 42nd Congressional district of California, Nunes was the chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee from 2015 to 2019.Xi’s visit to Tibet took place amidst the current India-China military tensions in eastern Ladakh.India and China have been locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC).China is accused of suppressing cultural and religious freedom in Tibet. China has rejected the accusations.Since becoming President in 2013, Xi has pursued a firm policy of stepping up security control of Tibet. Beijing has been cracking down on Buddhist monks and followers of the Dalai Lama, who despite his exile remains a widely admired spiritual leader in the remote Himalayan region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-prez-xi-jinping-s-tibet-visit-tibet-a-threat-to-india-us-congressman-101627391186963.html

The researchers said that those at moderate risk were four times more likely to have Covid-19 and five times more likely to die following confirmed infection than the low-risk group.  “In spite of the shielding strategy , high-risk individuals were at increased risk of death. Furthermore , to be effective as a population strategy , shielding criteria would have needed to be widely expanded to include other criteria , such as the elderly ,” the study said.  During the early pandemic days , many Western countries used shielding , or extended self-isolation , to protect people presumed to be at high risk from Covid-19 and reduce strain on health infrastructure. The study , led by the University of Glasgow , investigated the effectiveness of the shielding strategy by comparing Covid-19 outcomes among shielded and unshielded individuals in the West of Scotland.  The researchers looked at data between March and May 2020 from 1.3 million patients registered with GP practices in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC). About 2.03% of the registered patients were advised to shield while nearly 27% were classified as a moderate risk due to health conditions such as diabetes. Among the shielded group , 299 (1.1%) confirmed infections and 140 deaths (0.51%) were reported.  The findings suggest that the strategy may not have been as effective at protecting those at the highest risk from infection and death as hoped. Professor Jill Pell , director of the University of Glasgow’s Institute of Health and Wellbeing and co-author of the study , said in a statement that shielding should be used alongside other population-wide measures such as physical distancing , face coverings and hand hygiene to protect high-risk individuals.  “Our study also showed that shielding may be of limited value in reducing burden on health services because , in spite of the shielding strategy , high risk individuals were at increased risk of death ,” she added.  The study titled ‘Comparison of COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded populations’ has been published in Scientific Reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shielding-not-effective-as-hoped-people-eight-times-more-likely-to-get-covid-19-study-101627386021037.html

We will work together to ensure stability in both our regions," he said.He also stressed upon expanding bilateral coordination in the areas of technology and the environment.The Saudi minister said his country values the contributions made by the Pakistani community in the economy of the Kingdom and in the talks with his counterpart they discussed more opportunities for Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia.On his part, Qureshi said the talks primarily focused on promoting bilateral trade and investment.He said good progress was made to activate the SP-SCC, including appointment of focal persons in the countries to oversee progress.Qureshi said there are immense opportunities for Saudi Arabia for investment in SEZs under the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, while “our skilled, semi-skilled workforce and professionals can also make significant contributions to the Saudi vision 2030.”He said Pakistan wanted to expand relations with Saudi Arabia in the areas of culture, information, media, entertainment and sports. They also discussed cooperation in the area of climate change.Qureshi also thanked Saudi Arabia for supporting Pakistan in the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and playing its part in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-saudi-to-work-together-to-ensure-regional-stability-boost-economic-ties-101627382593009.html
27-07-2021||World||Chinese poet committed suicide under 'unbearable' surveillance by the CCP||A Chinese poet and current affairs commentator has committed suicide in Guangdong province following "unbearable" surveillance under the tenure of President Xi Jinping.Li Huizhi, 62, was a vocal critic of Xi Jinping's policies. He breathed his last in a hospital in Guangdong's Huizhou city, Radio Free Asia reported.His friend Li Xuewen told RFA that the poet had posted a suicide note online before taking his own life."After he had posted his suicide note online, he turned off his phone," Li Xuewen said. "He took the pesticide, and was taken to hospital after that."The note suggested that Li had found the increased surveillance under the tenure of ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping unbearable.There has been less and less room for freedom of public expression since Xi Jinping took power, the letter said.Li himself had been made a "ministry-level" stability maintenance target during the 2019 National People's Congress (NPC) meetings in Beijing.According to RFA, Li's phone was monitored and he had to report to the state security police if he wanted to make a trip out of town, the letter said.Li had also suffered a stroke in March 2021, after which his mobility had been greatly affected, it said."He was forced to use a wheelchair after the stroke, and suffered from paralysis in his right arm," Li Xuewen told RFA. "It really did a lot of damage ... he wasn't able to write properly.""But he learned pretty quickly how to type with his left hand and carried on writing articles."The letter said Li had made repeated requests for the authorities to call off their surveillance teams, but to no avail.The local state security police had replied that the decision wasn't theirs to make, and that they would convey his request higher up the chain of command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-poet-committed-suicide-under-unbearable-surveillance-by-the-ccp-101627377117767.html
27-07-2021||World||China’s Nanjing with 9mn people sealed off as Delta variant of Covid spreads||The city of Nanjing in eastern China has been virtually sealed off and residents advised to stay indoors after 31 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday in the past 24 hours, pushing the total number of coronavirus infections up to 112 in the ongoing outbreak.Local health authorities said the genetic sequencing of the virus from the cluster turned out to be of the fast-spreading Delta variant.Ding Jie from Nanjing Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said that judging from the previous related outbreaks, the Delta strain has some shown new characteristics. It has increased adaptability, can spread faster, has higher virus load, treatment time is longer, and it is easier to contract a severe form of the illness.First detected among the city’s airport workers, the new outbreak has triggered two rounds of citywide nucleic acid testing of Nanjing’s nine million residents.Health authorities are carrying out a second round of mass testing and placed tens of thousands of people under lockdown.At least five Chinese provinces and nine cities have reported cases related to the Nanjing outbreak.Following more than 30 cases on two consecutive days, the city, China’s former capital with over nine million residents, has pushed up epidemic risk levels, designating four areas as high-risk zones and 25 areas as medium-risk zones.Nanjing has suspended movie theatres, gymnasiums, indoor swimming pools, bars, bathing venues, “mahjong” halls, chess and card rooms, and other public places.Residents have been told to stay at home and to go out only if it’s essential, the authorities said on Tuesday.Strict restrictions on the number of people entering at the same time have been put in place at pharmacies, wholesale markets, shopping malls and supermarkets.Entrances of non-residents including delivery personnel have been restricted at all residential communities.The city has suspended the operation of eight long-distance bus stations, as well as bus tour services, while the airport has been closed.“Some 19 bus lines that had routes travelling to adjacent areas were limited within the city, and taxis are required not to leave the city,” a state media report said.Meanwhile, more than 560 million Chinese citizens, or 40% of the population, received both doses of a two-shot Covid-19 vaccine by June 30, Gao Fu, director-general of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Tuesday.“Now, we have started our mass inoculation programme for the latter half of the year,” Gao was quoted by official media as saying at a conference.As of July 22, China had administered over 1.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines, according to the national health commission.“To tackle new variants of the coronavirus, sharing Covid-19 vaccines should be a part of the solution so that all countries can have access to them and inoculate their population, allowing us to stem the global transmission of the disease,” Gao said, adding that if the world doesn’t adequately share vaccines, then the virus will continue to take hold globally.As of June 12, China has supplied 500 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and concentrates to more than 100 countries and international organisations, accounting for one sixth of the global output.As of Monday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stood at 92,676, and the death toll was 4,636..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-nanjing-with-9mn-people-sealed-off-as-delta-variant-of-covid-spreads-101627383549743.html

Ferguson, who influenced the governments’ response around the world with his initial Covid-19 modelling, told the BBC that though the UK is not “completely out of the woods”, the reduced risk of hospitalisations and deaths due to vaccines has “fundamentally changed” the equation."The effect of vaccines has been huge in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death and I think, I'm positive that by late September, October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic," Ferguson said.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to remove almost all restrictions from July 19 was severely criticised by health experts as the country was witnessing a worrying surge driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. Despite criticism, the UK government followed up on the plan but continued to emphasise the importance of social distancing measures and wearing face masks.While the impact of the removal of Covid restrictions is yet to be seen, Johnson is betting on the high rates of vaccination to boost one of Europe's largest economies. The daily new Covid-19 cases have fallen continuously for the last six days, with 24,950 new cases reported on Monday.The recent spike in Covid-19 cases didn’t lead to a vast increase in deaths even as hospitalisation from the virus has been on a rise. In a letter to Johnson, cabinet ministers and the NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS Providers group said the hospitals are as stretched now as they were at the height of the second wave in January.Ferguson said by October, Britain will “still have Covid with us, we will still have people dying from Covid, but we’ll have put the bulk of the pandemic behind us,” adding that there is going to be “remaining uncertainty” until autumn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-covid-19-pandemic-might-be-near-in-uk-says-epidemiologist-neil-ferguson-101627382219488.html

While the TTP has “distinctive anti-Pakistan objectives”, it also supports the Taliban militants inside Afghanistan against Afghan Forces, according to the report prepared by the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team.The TTP is said to be traditionally located in the eastern districts of Nangarhar Province, near the border with Pakistan. A reunification of TTP and certain splinter groups, including Shehryar Mehsud group, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), and Hizb-ul-Ahrar took place from December 2019 to August 2020 while Al-Qaeda was reportedly involved in the moderation between these groups, the report said.“The return of splinter groups to the TTP fold has increased its strength, of which current Member State estimates range between 2,500 and 6,000 armed fighters, with one Member State assessing that the upper range is more accurate,” the report says.Also Read | Afghan forces retake key district in northern province of Balkh from TalibanCiting information from the Member States and other interlocutors, the UN report said that the Taliban’s approach towards foreign terrorists has not been consistent. The Taliban’s effort to suppress such outfits has been “more pronounced in cases of foreign terrorist fighters with suspected leanings” Islamic State and TTP.“Attempted enforcement has reportedly led to clashes (some fatal) between the Taliban and TTP over operational restrictions placed on the latter,” the report states.Despite the Taliban’s repeated denial of any presence of foreign terrorists in Afghanistan, the report noted that fighters from various countries and militant groups continue to operate in the country and most are reported to be, at minimum, “tolerated or protected by the Taliban.” The foreign terrorists mainly comprise fighters from “Central Asia, the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation, Pakistan and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China, among others."“Although the majority are affiliated foremost with the Taliban, many also support [Al-Qaeda].

Fort Detrick is a military base located in Frederick, Maryland.The WHO said earlier this month that a second stage of the international probe should include audits of Chinese labs, amid increasing pressure from the US for an investigation into Wuhan Institute of Virology.The proposal outlined by WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus included "audits of relevant laboratories and research institutions operating in the area of the initial human cases identified in December 2019".Reacting to it, China's vice health minister Zeng Yixin said that he was "extremely surprised" by the plan, which he said showed "disrespect for common sense and arrogance towards science".Beijing has repeatedly insisted that a leak from one of its laboratories would have been "extremely unlikely", citing the conclusion reached by a joint WHO-Chinese mission to Wuhan in January. The WHO has accused China of not sharing the important raw data during the first phase of the investigation.The theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory has gained momentum in the last few months.Earlier, Chinese tabloid Global Times said it had collected five million signatures from the country's internet users on a petition to investigate the US lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-go-to-fort-detrick-lab-in-us-china-tells-who-101627367256859.html

Modi had said that India has been committed to sharing its expertise and resources with the global community in combating the pandemic.The Covid-19 resolution, adopted by the Security Council in February this year, calls for the strengthening of national and multilateral approaches and international cooperation, such as the COVAX facility, to facilitate equitable and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines in armed conflict situations, post-conflict situations and complex humanitarian emergencies.It also stressed the need to develop international partnerships particularly to scale-up manufacturing and distribution capabilities, in recognition of differing national contexts, and noted the need to maintain incentives for the development of new health products.The resolution recognised the role of extensive immunisation against Covid-19 as a global public good for health.Permanent Representative of France to the UN Nicolas de Riviere tweeted that one year after the adoption of Resolution 2532, the Security Council met on the Covid-19 situation. Resolution 2532, adopted by the Security Council in July 2020, had expressed grave concern about the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world, especially in countries ravaged by armed conflicts, or in post-conflict situations, or affected by humanitarian crises and had demanded a “general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations on its agenda.”“Despite some progress, it is far from satisfactory. We must continue to focus our efforts on a cessation of hostilities, a humanitarian pause & equitable access to vaccines,” the French envoy said.The overall global Covid-19 caseload has topped 194 million, while the deaths have surged to more than 4.16 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University.

The two leaders agreed to restore mutual trust as soon as possible.At 10 am Monday, the two sides reopened hotlines that had been silent for more than a year, South Korea said. The move came on the 68th anniversary of the armistice agreement that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War.The lines allowed for constant communication between the two sides since the start of the war but were cut off in June 2020 during one of the worst flareups in years between the Koreas. That dispute culminated later that month in Kim’s regime blowing up a liaison office on the northern side of the border.The communications channels were established in 2018 after North Korean leader Kim and Moon held summits over the course of five months between April and September. North Korea accused South Korea of violating the agreement by allowing the launches of balloon carrying anti-Pyongyang messages as a justification for cutting off communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-koreas-exchange-letters-agree-to-rebuild-ties-in-a-historic-move-101627351840333.html

When deputies arrived at the scene, the suspect opened fire at the law enforcement personnel and the two sides started an hours-long standoff.Two hours later, special weapons and tactics (SWAT) teams who approached the house were attacked by the gunman. One policeman suffered major injuries and died in hospital and another deputy was moderately injured.At around 6.30 pm (local time), the suspect and deputies exchanged more gunfire and the suspect was wounded. The suspect and others three persons locked in the house during the time of the shooting were taken to a hospital for treatment, and all died there.Wasco is in the San Joaquin Valley, about 240 kilometers northwest of Los Angeles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-killed-in-hours-long-standoff-in-us-s-california-101627350319719.html
27-07-2021||World||Germany to warn of future floods with phone alerts||Germany will issue mobile phone alerts in the future to inform citizens of impending dangers, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Monday after deadly floods prompted a rethink of the country's warning systems."Not everyone has always been enthusiastic about the idea in recent months. But I've decided that we're going to do it... There is no reasonable argument against it," Seehofer said in parliament.At least 180 people died when severe floods pummelled western Germany over two days in mid-July, raising questions about whether enough was done to warn residents ahead of time.Some 70 people are still missing after torrents of water ripped through entire towns and villages, destroying bridges, roads, railways and swathes of housing.Government spokeswoman Martina Fietz last week said the country's weather warning system and mobile phone app Nina had "worked" but admitted that "our experiences with this disaster show that we need to do more and better".Armin Schuster, president of the German civil protection agency (BBK), called for sirens to be reinstated in more areas.He also said the agency was considering introducing mobile phone alerts, but "a number of issues" would need to be talked through first, including the costs and data protection concerns.The alerts would be sent using a technology known as cell broadcast, which enables local authorities to send messages to multiple mobile phone users in a particular area at the same time.The alerts are similar to SMS messages, but can be sent and received anonymously and have the advantage of still working when networks are overloaded.The technology is not widely used in Europe, but is common in the US and Japan.Seehofer on Monday called for a mix of analogue and digital warnings. "The warning app is of no use if you are asleep at night and don't hear it. The siren, in turn, is of no use on its own because it doesn't tell people: What should they do?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-warn-of-future-floods-with-phone-alerts-101627350021507.html
27-07-2021||World||Jeff Bezos offers NASA a $2 billion discount for Blue Origin Moon lander||Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos wrote an open letter to NASA on Monday offering a $2 billion discount to allow his company to build a Moon lander.The human landing system (HLS) contract, worth $2.9 billion, was awarded to rival SpaceX in April, but Blue Origin and a third company Dynetics filed protests that are currently awaiting adjudication by the US Government Accountability Office.The United States is seeking to return to the Moon by 2024 under the Artemis program, using the lessons learned to prepare for a crewed Mars mission in the 2030s.In his letter to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said the offer would "bridge the funding shortfall" that led to the space agency picking just one contractor, instead of two which would then compete with each other.He added "this offer is not a deferral, but is an outright permanent waiver."Since losing the award, Blue Origin has been frantically lobbying to have the decision reversed, leading the Senate to pass a bill agreeing to add $10 billion to the human lander system.But the legislation is still being debated in the House, and has been branded a "Bezos Bailout" by critics.Bezos wrote that an advantage of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander was its use of liquid hydrogen for fuel, which can be mined from lunar ice in line with NASA's plans to use the Moon to refuel rockets for operations deeper into the solar system.He added that the company would test its lander in orbit around the Earth at its own cost."We stand ready to help NASA moderate its technical risks and solve its budgetary constraints and put the Artemis Program back on a more competitive, credible, and sustainable path," Bezos concluded.It is unclear whether Bezos' last-minute intervention will sway the outcome of the award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-offers-nasa-a-2-billion-discount-for-blue-origin-moon-lander-101627349146095.html
27-07-2021||World||US combat mission in Iraq to conclude by 2021 end, says Joe Biden||President Joe Biden said Monday the US combat mission in Iraq will conclude by the end of the year, an announcement that reflects the reality on the ground more than a major shift in US policy.Even before Biden took office, the main US focus has been assisting Iraqi forces, not fighting on their behalf. And Biden did not say if he planned to reduce the number of troops in Iraq, now about 2,500.The announcement comes on the heels of Biden's decision to withdraw fully from Afghanistan nearly 20 years after the US launched that war in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Together, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have heavily taxed the US military and kept it from devoting more attention to a rising China, which the Biden administration calls the biggest long-term security challenge.Also watch, First Afghanistan, now Iraq: How Joe Biden is ending America's post-9/11 warsFor years, US troops have played support roles in Iraq and in neighboring Syria, which was the origin of the Islamic State group that swept across the border in 2014 and captured large swaths of Iraqi territory, prompting the US to send troops back to Iraq that year.Speaking to reporters during an Oval Office session with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, Biden said his administration remained committed to a partnership with Iraq — a relationship that has been increasingly complicated by Iranian-backed Iraqi militia groups.The militias want all US troops out of Iraq immediately and have periodically attacked bases that house American troops.Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, said US troops will remain at risk.“Regardless of whether their deployment is called a combat mission, US troops will remain under regular attack as long as they remain in Iraq,” Caldwell said in a statement.“An American military presence in Iraq is not necessary for our safety and only risks the loss of more American life.”Biden said the US military will continue to assist Iraq in its fight against the Islamic State group, or ISIS. A joint US-Iraq statement said the security relationship will be focused on training, advising and intelligence-sharing."Our shared fight against ISIS is critical for the stability of the region and our counterterrorism operation will continue, even as we shift to this new phase we're going to be talking about,” Biden said.The shift from a US combat role to one focused on training and advising the Iraqi security forces was announced in April, when a joint US-Iraqi statement said this transition allowed for the removal from Iraq of any remaining US combat forces on a timetable to be determined later.It did not specify what combat functions the US was engaged in then, nor did Biden get into such specifics on Monday.“We're not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission,” he said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined to say how many troops would remain in Iraq by year's end."The numbers will be driven by what is needed for the mission over time, so it is more about moving to a more advising and training capacity from what we have had over the last several years,” she said.The US troop presence has stood at about 2,500 since late last year when then-President Donald Trump ordered a reduction from 3,000.The Iraqi government in 2017 declared victory over the Islamic State group, which is now a shell of its former self. Still, it has shown it can carry out high-casualty attacks. Last week, the group claimed responsibility for a roadside bombing that killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens in a busy suburban Baghdad market.In his remarks alongside Biden, al-Kadhimi thanked the United States for its support.Back home, al-Kadhimi faces no shortage of problems. Iranian-backed militias operating inside Iraq have stepped up attacks against US forces in recent months, and a series of devastating hospital fires that left dozens of people dead and soaring coronavirus infections have added fresh layers of frustration for the nation.For al-Kadhimi, the ability to offer the Iraqi public a date for the end of the US combat presence could be a feather in his cap before elections scheduled for October.Biden administration officials say al-Kadhimi also deserves credit for improving Iraq's standing in the Mideast. Last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi visited Baghdad for joint meetings — the first time an Egyptian president has made an official visit since the 1990s, when ties were severed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.The Iraqi prime minister made clear before his trip to Washington that he believes it's time for the US to wind that mission down.“There is no need for any foreign combat forces on Iraqi soil,” al-Kadhimi told The Associated Press last weekend.The US mission of training and advising Iraqi forces has its most recent origins in President Barack Obama's decision in 2014 to send troops back to Iraq.The move was made in response to the Islamic State group's takeover of large portions of western and northern Iraq and a collapse of Iraqi security forces that appeared to threaten Baghdad. Obama had fully withdrawn US forces from Iraq in 2011, eight years after the US invasion.Pentagon officials for years have tried to balance what they see as a necessary military presence to support the Iraqi government's fight against IS with domestic political sensitivities in Iraq to a foreign troop presence.The vulnerability of US troops was demonstrated most dramatically in January 2020 when Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on al-Asad air base in western Iraq. No Americans were killed, but dozens suffered traumatic brain injury from the blasts.That attack came shortly after a US drone strike killed Iranian military commander Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad International Airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-combat-mission-in-iraq-to-conclude-by-2021-end-says-joe-biden-101627345399836.html

He will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday before travelling to Kuwait on the next leg of his tour.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Monday that the security situation in Afghanistan will be a key issue during Blinken’s visit as the Indian side believes US support for Afghan forces over the next few months will be crucial for retaining the gains made under the democratic system in Kabul over the past 20 years.The Taliban stepped up its campaign to capture territory across Afghanistan once the US made it clear that it intended to complete the drawdown of its troops by next month. The US is keen on some sort of power-sharing arrangement in Kabul after facing criticism from some quarters for the nature of its withdrawal.The Indian side, on the other hand, is expected to raise the implications of the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan and the need for sustained pressure on Pakistan over terror financing and terrorist sanctuaries, the people cited above said.A coordinated Covid-19 response, including open and consistent supply chains for materials and items required for producing vaccines, will figure in the discussions in line with India’s plans to ramp up production for both domestic vaccination and subsequent global supplies, the people said.Further engagements under the rubric of the Indo-Pacific, including a possible meeting of Quad foreign ministers, an in-person Quad Summit and the Quad vaccine partnership, and bilateral contacts such as the 2+2 meeting of defence and foreign ministers are also expected to figure in the discussions.Blinken’s visit is an opportunity to “continue the high-level bilateral dialogue and bolster the India-US global strategic partnership”, the external affairs ministry said last week while announcing the visit. “Both sides will review the robust and multifaceted India-US bilateral relations, and potential for consolidating them further,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-blinken-to-visit-india-on-tuesday-afghanistan-covid-19-response-on-agenda-101627319920214.html
27-07-2021||India||Meghalaya’s response helped defuse a conflict||SHILLONG: A timely response by the Ri-Bhoi district administration of Meghalaya thwarted off what could have been another border clash with Assam on Monday. What began as a mere civic amenity project by the Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited (MeECL) by way of erecting electricity poles in Iongkhuli village on the same stretch where its Assamese counterpart had erected electric poles earlier in January, almost snowballed into a physical confrontation between Assam police and officials and members of the public in the area.According to Meghalaya officials, while the work was going on, at around 11am, a large posse of Assam government officials and senior police officials arrived at the scene and dismantled the erected poles. The act was not received well by the local residents who offered stiff resistance which almost led to fisticuffs.A timely response by the Ri-Bhoi additional district magistrate, the Superintendent of Police and senior police officials who arrived at the spot helped defuse the situation. On Tuesday, the Chief Executive Member (CEM) of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) Titosstarwell Chyne expressed concern over Assam’s intentions while observing that while on the one hand it sounds keen to resolve the border dispute, on the other it seems to openly encourage disputes with Meghalaya. “Iongkhuli village has never been in any of the disputed areas with Assam. I am surprised how it has happened like this,” he wondered.Meghalaya has identified 12 areas of difference with Assam and submitted documents on these, starting August 9, 2011. The hill state has been asking for the creation of a boundary commission monitored by the Centre to resolve the disputes. The total disputed area is around 2700 sq km. In recent years, the Assam government’s guest house which was used as the official residence of former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi was caught in a row between the two states. The residence located on a small hillock within Khanapara and Pilangakata has often been claimed by Meghalaya as part of its territory. In the past, Meghalaya government had said that it had records to prove its claim on the land.During last week’s meeting between Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad K Sangma, it was decided to no longer maintain status quo on the boundary issue but instead proceed on resolving it at the earliest. The next round of CM level meetings will be in Dispur on August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalayas-response-helped-defuse-a-conflict-101627410319962.html
27-07-2021||India||Mizoram, assam lock horns over border clashes||GUWAHATI: Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana said on Tuesday that the violent clash along the border between both states on Monday that claimed seven ives and injured 41 (on the Assam side) was the outcome of provocation by the neighbouring state, rejecting Assam’s version of events.  Assam maintains that Mizoram police were the first to start firing at its (Assam’s) police personnel and civilians, but Lalchamliana stated that his state’s security forces responded to firing initiated by the Assam side. “Yesterday’s incident was unfortunate, but Assam police should not have entered Mizoram forcibly to remove residents,” the home minister said refuting the comments of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. On Tuesday, Sarma, who visited Silchar and met those injured in clashes a day earlier, told journalists that Assam administrative and police officials who went to the border on Monday to request the Mizoram side to maintain status quo of the disputed area were first attacked by a mob of miscreants and later fired upon by Mizoram police personnel. “One shouldn’t believe all statements made by the Assam chief minister. It was Assam police personnel and civilians who entered Mizoram’s territory on Monday and created problems. When Assam police started firing, our forces had to retaliate to save themselves,” said Lalchamliana. “Assam police personnel came heavily armed and were the first to open fire. Our personnel, who were also armed with automatic weapons and light machine guns (LMGs), responded to the attack. Whatever has happened in unfortunate,” he added. On Tuesday, Lalchamliana visited the area in Vairengte where the border clashes took place a day earlier. As per a Mizoram government release, the state police has been deployed at three places along the border where “tension surged up recently due to incursion by Assam Police”. Mizoram has not put out an official statement on casualties it suffered in the clash. A staffer at the Mizoram CM’s office told HT over phone on Monday that three people sustained injuries. On Tuesday, Chief Minister Zoramthanga tweeted a photo of one injured getting treated at a hospital in Kolasib for ”grievous injuries”. “The situation along the border is peaceful on Tuesday. We believe violence will not solve anything and we want resolution of the border issue through talks. I can’t comment on when and where the CMs of both states will have a meeting to discuss the issue,” said Lalchamliana. He added that the union home secretary has called for a meeting with chief secretaries and police chiefs of both Mizoram and Assam at New Delhi on Wednesday to discuss Monday’s incident and also the border issue. “But the union home secretary is an IAS-office of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre.

Dr Prasad said that the roles of such agencies should be scrutinised as part of the NIA investigation.The plea said that officials associated with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), and the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), among others, are “material witnesses” in the investigation process.Dr Prasad stated that owing to the “nefarious, terrorist, expansionist, aggressive and animus behaviour of China at the borders in the northeast region of India,” it would be dangerous to not undertake a “detailed investigation of the origins and spread of the virus from China to India.” The plea added that the probe will help disclose the “entire truth” and the “guilty can be punished in accordance with various provisions of Indian laws.”The petition has moved through advocate Mahmoood Pracha and sought filing of FIR under section 156 (3) Cr PC and section 16 of the NIA Act.This follows China’s latest jibe at the US over investigation into the origin of Covid-19 pandemic. Spokesperson of China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, Zhao Lijian on Monday took to Twitter to state that laboratories are to be probed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) officials should “go to Fort Detrick.”“Only in this way can truth be revealed to the world,” Zhao wrote on the microblogging site.Earlier this month, the WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that a second stage of the international probe should include “audits of relevant laboratories and research institutions operating in the area of the initial human cases identified in December 2019.Last month, Ghebreyesus had urged China to cooperate with the ongoing probe. “We need transparency to understand or know or find the origin of this virus... after the report was released, there were difficulties in data sharing, especially with raw data,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-created-covid-19-as-biological-weapon-plea-in-delhi-hc-seeks-nia-probe-101627408757501.html

The survey that analysed responses from over 18,000 Indians living in 311 districts said that 5% of those planning to travel have already made bookings for their accommodation. Meanwhile, as many as 9,146 people (63%) said that they don’t have any travel plans.The Centre on Tuesday warned that the pandemic is “far from over” with 22 districts – the maximum being in Kerala (seven) and Manipur (five) — witnessing an upward swing in the daily Covid-19 cases during the last four weeks.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-snatched-14-5-million-tourism-jobs-in-q1-of-2020-21-fiscal-shows-data-101627407513224.html
27-07-2021||India||Second Bommai to become CM, checks all boxes for BJP||For the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), Basavaraj Bommai is the ideal candidate to replace BS Yediyurappa. The 61-year-old is a Lingayat, obedient to the Central leadership and a close associate of BS Yediyurappa. According to party insiders, all groups within the BJP are happy with the decision and believe that the change of power, that could have affected the party adversely, has culminated well with Bommai’s appointment. Unlike Yediyurappa, who was part of the BJP from its inception, Bommai started his political career with the Janata Dal and worked with senior leaders including HD Deve Gowda and Ramakrishna Hegde during this time. In 2008 he left the Janata Dal (United) and joined the BJP. A graduate in mechanical engineering, Bommai was elected as a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council in 1998 and 2004 from Dharwad. He was thrice elected to Karnataka Legislative Assembly from the Shiggaon constituency in Haveri district in 2008, 2013 and 2018. This is the second time in the state’s political history that a father-son duo would have held the chief minister’s post. His father SR Bommai was instrumental in the Janata Party forming a government in the state for the first time in 1983 and became the CM in 1988, after then chief minister Ramakrishna Hedge resigned over snooping charges. The other father-son duo to have achieved this feat are Janata Dal Secular President HD Deve Gowda and his son Kumaraswamy. His socialist father is best remembered for a landmark battle in the Supreme Court known as SR Bommai versus Union of India case that he fought after his government in Karnataka fell following defections. The judgment in that case laid down certain guidelines against the misuse of Article 356 of the Constitution by the Central governments to impose President’s Rule on states with unfriendly governments. He had moved court against the governor’s refusal to provide him an opportunity to prove his majority on floor of the house. The selection of junior Bommai, a Lingayat, comes after several pontiffs from Lingayat mutts in the state warned the BJP central command against removing Yediyurappa, a tall leader of the Lingayat community. The Lingayat community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and they have been a loyal vote base for the saffron party. His appointment is expected to appease the community, according to BJP leaders. During this term as the home minister, he made headlines over his announcement to conduct National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Karnataka, even before the Union government issued any orders. In October 2019, he said the Karnataka government is collecting information on immigrants in the state and will work towards Assam-like NRC after a discussion with the Central government. However, following a backlash, he claimed that it will only be a survey of overstaying foreigners and not be an NRC. He was also a trusted lieutenant of BS Yediyurappa, who often spoke in the assembly on behalf of the government. “Even though he was the home minister, he knew about the development in all departments. You find him often in the assembly, answering the questions on behalf of several departments with clarity,” pointed out a BJP leader. Political analyst and a faculty at the Azim Premji University, A Narayana, said the appointment of Bommai was a win-win situation for all stakeholders in the party. “First of all, he is a Lingayat, which takes care of the party’s biggest vote bank. He is close to Yediyurappa, which makes the veteran leader less unhappy with the new appointment. For Modi and Amit Shah, he is someone who will be obedient...,” he said. However, a senior leader in the BJP, on the condition of anonymity, said that even though he is close to Yediyurappa, more than Bommai’s appointment, the position given to his son would decide Yediyurappa’s approach towards the party. “As long as Bommai doesn’t become a powerful leader, who pushes back against the central leadership, he will remain in the post. As of now, he is an ideal candidate for the central leadership,” said the leader who didn’t want to be named..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-bommai-to-become-cm-checks-all-boxes-for-bjp-101627407919769.html

The allocated budget is 34% less than the revised estimate of ₹1,11,500 crore 2020-21 financial year, a statement released by the ministry of rural development on Tuesday revealed.However, in terms of budgetary allocation, there has been an increase of ₹11,500 crore, from ₹61,500 crore to ₹73,000 crore during the period under review.The hike in MGNREGA allocation comes a week after Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) announced an assistance package of ₹532 crore for 32 lakh MGNREGA workers, who have worked in the state for the past three months. In addition to the daily wage of ₹207 that workers are given under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, they will receive an additional ₹50 for each day of work done, said a press release from panchayati raj department.MGNREGA is a socio-economic measure introduced by the United Progressive Alliance government in 2005. It provides at least 100 days of employment to adult members of every household, in a bid to provide livelihood security in rural areas.“During the previous financial year 2020-21, at least 11.19 crore people were provided employment and more than 389.23 crore person-days were generated. In the current financial year 2021-22 (as on 23.07.2021), 6.51 crore persons have been provided employment and more than 130.9 crore person-days have been generated under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.

27-07-2021||India||US backs India as global power and vital partner in Indo-Pacific as Blinken begins visit||The US said on Monday it backs India’s emergence as a leading global power and a vital partner to make the Indo-Pacific a region of stability and economic inclusion as secretary of state Antony Blinken began a two-day visit to the country. Blinken, the third senior member of the Biden administration to travel to India this year, is expected to hold wide-ranging discussions on issues such as the situation in Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific during his meetings with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. The secretary of state flew into New Delhi hours after US defense secretary Lloyd Austin accused China of working against the shared principles and interests of the US and its partners across the Indo-Pacific. While the US and its friends are committed to inclusion and freedom of the seas, China had shown “unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law”, he said. Opposing China’s claim to the majority of the South China Sea, Austin said: “We have also seen aggression against India…destabilising military activity and other forms of coercion against the people of Taiwan…and genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.” A fact sheet issued by the US state department soon after Blinken arrived in New Delhi on Monday evening said his engagements will reaffirm Washington’s commitment to strengthen the bilateral partnership and underscore cooperation on shared priorities. “The United States supports India’s emergence as a leading global power and vital partner in efforts to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity and economic inclusion,” the fact sheet said. The US and India are closely coordinating on regional security issues, such as Afghanistan, and are also partnering to strengthen the global Covid-19 response, on issues ranging from addressing infectious disease outbreaks to securing global supply chains. Besides working to expand cooperation in international organisations, the US will host the fourth 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers later this year. At the maiden Quad Leaders’ Summit in March, US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined their Japanese and Australian counterparts in pledging to respond to the economic and health impacts of Covid-19, combat the climate crisis and address shared challenges in cyber-space, critical technologies, counter-terrorism, quality infrastructure investment, and maritime security. The US has provided more than $200 million for India’s Covid-19 relief and response efforts, including more than $50 million in emergency supplies and training for more than 218,000 frontline health workers. US pharmaceutical companies coordinated with Indian counterparts on issues such as voluntary licensing and technology transfer agreements to increase global manufacturing capacity for Covid-19 vaccines, therapies and conducting clinical trials. Though the US has also outlined plans to share millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines from its surplus stocks, actual supplies have been held up by differences over the issue of indemnity for American manufacturers of the jabs. Under the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership launched in April, the two sides intend to launch a new climate action and finance mobilisation dialogue and relaunch the strategic clean energy partnership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-backs-india-as-global-power-and-vital-partner-in-indo-pacific-as-blinken-begins-visit-101627406300292.html

27-07-2021||India||Clash over land leaves 13 injured at Tripura-Mizoram border||A clash over a plot of land between two different communities left at least 13 injured at Damcherra in North district of Tripura, said police on Tuesday. Damcherra is Tripura’s last village before the inter-state boundary with Mizoram. Of the injured persons, seven are from the Bru community while the rest are from the Halam community. This is likely to be the first noteworthy incident of violence involving the Brus since the process to settle around 30,000 members of the community in Tripura started earlier this year in April, when about 1,600 Bru families were permanently settled in Dhalai and North Tripura districts. Halam communities of Tripura belong to the Kuki-Chin tribes of Tibeto-Burmese ethnic group.“We took a suo moto case. No one has been arrested so far. We have imposed Section 144 in the area for an indefinite period,” said superintendent of police (SP) of North district Bhanupada Chakraborty. Police said there was tension between the two communities over possession of the land since the past 15 days which ended in a clash on Monday leaving 13 injured. Two among the injured Brus were admitted to a hospital in Dharmanagar with serious head injuries. A quadripartite agreement signed between the Centre, Tripura and Mizoram governments and Bru leaders in January last year allowed over 32,000 Brus permanent resettlement in Tripura. The Centre also announced a ₹600 crore package for resettlement of the migrants in clusters.The decision led to several protests by a few local organisations against their permanent settlement. Two persons including a fireman were killed and 20 others injured during the anti-Bru settlement protests last year. The Brus came to the state in 1997 to escape an ethnic clash in Mizoram and started staying at six relief camps in the North District. Nearly 5000 Bru families have been repatriated since 2009 in the ninth phase of repatriation. Expressing deep concern over the issue, CPM demanded that the state government take measures to restore peace and normalise the situation in the affected area. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharjee said the party suspected “a conspiracy” behind the incident. “We believe that police will investigate the matter and take proper action,” Bhattacharjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clash-over-land-leaves-13-injured-at-tripura-mizoram-border-101627404500053.html

Although the number is less in comparison to April and January this year when the global daily case count was 9,03,306 and 8,40,131, respectively, it is still higher to assume that the pandemic has subsided.Coronavirus cases in the United States have witnessed 1.4 times increase in the past 14 days, while in France it has surged 3.5 times. Infections have gone up by 2.7 times in Italy and 1.2 times in Japan as well, according to data from Outworldindata.“This is an indication for us that we still cannot relax and must continue to strictly follow Covid management rules in order to contain the virus,” the government said, adding that “we may be tired, but the virus is not.”Indonesia has become the new epicentre for Covid-19 cases after the country reported 45,416 fresh cases on Sunday, thereby overtaking India, Brazil and the US in terms of new infections, Worldometer data revealed.As far as India is concerned, it reported less than 30,000 new cases on Tuesday – the first time in 132 days with 29,689 infections, Union health ministry’s bulletin data showed.The warning comes at a time when India is fearing the probable arrival of a third wave of Covid-19, even as declining new Covid-19 cases has resulted in ignorance towards following pandemic protocols such as maintaining social distance and wearing of masks.Furthermore, the Delta variant that was first identified in India, has become the most dominant of its kind with it being found in 124 countries now, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week. “It is expected that it will rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant circulating lineage over the coming months,” the UN health agency said in its epidemiological update on July 21.Notably, Delta variant accounts for over 75% of the Covid-19 cases across the world, including Great Britain, Russia, Australia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Singapore and India, among others, the WHO report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-may-be-tired-but-covid-is-not-centre-warns-as-fear-of-third-wave-lingers-101627400899187.html

A 1984-batch IPS officer from Gujarat cadre, Asthana was appointed as Delhi police chief, three days before he was to superannuate."Consequent upon appointment of Shri Rakesh Asthana, IPS (GJ:84), Director General, BSF, as Commissioner of Police, Delhi, the competent authority has approved that Shri S. S. Deswal, IPS (HY:84), Director General, ITBP shall hold additional charge of the post of DG, BSF vice Shri Asthana, till the appointment and joining of the regular incumbent or until further orders whichever is earlier," the order from the Union home ministry said.Known for his professional competence and integrity, Asthana was drawn into an unsavory controversy when he locked horns with then CBI Director Alok Verma as a Special Director on conduct over high profile cases. Asthana was shunted out along with Alok Verma, on January 10, 2019, and appointed to the post of Director General Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).While the government had given additional charge of Delhi Police to Balaji Srivastava after the retirement of S N Shrivastava on June 30, the decision to appoint Asthana has been taken as the Home Minister Amit Shah wants to reform Delhi Police by making it more professional and responsive. Asthana is known for criminal investigation and was the key player in the unravelling of the Indian Mujahideen in Gujarat in the past decade.Although Asthana was the front runner for appointment to the Director CBI after Rishi Shukla, he was overlooked on technical legal grounds raised by the committee members.Asthana as DG of NCB has been at the forefront of drug seizures and has directed the investigation into the influx of cocaine and synthetic drugs in the Mumbai film industry.

Therefore, availability of 516 million doses till the end of a particular month does not mean that every dose supplied till that month is going to be consumed or administered,” it read.The Centre explained that vaccine supplies remain in pipeline, which should be available for the next few days till the next batches of vaccine jabs materialise in a particular state or district or sub-district to keep the vaccination process going.Between January and July 26, the Centre supplied a total of 457 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to the states and Union territories, and an additional 60.3 million doses are expected to be supplied by July 31, the health ministry projection showed. “This will amount to a total of 517 million doses supplied from January 2021 to July 31, 2021,” the statement added.India has administered 440 million vaccine doses under the nationwide vaccination drive so far, which the Centre claims to be the “largest number achieved in the world”. Of these, 9.6 beneficiaries got both doses of the vaccine, the health ministry statement said.As many as 11.97 crore jabs were administered in June while 10.62 crore jabs were given in July (till July 26). “It is the endeavour of the government to provide vaccination to eligible citizens in the shortest possible time as per availability of the Covid-19 vaccines,” the health ministry said.India on Tuesday reported 29,689 fresh Covid-19 cases, which was the first time in 132 days (since March 16) that the country’s daily case count was less than 30,000, health ministry’s bulletin data showed. The figures were 10,000 less than Monday’s when 39,361 new cases were reported. The active caseload stands at 3,98,100, which is 1.27 per cent of the total cases, according to the bulletin data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-quashes-reports-on-missing-half-a-billion-covid-vaccine-goal-by-july-31-101627399475683.html

27-07-2021||India||Basavaraj Bommai is Karnataka’s new chief minister||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) named 61-year-old Basavaraj Bommai as Karnataka’s new chief minister following the legislative party meeting at Bengaluru’s Capitol hotel on Tuesday evening. Arun Singh, in charge of party affairs in Karnataka, and Central observers held the crucial meeting in Bengaluru. BJP’s parliamentary board had appointed Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and G Kishan Reddy as Central observers for selection of new leader. Basavaraj Bommai was the home minister in Yediyurappa’s council of ministers, which was dissolved following the 78-year-old leader’s resignation as chief minister on Monday. Bommai is considered a close confidant of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. Son of former chief minister S R Bommai, Basavaraj Bommai started his political career with the Janata Dal and worked with senior leaders including HD Devegowda and Ramakrishna Hegde. He left the Janata Dal (United) and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in February 2008. A graduate in mechanical engineering, Bommai was elected as a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council in 1998 and 2004 from Dharwad. He was thrice elected to Karnataka Legislative Assembly from the Shiggaon constituency in Haveri district in 2008, 2013 and 2018. The selection of Bommai, who is from the Lingayat community, comes after several pontiffs from Lingayat mutts in the state had warned the BJP central command against removing Yediyurappa, a tall leader of the Lingayat community. The Lingayat community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and they have been a loyal vote base for the saffron party. Even though there were speculations that the BJP may appoint a leader from a different community, it eventually zeroed down on the Lingayat leader. BS Yediyurappa resignation on Monday ended months of speculation following growing dissidence within the Karnataka unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The 78-year-old leader made the announcement in an emotional speech at an event celebrating two years in power before submitting his resignation to governor Thaawarchand Gehlot. “I’m not sad. I’m happy. I can’t thank in words PM Modi, Amit Shah, and JP Nadda for letting me be the chief minister even though I was over 75 years of age,” Yediyurappa said. “There is no question of political retirement for any reason, I’m with the karyakartas and the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/basavarai-bommai-is-karnataka-s-new-chief-minister-101627398551452.html

However, as per phase 1 trial results, the DNA plasmid-based vaccine, ZyCoV-D, was found to be immunogenic and safe. The result of the 48-participant trial was published by Lancet.Also Read | Cadila jab immunogenic, safe: Phase 1 trial data"Immunogenicity" is defined as the ability of a foreign substance to trigger an immune response in the body of a human being or an animal.An emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the DCGI will be granted after it reviews data recommended in the meeting of its Subject Expert Committee (SEC). If satisfied, the regulator is expected to approve the vaccine in August.On July 1, Zydus Cadila submitted an application, seeking EUA for its three-dose vaccine for citizens above the age of 12. It mentioned in its application that the vaccine showed an efficacy of 66.6% in an interim analysis of phase 3 trials.

Agarwal also said that such districts are very localised and in a limited set of areas.Also read | Private hospitals procured 1.27 crore Covid-19 vaccines doses in May: CentreDuring the past four weeks, 22 districts witnessed an increasing trend in the daily cases. Kerala, with seven districts — Alappuzha, Kottayam, Malappuram, Thrissur, Wayanad, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta — contributed the maximum to the list. While Manipur added five districts, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh added three each.

27-07-2021||India||Assam-Mizoram border sealed, MHA calls meeting of officials||The home ministry has called a meeting of senior officials from Assam and Mizoram even as the Central Reserve Police Force has increased deployment of personnel at Assam-Mizoram border, which remained tense on Tuesday, a day after violent clashes between two states claimed 6 lives and left 50 others injured. As Mizoram increased deployment of security personnel on its side of the contentious border, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said they will deploy 4,000 commandos along 165 km Mizoram border and will move Supreme Court seeking protection against construction of roads by Mizoram government in region, Assam considers to be its own territory.The border dispute is primarily a difference of perception. While the Mizoram government goes by 1875 border alignment to separate plains of Cachar from Lushai Hills (present day Mizoram), Assam follows 1933 demarcation, done to identify districts of present day Manipur carved from some parts of Lushai Hills. On Tuesday, the Assam-Mizoram border shared by Cachar’s district Lailapur and Kolasib district’s Vairengte, the epicentre of the bloodiest border violence between the two states, was tense but calm with the CRPF deploying additional personnel. CRPF director general Kuldiep Singh said, “Five companies (close to 500 personnel) have been deployed and another two are on standby”. The border check-posts are manned by CRPF personnel as it falls in no man’s land between the two states.“We can’t do what Mizoram has done yesterday. Assam will never use bullets against any Indian citizen, this is not in our DNA. We don’t have political fights with Mizoram but there is a reason behind yesterday’s incident. We have discussed the matter and asked Mizoram to investigate properly,” Sarma said on Tuesday, while addressing the media in Silchar. Mizoram refuted his claim and said the Assam police entered Mizoram and started firing first.“Our police personnel only fired in retaliation to firing by Assam police. It was Assam police that entered Mizoram and started assaulting our people. Any violence is unfortunate and we condole the deaths,” said Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla will be meeting chief secretaries and director generals of police (DGPs) of Assam and Mizoram on Wednesday in his office over the border dispute, people familiar with the developments in the ministry said on condition of anonymity. Other senior officers of the MHA as well as intelligence agencies and paramilitary forces are expected to attend the meeting. The MHA has asked the states to resolve the border dispute amicably without any violence and the Wednesday meeting is being seen as first steps towards facilitating such talks. Junior Union home minister, Nityanand Rai, said the ministry only acts as a facilitator for amicable settlement in case of border disputes between states and such disputes can only be resolved with the cooperation of the concerned state governments. There are at least seven such inter-state disputes with Assam being involved in four, he said. Assam has border disputes with Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya. On Tuesday morning, Assam CM visited Silchar Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) and met the injured police personnel and civilians. He also paid a floral tribute to the five police personnel killed and announced a compensation of ₹50 lakhs for their families and a government job for a family member. “The moment when the firing started, senior police officers of Assam and Mizoram were sitting and discussing the dispute. Home minister Amit Shah has spoken to the Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and me several times since yesterday. We have assured that there will be no violence from our side but we will not let Mizoram to encroach one more inch from Assam’s territory.On reasons behind the attack, Sarma alleged that they stopped several illegal activities like drugs, cattle smuggling and infiltration from Mizoram side in the past few months. “People who have entered Mizoram from Myanmar are trying to come to Assam and stay in Dima Hasao district. But we did not allow them,” he said. Sarma claimed that on June 8 this year, Assam gave a proposal to the Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga to sign an MOU that forest land will not be destroyed on either side of the border. But he (Mizoram CM) did not agree, he claimed. Lalchamliana denied Sarma’s claim of Mizoram carrying out developmental activities in Assam’s territory and pushing migrants into Assam. “We have been carrying out developmental activists in our territory, whereas people from Assam are regularly entering our area and trying to block the works,” he said.The Assam government also airlifted superintendent of Cachar district police Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar to Mumbai for further treatment. Dr Bhaskar Gupta, head of Silchar Medical College and Hospital said SP was taken to Mumbai in a special air ambulance. “He has severe injuries in the lower part of his body. The family members decided to shift him to Mumbai for better treatment,” he said. Nimbalkar will be admitted to Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute, Mumbai, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assammizoram-border-sealed-mha-calls-meeting-of-officials-101627396991296.html
27-07-2021||India||Private hospitals procured 1.27 crore Covid-19 vaccines doses in May, administered 83.61 lakh jabs till June 15: Centre||Minister of state for health Bharati Pravin Pawar told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that private hospitals have directly procured 1.27 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine in May. "Under the 'Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy', which came into effect from May 1, a total of 127.34 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines were procured directly by private hospitals in May," Pawar said in a written reply.But the private hospitals administered only 83.61 lakh doses between May and June 15. "A total of 83.61 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered at private Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) from May to 15th June, 2021," she told the Upper House of the Parliament.The Centre introduced the ‘Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy' to ensure flexible pricing, procurement, and administration of vaccines and to augment production and availability across the country. Under the policy, the states and the private hospitals were allowed to directly procure up to 50% of the vaccine doses produced by the manufacturers.Pawar’s response comes a few days after Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy once again requested the Centre to take back unused vaccine doses procured by private hospitals and re-allot them to the states in a bid to boost their vaccination drive.“In reality, the private hospitals are not vaccinating fully to their capacity. Whatever these people are earmarked and whatever they are not able to proceed with, if that quota (of vaccines) is re-allotted to the state government, it would help us in doing a better job,” Reddy told the Prime Minister on July 17, reported PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-hospitals-procured-1-27-crore-covid-19-vaccines-doses-in-may-administered-83-61-lakh-jabs-till-june-15-centre-101627395018409.html

Governments concerned and that the Central Government acts only as a facilitator for amicable settlement of the dispute in the spirit of mutual understanding," Rai said in the Lower House.Rai’s statement comes a day after violent clashes along the Assam-Mizoram border claimed six lives, including five police personnel, and left nearly 50 others injured. The two neighbouring states have been feuding for over five decades, ever since Mizoram was carved out of Assam, as a then Union territory in 1972.The chief ministers of Assam and Mizoram, Himanta Biswa Sarma and Zormathanga, got embroiled in a verbal spar on Twitter until Union home minister Amit Shah intervened, following which the chief ministers spoke on the phone and agreed to maintain status quo and peace on their respective borders. Sarma belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while Zoramthanga’s Mizo National Front is a partner in the National Democratic Alliance government at the BJP-led Centre.Rai, who was responding to a question submitted by Bahujan Samaj Party MP Haji Fazlur Rehman, said issues regarding demarcation of boundaries and claims and counter-claims over territories have also risen between Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, Assam and Nagaland, Assam and Meghalaya and Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, all of which can only be resolved if the states cooperate with the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-disputes-to-be-resolved-with-cooperation-of-states-centre-to-act-as-facilitator-lok-sabha-told-101627394448601.html

He added that a Supreme Court monitored probe should be carried out so that the truth about the alleged hacking could finally come out.Also Read | Liberal democracies must stand upKharge said no democracy in the world would allow such alleged snooping.

We are ready for discussions,” he told reporters outside Parliament.Kharge asked the government to call an all-party meeting on the alleged snooping while vowing to continue fighting against it.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation into the alleged snooping explains, the presence of a number on the database of the alleged targeted numbers for snooping does not indicate an individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The leaked database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices associated with 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of the 37, 10 were in India.The government has rejected reports of snooping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dictatorship-in-country-opposition-mounts-attack-at-centre-on-pegasus-row-101627390810764.html

The two leaders had met very briefly when PM Modi visited West Bengal to assess the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas in May.Calling it a “courtesy” meeting, Banerjee, who is also the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief, told reporters that she raised the issue of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and also demanded more vaccines and medicines for West Bengal.“During the meeting, I raised the issue of Covid and the need for more vaccines & medicines in the state. I also raised the pending issue of the change of name of the state. On this issue, he said, “He will see,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Her visit comes at a time when Parliament's monsoon session is on in which the opposition parties are protesting on a range of issues including the allegations of surveillance through Pegasus spyware, price rise, and repeal of three farm laws.Banerjee said that PM Modi should call an all-party meeting over the Pegasus hacking controversy, and demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the matter. The chief minister's request for a probe comes exactly one day after the West Bengal government ordered an inquiry into the snooping scandal, the first state across India to do so.Earlier in the day, Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Anand Sharma met the Trinamool Congress chief."I appreciate her for how she fought the recent polls and won. She has come to Delhi for the first time after victory, so I came and had tea with her," Sharma told mediapersons after the meeting.Banerjee, who has been in the national capital since Monday, is also expected to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday along with other opposition leaders such as Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-meets-pm-modi-discusses-covid-demands-more-vaccines-for-state-101627387072197.html

The plea has questioned the police probe which has cleared a superior officer, initially suspected to be involved in the death along with the deceased officer’s wife.Surendra Panigrahi of Bharatiya Bikash Parishad in his PIL filed before the HC demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the death of assistant conservator of forest of Paralakhemundi, Soumya Ranjan Mohapatra, who was found with over 95% burn injuries at his government quarter on July 11 and died two days later during treatment at a hospital on July 13. In the PIL, the petitioner has made Odisha chief secretary, state home secretary, director general of police (DGP), Gajapati superintendent of police (SP) and Paralakhemundi police station inspector parties.Earlier, the Odisha Police had lodged a murder case against Mohapatra’s wife Bidyabharati Panda and his superior officer and Paralakhemundi divisional forest officer (DFO) Sangram Keshari Behera. A case under sections 302 and 120 (b) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at Paralakhemundi police station. However, Gajapati SP Tapan Kumar Patnaik later ruled out the DFO’s involvement in the death case on the basis of call records analysis and his interrogation.The PIL came a day after the family members of the deceased officer were given the post mortem report which said his death was due to burn injuries.The petitioner in his PIL demanded a detailed probe raising doubts over the way the investigation was being conducted by the state police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-probe-sought-into-death-of-young-odisha-forest-officer-police-probe-questioned-101627387510186.html

Vijayan also denied Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya’s claims that 1 million Covid-19 vaccine doses remained unutilised with Kerala and said that only 500,000 doses were with the state when the minister made that statement.Vijayan said that Kerala was one of the states which had implemented the vaccination drive against the disease in an effective manner. However, he also said that the state was facing challenges in fighting the pandemic.“The present circumstance is that we are facing [an] acute shortage of the jab. That is the truth,” news agency PTI quoted the chief minister as saying earlier on Tuesday.Also read | Zika virus cases in Kerala soar past 50 with 3 new infectionsMandaviya had told the Lok Sabha that 1 million Covid-19 vaccine doses remained with Kerala that were yet to be utilised.

He further said that there was no lapse on part of the state’s immunisation drive and the available vaccine stocks were not enough to meet the demand currently.Meanwhile, on Monday 11,586 people tested positive for the disease in the state, taking the total confirmed infections to 32,83,116. The death toll climbed to 16,170 with 135 more fatalities.

The move has been announced as a mark of respect to the cops and a civilian who died in Monday's clashes.“The state government of Assam expresses its profound sorrow at the sad demise of five Assam Police personnel and one civilian at Lailapur of Cachar district while defending the borders of Assam on July 26, 2021. As a mark of respect to the departed souls, the Government of Assam has declared state mourning for three days with effect from July 27,” an official order from the Assam government said. Due to the mouring, the national flag would be flown at half-mast where it is regularly flown and no public entertainment will be permitted for three days.More than 50 people were injured in the border clashes which broke out over the encroachment issue in the border areas. The dispute has been going on for decades and this is not the first time that clashes took place along the Assam-Mizoram border. However, Monday’s episode has been the most violent till now.Earlier in the day, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma paid tributes to the five police personnel who were martyred and also paid a visit to the Silchar Medical College and Hospital to meet the injured personnel of the force.“We are deeply anguished by the loss of lives of our brave @assampolice personnel. I visited the Silchar SP Office and paid floral tributes to the five martyrs and saluted their sacrifice,” Sarma posted on Twitter.Late on Monday, the Assam government issued a statement where it urged Mizoram to restrain its citizens and the police from indulging in wanton violence and work towards restoring peace. “The government of Assam is committed to maintaining cordial relations and peace, while restoring neighbourly relations,” the statement added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assammizoram-clashes-himanta-sarma-govt-declares-3-day-state-mourning-101627386478552.html

The affidavit said some of the committee members have a close association with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Central government and that they were deliberately chosen to give “a negative report” against the state.“The Committee has been deliberately constituted to spearhead a witch hunt against the entire state machinery in West Bengal….In conclusion, it is stated that concerted efforts are being made by those behind the Committee to completely discredit a democratically elected state government,” stated the 95-page affidavit.Also Read | WB govt steps in as students continue protests against Class 12 exam resultIn June, a five-judge bench of the court directed the NHRC to constitute a committee to examine all cases of alleged human rights violation during the violence after the March-April assembly polls. The seven-member committee led by NHRC member Rajiv Jain submitted an interim report on July 2. The final report was submitted on July 13.“Several members of the Committee are either members of the BJP or are known to be closely associated with the ruling dispensation in the Central Government. Therefore, the credibility of the Committee inasmuch as they are expected to investigate in an unbiased and neutral manner is questionable,” said the affidavit. It called the petitions on post-poll violence politically motivated.NHRC officials refused to comment on the affidavit saying the matter was being heard by the court.The NHRC’s inquiry report has recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the alleged cases of violence and that trials related to them be held outside the state. It said the violence in the state showed “a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus”.The affidavit insisted the committee has no power to recommend any course of action. “Thus, in purporting to recommend the investigation by CBI and trial of post-poll violence outside the state of West Bengal, the committee has exceeded its mandate and in doing so, the committee has clearly demonstrated its bias.”The report slammed the state government calling the violence “death knell” for democracy. It added the situation in West Bengal “is a manifestation of the law of ruler, instead of rule of law”.The affidavit filed on Monday called “concerted efforts to discredit a democratically elected state government” the real “death knell for democracy in this great nation”.The matter is likely to be heard by a five-judge bench headed by acting Chief Justice of the Calcutta high court, Rajesh Bindal, on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-rejects-nhrc-report-on-post-poll-violence-101627386370634.html
27-07-2021||India||Assam-Mizoram border dispute has origin in British era notifications||The dispute over the 165-km Assam-Mizoram border has its origin in British era demarcations and has since led to persistent conflict. Here is all you need to know about it:In 1875, the first exercise to demarcate present-day Mizoram, then Lushai Hills, from the plains of Cachar in Assam was undertaken to introduce the inner line permit (ILP) regime. The British government demarcated the Lushai Hills under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873. The regulation introduced the ILP regime in the northeast. ILP is a document issued for allowing the travel of an Indian citizen into a protected area for some time.In 1933, the British conducted demarcations in the northeast for separate districts based on culture, linguistic and tribal lines. This led to a new boundary separating Lushai Hills, Cachar, and the former princely state of Manipur. As part of this trifurcation, some parts of Lushai Hills went to Manipur.Also Read | Why northeast has hot internal bordersDisputeMizoram backs 1875 demarcation, saying it took place in consultation with then Mizo tribal chefs. Mizoram has rejected the 1933 demarcation saying Mizo tribal chiefs were not consulted then.Assam backs the carving of districts in north-eastern states as per the 1933 demarcation.In 1972, Mizoram was carved as a Union territory on basis of 1933 demarcationWhen Mizoram was granted statehood in 1987, Mizo tribal leaders raised the border dispute claiming that Assam had taken away their land.In 1995, the first major skirmishes were reported in Lushai Hills along the border when the Mizoram government tried to settle people there as per the 1875 demarcation. Nearly 50 persons, including journalists, were injured in action by Assam police in 2018 after some Mizo civil society groups tried to set up a hut on the disputed boundary.In 2019, the two states agreed to maintain a status quo and have no man’s land in the disputed area.Skirmishes in October 2020 left several injured on both sides and resulted in a blockade of National Highway 306, the lifeline to Mizoram, for 12 days.Days before this clash, on October 9, similar violence took place on the border of Karimganj (Assam) and Mamit (Mizoram) districts.Assam’s other border disputesAssam also has border disputes with Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh, the other states carved out of Assam.Nagaland and Arunachal border dispute cases are pending in the Supreme Court.Over 100 people have been killed, most of them on the Assam side, in attacks by armed men from Nagaland in separate incidents in 1979, 1985, and 2014.The Meghalaya government informed the state assembly in 2020 that 56 incidents related to the border dispute with Assam have taken place since 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assammizoram-border-dispute-has-origin-in-british-era-notifications-101627385890004.html

27-07-2021||India||Not a ‘political’ issue: Himanta Biswa Sarma on Assam-Mizoram border clashes||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Tuesday that clashes at its border with Mizoram was “not a political issue” but a long-standing dispute between the two states. “This is a boundary dispute between two states. This is a long-standing border dispute. There was a dispute even at the time when the Congress government was there on both sides. This is a dispute between two states,” he said.Sarma added that three battalions of commandos would be deployed in Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi districts bordering Mizoram to quell violence.The move followed after six Assam police personnel were killed and 50 others injured during clashes at the border between Assam’s Cachar and Mizoram’s Vairengte on Monday. Visuals that surfaced on social media showed civilians on both sides of the border pelting stones at each other and attacking security personnel with sticks and rods.Sarma further stated that he ordered a probe into the incident and find where civilians procured arms and ammunition from. The chief minister also visited Silchar Medical College and Hospital to meet the injured state police personnel.Monday’s violence broke out over allegations of encroachment. Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana claimed that Assam police entered Mizoram’s territory and committed arson. In a statement, he added that “upon learning of the arson, residents of Vairengte…proceeded to the site to inquire” when Assam police assaulted these “unarmed civilians” by lathi charging them and firing tear gas canisters. The state’s deputy inspector general of police (northern range) Lalbiakthanga Khiangte said that eight unoccupied farm huts were set ablaze by unidentified persons on Sunday around 11.30pm.The incident even saw the chief ministers of both states engage in a war of words on Twitter. While Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga accused the Assam government of “intrusion and aggression” into the state, Sarma said civilians of Mizoram attacked security personnel stationed in Lailapur to encroach into Assam’s territory. Later, both the chief ministers held a meeting after which Sarma tweeted that Assam will maintain “status quo and peace between the borders.”A battalion of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was deployed in both the states between 4pm and 4.30pm as per the orders of home secretary under the direct supervision of Union home minister Amit Shah – whose intervention was sought by both the chief ministers.Also Read | Assam-Mizoram clash: Culmination of simmering discontent between 2 statesThe clashes broke out after Shah’s recent visit to Meghalaya’s capital Shillong during which he chaired a meeting with the chief ministers of all eight northeastern states and reportedly discussed inter-border disputes.

It’s not organising any settlement in the forest area, we don’t want any settlement there,” he further said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-political-issue-himanta-biswa-sarma-on-assam-mizoram-border-clashes-101627384271596.html
27-07-2021||India||Guj to provide ₹2,000 as monthly aid to kids who lost 1 parent due to Covid-19||The Gujarat government said on Tuesday that children who have lost a parent to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will receive a monthly assistance of ₹2,000 under the existing scheme of the Mukhya Mantri Bal Seva Yojna, news agency PTI reported.Additional chief secretary of the social justice and empowerment department Sunaina Tomar said chief minister Vijay Rupani would launch this provision on August 2. Tomar wrote to the district collectors instructing them to open bank accounts for eligible children within three days.Until now, only those children who lost both parents to the viral disease were covered under the Mukhya Mantri Bal Seva Yojna and were entitled to get a monthly assistance of ₹4,000 till they turned 21. In case they chose to opt for higher studies after 21, the government would pay them ₹6,000 per month till they turned 24.As many as 776 children, who lost both parents, received the first monthly instalment of ₹4,000 each earlier in July, according to a report published in PTI.On July 9, Rupani had increased the age limit of Mukhya Mantri Bal Seva Yojna from 18 to 21 years. He said any undergraduate and postgraduate course would be considered for availing benefits, adding children will also be given priority in various government schemes offering scholarships within India and abroad irrespective of their income criteria.Gujarat has so far reported nearly 825,000 cases, 10,076 deaths and 814,356 recoveries due to the coronavirus disease.

27-07-2021||India||Assam-Mizoram clash: Culmination of simmering discontent between 2 states||Monday’s violent clash along the Assam-Mizoram border that claimed six lives including those of five policemen and left nearly 50 others injured on the Assam side was the culmination of simmering discontent between the two states since October 2020 when skirmishes left several injured on both sides and resulted in a blockade of NH 306, the lifeline to Mizoram, for 12 days. Though it wasn’t the first time violence has erupted along the 164km boundary between both northeastern states, Monday’s incident was the bloodiest till date. The border dispute between both states is nearly five decades long and started after Mizoram, which was earlier a part of Assam was declared a union territory in 1972 and gained statehood in 1987. While Assam claims Mizoram has encroached its “constitutional boundary”, the latter maintains the area belongs to it . Also Read | Why northeast has hot internal bordersThree districts of Assam, Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj, share borders with three districts of Mizoram, Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl. The main bone of contention is a 509-square mile stretch of the inner line reserve forest on the interstate boundary that Mizoram claims as its own. The origin of the dispute lies in two different notifications issued during the British era. Mizoram wants delineation of the border based on a 1875 notification framed under Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 that sought to demarcate the Lushai Hills (the earlier name of Mizoram) from the plains of Cachar (in Assam) and also introduced the inner line permit regime (ILP) that regulates entry of outsiders to the area, now Mizoram, even today. Assam follows a 1933 notification through which delimitation of the earlier boundary between Lushai Hills and the former princely state of Manipur was modified. As expected, there have been allegations and counter-allegations on what ignited Monday’s clashes. Mizoram’s home minister Lalchamliana issued a statement in the evening accusing Assam police personnel of entering the state and indulging in violence. The statement added that Mizoram police retaliated after tear-gas canisters and grenades were hurled by Assam’s security forces. Late at night, Assam responded by issuing a statement that blamed Mizoram of breaching existing agreements and status quo on the border and accusing police of the neighbouring state of firing on its security forces and civilians using light machine guns (LMGs). Earlier in the day Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma indulged in a blame game on Twitter. It ended with intervention of union home minister Amit Shah, after which the two CMs talked over phone, agreed to maintain status quo and work for peace. Besides Mizoram, Assam has border disputes with Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Assam shares an 804km long boundary with Arunachal Pradesh. Though there was no dispute initially, over the years allegations of residents of one state encroaching land on the other have led to disputes and violence. A suit has been pending in Supreme Court since 1989 on the issue. Earlier this month, Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu had expressed hope of solving border dispute with Assam out of court. Nagaland and Assam share a 434km boundary and a dispute that’s going on for over five decades. Both states have refused to accept recommendations of two commissions set up by Centre to solve the issue and a suit is pending in Supreme Court on the issue since 1988. There have been several violent clashes on the issue. Over 100 people have been killed, most of them on the Assam side, in attacks by armed men from Nagaland in separate incidents in 1979, 1985 and 2014. The Assam-Meghalaya border dispute is at least four decades old and there is contention between both states at 12 points along the 733km boundary they share. Several rounds of talks have failed to solve the issue. Last week CMs of Assam and Meghalaya met and agreed to use a pragmatic approach to sort their boundary problems. The long standing border disputes were expected to change with change in power equations in the region over the past five years. Since 2016 when a BJP-led coalition first formed government in Assam, the Congress has been wiped out from the region. The BJP is heading governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and is part of the ruling coalition in Meghalaya and Nagaland. In Mizoram, Mizo National Front (MNF), which is a constituent of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led front of anti-Congress parties in the region formed in 2016, is in power. Monday’s incident came two days after Amit Shah interacted with CMs of all eight northeastern states in Shillong where the long pending interstate border disputes were also deliberated upon. The union home minister urged all states to resolve their issues before the 2024 general election. Significantly, during the 4th NEDA conclave held in Guwahati in September 2019, Shah urged all chief ministers of the region to address all border disputes in a time-bound manner before India celebrates 75 years of Independence in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assammizoram-clash-culmination-of-simmering-discontent-between-2-states-101627383250265.html

Speaker Om Birla urged the Opposition to join in the proceedings repeatedly but the question hour had to be adjourned many times. The first hour of Lok Sabha is reserved for question on any public issue from lawmakers and called the Question Hour, according to Lok Sabha conventions. The members of the Opposition kept up protests demanding discussions on the Pegasus Project, the recent case of data leaked to a consortium of news media, suggesting a spyware was used to track various people in India. The Opposition began protests with noisy slogans, prompting the Speaker to intervene. “Please return to your seats and take part in the proceedings. You can get the government to answer all your questions. Please cooperate,” Birla said, making similar requests frequently. Also Read | Covid: Vaccination for kids likely to begin next month, says health ministerAmid stormy scenes, Tomar made a statement on the catastrophic flooding in Maharashtra, which has reportedly killed hundreds of people and affected thousands of families. “We have received and analysed a detailed report of destruction in the state due to the recent floods, especially to farmers. The home ministry has approved ₹700 crore towards relief,” Tomar said. The farm minister, who is facing protests also from farmers who want the government to scrap three recent agricultural laws, said nearly 1.1 million farmers were given claims under a flagship state-run agricultural insurance scheme. Farmers will receive additional compensation under the state’s disaster relief fund, he said. The first of the several adjournments happened within nearly 40 minutes of the day’s session. Tomar seized the opportunity to slam the Opposition. “Speaker Sir, through you, I want to tell all the members of the house and particularly the Opposition members that there are more than 15 questions related to village and farmers in the today’s list of business. If the Opposition members have even the slightest regard for the farmers, they should sit in their places peacefully. You should raise you issue through these questions and listen the reply of the government,” Tomar said. “Due to the uproar, the dignity of the House is being destroyed, the public is also being harmed and the character of the opposition parties towards the farmers is also evident,” he said. Members of the Trinamool Congress continued to protest. They had brought placards that had protest messages, such as “Master of Digital Invasion” and “Big Brother is watching”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-700-cr-approved-for-maharashtra-flood-relief-minister-tomar-to-parliament-101627382469810.html

27-07-2021||India||Potential clash on Assam-Meghalaya border prevented||A timely response by the Ri-Bhoi district administration of Meghalaya thwarted off what could have been another border clash with Assam on Monday. What began as a mere civic amenity project by the Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited (MeECL) by way of erecting electricity poles in Iongkhuli village on the same stretch where its Assamese counterpart had erected electric poles earlier in January, almost snowballed into a physical confrontation between Assam police and officials and members of the public in the area.According to Meghalaya officials, while the work was going on, at around 11am, a large posse of Assam government officials and senior police officials arrived at the scene and dismantled the erected poles. The act was not received well by the local residents who offered stiff resistance which almost led to fisticuffs.Also Read | Why northeast has hot internal bordersA timely response by the Ri-Bhoi additional district magistrate, the Superintendent of Police and senior police officials who arrived at the spot helped defuse the situation. On Tuesday, the Chief Executive Member (CEM) of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) Titosstarwell Chyne expressed concern over Assam’s intentions while observing that while on the one hand it sounds keen to resolve the border dispute, on the other it seems to openly encourage disputes with Meghalaya. “Iongkhuli village has never been in any of the disputed areas with Assam. I am surprised how it has happened like this,” he wondered.Meghalaya has identified 12 areas of difference with Assam and submitted documents on these, starting August 9, 2011. The hill state has been asking for the creation of a boundary commission monitored by the Centre to resolve the disputes. The total disputed area is around 2700 sq km. In recent years, the Assam government’s guest house which was used as the official residence of former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi was caught in a row between the two states. The residence located on a small hillock within Khanapara and Pilangakata has often been claimed by Meghalaya as part of its territory. In the past, Meghalaya government had said that it had records to prove its claim on the land.During last week’s meeting between Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad K Sangma, it was decided to no longer maintain status quo on the boundary issue but instead proceed on resolving it at the earliest. The next round of CM level meetings will be in Dispur on August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/potential-clash-on-assam-meghalaya-border-prevented-101627382230017.html

27-07-2021||India||Children orphaned during Covid-19 should be covered under welfare schemes: SC||The Supreme Court observed on Tuesday that the Centre's welfare schemes should cover all the children who were orphaned after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic struck, and not limit its benefit to those kids who lost their parents to the infection.The observarion was made by a two-judge bench of Supreme Court Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose that was hearing a suo motu case regarding the condition of children in institutionalised care during the pandemic.The Supreme Court noted that government-run schemes such as PM-Cares Fund, which proposed a corpus of ₹10 lakh for children till they turn 23, covered only those who became oprhans after losing their parents to Covid-19.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati who represented the Centre told the apex court that the PM-Cares scheme covers children who have lost both the parents or the lone surviving parent or the legal guardian. The counsel said the scheme does not cover a child till he or she attains majority. It takes care of children who would go for higher education, etc and a sum of 10 lakh would be given. "The scheme has been devised for a special mechanism due to the pandemic," Bar and Bench quoted Bhati as saying in a Twitter post.The Supreme Court told the counsel that while it doesn't seek an extension of any scheme, it is studying how the orphaned children could be given immediate benefits. Justice Rao said, "The order that we passed covers all children who became orphans during this period and not just due to deaths due to Covid-19." "What we are thinking is to take care of all children who have been orphaned whether Covid or not Covid. We cannot restrict the orders passed to only orphans who lost both parents to Covid 19", Justice Rao said, according to LiveLaw.inThe bench also pointed out that India is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of Child and, therefore, the country has an obligation to take care of orphans. The court also stressed the need to ensure that the schemes announced reach the real beneficiaries and not just remain on paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-orphaned-during-covid-19-should-be-covered-under-welfare-schemes-sc-101627378749600.html
27-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh health minister walks out over allegations of attacking Congress MLA||Chhattisgarh minister T S Singh Deo on Tuesday walked out of the state assembly demanding a “clear statement” from the government over fellow Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh’s allegation that he was “attacked” at the former’s behest on Sunday.It is rare for a minister to stage such a walkout and signals an escalation in the rift within the ruling Congress. Deo was seen among the contenders for the chief minister’s post when the party swept back to power in 2018. Singh has linked the alleged attack to his praise of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and backing his continuation as the state’s top elected official. He claimed Deo held a grudge against him over his position.Singh has alleged his convoy was allegedly attacked by three persons, one of whom is a relative of Deo. Deo has denied the allegation and claimed that he instructed police to take strict action against the accused.The controversy has erupted amid talk of a purported formula under which Deo and Baghel agreed to share the chief minister’s post over five years. Home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, who was seen as the other leading contender for the top post in 2018, made a statement in connection with “a road rage incident” involving Singh’s convoy on July 24. Amid the chaos over the issue in the House, Deo said, “Yesterday (Monday) chief minister (Bhupesh Baghel) called us in his chamber and a discussion took place...”Deo said he is not in a position to attend the House till there is clarity from the government over the issue. “I do not consider myself eligible to participate in the proceedings...,” he said. “I do not find myself worthy to be part of the session of this House until the government orders an inquiry or issues a statement.’ Deo soon left the assembly while refusing to speak to the media.The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned Sahu’s statement saying it had no reference to Singh’s allegations against Deo.Assembly speaker Charan Das Mahant said he has not received any complaints either from Singh or Deo.The BJP on Monday demanded that the House take cognisance on its own over the issue and order an inquiry.Dharamlal Kaushik, the opposition leader, called the alleged attack an “unfortunate incident” for Congress as well as the state as such allegations have never been levelled in the state’s history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-health-minister-walks-out-over-allegations-of-attacking-congress-mla-101627378089142.html

Already 26 fighters have been delivered with 24 landed in India and remaining two kept for IAF pilot and technician training in France.Given the reliability of strategic ally France, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Navy have evinced keen interest in Rafale platform due to its weight to power ratio and maritime strike capabilities. Apparently, the IAF leadership wants to acquire another 36 Rafales in future and the Navy is looking at Rafale-M as a fighter option onboard INS Vikrant (Indigenous aircraft carrier-1), to be commissioned next year.The induction of Rafale into western and eastern theatre has force multiplied Indian war making capabilities as the French fighter is armed with the longest range air-to-air Meteor missile in the sub-continent, Hammer air to ground smart munition and long range SCALP air to ground weapon. The Hammer missile, which has been acquired by India under emergency purchases, can be released at a height of mere 500 feet to hit a high altitude target more than 70 km away. The missile hugs the terrain and then climbs to a height of over 4000 metres before striking the target from a top down action. The Indian Rafales carry specially modified Hammer missiles due to high altitude targets, mountainous terrain and Chinese recently acquired Russian S-400 air defence systems. In fact, the French have offered to jointly develop Hammer and Meteor missiles with India with extended range and heavier payload.While the French Rafale deliveries are slightly ahead of time, all eyes are on the activation of the Hashimara air base, which will house the second squadron of Rafale fighters with the first squadron being home based in Ambala. The presence of Rafale in India’s eastern sector will add teeth to its military response in the sector with both Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh being a defence priority.The positioning of Hashimara is such that it covers the Chumbi Valley, Sikkim and the sensitive Siliguri corridor. While both Ambala and Hashimara are home bases of Rafale, the fighters with nuclear capability will be flying all over India and its littoral territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-to-deliver-35-rafales-by-2021-end-a-solo-fighter-will-join-in-jan-2022-101627377558804.html

27-07-2021||India||Day after debate between their power ministers, Delhi, Goa CMs spar on Twitter||A day after a televised live debate between their power ministers over the promise of free electricity, the chief ministers of Delhi and Goa took potshots at each other via Twitter.After the debate ended on Monday, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant hit out at Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain for what he called an “unacceptable” reference to Goa’s politicians as “third class”. “AAP has always indulged in cheap politics through constant protests and theatrics. But to say Goans are third class politicians is an insult to great sons-of-the-soil like Bhausaheb Bandodkar (Goa’s first chief minister), Jack Sequeira (João Hugo Eduardo de Sequeira, Goa’s first opposition leader), Manohar “Bhai” Parrikar, Rajendra Arlekar (Governor of Himachal Pradesh) or Shripad “Bhau” Naik (Union Minister of State for Ports and Shipping),” Sawant tweeted. “AAP is free to create hype for their political benefits but to come to Goa and insult our leaders is unacceptable,” he added. This morning, Kejriwal responded by saying that “buying and selling” MLAs was the real disservice to Goa’s eminent politicians. “Pramod-bab, by comparing the present set of politicians to such political greats, you are insulting them. Current BJP neither has the greatness of Bhausaheb Bandodkar, integrity of Dr Jack Sequeira or [the] vision of Manohar Parrikar,” he tweeted. “Bhausaheb Bandodkar has been insulted by the way MLAs have been bought and sold. Dr Jack Sequeira didn’t fight to see Goan votes being bought and sold. Manohar Parrikar didn’t work tirelessly to see Congress MLAs being bought wholesale,” he added. A section within the BJP reportedly resents the ten Congress MLAs who joined the party in 2019. Atanasio Monserrate, for instance, now represents the Panaji seat that Manohar Parrikar represented for five terms. AAP is hoping to tap into this resentment and promises to take Parrikar’s legacy forward despite attacking the BJP for forming governments without having the people’s mandate. In 2017, Parrikar quit as the defence minister to become Goa chief minister with the help of the Goa Forward Party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Independents despite the party being routed at the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-debate-between-their-power-ministers-delhi-goa-cms-spar-on-twitter-101627373588644.html

27-07-2021||India||Journalists N Ram, Sashi Kumar move SC seeking inquiry into Pegasus use||Journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar have moved the Supreme Court seeking an inquiry by a retired or sitting judge of the top court into alleged surveillance through Israeli Pegasus spyware and to ascertain the extent of the alleged surveillance on Indian citizens and entities responsible for it.In their petition filed through advocate Shadan Farasat, the two said the alleged snooping “prima facie constitutes an act of cyber-terrorism”. It describes Pegasus as an extremely sophisticated military software. “Such mass surveillance using a military-grade spyware abridges several fundamental rights and appears to represent an attempt to infiltrate, attack and destabilize independent institutions that act as critical pillars of our democratic set-up.” The plea added the alleged snooping has several “grave political and security ramifications, especially considering that the devices of government ministers, senior political figures and constitutional functionaries which may contain sensitive information have been targeted.”The petition called for viewing the snooping allegations with seriousness as it impacts rights to privacy and free speech protected under the Constitution’s Articles 21 and 19(1)(a). It noted the alleged hacking of mobile phones using Pegasus spyware constitutes a punishable offence under the Information Technology Act. The petition alleged the surveillance has been done bypassing the legal regime provided under Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, which provides for it on grounds of public emergency or in the interest of public safety.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation into the alleged snooping explains, the presence of a number on the database of the alleged targeted numbers does not indicate an individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The leaked database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices associated with 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of the 37, 10 were in India.The plea of the journalists has sought a response from the Centre whether it or any of its agencies obtained license for Pegasus spyware or have used it to conduct surveillance on Indian citizens. It added it is concerning to note that the government has not categorically ruled out obtaining Pegasus licenses to conduct surveillance, citing Union Ashwani Vaishnav’s statements in this regard.The petition said prominent journalists, politicians, activists and scientists are among those on the list of potential surveillance by Pegasus. It added despite this no steps have been taken by Centre to ensure a credible and independent investigation.Advocate ML Sharma and John Brittas, a Rajya Sabha member, have earlier filed two petitions seeking inquiry into the alleged snooping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalists-n-ram-sashi-kumar-move-sc-seeking-inquiry-into-pegasus-use-101627370588685.html

27-07-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi tomorrow||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday during her stay in the national Capital. Banerjee is scheduled to meet Gandhi in the afternoon in what will be the first meeting of the two leaders after Trinamool’s sweeping victory in the West Bengal assembly elections in May this year. Even as the Congress and Trinamool relationship has been tumultuous, Banerjee’s personal equation with Gandhi has stood the test of time. While there is no fixed agenda of the meeting, the two leaders are expected to focus on long-term goals of the Opposition bloc with an eye on the next national elections, due after three years. The meeting also assumes significance in the backdrop of the ongoing Parliament session where the Opposition has launched massive protests against the government over the Pegasus snooping row and to demand repeal of the three controversial farm laws. Congress functionaries added that party leader Rahul Gandhi too might drop in at the Mamata-Sonia meeting. While Banerjee’s equation with Rahul has faced a few hurdles in the past, poll strategist Prashant Kishor has reportedly worked as an emissary between the two sides and functionaries claim that the equation has improved over time.Banerjee arrived at Delhi on Monday evening. On Tuesday, she will meet former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, followed by a meeting with senior Congress leader Anand Sharma. Nath, who lived in Kolkata for a long time, enjoys a good rapport with the Bengal chief minister. Sharma’s equation with Banerjee goes back a long way as the Congress leader was her senior in Indian Youth Congress. Also Read | Mamata forms committee to probe Pegasus snooping rowBanerjee’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled at 4pm on Tuesday. According to one of her trusted aides, Banerjee is expected to raise the issue of GST dues and financial package for West Bengal to ease its credit burden. The two leaders are also expected to discuss political issues. Her last meeting scheduled for Tuesday is with Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi who also fights key cases for the West Bengal government. The West Bengal chief minister will pay a courtesy visit to President Ram Nath Kovind and might also meet Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. While her party is very active in Parliament, Banerjee is unlikely to visit Parliament during her stay. “There are restrictions in entry of visitors in Parliament due to Covid. She might not like to go there now,” said the aide. Usually, Banerjee always goes to Parliament if she is in Delhi during the session. She has been a seven-time MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-to-meet-congress-president-sonia-gandhi-tomorrow-101627363010380.html

27-07-2021||India||Covid-hit mothers may continue to breastfeed newborns, says health ministry||A woman who has tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease can continue to breastfeed her baby, but should maintain a physical distance of 6 feet at all other times, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has said.Also, there is no evidence yet to suggest that a foetus may contract the virus from the mother, but pregnant women need to take all possible precautions to stay away from being infected, the ministry quoted a senior doctor from an interview.The ministry spoke to Dr Manju Puri, who heads the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Lady Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, over several related concerns, including vaccine hesitancy and what precautions an infected woman needs to take to protect her newborn. Dr Puri said vaccines that are being administered against coronavirus do not have any adverse effect on reproductive organs or fertility.Stressing the importance of inoculation, Dr Puri said the doses will help prevent severe diseases in pregnant women. "Also, vaccinating a mother is likely to give some degree of protection to the newborn as the antibodies developed in the mother's body post-vaccination will pass on to the developing foetus through her blood. In the case of lactating mothers, an infant gets these antibodies through the mother's breast milk," Dr Puri said.Regarding fears of any impact of the doses on fertility, Puri said it was all a rumour that gets circulated on social media, adding misinformation is far more dangerous than the virus itself.She said while the anti-virus vaccines are relatively new, these have been developed using time-tested techniques. "Vaccines help the body develop immunity against a specific pathogen, it does not affect any other body tissue. In fact, we give some vaccines such as hepatitis B, Influenza, pertussis vaccine to women even during pregnancy to protect them and their unborn child from various diseases," she said.Besides, regulators have approved the administration of the vaccines during pregnancy only after they were confident of their safety, she said. "There is no scientific data or studies that show that vaccines can cause infertility. These vaccines do not affect the reproductive organs in any way," she said.Speaking more on caring for newborns, Dr Puri said an infected mother should continue to breastfeed the baby, but keep a distance of six feet otherwise. Help from a caregiver who has tested negative from the virus may also be sought during the period. Dr Puri said an infected mother should wash her hands, wear protective gear such as a mask and face shield before breastfeeding the newborn. Frequent sanitisation of the surroundings is also helpful."If there is no one else to take care of the child, a mother should wear a mask all the time, and maintain physical distance from the child as much as possible. The mother and the child should stay in a well-ventilated room. And she should regularly wash her hands and sanitise the surroundings," Dr Puri said.The senior doctor said that while pregnancy and childbirth are social events in Indian society, expectant mothers should take adequate precautions, including wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing even at home. This is because she may not be going out, but may contract the disease from her family members who could be going out for work.She said if a pregnant woman develops any symptom of Covid-19, she should get herself tested at the earliest, "as the sooner we diagnose, the better we can manage the disease".The management of COVID-19 is almost the same during the pregnancy as it is for others, but it should be done only under the strict supervision of a doctor, she said."A woman should isolate herself, drink plenty of fluids, check her temperature and oxygen saturation every four-six hrs. If the temperature does not come down even after taking paracetamol, she needs to get in touch with a doctor. If there is a fall in oxygen concentration or if there is a decreasing trend for example if it is 98 in the morning 97 in the evening, and then drops further the next day, she needs to speak to her doctor," Dr Puri said.Besides, women who have associated illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, obesity, etc, need to be more careful, as they may need hospitalisation.Hence, consulting and staying in touch with a doctor are very important during the entire period. “We strongly recommend an overall health check-up post-COVID recovery to ensure that the mother and the foetus are doing fine," she said.The doctor further said there is an increase in mental health problems among women during pregnancy and post-childbirth and these are times when a woman undergoes a lot of hormonal and physiological changes.Dr Puri said pregnant women have poor coping skills and need social support. Isolation for 15 days is difficult for everyone, but more so for pregnant women and postnatal mothers. During this time, the additional anxiety about her child's health can severely affect her mental status. So, it is important to provide constant support and assurance to women during this time. Family members should observe her and if there is any drastic change in her mood, may seek medical help.She also spoke on counselling expectant women about various contraceptive methods during pregnancy and offering them postpartum intra-uterine device that can be inserted immediately after childbirth or caesarean delivery."It saves them from an unnecessary visit to the hospital after childbirth and reduces the risk of an unplanned pregnancy," Puri said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covidhit-mothers-may-continue-to-breastfeed-newborns-says-health-ministry-101627355530136.html

Here's why||The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM KISAN) scheme along with the Digital India initiative has made it possible to reach the benefits to 12 crore farmers in the country. However, despite the transfer of money by the government, it does not always reach the farmers' accounts.A number of factors is responsible if farmers do not receive the benefit. The main reason for this is a mistake in Aadhaar, account and bank account numbers. Apart from this, if there is a mismatch in the spelling of the name in the bank account and the name entered on the Aadhaar card or the filling of the wrong IFSC code, farmers will fail to get the money.Due to these mistakes, the installments of 162,297 farmers in Andhra Pradesh are pending for April-July and the payment for 48,275 agriculturists has failed. At the same time, according to the data given on the PM Kisan Portal, the payment of 15,699 farmers of Chhattisgarh has also failed and the installment for 15,059 is pending. Similarly, payments of 133,790 farmers of Madhya Pradesh are pending and 38,576 have failed. On the other hand, the payment of 138,154 farmers of Uttar Pradesh has failed and the installment of 91,066 has been suspended.The government launched the PM-KISAN scheme to provide financial assistance of up to ₹6,000 annually to small and marginalised farmers across the nation.The financial benefit of ₹6,000 per year is to be released to the eligible farmers in three installments of ₹2,000 each every four-month trimester, i.e. April-July, August-November and December-March.This scheme is being implemented through an Aadhaar linked electronic database containing details of all members of the families of the farmers whose names appear in the land records.The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme provides financial assistance to farmers irrespective of the size of their landholdings. The amount is directly transferred to the bank account of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-kisan-samman-nidhi-2021-payment-for-andhra-up-farmers-fails-here-s-why-101627345218071.html

A magistrate's court in Mumbai on July 23 extended their police custody till Tuesday.The police earlier told the court that the 45-year-old businessman was gaining financially from the illegal activity of making and selling pornographic material, news agency PTI reported.The police claimed that they have seized Kundra's mobile phone and its contents need to be scrutinised and also his business dealings and transactions have to be looked into. "This is why transactions between Raj Kundra's Yes bank account and United Bank of Africa account need to be investigated," Mumbai Police told the court, according to news agency ANI.On July 20, the Mumbai Police said that they have arrested Kundra and 10 others for their alleged involvement in the creation of porn films and publishing them through mobile apps.

"We have sufficient evidence regarding this," Nagrale said.Maharashtra's anti-corruption bureau (ACB) said on Thursday that it has received four emails alleging that Kundra even bribed Mumbai Police officials with ₹25 lakh to avoid arrest.Kundra had a tie-up with a London-based company involved in streaming pornographic content through Hotshots, a mobile app, joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said.The case was registered with Mumbai Police's crime branch in February this year about the creation of pornographic films and the use of apps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-kundra-ryan-thorpe-police-custody-ends-today-in-alleged-pornography-case-101627342264488.html
27-07-2021||India||Why BS Yediyurappa matters for the BJP in Karnataka||Exactly two years after he assumed the chief minister’s post in Karnataka, BS Yediyurappa has tendered his resignation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to name his successor. The fact that there is no obvious front-runner despite Yediyurappa’s resignation being in the works for months underscores his importance in Karnataka’s political landscape. There are two key challenges facing the BJP at the moment. One, making sure that Yediyurappa does not rebel against it, like he did in 2012, and two, maintaining the party’s support base in the Lingayat community, of which the outgoing CM is the tallest leader. Here are three charts which explain this.Lingayats voted for the BJP in 2019The BJP achieved its best ever performance in Karnataka in the 2019 elections winning 25 out of the 28 Lok Sabha seats. While the party had high levels of support across Hindus, it was an overwhelming 87% among Lingayats, who account for almost 16%-17% of the state’s population. The Congress-JD (S) government fell immediately after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and Yediyurappa, a Lingayat, was made the chief minister. (See Chart 1)Lingayats have been the core support-base of the BJP in Karnataka, but they are also loyal to Yediyurappa.Karnataka is the first and only southern state so far where the BJP has been able to capture power on its own. The BJP’s success story in the state is tied with Yediyurappa who has mobilised the Lingayats for the party.In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP party realised the hard way that it cannot take Lingayat support for granted if Yediyurappa is not on board. Yediyurappa parted ways with the BJP and formed the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) after he was made to resign as the chief minister in 2011. The KJP did massive damage to the BJP in the 2013 assembly elections in which its performance was the worst since the 1994 state polls. (See Chart 2)A comparison of community-wise vote shares from the 2008 and 2013 CSDS-Lokniti surveys shows that the Lingayats deserted the BJP in a big way in the 2013 elections. The Lingayat support returned in the 2014 elections (it was 63% according to CSDS-Lokniti), by which time Yediyurappa had been brought back into the BJP fold. (See Chart 3)BJP’s social engineering problem in KarnatakaCaste politics has always been important in Karnataka. In its heydays, the Congress, under the leadership of Devraj Urs perfected what it called the AHINDA coalition which included minorities, backward classes and dalits. The Congress fell between two stools in the 2018 elections, while trying to play the AHINDA card on the one hand and wooing Lingayats with a separate religious status on the other. While it did gain some ground among the Lingayats, it lost the support of other sections.The BJP, which is enjoying the peak of its political popularity in Karnataka if the 2019 results are any indication, will face a similar problem. It cannot alienate the Lingayats who are its most loyal supporters but must also be seen as offering a bigger share of power to other Hindus. Whether or not Yediyurappa’s successor is a Lingayat is the BJP’s first challenge on this front. We will know soon enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-bsy-matters-for-the-bjp-in-karnataka-101627339841665.html
27-07-2021||India||Plea against DMK, AIADMK leaders’ win: HC issues notice to EC, 3 candidates||Chennai: Hearing a batch of petitions filed challenging victories of leaders in the Tamil Nadu assembly election held on April 6, the Madras high court on Monday issued notices to the Election Commission of India and three candidates —S Duraimurugan, minister for water resources and two AIADMK leaders— former health minister C Vijayabhaskar and S Jayakumar from Perundurai constituency..Justice V Bharathidasan ordered a notice to senior DMK leader and minister Duraimurugan on an election petition challenging his victory from Katpadi constituency by a thin margin of 746 votes against rival AIADMK’s V Ramu. His victory has been challenged on the ground that they were in violation of the Representation of People Act and the Conduct of Election Rules. Ramu in his petition wanted to be declared as the winner on the basis of his complaint that votes polled in a particular polling station (110A) were never counted leading to the victory of Duraimurugan.The court also ordered a notice to Vijayabhaskar who has been re-elected from Viramalai constituency polling 53.8% of the votes. The petition was filed by DMK candidate M Palaniappan who was represented by senior advocate and DMK MP P Wilson. The petition sought to declare the election of Vijayabaskar as illegal and void on several grounds including distribution of cash.The case has been posted to September 6 by which time the elected candidates have to file their responses.GoI stance on filling AIQ seats by following reservation After the Madras high court said that it is unacceptable that the union government would not implement Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation in state-surrendered medical seats for the All India Quota (AIQ) in Tamil Nadu and asked them to file their stance, the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the court on Monday that the Centre is in an advanced stage on the matter. The Centre submitted that they require another week to submit their final decision. The first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthil Kumar Ramamoorthy adjourned the matter by a week. The case pertains to a contempt petition filed by the DMK stating that the order to grant OBC reservations in the All India Quota seats in medical and dental colleges was not obeyed by the Union government. P Wilson, senior advocate appeared for the DMK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-against-dmk-aiadmk-leaders-win-hc-issues-notice-to-ec-3-candidates-101627328560613.html
27-07-2021||India||TN issues order to implement 10.5% quota Bill for Vanniyars||Chennai: In a boost to the AIADMK’s ally, Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Vanniyar caste that they represent, the DMK government in Tamil Nadu late on Monday issued an order to implement the 10.5% internal reservation allocated for the community. “This reservation will be followed for government jobs and educational institutions from this academic year,” the order read. The previous AIADMK regime had on February 26 passed a legislation in the assembly to allocate 10.5% quota to the Vanniyar community within the existing 20% quota for the Most Backward Classes. The move was made ahead of the assembly elections that were held on April 6, to appease the PMK that threatened to walk out of the alliance if their demands weren’t met. The order issued by Mythili K Rajendran, secretary to the government said that the reservation which came into effect on February 26, will be applicable for new vacancies called by recruiting agencies and appointing authorities. PMK founder S Ramadoss thanked the former AIADMK leadership for enacting the law and chief minister M K Stalin for implementing the reservation. “The situation of the people from the Vanniyar community will gradually improve when the reservation is implemented in employment and education,” Ramadoss tweeted in Tamil. Just a day ago, Ramadoss had expressed his disappointment that admissions for courses in engineering, arts and science colleges were announced without mentioning the reservation for Vanniyars. This reservation has been a four-decade long demand of the PMK for the upliftment of the community which it reignited in the run up to the polls. Some of their protests during this time often turned violent. Former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s last act before the model code of conduct came into effect was passing the Bill offering a 10.5% internal quota for the Vanniyar community in educational institutions and appointments in government services and jobs within the existing reservation for MBCs. Despite its declining show in the electoral fray in the past decade, PMK retains clout amongst the Dravidian majors because of their dominating influence in the Vanniyar community- their core vote bank--in Tamil Nadu’s northern belt and a few districts in the western region. Necessary amendments to the Tamil Nadu Government Servants (Conditions of Service) Act, 2016 shall be issued separately, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-issues-order-to-implement-10-5-quota-bill-for-vanniyars-101627328500546.html
27-07-2021||India||CBI must probe ISRO spy case independently: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will have to conduct its investigation independently into the conspiracy by Kerala Police officials to frame former Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) scientist S Nambi Narayanan in the alleged 1994 ISRO spy scandal and that the agency cannot just rely on the findings of the committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge.The Court was referring to the report prepared by a three-member Committee headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice (Retd) DK Jain which had named the police officials responsible for foisting a false case against Narayanan. Based on this report, the Court had directed CBI to take up the probe in April this year and had asked the agency to examine if a case was made out from the reading of the Committee’s findings.On Monday, the CBI represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the top court that the agency has decided to lodge a first information report (FIR). The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna allowed the agency to proceed in accordance with law and said, “Investigation agency must collect materials on its own. The report (by Justice DK Jain Committee) by itself cannot be the basis to proceed against the persons named as accused in the FIR. It is only to provide you initial information. Ultimately it is the investigation done by you that will have the consequence.”The Committee, formed by the top court on September 14, 2018 had done an exhaustive analysis into the conspiracy charge leveled by Narayanan in his petition before the Supreme Court. Finding merit in his allegation that he was framed by officers of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Kerala Police in the alleged scam, the top court ordered the probe and directed the Kerala government to pay a compensation of ₹50 lakh to the 81-year old scientist. The Committee had one representative each from Central and Kerala governments and the expenses of the Committee were borne by Centre.The SIT formed in November 1994 was headed by then Deputy Inspector General of Police (Crime) Siby Mathews, along with investigating officers e investigating officers S. Vijayan (then Inspector, Special Branch) and KK Joshua, (then Deputy Superintendent of Police, CB CID).With the report taken to its logical end, the bench found no purpose in continuing with it further and ordered the Committee to be wound up. Solicitor General informed the Court that on April 15 this year, when the Court directed CBI to examine the Justice DK Jain Committee report, a bar was placed on disclosing the report contents. Since some portions of the report were contained in the FIR, Mehta sought a clarification on making the FIR contents public.The lawyers representing the police officers sought for a copy of the Committee report. The bench clarified that the report was meant for the purposes of the Court and the accused can certainly be provided the copy of the FIR by CBI. The bench allowed CBI to upload the FIR on its website without passing any specific directions in this regard. Mehta informed the Court that the same would be done during the course of the day.Interestingly, this is not the first time the CBI is handling the ISRO spy scandal case. In December 1994, the Kerala government had handed over the case probe to CBI after SIT had arrested Nambi Narayanan and another scientist D Sasikumaran for the charge of passing secret documents related to ISRO to a Maldivian woman. The CBI in its final report found the allegations to be false. This finding led to the discharge of the two scientists by the trial court in May 1996.The state government was unhappy with these findings and ordered the state police to re-investigate the case. This notification of June 27, 1996 was challenged by Narayanan before the Kerala High Court. In November 1996, the High Court upheld the state notification which forced Narayanan to approach the top court. This appeal was decided in September 2018.Commenting on the trauma faced by Narayanan, the top court in its order had said, “The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect.”In 2001, the National Human Rights Commission awarded him a compensation of ₹10 lakh. Narayanan had told the top court that the malicious prosecution had a “catastrophic effect on his service career” that destroyed his career, life span, savings, honour, academic work as well as self-esteem. The peace of his family was affected. Despite all odds, Narayanan kept fighting to be redeemed of the ignominy facing him of being accused of espionage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-must-probe-isro-spy-case-independently-sc-101627328440549.html
27-07-2021||India||Top AIADMK leaders call on Modi in Delhi||AIADMK leaders Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam, along with senior party leaders, Monday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, at a time when the party is facing the heat from several quarters back home.After the meeting, the leaders told reporters in New Delhi they discussed welfare measures and infrastructure for Tamil Nadu. However, party insiders said they did talk to PM Modi about the DMK government initiating a raid and filing a corruption case against former transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar last week. “They discussed the present situation in Tamil Nadu. They have discussed the raids and spoken about DMK ministers who amassed wealth and are holding a post now, and that Income Tax should look into such cases,” said a senior AIADMK leader who did not wish to be named.The dual leadership was accompanied by former municipal administration minister SP Velumani, Panneerselvam’s son and MP O P Raveeendranath and former Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambidurai. The meeting went on for about 35-minutes. “We thanked Prime Minister Modi Ji for campaigning for alliance candidates in the assembly election,” Palaniwami told reporters after the meeting. “We have urged the Prime Minister to allocate sufficient Covid-19 vaccines for Tamil Nadu.”They also demanded that the Union government not permit Karnataka to construct the Mekedatu dam. Palaniswami reiterated how Panneerselvam, late J Jayalalithaa and himself, when they had occupied the chief minister’s chair, had urged the Centre not to clear the project. “If the dam is built the Delta districts would turn into a desert. About 14 districts are dependent on the Cauvery river for drinking water. So, we placed a demand before the Prime Minister on this. Also, to address the water scarcity in Tamil Nadu, we have asked him to implement the Godavari-Cauvery river link initiative as soon as possible.”Palaniswami didn’t answer a question on expelled leader V K Sasikala’s opinion that there has to be a single leadership in the AIADMK. “They didn’t discuss Sasikala. She hasn’t achieved anything for us to discuss. She is just making some noise after we lost the election,” the leader quoted above said. “Even in our meetings in the party headquarters, we have not been discussing her anymore.”It is the first time Palaniswami and Panneerselvam are meeting PM Modi together as their party grew closer to the BJP following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. Panneerselvam had earlier said in 2018 that he patched up with Palaniswami on Modi’s advice.On July 22, officials from the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) raided 26 places linked to the former transport minister and seized ₹2,556,000 cash and other incriminating documents. They filed a case on a slew of charges, including disproportionate assets. It is seen as the beginning of a crackdown as one of the DMK’s election promises is to establish a special court to prosecute top AIADMK ministers including Palaniswami, Panneerselvam and Velumani on charges of corruption. The DMK, while in opposition, had submitted complaints of corruption against six AIADMK ministers to Governor Banwarilal Purohit.The AIADMK called the raid a political vendetta. The party plans to protest across Tamil Nadu on July 28 against the DMK for not fulfilling its election promises, such as abolishing NEET and cutting fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-aiadmk-leaders-call-on-modi-in-delhi-101627328380533.html
27-07-2021||India||Lingayat community unhappy with BSY resignation||Even though BS Yediyurappa claimed his resignation was voluntary, his removal presents a challenge for the saffron party in the coming days. The first signs of trouble came hours after his resignation when some seers of the Lingayat community warned the BJP of consequences for removing the 78-year-old leader. In some parts of the state, protests were reported against the high command. “BS Yediyurappa has given his resignation in pain. Karnataka BJP will be washed away in tears. BJP should reconsider its decision,” Dingaleshwara Swami, one of the prominent seers in Karnataka. The Lingayat community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and Yediyurappa has been the tallest leader of the community. Moreover, rumours that a non-Lingayat leader could be the next chief minister has irked the Lingayat community. “We have been hearing names of Brahmin and Vokkaliga chief minister candidates. These are only rumours and the decision will be taken by the central high command, considering all aspects but several Lingayat leaders are unhappy with this someone outside the community becoming a chief minister,” said Lingayat legislator on the condition of anonymity. Shikaripura, Yediyurappa’s constituency in Shimoga district, witnessed an undeclared bandh in the afternoon with shops and other commercial establishments shut in protest, soon after Yediyurappa’s resignation. Even though Yediyurappa was born in the Mandya district, Shikaripura became the base of his political activities. In Hassan, supporters of Yediyurappa took out a march on the main streets raising slogans. They criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, maintaining that they forced the chief minister to resign. Another leader added that among the other Lingayat leaders, no leader could be considered a leader for the community. “Yediyurappa is the only mass leader in Karnataka. More than the party, in many cases it is his following that brings the votes. In a way, it is good that the replacement is taking place now because we will have some time to calm nerves before the elections,” he said. For the BJP, the Lingayat seers are not the only problem. The 12 legislators from Congress and the JDS defected to the BJP and helped Yediyurappa form a government in July 2019. When there was a delay from the central leadership in accommodating these leaders into the cabinet, it was Yediyurappa who stood firm by them. With the news of Yediyurappa’s removal, these MLAs have got into a huddle. When asked about the future of these MLAs, Yediyurappa on Monday said that they are all together. However, it remains unclear whether these MLAs will keep portfolios they are holding now, with Yediyurappa having no say in deciding the cabinet. These MLAs resigned from the respective parties to join BJP on the promise of getting minister posts. In case, any of them are removed from the current posts, it could lead to problems for the BJP since the party came to power because of these turncoats. “He (Yediyurappa) was mentioning to me that on July 26, he may receive a favourable decision from the high command. But things have happened on the contrary. We all have to abide by the decision… but he is exiting only from the chief minister post and not from active politics,” said K Sudhakar, one of the turncoats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lingayat-community-unhappy-with-bsy-resignation-101627328321187.html
27-07-2021||India||Yediyurappa: A doughty fighter with a weakness for Parivar||In April this year, ground reports began to trickle in that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was trailing badly in the by-elections to Belagavi Lok Sabha seat. The bypolls were necessitated after the death of Union minister Suresh Angadi due to Covid-19. A popular MP, he had won the seat in 2019 for the fourth consecutive time with a margin of nearly four lakh votes. Taking into consideration the large margin of victory earlier, as well as to encash on the sympathy factor, the BJP had fielded Mangala Angadi, his wife, for the polls. But closer to voting day, internal party reports indicated that party was trailing as the Congress with a formidable candidate was giving it a tough fight. That is when the party sent an SOS to its most dependable vote-catcher in the state, chief minister B S Yediyurappa (BSY). The 78-year-old was down with a 102-degree fever and had gradually turned physically weak, having just recovered from a bout of Covid-19. But despite that and amid protests from family members, Yediyurappa flew to Belagavi to hold meetings and roadshows for two days, thus ensuring BJP’s victory, albeit with a small margin. It is this doughtiness and never say die attitude that has served Yediyurappa well over the last five decades of his political career. Born in Bookankere of Mandya district in southern Karnataka, it was however, Shivamogga in the Malnad region of the state - where he moved to become a clerk in a rice mill and eventually marry the daughter of the mill owner - that gave him a political career. He was elected eight times from Shikaripura (literally the ‘land of hunters’) constituency, served as leader of opposition thrice, deputy chief minister once and the chief minister of Karnataka four times. Yediyurappa tasted electoral defeat only once in 1999 when against his advice, the Sangh as a part of its longer-term plan, forced the BJP to enter into an alliance with the unpopular incumbent government of Janata Dal (United) led by J H Patel. BJP lost the battle but managed to win the war when large parts of the Ramakrishna Hegde-J H Patel-led Janata faction later merged into the BJP, enabling the saffron party under BSY to cement its position in the state. For the legions of his admirers, he is known as ‘Raja Huli’ (King Tiger, a reference to a popular Kannada movie), who built the saffron party in Karnataka when it was an unknown entity. Yediyurappa was already criss-crossing Karnataka on a bicycle to hear the woes of people, in 1987, a year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally joined the BJP. BSY helped build the party brick-by-brick, undertaking agitations on behalf of landless and bonded labourers. While other BJP leaders like Anant Kumar, Rama Bhat, B B Shivappa, K S Eshwarappa and V S Acharya too played an important role in building the party, two things helped BSY: loyalty and caste. He has been loyal to the Sangh Parivar, if not always to the BJP. In 1985, when BJP won only two seats - Yediyurappa himself and Vasant Bangera from Belthangady - both were offered incentives to move over to either the then ruling Janata Party or Congress. While Bangera crossed over, Yediyurappa stood steadfast. Even in 2012, when he got angry by the treatment meted out to him by the BJP high command and left to form the Karnataka Janata Paksha, he maintained cordial relations with the larger Sangh Parivar. The second key reason for his rise was that the Sangh - which was till then dominated by Brahmins and Vysyas (Banias) - quickly identified that Yediyurappa, a Lingayat whose fellow community members are nearly 17 per cent of the state population, would be a good asset in its social engineering outreach. With his overt religiosity and ability to network amongst the numerous Lingayat swamis and mutts, he helped the Sangh get an entry into numerous cooperative networks like regional banks, milk unions, farmer associations, sugar and rice mills, educational enterprises, apart from others. These institutions exert tremendous influence at a local district level by offering patronage and these networks, till then, were largely dominated by the Congress party. BSY also groomed a generation of young leaders and today, several of his proteges are in senior positions both in the party and the government. However, Yediyurappa’s rise as the ‘tallest’ Lingayat as well as BJP leader in the state has not always been benign. While senior BJP leaders like Anant Kumar or Sadananda Gowda who did not see eye-to-eye with him were forced to ‘exile’ themselves to national politics, even other Lingayat leaders like B B Shivappa and more recently, Basangouda Patil Yatnal or Jagadish Shettar, were cut to size in the party if they tried to overshadow him. While allegiance to the larger Sangh has been his strength, Parivar (family) has been his weakness. Even as the BJP accused Congress and others of corruption and promoting dynasties, Yediyurappa ensured that his elder son Raghavendra became the Shivamogga MP and the younger son Vijayendra was made a vice president of the state unit. His son-in-law and grandson have been accused of corruption while other members of his family allegedly interfered in the state administration. Yediyurappa also carries the opprobrium of being the only chief minister of the state who was arrested and jailed in a corruption case. Several other cases are pending investigation. Irrespective of the taints, Yediyurappa’s departure as chief minister and the BJP face in the state marks the beginning of a new political chapter in Karnataka’s politics. The BJP may struggle to find somebody whose name has the same brand cachet and recognition, both by its supporters and opponents, as Yediyurappa’s did. Also, like his peer, Deve Gowda, who is still active in politics at the age of 88, Yediyurappa is a round the clock politician who will find it hard to retire. It remains to be seen whether he accepts a rumored gubernatorial role and gracefully walks into the political sunset or has some other things planned for the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-a-doughty-fighter-with-a-weakness-for-parivar-101627328261025.html
27-07-2021||India||A span of challenges, unfulfilled dreams||BS Yediyurappa’s resignation as the chief minister of Karnataka brought down curtains yet another time for him at the helm. In a political career spanning five decades, the 78-year-old might be the only politician in India to become the chief minister of a state four times and never complete his term, an indication of turbulence he faced in his long political career.In 2007, he was in office for seven days, followed by the 2011 term, when he resigned over corruption charges after being CM for three years. In 2018, he was in office for two days, and in 2021, the BJP asked him to resign due to concerns over his age.Even though his days in power saw trouble, his political growth from a clerk to the chief minister was a remarkable journey. Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yediyurappa was born into a poor family in Mandya district in 1943. After finishing his education, he got a job as a first-division clerk with the social welfare department and got posted in Shimoga (now Shivamoga) district in Karnataka in 1965, which later became his political home ground. The same year, he resigned from the job and joined Shankar rice mill as a clerk. Within a year, he married the daughter of the mill owner and started a hardware store. Yediyurappa was involved with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) since his teenage days, and after moving to Shikaripura in Shivamoga, he began taking part in active politics. By 1970, he got appointed as the secretary of RSS in Shikaripura, and in 1980, when the Bharatiya Janata Party was formed, he became one of the leaders who built the party in the state. Since the formation of the BJP, his political career saw a steady growth. In 1983, he was elected to the assembly from Shikaripura. In 1988, he became the BJP state president, and by 1994, he became the leader of the opposition. Over the decades of political circus in the state, consisting of a series of splits between the Congress, Janata Party, a coalition of parties, and untimely deaths of Lingayat-supported leaders resulted in the community vote share shifting to the BJP, and Yediyurappa becoming the face of the community. With the support of the Lingayat community, under the leadership of Yediyurappa, the BJP became the single-largest party in 2004. Since the Congress and Janata Dal-Secular formed a coalition government, the party could not come to power. However, in 2006, that coalition collapsed. The JD(S) then approached the BJP with the offer to form the government. As per the deal struck between the two parties, JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy would become the chief minister for the first 20 months, and Yediyurappa will be at the helm for the next 20 months. However, Kumaraswamy refused to vacate the seat, which resulted in another collapse of the government. On November 12, 2007, Yediyurappa became the chief minister, but only for seven days. The JD(S) withdrew support, which resulted in the BJP walking out of the coalition. Riding on the sympathy wave, the BJP then swept the 2008 elections, and on May 30, 2008, Yediyurappa became the chief minister for the second time. However, the Karnataka Lokayukta investigating the illegal mining case submitted its report, indicting Yediyurappa for illegally profiteering from land deals in Bengaluru and Shivamoga. Yediyurappa was forced to resign on July 15, 2011, and in August 2011, he was arrested. Upset over the party asking for his resignation, Yediyurappa resigned from the BJP and formed his party – Karnataka Janata Paksha – in November 2012. This move cost the BJP the 2013 Karnataka legislative election as, despite Yediyurappa winning only six seats, he ate into the BJP vote bank, resulting in the Congress victory. In January 2014, after several rounds of talks with the BJP leaders, he returned to the party, and during the 2018 general election, the BJP emerged as the single-largest party. “In the 2018 elections, despite the Modi wave, the BJP was relying on Yediyurappa’s pull over the Lingayat community. With the Congress trying to create a separate Lingayat religion, Yediyurappa stood his ground that the community cannot be divided, and it resulted in BJP becoming the single-largest party,” said a Congress leader on the condition of anonymity. After the BJP became the single largest party, the Karnataka governor invited Yediyurappa to form the government but he could not prove the majority, resulting in him resigning as the chief minister on May 19, 2018, after two days in power. “Since the day Congress and the JD(S) formed the government he was trying to bring it down. He knew it was his last chance to be the chief minister, so they bought out MLAs offering them posts. He was desperate to become the chief minister in his last term,” the Congress leader added. With his resignation on Monday, there are several questions about his role in the party. Yediyurappa, too, has made it clear that he will not leave the state or active politics. On multiple occasions, he has reiterated that he will continue to strengthen the party he helped build.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-span-of-challenges-unfulfilled-dreams-101627328140547.html
27-07-2021||India||Franklin Templeton won’t launch new debt funds for now, Supreme Court told||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday got an undertaking from Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) against the launch of any fresh debt schemes till the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) takes a final call on the market regulator SEBI’s decision to bar the company from launching any new schemesThe top court was hearing an appeal filed by the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) against a June 28 order passed by SAT staying the SEBI order of June 7 that restrained Franklin Templeton from going ahead with the launch of any new schemes.Reminding the company that the public should not be cheated, the bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said the court was still struggling with the fallout of the company’s six schemes being abruptly shut down in April 2020 citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond market.“You are well aware of what has happened to your six schemes. We are still struggling with those schemes. We are not concerned about the refund (to be paid by the company) but the public should not be cheated,” the bench said.On June 7 this year, SEBI ordered Franklin Templeton Asset Management Company (FTAMC) not to launch any fresh schemes and directed a refund of investment management and advisory fee along with interest calculated at 12% per annum. This amount came to a little over ₹512 crore.Appearing for SEBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the SAT figure of over ₹512 crore was not an imaginary figure as the same was calculated under statutory rules. He even sought a stay of the order passed by SAT that stopped the order prohibiting FTAMC from issuing fresh debt schemes.Senior advocates Harish Salve and Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for FTAMC, said they were willing to give an undertaking not to issue any fresh schemes till the disposal of their appeal by SAT. As the next date for the tribunal to hear the case is on August 30, Salve said, “Between today and 31st (of August), no scheme will be launched.”The bench took this statement on record and said in its order that FTAMC undertakes that no new scheme will be launched till the disposal of the appeal before SAT. On the issue of refund, Salve said this is an interim order by which the tribunal has directed the firm to deposit 50% of the total amount.The bench agreed that the order with regard to 50% deposit was “quite fair” and told SEBI that it could contest the appeal before the tribunal. The court gave four weeks’ time for SEBI to file its response before SAT. On July 14, the top court held that closure of any scheme will require the trustees to seek the consent of majority unitholders after publishing a notice giving reasons for winding up the said scheme.The closure of the six schemes led SEBI to order a forensic audit as the discontinued schemes had approximately ₹25,000 crore as assets. The schemes were Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund. The probe by SEBI found “serious lapses” with regard to the closed schemes.Finding SEBI’s refund order against FTAMC as “excessive”, SAT ordered the company to deposit ₹250 crore in an escrow account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/franklin-templeton-won-t-launch-new-debt-funds-for-now-supreme-court-told-101627328021422.html
27-07-2021||India||Prashant Kishor’s I-PAC team ‘confined’ to Tripura hotel||AGARTALA: At least 23 members of Prashant Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee ( I-PAC) were on Monday asked to stay inside a hotel in Agartala till their Covid-19 test reports arrive, police said. The team arrived in the state last week to assess potentiality of Trinamool Congress (TMC) to expand its base in Tripura, which will go for assembly polls in 2023. The state is currently ruled by Bharatiya Janata Party- Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (BJP-IPFT) alliance. Police said some of these persons were found moving at different places amidst Covid-19 curfew. Police added that they visited their hotel on Monday and inquired about their purpose of visit, calling it a ‘routine check-up’. All of them underwent Covid-19 tests on Monday and were asked to stay inside a private hotel where they have been staying, till they get clearance from the health department, said a police officer from East Agartala police station. A person from the I-PAC team stranded at the hotel said they were not given any reason for staying in the hotel except that the order came “from the top”. The person added that the RT-PCR tests are suspected to have been so aligned that the visiting team members could board their flights back to Kolkata and do nothing apart from that. A state health department official said the team members had violated the mandatory RT-PCR negative test report to enter the state for non-residents. Meanwhile, TMC’s Tripura unit president Asish Lal Singh termed it as an attack on democracy. “The I-PAC team came here for a survey. The state government has put them under virtual house arrest as they are scared of their survey results...,” said Singh. President of BJP in the state Manik Saha said he is not aware of anything about this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-s-i-pac-team-confined-to-tripura-hotel-101627327660525.html
27-07-2021||India||2.7-3.3 million Covid-19 deaths in India: Study||There have been at least 2.7 to 3.3 million deaths due to the two waves of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India, estimates a study authored by Dr Prabhat Jha from Centre for Global Health Research at the University of Toronto and Dr Paul Novosad from the department of economics at Dartmouth College. India’s official toll due to Covid-19 currently stands at just over 421,000.The study is based on excess mortality recorded across eight states and seven cities between June 2020 and 2021, and extrapolates this to arrive at the final estimate.The median excess mortality recorded during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 was 22%; ranging from 63% in Andhra Pradesh to 6% in Kerala. This increased to 46% during the second wave of the pandemic between April and June this year and was as high as 198% in Madhya Pradesh.Excess mortality is the gap between the number of deaths due to any cause seen in 2020 and 2021 as compared to the years before. Researchers believe that most of these additional deaths are likely to have been due to Covid-19.The study did adjust for excess mortality below the age of 35 years, “which are unlikely to be from Covid.”The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, which was recently uploaded on MedRxiv, has based the excess mortality figures on the civil registration system which records all births and deaths, data from several healthcare institutions collected through the health management information system, and a telephonic survey.The excess mortality estimated by the current study is certainly less than the 4.9 million excess deaths estimated by a study by the Center for Global Development . The report based the excess mortality estimates on international infection fatality rate – proportion of deaths among the total number of people infected – and the factor of undercounting infections according to the seroprevalence data. This was in addition to data from civil registration system and another longitudinal survey.Last week, responding to the CGD study without naming it, India issued a statement saying such numbers are “totally fallacious”. “Given the robust and statute-based death registration system in India, missing out on deaths is unlikely,” it added.In the latest study, the researchers estimated 0.63 million excess deaths for five states -- Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Haryana -- for which the researchers had data available for ten or more months, including for period when the number of cases were low. “This implies, crudely, about 3.2 million deaths nationally in both viral waves, assuming other states have also have five times more excess deaths,” the study said.The researchers also noted that much of this excess mortality in the states in question, 0.45 million , occurred during April and May when the second wave of the pandemic was at its height.“Three different databases: A survey, CRS, HMIS, all pointing towards at least 27% excess mortality over a year. Note that these results are after using UN/SRS baselines in the main. All 3 databases suggest that bulk of excess mortality was in the second wave. Our conclusion: India’s COVID death rate may be about 7-8 times higher than the officially reported 290/million population,” said Chinmay Tumbe, one of the authors of the paper and assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2733-million-covid-19-deaths-in-india-study-101627327600496.html
27-07-2021||India||O2 Audit: Around 20% of oxygen plants announced during second wave operational||The Union government has sanctioned 1,222 pressure swing absorption (PSA) plants that act as oxygen generators for hospitals, and of these, 245 – roughly a fifth – have been commissioned in different regions till July 20, the Union health ministry told parliament last week.The Centre announced new plants will be set up across the country after the April-May peak of Covid-19 triggered an unprecedented shortage of medical oxygen, with reports suggesting there may have been hundreds of deaths nationwide during this period because the gas was in short supply.In October 2020, during the first wave of Covid-19 cases, the central government invited tenders for 162 PSA oxygen plants -- by April 2021, only 33 of these were operational, according to a tweet by the Union health ministry on April 18.In the aftermath of the second wave, the government first announced on April 26 that 551 plants will be set up using the PM Cares funds. These were in addition to an unnamed number that were to be funded by central ministries and public sector units (PSUs).On June 14, a statement by the ministry of science and technology quoted Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) secretary C Satish Reddy as saying that the number of PSA plants to be set up under PM Cares was 850. DRDO has been executing some of the PSA plants projects, while for the rest, the government has floated tenders.In a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office on July 9, officials told the new cabinet that in all, over 1,500 PSA plants were set to be installed in the country. Altogether, these will support 400,000 beds, the statement added but without specifying by when these would be installed -- the Prime Minister directed officials to ensure it is done at the earliest.According to officials in the health ministry, who asked not to be named, an additional 250 PSA plants are expected to be installed by August 15 and the remaining from the lot of 1,222 sanctioned will be commissioned by the end of the year.The July 23 statement by the health ministry to parliament also states that the number of plants to be set up by central ministries and PSUs in addition to the 1,222 is 351, and that the states have separately informed the Union government that they are setting up 1,023 plants on their own.The health ministry’s reply in parliament said the 1,222 plants will together account for a capacity of around 1,771MT a day – which comes to about a fifth of the peak 9,690MT liquid medical oxygen dispatched by the Centre to states in a single day in the April-May period.Officials in other states indicated that the number of plants they are working on may be higher than for which information has been shared with the Centre. Uttar Pradesh, which got 127 plants from the Centre, has sanctioned 414 PSA plants on its own and 145 of them have become operational, an official said.Rajasthan, which got 51 from the Centre, sanctioned 429 plants on its own and of them 280 are operational, according to the state government.Similarly, health department officials in Maharashtra said the state planned 462 PSA plants and of them 98 are operational.According to projects.datameet.org, a portal that tracked reports about deaths due to oxygen shortage or disruption in hospitals in April and May this year, 619 people may have died during the crisis.The government in its response to parliament said oxygen supply for medical purposes increased to 9,690 metric tonnes in May 2021 from 5,770 in August 2020.The health ministry informed Parliament on July 23 that on July 15, 1,244 liquid medical oxygen tankers were available in the country as compared to 225 in March 2020.The ministry also said that in 2019-20, it released ₹1,113 crore to states under National Health Mission for Covid management, apart from ₹15,000 crore given under Covid Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness package. The phase two of the package of ₹23,132 crore (including state contribution) has also been approved, the ministry said.(With inputs from state bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-audit-around-20-of-oxygen-plants-announced-during-second-wave-operational-101627327540465.html
27-07-2021||India||Nearly 10% of eligible population inoculated: Co-WIN data||Close to 10% of India’s eligible population has now been fully vaccinated for Covid-19, data from the government’s Co-WIN system showed on Monday, when over 6.5 million doses were given across the country, according to its dashboard.In terms of partial protection, 26.5% of the 940 million eligible population has now had one dose. In all, there are now a little over 436 million doses given to people since the drive began on January 16.“Also, in another significant achievement today, Maharashtra became the first state to vaccinate more than 1 crore (10 million) people with both doses of Covid-19 vaccine,” the Union health ministry said in its latest Covid-19 vaccination update issued on Monday evening.In the last week, India administered an average of 4.1 million doses a day – far lower than its peak of 6.4 million doses a day recorded on average in the seven days ending June 26.On Monday, the number of second doses administered was a little over 30% of the doses given during the day but this share is likely to increase in coming days as the 18-plus age group, which became eligible for doses on May 1, is scheduled to take their second doses of Covishield beginning end of July.In terms of the most doses ever given, India’s record was on June 21 when the universal free adult vaccination programme was opened up by the Union government – that day, 8.8 million doses were administered.Monday’s vaccination numbers were the fifth highest recorded in the 192 days of the drive.The increase in vaccine coverage comes days after serological surveys suggested two-thirds of the country’s population, on average, may have some protection from the coronavirus due to either vaccination or an infection that left them with antibodies.Antibodies from a past infection are expected to wane in a matter of months, possibly enough to allow for a re-infection, although such an infection might still manifest itself in asymptomatic or a mild manner. Experts said this makes vaccines necessary since they also impart long-lasting adaptive immune memory.Government officials and experts have also cautioned against reading too much into population immunity estimates until there is ample coverage of vaccination.A country like Israel, which has one of the highest coverage of full vaccination at close to 62% of the population, has seen an increase in infections in recent weeks due to the more resistant Delta variant.India will need to significantly boost its vaccination rates since at the current pace of 4.1 million vaccination a day, the country will not meet its target of vaccinating the entire population by December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-10-of-eligible-population-inoculated-co-win-data-101627327420487.html
27-07-2021||India||Afghan Army chief postpones India visit over Taliban offensive||Afghan Army chief General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai has postponed a visit to India this week because of the offensive by the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Afghan embassy said on Monday.The visit, though scheduled several months ago, would have coincided with US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s trip to New Delhi. Ahmadzai, who was appointed last month as part of a shake-up of the higher echelons of Afghanistan’s security set-up, was to visit India during July 27-30.The visit was postponed because of the “intensity of the war and Taliban’s increased assault and offensive” in the country, the Afghan embassy said without giving details.Ahmadzai was scheduled to hold talks with his Indian counterpart, General MM Naravane, and meet National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other top security officials. He was also scheduled to travel to Pune to meet Afghan cadets being trained at various institutions.The visit was aimed at providing an opportunity for the two sides to hold consultations on the security situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of a campaign by the Taliban to capture territory and crucial border crossings with other countries.Intense fighting has been reported from various parts of Afghanistan as Afghan forces attempt to take back districts and key centres captured by the Taliban in a campaign that has coincided with the speedy drawdown of US and NATO forces. The US recently conducted air strikes to slow down the advance of the Taliban.India plays a key role in training Afghan military personnel – some 300 cadets are currently training in the country – and is also helping in the medical treatment of injured Afghan military personnel, with a number of them being treated in hospitals across the country.For India, a key security concern is the presence in Afghanistan of more than 7,000 Pakistani terrorists from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. These fighters are fighting alongside the Taliban in many areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-army-chief-postpones-india-visit-over-taliban-offensive-101627327360425.html
27-07-2021||India||No cyber breach in NIC email system, Parliament told||There was no breach in the government’s official email system maintained by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), the Union ministry of electronics and information technology told parliament last week, in a stand that appeared to contradict several cybersecurity incidents in the past year.In February, HT reported on a series of phishing mails by attackers who gained access to NIC domain email addresses, triggering multiple advisories by different government IT departments warning officials against opening attachments or links contained within them. HT is aware of at least two people – former defence ministry officials – whose devices were hacked at the time.“No,” the ministry said in response to a question by a Lok Sabha member who asked to know “whether there was a cyber security breach into the e-mail system of Government maintained by National Informatics Centre (NIC) in the recent past.”The response, by Union minister of state for the IT ministry Rajeev Chandrashekhar, also added: “The email system is equipped with a defense-in-depth security architecture with a layered security approach. All incoming mails are scanned for the presence of any malware, spam, phishing, spoofing, sender reputation etc. In addition to the above, network level firewall, application level firewall. Intrusion Prevention System etc. are deployed…”“In order to enhance the security of email accounts, National Informatics Centre (NIC) has implemented geo-fencing. This allows access to the users email account only from the country where the user is physically present,” the minister added.The government also added that it had made multi-factor user authentication “mandatory for email access and is being rolled out for email users to strengthen the email account security”. Multi-factor user authentication refers to a second requirement, usually a one-time password, for someone to access an email service in addition to their password.Altogether, HT is aware of at least six NIC domain addresses – five with @gov.in addresses and one with @nic.in, which have been used to send out phishing emails, prodding users to download attachments or click on links that could ultimately compromise their devices.A number of senior government officials, including those from the ministries of defence and external affairs, received this emails, some of the recipients confirmed to HT at the time.NIC, which runs the official email service for the government, at the time clarified that the compromised emails were blocked immediately and no breach or loss of data was reported.Experts said the multi-factor authentication in a system such as NIC’s may not make it fool-proof and that the reply does not take into acknowledge the magnitude of cybersecurity challenges. “NIC.IN domain, like every other email service, uses the SMTP protocol, which does not support 2FA (two-factor authentication), and is a known problem across every other email service. 2FA hence only provides some protection against web logins from automated attacks and do not prevent SMTP access,” said Anand Venkatanarayanan, cybersecurity strategy advisor to DeepStrat.Such vulnerabilities, he added, “allows compromised credentials (harvested from elsewhere) to send more malware to others, thus creating a chain of compromise, extending to everyone in the NIC domain”.“At that point in time, it is equivalent to compromising the entire domain, which the reply does not consider.“This is worrying because defence at depth, layered security etc are not disconnected from human errors and malware writers know how to evade firewalls, bypassing them via human channels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-cyber-breach-in-nic-email-system-parliament-told-101627324300852.html
27-07-2021||India||Rain fury leaves 164 dead, 100 missing in Maharashtra||The search operation for the missing 31 people in Maharashtra’s landslide-hit Taliye village was called off on Monday, officials said, even as the death toll in the state pummeled by days of heavy rainfall rose to 164, with at least 100 people still missing.The Konkan and western districts in the state have witnessed heavy rainfall since last week, which triggered floods and landslides in several villages. According to official data, 890 villages in nine districts were affected.Rescue teams have recovered 53 bodies from the site of the landslide in Taliye village and five people were reported injured till Monday, Raigad district collector Nidhi Chaudhari said. The 31 people still missing will be declared dead following due process, she said.“The teams have stopped search and rescue operation at landslide-hit Taliye village. 31 missing people to be declared dead following due process. The search for these missing people has been called off after seeking the opinion of NDRF, SDRF, TDRF. The relatives of the missing people also demanded closure of the operations,” Choudhari said.The village, in Mahad taluka of Raigad district, was flattened out after a portion of a hillock collapsed after heavy rainfall burying several houses on Thursday night.Respecting sentiments of the survivors and relatives of the missing people, the operations to search for the 31 missing people have been officially called off, Chaudhari said.“It has been a painful experience for us. We have lost our near and dear ones,” said a resident of the village, whose five-year-old son died in the landslide.Till Monday, with 71 deaths, Raigad district has reported the maximum fatalities, while 41 people have died in Satara, 21 in Ratnagiri, 12 in Thane, seven in Kolhapur, four in Mumbai and two each in Sindhudurg, Pune, Wardha and Akola, the state government said in an official release.Over 229,000 people have been evacuated from affected areas, the release added.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar toured various rain-hit villages in Sangli district on Monday and interacted with the residents.“Maha Vikas Aghadi government will provide all possible help to those who have been affected by floods. I, cabinet ministers Jayant Patil, Vijay Wadettiwar, and minister of state Vishwajeet Kadam visited the flood-affected areas in the Sangli district and took stock of the situation. In the next two days, a final decision about (the relief) will be taken in the presence of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray,” Pawar, who also holds the Finance portfolio, told reporters.The work to assess losses caused due to floods is yet to be completed, Pawar said.“Real picture about the damage caused to crops and farms will emerge after the water recedes. I have instructed the district administration to continue with the assessment of losses at new places,” he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-fury-leaves-164-dead-100-missing-in-maharashtra-101627324300179.html
27-07-2021||India||Yediyurappa resigns as CM after a ‘trial by fire’||Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yediyurappa resigned as the chief minister of Karnataka on Monday, ending months of speculation due to growing dissidence within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the only southern state it has ever been in power.The 78-year-old made the announcement in an emotional speech at an event celebrating two years in power before submitting his resignation to governor Thaawarchand Gehlot . The four-time chief minister, who battled criticism and public attacks from within his party and cabinet over the past three months, said he quit “voluntarily” and thanked the BJP.“I’m not sad. I’m happy. I can’t thank in words PM Modi, Amit Shah, and JP Nadda to let me be the chief minister even though I was over 75 years,” said Yediyurappa. “There is no question of political retirement for any reason, I’m with the karyakartas and the people.”He also scotched rumours of having accepted a gubernatorial posting. “Atal Bihari Vajpayee had offered me to become the central minister when he was the PM, I had said no… There is no question of becoming governor. I will work to strengthen the organisation in Karnataka. I have not asked for any position, nor will accept it,” he said.The resignation -- which came roughly 10 days after he travelled to Delhi and met Modi and Shah -- triggered speculation about his successor.BJP national general secretary and Karnataka in-charge Arun Singh said the decision was left to the party’s parliamentary board and legislature party. “I will not say now. The parliamentary board of the BJP will decide the next chief minister and in the legislature party meeting,” Singh told reporters in Delhi without mentioning a date for the meeting.But party leaders said on condition of anonymity said the meeting was likely to occur on Tuesday with Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan as the central observer. Gehlot asked Yediyurappa to continue as caretaker chief minister until his successor is appointed.When asked if he had suggested a replacement for chief minister, Yediyurappa said, “I have not given any names, nor will I suggest anyone. Who should be made [the next CM] is left to the central leadership. I will continue doing my work.”Senior party leaders told HT that among the contenders were Union minister Pralhad Joshi, BJP national general secretary CT Ravi, national organising secretary BL Santhosh, and assembly speaker Vishveshwar Hegde Kageri. Joshi, Santosh and Kageri are Brahmins; Ravi, the MLA from Chikkamagaluru, is a Vokkaliga, Karnataka’s second-largest community concentrated in southern Karnataka, where the party is trying to make inroads.If the party looks to replacing Yediyurappa with another leader from the dominant Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, probable names include mining minister Murugesh Nirani, industries minister Jagadish Shettar and MLAs Arvind Bellad and Basanagouda Patil Yatnal.Nirani is a businessman-politician whose repeated Delhi visits in recent months have raised eyebrows in party circles. Shettar earlier served as chief minister between 2012 and 2013. Bellad and Yatnal were among the most trenchant critics of Yediyurappa who publicly sought his ouster.A Lingayat strongman, Yediyurappa is credited with having built the BJP from the grassroots in the 2000s and leading the party to its first victory in a southern state in 2008. He has pan-state appeal and nurtured the Lingayats -- comprising roughly 16% of Karnataka’s population -- as a reliable vote bank for the BJP. Even in his last days in office, he rallied support from influential Lingayat seers and mutts.But his legacy is tarnished by multiple corruption charges, including that of bribing and influencing Opposition legislators to prove his government’s majority. He resigned in 2011 after being indicted in a corruption case. He briefly left the BJP to form the Karnataka Janata Paksha, which bruised the BJP in the 2013 elections, before merging his outfit with the BJP a year later.He battled rising dissidence during his last year, especially over his son and Karnataka BJP vice-president BY Vijayendra. Several party leaders and ministers accused Vijayendra -- Yediyurappa’s younger son -- of corruption, heavy handedness and running a parallel administration. BY Raghavendra, Yediyurappa’s elder son, is the MP from Shivamogga.Yediyurappa became chief minister for a fourth time in 2019 after the previous Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government collapsed following the sudden resignation of 17 legislators.After surviving with a thin majority for four months, Yediyurappa led the BJP to success in assembly bypolls in 2019,with the party winning 12 of 15 seats.Ten of the former Congress-JD(S) legislators were made ministers later.In his final speech as chief minister, Yediyurappa termed the two years in office as a “trial by fire”, saying he was not allowed to form a cabinet when the state was marooned in devastating floods in 2019.“I had decided to resign two months ago, as we complete two years of our government today. I thought it was apt to resign now and have submitted the resignation to the governor, and he has accepted it,” he said.Asserting that he will continue in politics and work to bring the BJP back to power, he said, “The party has nurtured me to this height, most probably no other politician in the country has got the privileges that I have got,” he said.Shikaripura, Yediyurappa’s constituency in Shimoga district that he won eight times, wore a deserted look with shops and other commercial establishments shut in protest. In Hassan, supporters of Yediyurappa took out a march on the main streets and shouted slogans in his support.An influential religious leader who met Yediyurappa last week said the Karnataka BJP will be washed away in tears due to Yediyurappa’s resignation. “BS Yediyurappa has given his resignation in pain. Karnataka BJP will be washed away in tears. BJP should reconsider its decision,” Dingaleshwara Swami, the chief of Balehosur Mutt, said.The Congress demanded the ouster of the BJP government.“There is no benefit for the common man if one corrupt CM is removed to make another corrupt as CM. Instead, the whole BJP party, which is responsible for the miseries of people, should be ousted,” former chief minister Siddaramaiah, who is Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka assembly, tweeted.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-resigns-as-cm-after-a-trial-by-fire-101627323820714.html
27-07-2021||India||Assam, Mizo CMs face off over violence at their border; 6 cops killed in clashes||Six Assam Police personnel were killed and dozens injured as a decades-long border dispute with neighbour Mizoram sparked violent clashes on Monday, prompting both chief ministers to publicly trade charges, and forcing Union home minister Amit Shah to intervene.Violence broke out at the Assam-Mizoram border shared by Cachar district's Lailapur and Kolasib district’s Vairengte around 11.30am over allegations of encroachment. Thousands of civilians on either side of the border hurled stones and charged at each other and security personnel with sticks and rods. Visuals showed policemen firing tear-gas shell and air pellets as people torched vehicles and huts.“I am deeply pained to inform that six brave jawans of Assam Police have sacrificed their lives while defending constitutional boundary of our state at the Assam-Mizoram border. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted.Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana accused Assam Police of entering Mizoram’s territory and committing arson. “Upon learning of the arson committed by Assam Police, residents of Vairengte town, Kolasib district proceeded to the site to inquire. These unarmed civilians were assaulted by Assam Police by lathi charging them and firing tear gas, thereby causing injuries to several civilians,” read the statement.The hostilities pared down after the chief ministers spoke on the phone. Shah also spoke to both chief ministers, asking them to resolve the border issue amicably without any violence, people familiar with developments said. Senior Union home ministry officials are closely watching the developments at the interstate border, said the people quoted above.Officials at Silchar Medical College Hospital (SMCH) in Assam confirmed on the condition of anonymity that 36 people were admitted with injuries from air gun shots and stone pelting. Cachar superintendent of police VC Nimbalkar was in the intensive care unit. Details of injuries on the Mizoram side were not available.The violence came two days after the chief ministers shared a stage with Shah and spoke of resolving the border dispute amicably. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power in Assam and Mizoram is ruled by the Mizo National Front.Assam’s Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6 km long border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. Mizoram was a part of Assam till 1972 when it became a Union Territory. It became a state in 1987. The territorial dispute has festered since then and fuelled sporadic clashes, the latest of which rocked the region in August 2020 and February 2021.Tensions first flared up around 11.30am, when around 200 Assam Police personnel attempted to construct a camp inside Mizoram’s territory, according police. While discussions were on between police officials of the two states, a group of people from Mizoram allegedly started pelting stones, the officials said requesting anonymity. Locals on the Assam side retaliated, they added.Senior administrative and police officials were immediately rushed to the spot but the violence worsened around 3:45 pm. Assam residents alleged tear-gas shells and air guns were fired from the Mizoram side.“I was near border area when people from Mizoram started firing. We tried to run away but a bullet touched my right arm and I fell on ground,” 25-year-old Fajar Ali, a resident of Assam who sustained an air gun injury on his hand, said.In a statement, Lalchamliana rejected these charges and said Assam Police personnel forcibly crossed the border post and damaged vehicles on the National Highway. CRPF officials were not immediately available for comment.He said Assam launched a volley of tear gas canisters and grenades at Mizoram Police around 4:50 pm. “Mizoram Police responded spontaneously by firing back at Assam Police,” he said.Mizoram said after Shah spoke to both chief ministers, Assam Police withdrew and handed the post back to the CRPF.The clashes took a political turn at 1.50pm when Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga tweeted a video of the clashes and tagged Shah and Sarma. “Shri @AmitShah ji….kindly look into the matter. This needs to be stopped right now,” he wrote.At 2.53pm, he tweeted a video of a couple sitting in a car with windows smashed in. “Innocent couple on their way back to Mizoram via Cachar manhandled and ransacked by thugs and goons.How are you going to justify these violent acts?” he asked.Sarma responded four minutes later, blaming Mizoram for the flare-up.“Honble Zoramthanga ji could you please investigate why are civilians from Mizoram holding sticks and trying to incite violence? We urge civilians to not take up law and order on their own hands and permit peaceful dialogue to take place between governments,” he tweeted, tagging Shah and the Prime Minister’s Office.At 3.25pm, he further wrote, “ Honble @ZoramthangaCM ji , Kolasib ( Mizoram) SP is asking us to withdraw from our post until then their civilians won’t listen nor stop violence. How can we run government in such circumstances? Hope you will intervene at earliest.”The tensions appeared to ease as evening approached. Sarma tweeted at 4.36pm that he spoke to Zoramthanga and said Assam will maintain status quo and peace along the border. “I have expressed my willingness to visit Aizawl and disscuss these issues if need be,” he said.Zoramthanga responded minutes later. “Hon’ble @himantabiswa ji, as discussed I kindly urge that Assam Police be instructed to withdraw from Vairengte for the safety of civilians,” he said.Assam Police said it was determined to protect Assam’s border.“It is unfortunate that large number of miscreants from Mizoram are indulging in stone pelting and such forms of attack at Assam government officials stationed at Lailapur to protect Assam’s land from encroachment. We strongly condemn these acts of vandalism and reiterate our resolve to protect Assam’s boundary,” Assam Police tweeted from its official handle.The Opposition condemned the violence.“We condemn the incident of firing on Assam Police personnel from the Mizoram side as reported in media. It is a matter of disgrace that such incident took place hours after union home minister left Assam [on Sunday]. It is also a matter of concern and humour that CMs of both states are arguing on Twitter on this issue,” said Assam Congress media in-charge Bobbeeta Sharma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-cms-face-off-over-violence-at-their-border-6-policemen-killed-in-clashes-101627323820113.html
27-07-2021||India||Personal details can’t be disclosed under RTI: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday said that personal information that has no relation to any public activity or interest, and the revelation of which can cause “unwarranted invasion” into the privacy of an individual, cannot be disclosed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act .A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said no larger public interest justifies the disclosure of the residential address of a candidate for a job, as well as their father’s name.The court’s order came while dismissing a plea by a man seeking the details of the address and father’s name of candidates appointed as multi-tasking staff in Rashtrapati Bhavan. The applicant was seeking the residential address and father’s name of the selected candidates.He challenged a January 29 decision of a single judge by the high court that dismissed his plea seeking the candidates’ details -- on the grounds that it was required to establish their bonafides -- under the RTI Act.The single judge had also imposed a cost of ₹25,000 on the man for concealing that his daughter also appeared for the same exam. The order also noted that providing him with details of the people who were appointed would be an invasion of their privacy.On Monday, the division bench upheld that decision, and said that the disclosure of personal information of the candidates has no relation to any public activity or interest.“The information which relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relation to any public activity or interest, or the disclosure of such information is unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individuals; in such circumstances, personal information cannot be disclosed by the central or the state public information officer. Thus, section 8 of the Right to Information Act has categorically mentioned that personal information cannot be supplied which has no relation to any public activity,” the bench said in its oral order.The court also said that it was in full agreement with the reasons given by the single judge while dismissing the plea. It noted that while all the queries of the man were answered, only one piece of information could not be given.Advocate Anurag Alhuwalia, the central government’s standing counsel, told the court that while five of the six details sought were provided to the man, the last one -- phone numbers, name and address of the successful candidates -- was not given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/personal-details-can-t-be-disclosed-under-rti-delhi-hc-101627323700048.html
27-07-2021||India||Parliament passes 2 bills amid disruption||The Lok Sabha on Monday approved two bills in the midst of Opposition protests over the Pegasus snooping controversy and farm laws, as the government got down to business after a near-complete wash-out of the first week of Parliament’s Monsoon Session.The Opposition, meanwhile, toughened its stand. In the morning, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi drove a tractor to Parliament, leading protests against the three agriculture reforms laws. In the evening, top Opposition parties such as the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party boycotted a meeting called by Rajya Sabha leader and Union minister Piyush Goyal to end the stalemate.The indication from the opposition camp is that the impasse is unlikely to get resolved soon. Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh announced that “the entire Opposition is united” and that their two key demands are: “a discussion on Pegasus snooping issue in the presence of Prime Minister or home minister; and a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry into the scandal.”HT reported on July 24 that the Congress would put these two demands before the government.Trinamool Congress’s Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O’Brien tweeted Jairam’s demands and said, “We need this in #Parliament. Not green tea at @PiyushGoyal office. Thanks. But no thanks.”In the Lok Sabha, many Opposition MPs objected to the motion to pass the Factoring Regulation Act (Amendment) bill, claiming that the House is not in order. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi backed the motion. “Five days have gone to waste. I appeal to all of you to participate in the discussion. This is a very important bill. We are ready to discuss your issues as well,” Joshi said, underlining that time was allotted for the bill in the Business Advisory Committee.Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury later tweeted, “In a brazen and egregious manner govt has been bulldozing the bills without discussion. When the house is not in order ― govt is passing the bills, thus depriving elected members from their constitutional right of the participation and ventilation of the public concern.”After that bill was passed in 12 minutes, another, the National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management Bill, piloted by the new food processing minister Pashupati Paras, was brought for passage. Amidst the din and furious protests by Opposition MPs, many of whom trooped to the well of the House, the bill was passed in seven minutes.Former Lok Sabha secretary general P Sreedharan maintained that the passage of bills in din is not unprecedented. “But it is not desirable. Parliament must debate, discuss before passing a bill. In 2008, eight bills were passed in 17 minutes amid din. But we should not rely upon the wrong precedence of the past.”On Monday morning, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi drove a tractor to Parliament along with senior party leaders Randeep Surjewala, Deepender Hooda and party MP Pratap Singh Bajwa to demand a repeal of the farm laws. Surjewala and some other leaders were even detained by the police and later released.Gandhi defended his action and said, “We have brought the message of farmers to Parliament. The government doesn’t allow discussion on the laws in Parliament. They are suppressing all the farmers of India. We have brought this (tractor) here. These black laws have to be withdrawn.”The government hit back. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, “Rahul Gandhi should not try to mislead the farmers and create an environment of anarchy in the country. Because of his habits and such a lack of understanding, he is not a universally accepted leader even in the Congress.”Both Houses faced repeated disruptions. In the Rajya Sabha, chairman Venkaiah Naidu expressed deep anguish at the continuous disruptions and said, “Members are being denied their opportunity. So, we are becoming helpless day by day. Important issues such as need for time-bound completion of Covid vaccination, unemployment caused due to pandemic, problems of students availing online education, hike in petroleum prices and essential commodities... could not be discussed because of this situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-2-bills-amid-disruption-101627323644960.html
27-07-2021||India||As BSY quits, buzz over his successor gains momentum||Soon after BS Yediyurappa announced his resignation on Monday, everyone's focus turned to his possible successor. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to make an announcement on the new chief minister and state BJP leaders say a delegation from New Delhi will arrive in Bengaluru on Tuesday, and announce the decision.When asked if he had suggested a replacement for chief minister, Yediyurappa said, “I have not given any names, nor will I suggest anyone. Who should be made (the next CM) is left to the central leadership. I will continue doing my work.”HT spoke with several leaders in the party to get an idea of the names doing the rounds.A senior leader who has served in the Karnataka cabinet said that there could be a generational shift in the state’s leadership. “To give you an example, after the demise of Anant Kumar, the party chose to field Tejasvi Surya as the candidate. It was big change and it was for the long term. So such a change could be expected this time,” said this person, who didn’t want to be named.A state minister said the chief minister could be from the all-powerful Lingayat community to which Yediyurappa belongs , adding that picking a chief minister from any other community would be mistake. “The party knows the importance of the Lingayat community. We have seen in the last three days how Lingayat seers have rallied behind Yediyurappa. We are hearing some names of (Murugesh) Nirani and Arvind Bellad,” said the minister who too asked not to be named.Nirani and Bellad are Lingayat leaders from north Karnataka, which is the heartland of the community. Nirani, a three-term MLA from Bilgi constituency, is currently the minister for mines and geology. Nirani is from the Panchamasali sub-sect of the Lingayat community, the largest sub-sect in the Lingayat community. Since there has been a demand for a chief minister from this community and from north Karnataka, he stands a good chance, another party leader said.However, other leaders claimed that the Lingayat community didn’t want Nirani to be the chief minister. “He is a businessman, and the community wants someone who is a political figure and who will stand with the community,” an MLA from north Karnataka said on condition of anonymity.Bellad is a two-term MLA but he is yet to get a cabinet position. While being a Lingayat leader puts him on the list of probable candidates, his lack of experience may work against him.Meanwhile, there is also some talk within the party that a non-Lingayat leader could be selected for the top post and the names of Pralhad Joshi, CT Ravi and CN Ashwath Narayan have been doing the rounds.Joshi, who led the party in 2013, when the Yediyurappa left the BJP to form another party, is currently serving as the union minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal, and Mines. However, the state hasn’t had a Brahmin chief minister since 1988 and Joshi is a Brahmin from north Karnataka.Joshi did hold a meeting on the Karnataka issue in New Delhi on Monday, and there is some speculation that the BJP might opt for a Brahmin candidate. “But the fact is that if they are considering Brahmin candidate, as much as Joshi, BL Santosh (BJP General Secretary organisation) has a chance. After Yediyurappa, he is the tallest leader in the party and he is very close to the Prime Minister,” said a BJP legislator from south Karnataka who asked not to be named.CT Ravi and Ashwath Narayan, who are from the Vokkaliga community, which is the second-largest vote bank in the state, are on the list of probable candidates. “There has been a talk in the party to move away from its dependence on the Lingayat community. Having a chief minister from the Vokkaliga community will help us break into that vote bank. And leaders like Ravi and Ashwath are young. They are good choices,” said a senior leader who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-bsy-quits-buzz-over-his-successor-gains-momentum-101627323399984.html
27-07-2021||India||No stay on Gautam Gambhir’s prosecution: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday shot down a plea by cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir to stay the criminal prosecution of his foundation for stocking and distributing Covid-19 drugs during the second wave, observing that the common man had to run helter-skelter for these essential drugs.“We also read the papers. We have our ears to the ground. People were running helter-skelter for oxygen and drugs and then suddenly a trust comes and says we will give you medicines because we have it in plenty. This is not on. We cannot allow this to happen,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah told the counsel for the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from East Delhi and his organisation, Gautam Gambhir Foundation.The bench added: “Individuals cannot distribute essential medicines. What was being distributed was a banned medicine. Everyone cannot start distributing it by procuring it somehow. We have seen how common man suffered. People were compelled to pay high prices.”The bench told senior counsel Kailash Vasudev, who appeared for Gambhir and his foundation, to approach the Delhi high court with their grievances after making it clear that the case is not at a stage for the top court to intervene.Vasudev, on his part, argued that Gambhir and his foundation tried to help people during the pandemic but the drug control department decided to prosecute them on the prodding of the high court.According to Vasudev, the drug control department initially cleared Gambhir’s foundation of any wrongdoing but then reversed its stand and launch a prosecution after the the high court refused to accept the first report. The counsel said that the high court order asking the drug control department to take action against Gambhir and his foundation required to be stayed.But the bench was not inclined to entertain the petition, saying Gambhir should put his defence before the high court by becoming a party in the case pending there.At this, Vasudev agreed to go back to the high court but requested for a stay on the prosecution process till the high court decides Gambhir’s plea, but the court turned down this plea, pointing out that the report by the drug control department highlighted several illegalities, which the high court noted in its order too.“You can pursue your remedies before the high court but we cannot help you. We cannot stay the prosecution. How can we stay the process? If you are in public life, you will have to go through this,” remarked the bench, compelling Vasudev to withdraw the petition.On July 16, Delhi’s drug controller, through an affidavit, informed the high court that it filed a prosecution complaint before a trial court against Gambhir’s foundation and that the medical dealers or retailers who provided medicines and oxygen devices for camps organised by the foundation were also suspended for 10 days. The complaint stated that the foundation violated the law since it did not have any licence to procure, stock and distribute drugs and oxygen.Gambhir did not comment on the apex court’s observations.Apart from Gambhir’s foundation, prosecution was initiated against Aam Aadmi Party MLAs Imran Hussain and Praveen Kumar for the alleged “unauthorised purchase or procurement, stocking and distribution of medicine and medical oxygen”.Gambhir distributed Fabiflu , an anti-viral medicine, at his office amid the second wave of the pandemic. Hussain and Kumar were allegedly hoarding oxygen devices for special camps.The report was filed in a public interest litigation seeking directions to lodge an FIR against the politicians for allegedly procuring and distributing large quantities of Covid medicines even as patients were scrambling to source them at the peak of the second wave in the Capital. Another application was filed by advocate Vedansh Anand in the pending petition, raising similar charges against Praveen Kumar and AAP MLA Preeti Tomar.On May 31, the court accepted the clean chit given to Tomar, though it slammed the drug controller for giving a clean chit to Gambhir. Three days later, the drug control department submitted yet another report stating that Gambhir’s foundation violated provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act as it did not have any licence to procure, stock and distribute drugs and oxygen.The matter before the Delhi High Court is listed for July 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-stay-prosecution-of-gambhir-s-foundation-in-covid-19-medicines-case-101627322441852.html

There is no threat to it. But I wanted to send a message to the NDA leadership. It is an alliance of four parties, but only JD(U) and BJP talk. So why go for a formality?” Sahni told Hindustan Times.Upset over not being allowed by the Uttar Pradesh government to install a statue of bandit-turned-politician late Phoolan Devi and denied entry in Varanasi, Sahni reminded BJP and JD(U) leaders that it is a government of four parties. “Even though VIP and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) have only four MLAs each, both parties are represented by a minister each in Nitish Kumar government,” he said.Later in the evening, Sahni met HAM-S national president and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, but did not divulge what transpired between the two. “Manjhi is our guardian,” said Sahni.Manjhi, who attended the NDA meeting, had criticised the UP government decision not to allow Sahni to install the statue and hold a press conference at Varanasi on Sunday. He had also extended support to the VIP for UP elections.Sahni, who was made to return from the Varanasi airport itself on Sunday, said, “The threat of Son of Mallah (as he calls himself) is visible in Uttar Pradesh as well. Nearly 5,000 policemen were deployed there. PM Narendra Modi ji believes there should be development for all. Yogi ji needs to understand this.”Aware of repercussions for the NDA government should VIP quit the alliance, BJP’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal was quick to issue a clarification over statue row. “In UP, the high court has debarred installation of statues. Even Yogiji has petitioned the court to allow him to install statues but he has also not been granted the permission yet,” said Jaiswal.With an eye of UP polls next year, Sahni had planned to install statues of Phoolan Devi at several places, including in Varanasi, to mark her death anniversary as “martyrdom day”.Phoolan came from Mallah (boatmen) community to which Sahni too belongs. The community has significant presence in eastern UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sahni-skips-nda-meeting-says-only-bjp-jdutalk-101627314699766.html
27-07-2021||India||Joblessness grows in cities, villages: CMIE||India’s unemployment rate soared to 7.14% in the week ending July 25, compared to a 5.98% rise the previous week (ending July 18), as joblessness increased both in urban areas and the rural hinterland, data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) released Monday showed.However, on a monthly basis, the joblessness rate showed an improvement, inching down from the near 10% levels in June, with economic activities picking up pace as the second wave of coronavirus disease infections continues to ebb.Even so, unemployment, mainly due to the effects of restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, remains high, experts said. Unemployment data from the CMIE, a widely cited gauge, are not considered to be official, but the country doesn’t put out similar high-frequency employment/unemployment data.According to CMIE, which tracks the labour market with proprietary tools, urban unemployment continues to be higher than rural at 8.01%, up from 7.94% in the previous week. The rural joblessness rate stood at 6.75%, a sharper rise from 5.1% in the previous week.On Monday, another widely cited barometer of business expansion, the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI), dropped to 95.3 for the week ending July 25 from 96.4 in the previous week. A fall in the index represents a dip in business activity. The index was “still at levels prior to the second wave but 4.7 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels”, Nomura, an investment firm which complies the index, stated.In any jobs survey, people with jobs are categorised as employed. People without jobs but looking for work are considered unemployed. The labour force participation rate is equal to people who are employed plus those who are not. Simply put, the unemployment rate is then the number of unemployed divided by the labour force times 100.Monday’s numbers show the rural impact of the second wave, which had a “deeper and wider penetration into the hinterland”, said Gautam Shahi, an economist with the ratings firm, Crisil Ltd.Most economists agree that growth and employment will see improvements in the coming weeks, but the key variable still is vaccination. “The pace of vaccinations stagnated, with the month-to-date average in July at ~3.7mn doses/day. We currently forecast a faster pace of vaccination starting in August, but the recent pace suggests risks are skewed towards a delay,” Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura Securities, wrote in a note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unemployment-rate-rises-in-both-urban-and-rural-areas-cmie-101627296519884.html
27-07-2021||India||Mamata forms committee to probe Pegasus snooping row||West Bengal has ordered an inquiry into the Pegasus snooping row that has rocked the nation since July 18, becoming the first state to do so. “The Cabinet has approved the appointment of a commission of inquiry comprising former Supreme Court judge, justice (retd) MB Lokur and retired chief justice of Calcutta high court, justice (retd) Jyotirmay Bhattacharya in exercise of the power conferred by section 3 of the Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952 in the matter of widely reported illegal hacking, monitoring, putting under surveillance, tracking, recording etc of mobile phones of various persons in the state of West Bengal,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said while addressing media at the state secretariat before leaving for Delhi. The Pegasus row erupted last Sunday before the beginning of the current monsoon session of Parliament after an international investigative consortium reported that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were potentially targeted by Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software, Pegasus, with a forensic analysis of 10 of the targets proving they had been hacked or that there had been attempts to do so. Political strategist Prashant Kishor, widely seen as the man behind the Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) recent electoral success, and Banerjee’s nephew and TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee were named in the list of potential targets. “Over the past one week, we thought the Centre would initiate a probe, monitored by the apex court on which the citizens have faith. But when we saw that the Centre was apathetical, we decided to appoint a commission of inquiry comprising two retired judges. West Bengal is the first state to do this. This will look into how hacking was being done and who were the persons behind it,” she said. The West Bengal home department immediately issued a notification announcing the terms of reference of the commission. The panel was asked to submit its report within six months and empowered to formulate its own procedure, select venues of sittings and seek assistance from government officials and experts. “Reported interception may have landed in the hands of state and/or non-state actors, as being currently reported, which, if found to be true, can lead to a total breakdown of public order of the state and the same is a serious criminal offence,” said the notification. “The reported interception, if found to be true, shall cause a loss of public confidence on the rights guaranteed to the public under the Constitution of India,” it added.The notification said the panel will probe the people allegedly involved in the row, whether spyware was used in hte past or currently being used, if the information collected was altered, stored or used and whether anyone could carry out such interception without legal provisions. Whether the right to privacy of individuals was affected will also be a part of the inquiry. “A state government can always order an inquiry under the Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952. Such a commission is formed so that the government can inform itself with the help of the findings. However, the Centre is not bound to accept the report,” said former Supreme Court judge, justice (retd) A K Ganguly. Neither of the two judges were available for comment.“If someone is asleep, he must be awakened. This is a small step. Hopefully this would awaken others. This is has been approved in the cabinet today. We will now request the two retired judged to join and start the inquiry,” Banerjee said.A highly invasive malware, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning it into a pocket spy. Banerjee, who has for long claimed for long that her phone was being tapped, alleged last week that spyware was used to hack Kishor's mobile phone and record an entire meeting with him before the recent assembly elections. Her name, however, was not on the list of potential targets. The BJP countered Banerjee and said her move to set up a commission is nothing but a gimmick. “It appears nothing more than a political gimmick which lacks support of jurisprudence and support of the Indian legal mechanism. Since coming to power in 2011 her government has so far formed innumerable such commissions using public money. But none of the reports were published or placed in the Legislative Assembly. Earlier multiple political leaders alleged that their phones were tapped by the TMC government. Will the commission also prove all these?” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP vice president in West Bengal. In Delhi, Banerjee is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many opposition leaders. “I am going to Delhi for two to three days...I had sought an appointment with the Prime Minister, and he has given me time. I will also try to meet the President. This apart, several political leaders have requested that they want to meet me,” Banerjee said last week while announcing her trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-west-bengal-becomes-first-state-to-order-probe-101627295738007.html
27-07-2021||India||ED officer, Kejriwal’s aide among potential targets of hacking||Phone numbers belonging to former director-general of Border Security Force (BSF) K K Sharma, senior Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer Rajeshwar Singh and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s former aide V K Jain, among others, were potentially targeted for surveillance through Israeli firm NSO’s Pegasus spyware, a report said on Monday.According to The Wire, phone numbers used by a junior official in the Prime Minister’s Office, a retired officer of India’s external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and two army colonels also figure in the database of 50,000 numbers possibility selected for surveillance by agencies that were also clients of the NSO Group.The database was first obtained by France-based nonprofit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with a consortium of 17 media organisations in 10 countries including The Wire. The presence of a number on this list does not imply the individual’s phone was hacked - just that it was of interest.The Wire, which is part of the consortium of media organisations, said K K Sharma’s number was placed on the list of probable targets for surveillance in 2018, barely a month after the 1982 batch IPS officer attended a conference by an affiliate of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) in Kolkata in February.Sharma, who retired in September, was appointed by the Election Commission as a special observer for the Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and Jharkhand the following year but was quickly dropped after the Trinamool Congress cited his participation in the RSS event. Sharma didn’t respond to calls and texts to seek his response.The numbers of ED’s controversial joint director Rajeshwar Singh, currently posted in Lucknow, and his family members, were also selected for the possible surveillance between 2017 and 2019, The Wire reported.Singh, who has investigated some high-profile cases including the 2G spectrum allocation scam and the Aircel-Maxis case against former finance minister P Chidambaram, was in the news in 2018 when the Centre removed then Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director Alok Kumar Verma and then special director Rakesh Asthana from the agency following their public spat. There have been reports that Rajeshwar Singh played a key role in the Verma-Asthana face-off. When contacted by HT, Rajeshwar Singh refused to comment.The Wire report said Arvind Kejriwal’s ex-advisor V K Jain’s name was added to the list in 2018 after he was questioned by the Delhi Police in connection with the alleged assault on the then Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash in February 2018. Jain resigned as Kejriwal’s advisor within a month, citing personal reasons. The police recorded his statement in this case but declined to share it with Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia. On July 1 this year, the Supreme Court rejected a request by the police to let it withhold Jain’s 2018 statement.Jain could not be contacted for his comments.The number of a former colonel Mukul Dev, who has been at loggerheads with the Centre on multiple issues including scrapping free rations for officers deployed in peace areas, degradation of armed forces and NFU (non-functional financial upgradation), was also placed as a possible target in 2019, The Wire added.Dev told HT: “I have been victimized by this government in every possible manner for fighting for the welfare of the armed forces. This is the state of present government. I knew back in 2018 that I am under surveillance when I filed a complaint with Punjab Police following a direct threat to me”.Another colonel-ranked officer, Amit Kumar, who filed a petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of 356 Army personnel against what they apprehended was an impending dilution of the Armed Forces (Special Forces) Act (AFSPA), was also placed on the list. The Wire report further said that BSF Commandant Jagdish Mathani, a retired RAW officer Jitendra Kumar Ojha, a senior official at Niti Aayog and a junior official at PMO were also on the snoop list.Mathani refused to comment while Amit Kumar and Ojha could not be contacted for their comments.The government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the spyware. NSO Group has on multiple occasions said that it offers services only to vetted government clients. The company has disputed the leaked list of numbers as those targeted by its clients.In all, The Wire has revealed the names of 142 people who were targets or potential targets for surveillance by clients of the NSO Group. Apart from at least 40 journalists, former Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi, two of his aides, political strategist Prashant Kishor, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and Union minister Prahlad Patel were also allegedly targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-officer-2-colonels-former-bsf-chief-kejriwal-s-aide-also-on-pegasus-list-101627289438117.html
27-07-2021||Today's||China is focusing on 'discourse power'. Shore up defences||In China’s strategic lexicon, might is right but might is essential to earn the “right to speak”. President Xi Jinping’s messaging both to Chinese citizens and the world, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) celebrated its march to the next century, seemed to stress on this theme repeatedly. Aside from the obvious deification of the Xi era and CCP, if one breaks down the centenary’s themes to, say, bumper stickers, the following would sum it up — we have arrived; we will not be bullied; the party is always right/the party is forever.In Chinese frameworks, a country’s huayuquan or right to speak or the power/authority to speak is essentially a form of power equivalent to military and economic power, “with discourse as its carrier”. Yet, for all of China’s gains in hard power and material strength, it has always felt lacking in “discourse power” relative to the West.So, China has invested heavily in telling “an overwhelmingly positive” story of its history. Purged of failures, this history credits the party for China’s strides and leading the Chinese people “from one victory to another on an unstoppable march towards national rejuvenation”. This narrative is essential to maintaining the infallibility of the party-State and is seen as central to its domestic legitimacy.But Xi has also wanted China’s discourse power to resonate externally — China’s story, on China’s terms, and Chinese ideas setting the global agenda. From the 19th party congress in 2017 onwards, Xi has consistently demanded that Chinese discourse power underwrite the promotion of the “China model”, and project its ability to “influence global values, governance, and even day-to-day discussions on the world stage”.Also Read | ‘Stop demonising us,’ China plays victim as US calls out Chinese aggressionWithin China’s borders, discourse power is a potent tool of the State, but when expanded to the international system, there are serious long-term repercussions. The emphasis here is not on dialogue, but on the “contestation of ideas” which have underwritten widely accepted universal values and norms, institutions and governance models. There is no space for reform or consensus in this narrative. It is about proving that all prior methods for solving the world’s problems have failed while China offers one with better solutions which it has applied successfully domestically.China’s discourse power represents the party-State as the righteous leader in the international space. Concepts such as a “community of shared future”, Made in China 2025’s goal of dominating global science and tech, and the creation of international financial institutions aim to project the ability to deliver an alternative solution to global needs. With a military budget of $209 billion, and massive investments in the grand Belt and Road Initiative as well the Health Silk Route, China’s national rejuvenation is showcased as adding value to global governance.However, beyond persuasion, Chinese discourse power is all about the power to prevail across the diplomatic, economic, military, cyber and technological domains. It has manifested itself in the People’s Liberation Army tactics of information warfare across the spectrum, including on the China-United States (US) split, Taiwan, aggression in the South China Sea, technology wars and deflection on the Covid-19 crisis.For India, this has been especially visible vis-a-vis the contentious border dispute. New Delhi has understood that China will leave no stone unturned to show that it was on the right side of history, given the emphasis the CCP’s centenary celebrations have placed on “correct” versions of its deemed successes.Yet, looking at China’s efforts from a narrow propaganda lens would be a folly — for the stakes for India are much higher, more nuanced and across multiple domains.Also Read | The vaccination drive is entering a challenging phase. Change strategiesFirst, India is an open society where Chinese officials have always had the opportunity to push their narrative in a vibrant and noisy media environment. Often, there is no reciprocity given the absence of a level-playing field on the Chinese side as they wield an iron fist with their State-controlled information flow. This awareness is yet to be internalised in India and requires constant calling out.Two, unlike earlier perceptions that India does not occupy mindspace in China, Galwan proved Beijing’s India policy is not monolithic. Scholarship has highlighted a trend of growing antagonism and a pessimistic outlook regarding the future of India-China relations. An enduring portrayal of “an obstructionist India”, an inevitable rivalry, “successor of a colonial order”, “hegemon with a Monroeist doctrine towards South Asia” and “peddling the US-Indo Pacific Strategy” have taken root and are important markers of China’s framing.Three, when China speaks of dominating the information domain, it also means supremacy over the electronic and cyber domain. Reports of repeated cyber attacks on India’s critical infrastructure, including in the banking, defence and the financial sector, and the high-profile alleged targeting of the Maharashtra electricity grid during the ongoing boundary crisis are not coincidences.Four, despite India maintaining that it can no longer delink peace and tranquillity on the border from other aspects of the relationship, China’s insistence of compartmentalising the relationship while keeping multiple fronts on the Line of Actual Control alive exemplifies coercive tactics. China’s psy-ops over “Arunachal Pradesh’s slow pace of development” in comparison to the development of model villages and the first electric train close to the border on its side, and publicising the decision to build a controversial multi-billion dollar hydropower dam on the Brahmaputra river in Tibet, are all par for the course.Finally for India, while managing the China relationship will be guided by its policy of building its internal capacity, diversifying and leveraging external partnerships and keeping channels of dialogue open, the CCP’s show of strength is also a reminder to heed to advice of practitioners and invest in capabilities to understand China better. From language training to understanding what the CCP’s ‘weapon of influence’ United Front Work Department (UFWD), can do to affect Indian interests, we need to dig deep.China’s discourse politics will target multiple fault lines in India. To prevail, New Delhi must create awareness and shore up its defences to push back against the renewed Chinese ambition to dominate mind games and project its power.Shruti Pandalai is a Fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and AnalysesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/china-is-focusing-on-discourse-power-shore-up-defences-101627379709307.html
27-07-2021||Today's||Liberal democracies must stand up||As revelations from Project Pegasus continue to make global headlines, one is reminded of a term the former and late United States (US) secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld used in 2002 — “unknown unknowns”.We don’t know what we don’t know about the extent of the surveillance undertaken using the Pegasus spyware and the damage it has done to the lives and dignity of its unsuspecting targets. But there is enough now in the public domain for everyone concerned about civil liberties globally to abandon hand-wringing and attempt a meaningful pushback.It is easy to be lost in the specifics of the regimes that are suspected to have used Pegasus against targets that were or are, evidently, neither “major criminals” nor “terrorists” — two categories of actors that the developer of Pegasus, NSO Group, claims it is meant for. Regardless of whether a regime was democratic or authoritarian, the fact is that the gratuitous use of Pegasus has fatally harmed civil liberties and deepened the hold of authoritarianism.An assault on civil liberties anywhere erodes the freedoms enjoyed by people everywhere. For this reason, anyone concerned about their basic freedoms has a stake in the issue. However, leadership on this issue will have to be provided by liberal democratic forces. Governments, world leaders, political parties, organisations and citizens committed to 21st century ideas of human freedom need to step up.Also Read | Journalists N Ram, Sashi Kumar move SC seeking inquiry into Pegasus useWhat can be done?Start by building a norm. Prioritise a frank and decisive conversation around the impact of technologies such as Pegasus on human freedoms. A start can be made on ground zero. There is a case for ascertaining the accountability of the NSO Group. On June 30, it released its first-ever Transparency and Responsibility Report in which it showcases its commitment to human rights and privacy as it sells what is reportedly the most invasive spyware currently on the surveillance market.The report is candid in many respects, but also interesting. For instance, it says that the company rejected over $300 million in sales opportunities after vetting its potential customers — “states and state agencies” — on human rights and has decided to not do business with over 55 countries for reasons such as “human rights, corruption, and regulatory restrictions”. That the list of over 55 countries, presumably, excludes at least some of the 10 featured in the revelations invites attention.Israel is the second and equally important actor on ground zero. The report claims that an agency of Israel’s ministry of defence “strictly restricts the licensing of Pegasus”, independently analysing potential buyers from a “human rights perspective”. On witness here is a complicated terrain; a sovereign State has used its privilege as an international actor to regulate the business of a niche private product meant exclusively for use by other sovereign States but with a high risk of abuse that could mar inter-State relations, harm civil liberties and encourage authoritarianism.As a responsible member of the international community, Israel will be expected to explain the alleged lapses, and not merely to France. And as a beacon of democracy and human rights in West Asia, it must feel obligated to revisit the arrangement between its sovereign authority and Pegasus.The problematic nature of the NSO Group-Pegasus-Israel linkage should be seen as an illustration of the global challenge that liberal democratic forces need to confront — the need to draw a line on unaccountable surveillance technologies that have unprecedented invasive power.The most insidious aspects of Pegasus appear to be its “zero-click” attacks and the near-absolute efficiency with which it compromises the targeted device, exposing unsuspecting citizens to vulnerabilities. Pegasus should mark the tipping point in the global debate that started after the 9/11 terror attacks on the extent to which the civil liberties of citizens can be sacrificed in the name of national security. Two decades ago, the defining challenge before the progressive world was terrorism. Terrorism remains a potent threat, but it has been overshadowed by different forms of authoritarianism. To meet this challenge, liberal democratic forces need to reclaim the ground that they have conceded.In the near term, they must push for a norm against surveillance technologies — which effectively are weapons — that cause unjustifiable and irreversible harm to human beings. There is precedent for this in the realm of chemical, biological, and even nuclear weapons. But this norm-setting agenda must be backed by a political reorientation. Liberal democratic governments need to abandon their diffidence in dealings with authoritarian forces and assert that constitutional governments that guarantee and verifiably ensure human freedoms are valuable, desirable and preferable.Over the past decade, as they have confronted authoritarian major powers such as China and Russia, liberal democracies have accommodated authoritarian centralisers of various hues across Europe, West Asia and South Asia. They have praised the democracy of their strategic partners, but hesitated to draw attention to eroding civil liberties within partner democracies. They have, thus, played their part in creating a worldwide culture of impunity in which authoritarian aids such as Pegasus are enabled and deployed.The revelations present an opportunity to liberal governments to push back against authoritarianism, firstly of friends and partners, and draw a line on unaccountable surveillance. They mustn’t squander it.Atul Mishra teaches international relations at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR.

27-07-2021||Today's||The vaccination drive is entering a challenging phase. Change strategies||Despite improvements in daily vaccination numbers and the promise of increased supply, challenges persist in India’s vaccination drive. First, there is a sharp rural-urban disparity (which, to be sure, is narrowing) in per capita vaccination numbers, and second, there are intermittent “dry” days in some parts of the country when lack of supplies brings the vaccination process to a halt.But India may be headed for a more serious problem. Vaccination is indeed a function of vaccine supplies. However, there is no reason to assume that the relationship is linear. With time, despite the increase in supplies, the relative returns in the form of increasing vaccination numbers may diminish. This is due to the interplay of multiple factors. In mass public health campaigns, initial returns are often high on account of governments reaching the easily accessible sections quickly, and rapid coverage of the affluent and the non-hesitant population. The rate of gains diminishes as the challenge of reaching the inaccessible and hesitant sections increasingly looms large. For India, this is particularly crucial to avoid this since such a decrease could be coterminus with the emergence of newer variants and fresh waves of Covid-19.Also Read | Science and technology is central to strong and lasting Indo-US tiesIn such circumstances, incentives to promote vaccination (in addition to free or subsidised vaccines) could become crucial to speed up the vaccination drive.In 1971, Julian Tudor Hart wrote in The Lancet about the “Inverse Care Law”, which describes an inverse relationship between the need for health care and its actual availability. In other words, those who most need medical care are least likely to receive it. Conversely, those with least need of health care tend to use health services more (and more effectively).A similar analogy can be drawn to the Covid-19 vaccination. It is well-known that the private market allocates vaccines inequitably, with the rich getting vaccines more easily than the poor. However, the private market also inequitably allocates incentives for vaccination. This is visible today: Gyms, pizza outlets, and big corporate employers are increasingly offering incentives to get vaccinated. Such incentives are relevant only for a class that perhaps doesn’t even require such incentives. The vast rural and poor sections, if anything, receive subtle disincentives to get vaccinated and cliched health education messages aimed at reducing vaccine hesitancy.The immediate implication of this is the need to reduce the private sector’s share in total manufactured vaccines that stands at 25%. This will only become more important with time since private vaccination will only grow inaccessible and irrelevant as the size of the well-off beneficiaries shrinks relative to that of the poor, hesitant, and hard-to-reach beneficiaries.However, there is no reason to believe that all will be well with public sector vaccination either. The Inverse Care Law applies, albeit weakly, to the public sector as well. Government services by default also reach easily accessible and affluent areas first, and subsequent accretions often follow the same pattern.Also Read | Why the monsoon session mattersFurther, governments are swift in rolling out negative incentives (such as penalties for non-vaccination) rather than positive incentives (such as rewards for getting vaccinated), since the former are more feasible administratively and economically. Such negative incentives, unless designed carefully, can adversely affect the acceptance of vaccines by communities.Nonetheless, they are destined to remain important tools in the arsenal owing to their relative simplicity. Many countries in Europe have implemented such negative incentives in the form of restricted entry to public places such as restaurants, bars and movie halls.Additionally, throwing in some positive incentives for vaccination would be necessary to ensure a judicious mix. If we can conceive a spate of incentives to control the population, why can’t we do the same towards controlling an urgent threat like Covid-19? It will be imperative to remember, however, that even government incentives will be far easier to extend to the easily accessible and well-off sections than the poor and marginalised, and careful planning must ensure that the latter are not left out.The fight against Covid-19 is a long-drawn-out battle, and so is the endeavour to vaccinate a huge population. The closer we draw to the finishing line, the more challenging it will become. Tackling this will entail ingenuity and responsiveness on the part of policymakers.Soham D Bhaduri is a physician, health policy expert, and chief editor, The Indian PractitionerThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-vaccination-drive-is-entering-a-challenging-phase-change-strategies-101627378629317.html
27-07-2021||Editorials||Assam-Mizoram: A constitutional breakdown||On Monday, Assam and Mizoram clashed over a disputed boundary. Five policemen and one civilian (all from Assam) were killed and nearly 50 others were injured. The bloodiest-ever incident between the two states was the culmination of the discontent that had been simmering since October 2020 over incidents of violence and Assam’s residents blocking NH-306, the lifeline to Mizoram, for 12 days. While Assam claims Mizoram has encroached on its boundary, Mizoram maintains the area belongs to the state.Also Read | The lockdown and its economic costsMizoram has accused Assam police personnel of entering its territory, indulging in violence, and claimed that it only retaliated after tear gas canisters and grenades were hurled by Assam’s security forces. Assam has blamed Mizoram of breaching existing agreements and status quo on the border, and accused the Mizoram police of firing on its security forces and civilians using light machine guns. A violent clash of this nature between two Indian states represents a constitutional breakdown. And the fact that the clash played out on Twitter, with chief ministers (CMs) of both states sparring and urging home minister Amit Shah to intervene, represents a political and institutional failure. Incidentally, Mr Shah had met the CMs of all Northeastern states over the weekend in Shillong where long pending inter-state border disputes were discussed.Mizoram’s border dispute with Assam goes back to 1972 when the former was first carved out as a Union Territory (it became a state in 1987). Assam also has border disputes with Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. With states in the region either ruled by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments or, as in the case of Mizoram, by constituents of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led political platform of anti-Congress parties, there were expectations that border issues would get resolved. Instead, the situation appears to have become worse. Monday must serve as a wake-up call for the Centre as well as states in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/assammizoram-a-constitutional-breakdown-101627389970643.html
27-07-2021||Editorials||The lockdown and its economic costs||The Indian economy experienced an unprecedented contraction of 24.4% in the quarter ending June 2020 due to the 68-day-long lockdown which was imposed on March 24 to curb the spread of the pandemic. That employment suffered during this period is a given. The urban unemployment rate increased from 8.9% in April-June 2019 to 20.9% in the same period in 2020, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for the April-June 2020 period released in March 2021. But since the quarterly PLFS numbers do not include rural areas, they did not reveal the entire employment story. The annual PLFS report for July 2019-June 2020, released last week, gives a better idea of the lockdown’s impact on employment, and corroborates anecdotal accounts of reverse migration to rural areas in distress. Urban jobs fell by 11.05 million between April-June 2019 and April-June 2020, while rural jobs increased by 14.67 million in the same period. The share of employment in agriculture increased in 2019-20. This is unprecedented. Real wages fell for most workers, the highest for the self-employed category during April-June 2020 period. Average number of hours worked fell across categories.Also Read | The vaccination drive is entering a challenging phase. Change strategiesIn short, the labour market faced a multi-pronged squeeze. It is easy to miss these nuances if one looks at the headline employment numbers for 2019-20. They show an improvement in labour force participation rate and a decline in unemployment rate, creating a misleading picture of labour markets. The latest PLFS findings have brought to fore the fact that vulnerabilities in Indian labour markets might not reflect themselves in the most commonly tracked statistic – the unemployment rate. In a country which has very little in terms of social security, staying unemployed is not an option. The pandemic pushed people from the more productive urban economy to the less productive rural sector. This is also reflected in the per worker output in agriculture in real terms which went down from ₹1.18 lakh in 2018-19 to ₹1.02 lakh in 2019-20 (July-June period). A rise in demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme also tells the same story.PLFS numbers after the April-June 2020 period are not available. Even quarterly reports will not have information on rural labour markets. But PLFS numbers suggest what to expect. Restoring growth is not going to be enough to revive India’s economic fortunes. The pandemic’s distributive consequences are equally adverse. That the government has not offered much in terms of direct fiscal support and its tax burden has become more regressive will only worsen the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-lockdown-and-its-economic-costs-101627389310448.html
