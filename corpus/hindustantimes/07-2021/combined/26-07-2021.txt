The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to name his successor. The fact that there is no obvious front-runner despite Yediyurappa’s resignation being in the works for months underscores his importance in Karnataka’s political landscape. There are two key challenges facing the BJP at the moment. One, making sure that Yediyurappa does not rebel against it , like he did in 2012, and two, maintaining the party’s support base in the Lingayat community, of which the outgoing CM is the tallest leader. Here are three charts which explain this.Also Read | Not going anywhere, will work for Karnataka: BS Yediyurappa on next stintLingayats voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in 2019 The BJP achieved its best ever performance in Karnataka in the 2019 elections winning 25 out of the 28 Lok Sabha seats. While the party had high levels of support across Hindus, it was an overwhelming 87% among Lingayats, who account for almost 16%-17% of the state’s population. The Congress-JD (S) government fell immediately after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and Yediyurappa, a Lingayat, was made the chief minister.Lingayats have been the core support-base of the BJP in Karnataka, but they are also loyal to Yediyurappa.Karnataka is the first and only southern state so far where the BJP has been able to capture power on its own. The BJP’s success story in the state is tied with Yediyurappa who has mobilised the Lingayats for the party. In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP party realised the hard way that it cannot take Lingayat support for granted if Yediyurappa is not on board. Yediyurappa parted ways with the BJP and formed the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) after he was made to resign as the chief minister in 2011. The KJP did massive damage to the BJP in the 2013 assembly elections in which its performance was the worst since the 1994 state polls.A comparison of community-wise vote shares from the 2008 and 2013 CSDS-Lokniti surveys shows that the Lingayats deserted the BJP in a big way in the 2013 elections. The Lingayat support returned in the 2014 elections (it was 63% according to CSDS-Lokniti), by which time Yediyurappa had been brought back into the BJP fold.BJP’s social engineering problem in Karnataka Caste politics has always been important in Karnataka. In its heydays, the Congress, under the leadership of Devraj Urs perfected what it called the AHINDA coalition which included minorities, backward classes and dalits. The Congress fell between two stools in the 2018 elections, while trying to play the AHINDA card on the one hand and wooing Lingayats with a separate religious status on the other. While it did gain some ground among the Lingayats, it lost the support of other sections. The BJP, which is enjoying the peak of its political popularity in Karnataka if the 2019 results are any indication, will face a similar problem. It cannot alienate the Lingayats who are its most loyal supporters but must also be seen as offering a bigger share of power to other Hindus. Whether or not Yediyurappa’s successor is a Lingayat is the BJP’s first challenge on this front. We will know soon enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-b-s-yediyurappa-matters-for-the-bjp-in-karnataka-101627293517669.html
26-07-2021||News||HT Explains: What we know about the evidence underpinning the Pegasus Project||Beginning July 18, a consortium of 17 news organisations reported on a mass mobile device surveillance operation by, possibly, multiple state actors. The expose involves a scale that is unprecedented, and involves targets not just typical sought by countries with slack democratic values – for instance journalists and human rights defenders – but also those more likely shielded from usual surveillance targeting — heads of state, judges and industrialists.At the heart of the disclosures is what the consortium says is a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The data was first obtained by a French nonprofit called Forbidden Stories, which collaborated with the consortium that includes Washington Post, The Guardian and India’s The Wire.The reports have described the list as being of numbers “selected for targeting” by clients of Israel-based NSO Group, which makes the infamous Pegasus – a mobile device surveillanceware that could intercept communications, retrieve photos and videos, log all key strokes and turn the device’s camera and microphone on.You can read more about the Pegasus Project by the consortium here and what the NSO Group as well as nation-states suspected of these spying campaigns have said here.The consortium of journalists and Forbidden Stories have not shared more details of the nature of the list, its origin and how exactly it ties in with the deployment of NSO Group’s Pegasus, but statements from both sides and past discoveries about NSO Group and its associations provide some clues.Also Read | Project Pegasus: India is at the crossroadsTo be sure, these constitute clues in the public domain at present, and the nature of the evidence could change when the journalists disclose their source.What is the list?One of the Washington Post reports described it as: “...list of more than 50,000 numbers that are concentrated in countries known to engage in surveillance of their citizens and also known to have been clients of the Israeli firm, NSO Group... The list does not identify who put the numbers on it, or why, and it is unknown how many of the phones were targeted or surveilled.”Where they found evidence of a Pegasus was by testing the devices of some of the listed numbers: “But forensic analysis of the 37 smartphones shows that many display a tight correlation between time stamps associated with a number on the list and the initiation of surveillance, in some cases as brief as a few seconds”.But over time, more clues have emerged for what this list could possibly be. One of these is that it could be data off queries to a mobile network routing database, known as the Home Location Register (HLR). Originally, it came from an NSO Group statement, which said: “NSO Group has good reason to believe that claims that you have been provided with, are based on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers’ targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products.”What is an HLR lookup? An HLR lookup is when mobile network operator sends another mobile network operator requests to check if a particular mobile number is registered – that is switched on and active on the network.This information previously included data such as the location of the tower it is active on, the network on which the user is actually a subscriber and their home location before some safeguards were brought in. But, according to telephone networking information company xConnect, HLR Lookup “still supports basic number validation and low volume message routing applications”. Essentially, an HLR lookup can, at least, determine if a phone is switched on.Why is it relevant?For one, this may be a precursor to a hack by those operating Pegasus. Forbidden Stories cites a source with direct knowledge of NSO’s systems saying: “...an HLR lookup is a key step of determining certain characteristics of a phone, such as whether it is turned on or in a country that allows Pegasus targeting.”The second reason has to do with a company called Circles and, once again, clues from a recent interview by NSO Group’s CEO and co-founder Shalev Hulio. Here, some things are noteworthy:NSO was approached with a list of numbers from a data broker a month ago. “He (the broker) said that there is a list circulating in the market and that whoever holds it is saying that the NSO servers in Cyprus were hacked and that there is a list of targets there and that we should be careful. We looked into it. We don’t have servers in Cyprus and don’t have these types of lists.”This is where Circles may fit into the story. Citizen Labs, a University of Toronto-based cyber research group, published a report in December, 2020 that determined Circles was “a surveillance firm that reportedly exploits weaknesses in the global mobile phone system to snoop on calls, texts, and the location of phones around the globe”, and that “Circles is affiliated with NSO Group”.Hulio’s responses in the interview suggest he maintains that NSO has no servers in Cyprus. The interview does not touch upon Circles. But a report from Vice from 2020 seem to confirm the presence of Circles offices in Cyprus and that NSO shut it down that year.What does all this mean?NSO’s suspicion that the data is of HLR lookup data, its CEO’s mentioning of a data broker with a list numbers purportedly hacked out of Cyprus, and the known presence of an NSO Group associate Circles – which has also been implicated in providing surveillanceware – potentially offer the closest known trail of clues. It is a possibility that these numbers may have been part of a log of HLR lookups, which could in itself have been a precursor to an infection with Pegasus – or it alone may have constituted a less sophisticated breach.But it is still important to note that these are circumstantial indications. Unless further evidence is disclosed, it is not possible to conclusively link all of the 50,000 numbers – except for those forensically confirmed to have been infected with Pegasus – to the NSO group’s malware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/ht-explains-what-we-know-about-the-evidence-underpinning-the-pegasus-project-101627285357607.html

Justice IP Mukherjee, who is a member of the five-judge bench headed by Justice Bindal, held a meeting with members of the bar association on Monday and discussed the issue. “We are not disclosing the outcome of today’s meeting. We will take it up at a meeting of the lawyers on Tuesday evening,” an office-bearer of the bar association said on condition of anonymity.The sequence of events unfolded on July 19. Justice Bhattacharyya, who had reacted sharply on July 16 when technical glitches disrupted the virtual hearing of the civil case, passed a strongly-worded order when he found that the case was transferred to the division bench of Justice Tandon. In his 10-page order, Justice Bhattacharyya criticised the court administration as well as the acting chief justice on whose orders the case was reassigned. “Although it has been clarified that the Chief Justice (including Acting Chief Justice) is the Master of the Roster and “more equal among equals” (not by Orwell but our own Supreme Court), the excess equality pertains only to the administrative side of this court and cannot override the appellate side rules, framed and modified by the full court comprised of all Judges of this Hon‟ble Court. There is doubt as to whether the Chief Justice/Acting Chief Justice, in her/his administrative capacity as the Master of the Roster, can override a judicial order passed by a Bench having determination fixed by the Chief Justice/Acting Chief Justice herself/himself and the file of the matter be assigned to some other court overnight,” justice Bhattacharyya wrote in his order on July 19. “’Do not wash your dirty linen in public’ is a nice defence for the beneficiaries of an oppressive/corrupt system, but is the anathema of transparency, which is in-built in the concept of the judiciary being the last bastion of democracy,” said the order. The incident triggered strong reactions. On July 22, some members of the bar association convened a meeting and wrote a four-page letter to Justice Bindal. “We are extremely shocked that the moment Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya questioned as to why measures are not taken to improve the quality of virtual hearing, the same matter was suddenly assigned to a division bench. It is extremely apparent that the sudden assignment to a division bench was made only for the reason that Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya questioned the administrative side of the high court for not doing their required job…” wrote the lawyers. “We are not questioning that fact that you in the capacity of an acting chief justice can definitely assign a matter… However, the question here is the time and matter coupled with to whom i.e. which bench,” the letter said. HT has seen a copy of the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/impasse-at-calcutta-high-court-as-some-lawyers-want-to-skip-hearings-by-acting-chief-justice-101627323581036.html

The facility was first started with oxygen beds towards April-end when cases of Covid-19 shot up, creating a crisis for the healthcare infrastructure. With the addition of ventilators, now the facility will also treat severe Covid cases. The equipment for the facility has been arranged by the Delhi government, whereas the manpower is supplied by Ujala Cygnus Group. “With very few cases of coronavirus disease, we are running only 50 beds at the moment. There are no patients in the facility; we discharged the last patient only a few days ago,” said Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, adding that the facility will keep opening up 50 beds for every 0.5% increase in the city’s positivity rate. “We will hire staff for a short time or divert them from across our hospital chain to open beds as the positivity rate goes up. The Centre had set a threshold of 5% but as we saw how the cases shot up last time, we will start increasing capacity early on this time,” said Dr Bajaj. Increasing the number of beds according to rise in positivity is part of the government’s graded action plan for hospitals. “In the second wave, we had seen the peak and we ran out of beds, oxygen and ICU facilities. So, for the upcoming third wave, we have to make sure that we don’t commit the same errors,” said Dr Bajaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-300-ventilators-at-burari-covid-facility-as-govt-preps-for-next-wave-101627322681741.html

The police operation lasted for nearly 15 minutes, said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.“The arrested cattle lifters were involved in stealing more than 1,000 cattle, mostly buffaloes, from Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan in the last four to five years, and selling them to unauthorised butchers in Uttar Pradesh. The five men had come to Goyala Dairy area near Dwarka in a pick-up van to steal cattle when our team members chased and caught them following an encounter. They also tried to snatch the service weapons of our policemen,” said DCP Meena. The suspects were not carrying cattle at the time of encounter with the police. The arrested men were identified by their first names Ajaj, Irshad, Ismail, Sajat and Nabiya, all residents of Meerut. A total of 11 cases were solved with their arrest, the police claimed.DCP Meena said that the district’s special staff team was tasked with identifying and arrest cattle lifters following a incident in Chhawla, in which the suspects stole four buffaloes after tying their caretaker with a rope on January 12 this year. During the probe, it was learnt that there several similar incidents. The team started collecting information about the cattle lifters and learnt about a Meerut-based gang.On July 26, the team received information that five cattle lifters from Meerut, carrying illegal weapons, were coming towards Goyala Dairy in a pick-up van. The team laid a trap near Samta Enclave and barricaded the road. Around 4.30 am, the team spotted the van and signalled its driver to stop. However, the truck hit the iron barricades and sped away“Our team members chased the van, while others tried to block it with their vehicles. The suspects started pelting stones at the police team.

The DCW said that it was in the process of identifying more widows.In a letter addressed to Madhu K Garg, secretary, Department of WCD and Social Welfare, DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said of the 791 identified women, 774 (97.85%) have children, out of which 384 have one or two children and nearly 360 have 3-5 children. Thirty widows have more than five children, the DWC stated in its letter.The survey showed that 734 women fall in the age group of 18-60 years and the rest are senior citizens. As many as 721 women are homemakers while the rest are employed as domestic workers, labourers, small business owners, and private and government employees, the survey found. According to the findings, 28.57% widows have no income source and are dependent on their husbands financially while 60.93% of women’s family income at present is ₹15,000 or less every month. “The past few months have been very difficult for humanity, especially India which was ravaged by the third wave of the Covid pandemic. The entire country came in the grip of the disease and several thousands died. In Delhi too, hundreds of women were widowed, and several children became orphans,” said the letter, adding that the DCW had carried out a survey through its mahila panchayat program.Maliwal asked the department to ensure that the women -- 597 widows had not been vaccinated against Covid-19 till the survey was carried out.-- are inoculated on priority and also requested the Women and Child Development Department to ensure that schemes such as Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojana, a social security scheme for families affected by the pandemic, reaches the affected women. “Our mahila panchayat teams have traversed every nook and corner of Delhi to identify 791 women who became widows during the Covid pandemic. We have done a social survey of all these women. Most of the women do not have a source of income, or are extremely poor. A detailed report has been submitted to the government,” Maliwal tweeted on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/791-women-widowed-by-covid-dcw-seeks-rehabilitation-for-them-101627322560545.html

The Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board disbursed the aid, to help workers during the lockdowns in the city, to 216,602 people during a drive in April, and 47,996 others between May 28 and July 18, said state government officials.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s labour minister said, “When the first lockdown was imposed because of the pandemic [in end-March] last year, the Delhi government was one of the first state governments to grant relief disbursement to all 39,600 workers who were registered with the construction board in March 2020.”“After taking charge of the labour department in November last year, inspections and mass registration drives were conducted at all the labour offices. Based on these inspections and registration drives, we have carried out a series of reforms in the labour department. As a result of this, within eight months, the number of construction workers registered with the construction board has increased to three lakhs [300,000],” Sisodia said.

Land has been identified for both the projects,” said RP Singh, secretary, ADA.In the last two years, the demand for houses has gone up considerably in Ayodhya, especially after the November 9, 2019 verdict of the Supreme Court in favour of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.These two colonies will also have commercial complexes. According to ADA officials, the front portion of these colonies will have the commercial complexes while the residential complex will be at the back. Both the colonies will be a few metres from the ring road, ADA officials said, adding that in future also housing projects will come up near the ring road due to the availability of space.Lucknow projectsFor the likely Lucknow townships, three promoters have applied for licence with the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA). According to LDA officials, these townships will be of 28 acres, 112 acres and 210 acres respectively. At the LDA’s board meeting in June this year, it was decided to invite proposals from private developers for integrated township on more than 25 acres. After this proposal, three private developers applied for the licence. Clearance for these three townships may take some time as new LDA vice-chairman Akshay Tripathi will take a final decision only after going through all the details of these projects, according to those familiar with the matter.

The objective was supposed to be achieved in five years by 2025.The state government had issued a notice, calling for bids for the appointment of a consultant on June 19, 2020. It revised the RFP (request for proposal) with October 9, 2020 set as the last date for the submission of the bids. It opened the financial bids on November 27, 2020 and zeroed in on the selection of a consultant but cancelled the bids on March 22, 2021, saying, “Fresh tender notice in this regard is likely to be published soon.”While a considerable period from the given timeline (2020-25) has gone by, there are indications that the state government is exploring the option of selecting a government agency as the consultant.“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is upset over the delay. Making the state a trillion dollar economy is on top of the state government’s priority list. The government will soon appoint a consultant by way of bidding or opting for a government institution/agency,” said a senior officer on condition of anonymity.Those aware of the development said Invest India, a national investment promotion and facilitation agency, made a presentation on the issue at a high-level meeting early this month.“We are in the process of taking a decision. We will take a call on revising the timeline only after a decision on selecting the consultant is taken,” said another officer.“The Uttar Pradesh government has been talking about making UP a trillion dollar economy since 2018. But there is no clear roadmap to achieve this objective. If you look back at the performance of the state in the past three years, the rate of GSDP growth has been low and even negative in 2020-21. This does not inspire confidence that UP will achieve the target in the given timeline. Given the present size of UP’s GSDP, an annual growth rate of about 45% would be needed to achieve the target. It would be better if the state government works out a long-term perspective plan of development and the trillion dollar economy may be a mid-term target,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor at department of economics, Lucknow University.The state government began working on the idea after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the issue at the Uttar Pradesh Investors’ Summit 2018 here on February 21, 2018.Modi referred to his association with the investors’ summit as chief minister of Gujarat and later with the UP Investors Summit-2018 as the PM. He said Maharashtra had also set a target to become a trillion dollar economy.“Can Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh compete with each other to become the trillion dollar economy? Will Uttar Pradesh government compete with other states? The more the competition, more will be the investment. This will result in the creation of more jobs and strengthen the concept of cooperative federalism,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/trilliondollar-economy-goal-13-months-on-uttar-pradesh-still-weighing-its-options-101627322440496.html

26-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Apparel industry pins hopes on international fair||Noida The apparel industry in Gautam Budh Nagar, still recovering from the losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is now banking on the 66th India International Garment Fair (IIGF) that kicked off on Monday. The two-month fair is being held virtually for the second time since last year and is scheduled to go on till September 25. Earlier, the fair used to be held at the India Expo Centre and Mart in Greater Noida.The International Garment Fair Association (IGFA) organises two events every year in the month of January and July in India. The event is aimed at helping exporters from India to showcase their latest designs and apparel for the upcoming season to importers from all across the world.“At present, we have 1,123 registered buyers and 181 registered buying agents, while 251 exhibitors are showcasing their latest collections. However, we expect the number of buyers to increase to 2,000 in the course of next two months as our team is following up with over 14,000 buyers across the globe,” said Lalit Thukral, , vice-chairman of the IGFA.According to Thukral, the association was looking forward to holding a physical fair this year before the second Covid wave hit the country.The apparel and fashion accessories fair is being held in India since 1988.Daljeet Singh, a buyer from London, who has been a regular at the fair for the past 20 years, said that the fair helps meet new exporters and exhibitors.“China has been holding such virtual fairs and hence new collections keep coming from that country. Now, I am happy that India has again held this event as the kind of material we need for our market can only be supplied from India,” said Singh from London, who runs Coleridge UK, an apparel firm.Uday Sehgal, an exporter from Noida Sector 59, said that many of his regular buyers stopped business due to losses incurred during the pandemic. “We are heavily dependent on the IIGF now because the pandemic hit the business badly. By showcasing our collection at the fair, we can be sure of business because the buyers are registered and genuine. We are expecting new buyers for this season at the fair,” said Sehgal.Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March last year in the country, the GB Nagar apparel industry suffered a collective loss of over ₹3,000 crore, said Thukral, who is also the president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC). However, he said that the market has recovered up to 80% of its business.“In 2020, we did suffer losses but in 2021, the business is back to 80% capacity of what it was before the pandemic. We hope that we will reach the pre-pandemic business, which is ₹10,000 crore, by end of this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-apparel-industry-pins-hopes-on-international-fair-101627322139923.html
26-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Cyber criminals held for duping e-commerce site of ₹2 crore||Noida The cyber police in Noida have nabbed two persons for allegedly duping an e-commerce site of more than ₹2 crore on the pretext of receiving defective goods, officials said on Monday. The suspects — both natives of Hisar in Haryana — were identified as Anil, 27, and Sachin, 30.According to the officials, the suspects used to purchase electronics from the e-commerce site and put in return requests after claiming that they had received defective goods. They used to make payments in both prepaid and cash on delivery. “They had joined hands with some delivery agents, who used to take pictures and show to the management that the suspects returned the defective goods, whereas the duo did not. The suspects used to sell these products as new ones in wholesale markets,” said Vinod Kumar Pandey, investigating officer, cyber police station. Police said that the suspects had registered 99 accounts on the website, with the help of fake documents, through multiple virtual numbers. “We have identified 64 bank accounts made for these e-commerce accounts. They have been freezed and ₹26 lakh has been recovered from these accounts,” said Pandey. Police have also recovered three cellphones from their possession. Officials said that the selling partners of the website had registered separate cases in Hapur, Dadri and Agra for fraud cases. “We have been investigating these cases for the past three months. After a lot of technical back tracing, the suspects were identified and nabbed from their homes. There are several others associated with the scam. We are working on identifying them. Delivery agents, who were associated with them, and the buyers of the goods in Delhi’s wholesale markets will also be apprehended soon,” Pandey added. The suspects were booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document or electronic record), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 120B (whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death) and relevant sections of the IT Act at the Sector 36 cyber police station, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Lucknow headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-cyber-criminals-held-for-duping-e-commerce-site-of-2-crore-101627322019876.html

26-07-2021||Gurugram||City forest planned on 200 acres, will be continuation of Aravallis, say officials||A 200-acre urban forest is likely to come up on Aravalli land interspersed between Sikanderpur and Chakkarpur, near the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said, after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a city-based non-governmental organisation for a period of eight years to develop the forest.Subhash Yadav, head of the urban environment division of GMDA, said, “An MoU has been signed with iamgurgaon NGO for developing the city forest. Last year, encroachments were cleared from this area and since then, it was lying vacant. It was decided to develop the forest here, as it will increase green cover in the city and also help in maintaining the landscape because of its proximity to Aravalli Biodiversity Park.” As part of the project, the NGO aims to convert the area into a ‘true forest’, on the lines of those found in northern Aravallis. Vijay Dhasmana, an eco-restoration practitioner, who helmed the development of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park and will develop this city forest too, said, “The main element is to bring back the forests of Aravalli along with its grasses, plants that are short-lived but have huge medicinal and food value and water plants. With these measures, the objective is to work on eco-restoration of the area.” The site chosen for the city forest is a watershed of a disappeared seasonal stream that flowed into the Sahibi river, a tributary of the Yamuna, where widespread mining took place in the 1990s. The area was later encroached upon by locals, with shanties and a marble market dotting the landscape, leading to further degradation of Aravalli land. Last year, around 3,500 shanties were removed from the area by the authorities. At present, the area is colonised by Prosopis juliflora (vilayati keekar), an alien and invasive plant species, experts said. Dhasmana said some of the interspersed mining pits in the area have also become seasonal and perennial water bodies. Due to this, conservation of water at this spot by holding the soil becomes important, increasing the potential of groundwater recharge to almost two million litres per hectare. This can also help in arresting urban flooding, especially in south Gurugram. Dhasmana said that this project will be different from the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, with “more wilderness area with forest pathways for people to navigate (instead of concrete paths)”. The emphasis will be on the recreation of habitats, which includes trees, shrubs, climbers, herbs, annuals and grasses, he said. “Preliminary observations show that wildlife like neelgai, jungle cats and jackals are already present in that area, but by developing it into a forest in the true sense, there could be a possibility of leopards also visiting the area,” said Dhasmana. At present, a master plan for the project is being developed by the agencies. Officials said that the city forest will have an interpretation centre, native plant nursery, public conveniences (drinking water facility and washrooms), viewing decks at picturesque locations that show the beauty of the area, canopy walk, and walkways over water bodies. A baseline survey, to understand the presence of wildlife and how to proceed with the plantation, will also be carried out within the next three months. However, a final decision is also yet to be taken on fencing, officials said. Areas close to the road will be fenced to ensure there is no further encroachment, but those in continuation with the existing Aravalli forest are likely to not have fences, so that wildlife is not disturbed, said officials. Latika Thukral, a co-founder of iamgurgaon, said, “This forest will not only increase the green cover in the city but once fully restored, will be home to a wide range of rare and important plants of the Aravali landscape. It will also be an important habitat for fauna species. After basic studies of the area, we will start plantation work this monsoon itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-forest-planned-on-200-acres-will-be-continuation-of-aravallis-say-officials-101627321660705.html

The decision was taken in the wake of several residents falling ill due to alleged water contamination at Mahagunpuram society adjacent to NH-9 in March, officials said. The UPPCB officials said that their focus will primarily be the residential projects with built-up area of 20,000 square metre or above and details of the STPs will also be sought from the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). “After the incident at Mahagunpuram, we have decided that UPPCB officials, along with officials from GDA and municipal corporation, will start inspections in order to find out if the STPs are functioning properly and there is no event which can lead to mixing of sewage pipe with water pipeline,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The UPPCB has identified about 40 such residential projects where STPs are installed. “As per the building by-laws, housing projects having area of 4,000 sqm or above are required to install an STP. As per our estimates, we have about 800 such buildings,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA. Environmentalists said that such checks should be carried out on a regular basis and not just after any incident has happened. “The departments should check on periodic basis if laid down norms are getting followed or not. There has to be monitoring devices installed at the STPs to check if they are functioning properly. If any violations are found, the erring societies should be penalised,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/uppcb-to-inspect-functioning-of-stps-in-residential-societies-101627321299789.html

This is the lowest since April when the infections climbed and at one point, the district had over 300 containment zones.A containment zone is an area within a 25-metre radius of a confirmed infection. In case there are two or more confirmed cases, the radius is increased to 50 metres. Movement of people is highly restricted in these zones.The 19 containment zones in the district include 13 high rise societies across Noida and Greater Noida.“For high-rises, the state government guidelines say that in case of one Covid-19 case, the entire floor will be contained, while the entire tower will be contained if multiple cases are detected,” said a district health department official on condition of anonymity.“The surveillance teams inform the local bodies like the residents welfare associations (RWAs) about positive cases and take their help in tracing and testing people in the community,” said Dr Jevr Ubaid, nodal officer for containment zones at district health department, GB Nagar.The guidelines allow an area to be taken off the containment zone list if no new cases are reported from there for 14 days after the last confirmed report.Despite the low case count — the district has been reporting less than 10 cases a day since June 20 — Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma said there is no let-up in testing, tracking and tracing of infected persons.“We have 800 teams surveying 6,000 homes and around 23,000 people per day. On July 23, 74 people were found to be symptomatic who were then tested for Covid-19,” said Sharma.Covid-19 symptoms include fever, dry cough and tiredness. “We are testing around 4,000 samples a day, of which around 1,500 are RT-PCR tests and around 2,500 are antigen tests. The positivity rate (number of tests returning positive) is around 0.06%.”On Monday, Gautam Budh Nagar reported three Covid-19 infections, bringing the active caseload to 36. Cumulative confirmed case count in the district was at 62,688 and the death toll at 466.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-19-containment-zones-in-gb-nagar-now-lowest-since-april-101627321119776.html
26-07-2021||Noida||Noida: District hospital begins token system to manage crowd at its vaccination booth||To reduce crowding at its Covid-19 vaccination centre, the Gautam Budh Nagar district hospital in Sector 30 introduced a coloured token system from Monday. Those who showed their confirmed slots booked through the Co-WIN portal were handed a blue coloured token at the entrance of the hospital that specified the date and time of their vaccination, said Dr Sushma Chandra, the hospital’s chief medical superintendent (CMS). “Those with these tokens will be vaccinated before the others in their allotted time slot.”The colour of these tokens will be changed every day to avoid anyone misusing it, she added.Dr Chandra said they vaccinate almost 3,000 people at the hospital every day. “Most of them come without a confirmed slot and that creates a major problem for those who had booked their slots. To avoid a chaos, we’ve decided to introduce this system,” she said. On Monday, the vaccination centre seemed relatively well managed.Subhendu Mishra from Sector 76 said this was his second attempt at getting his vaccination. “Before this, I had booked a slot for last Wednesday. But there was a heavy rush at the hospital and I returned without getting the vaccine shot. Today, I got it done within 15 minutes,” he said. Reena Dutt, a resident in Sector 61 who had received a token, said that she got her jab quickly too. “It was a good experience as the vaccination staff were administering the vaccine doses without any hurry,” she said. Hailing the new system, GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said that the system could be introduced in other hospitals also. “At present, other centres do not see much crowd due to the limited stock of vaccines. But if such a situation occurs, this system can be introduced for better crowd management,” he said. According to the Co-WIN portal, till Monday, over 1.5 million people had been administered their doses in the district, of which 1.1 million had got their first dose. On Monday, 10,137 doses were administered at 41 government and 23 private vaccination centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-district-hospital-begins-token-system-to-manage-crowd-at-its-vaccination-booth-101627321059809.html

In its plea, the police argued that the trial court's order was in "violation of the principles of natural justice."Also Read | Delhi riots case: Court slaps ₹25,000 on police for 'callous and farcical' investigation"The order was passed without giving any opportunity to the DCP to make his submissions. Also, very serious remarks were made against the investigation even prior to the commencement of the trial," the force submitted in its appeal to the high court. The petition, filed through advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, also noted that the imposition of a fine on the police was "unwarranted and uncalled for."In his order on July 13, additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav had pulled up the police over "lack of efficacy and fairness" in its investigation in the case and slapped on it a penalty of ₹25,000. The amount, the judge, had directed, was to be recovered from the station house officer (SHO) of Bhajanpura police station, and his supervising officers. The Delhi Police had challenged in the trial court a magisterial court order directing it to register an FIR on the complaint of Mohammad Nasir, who said he lost his left eye after suffering a gunshot injury during the riots which broke out in the Capital's northeast region in February last year. Arguing its case in the trial court, the agency had said that there was no need to file a separate FIR as it had already registered one earlier. It had also said that no evidence was found against the accused who allegedly shot Nasir, as they were not present in Delhi at the time of the incident. Nasir had named six people in his complaint, including former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Naresh Gaur.The trigger for the riots, which lasted for nearly a week, was stone-pelting between supporters of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and those protesting against it, in Maujpur on February 23. In the ensuing violence, 53 people lost their lives while scores were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-police-move-hc-against-trial-court-order-which-called-its-probe-callous-and-farcical-101627316998785.html
26-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand chief minister moves into ‘jinxed’ house after 6 days of ritual worship||Dehradun: Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami moved into his official residence after six days of worship rituals by eight priests on Monday, the fifth chief minister in 20 years to stay in the bungalow in the heart of state capital Dehradun that some of his predecessors considered jinxed.Trivendra Singh Rawat, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) surprise choice for the state’s top post after winning the 2017 state elections, was the last chief minister to live in the official residence. He didn’t complete his term and had to step down in March this year, nine days short of completing four years in office.Some in Uttarakhand’s political circles had linked Trivendra Singh Rawat’s exit to his 2017 decision to move into the bungalow built in a 10-acre plot of prime land by the government at a cost of ₹16 crore. Many recalled how others such as Ramesh Pokhriyal brushed aside the superstitious belief and stayed in CM House had his term cut short. They appear to ignore that others such as BC Khanduri or Trivendra’s successor Tirath Singh Rawat didn’t last long even though they didn’t live in CM House.No one really remembers when the so-called jinx that its occupants will not be able to complete their five-year term took root. But it hasn’t helped that no chief minister of Uttarakhand except for its first, Narain Dutt Tiwari, has been able to hold on to the post for the complete five-year term.When the Congress named Vijay Bahugana as chief minister in March 2012, he went ahead to move into the bungalow. He was replaced by Harish Rawat before he could complete two years.Senior Congress leader Suryakant Dhasmana said Harish Rawat didn’t live in the CM House for this reason and chose to live in Dehradun’s Bijapur area. He did manage to stay in power for three years but with two short spells of central rule.Before Pushkar Singh Dhami stepped into the house with his family, Vastu expert Santosh Khanduri said eight priests had been conducting worship rituals since July 21 “to increase the positive vibrations and lessen the impact of Vastu defects in the house”.Chief minister Dhami first offered prayers at the Shiv Temple on the premises, offered grass to the cows in the cowshed also on the premises and circumnutated around the house before stepping foot, said Santosh Khanduri who was overseeing the rituals.Prof MM Semwal, a political analyst from Garhwal university said from a scientific point of view, one shouldn’t link political developments to such superstitions. “All these major political changes in the state over the years have political reasons. One house cannot affect or bring such changes”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-chief-minister-moves-into-jinxed-house-after-6-days-of-ritual-worship-101627319200340.html

The abode of the Lord Jagannath is at the forefront. The metro cities do not have this facility either. Today, Puri has joined the world’s largest cities league, including London, New York, and Singapore,” he said, adding that all families in Puri will receive tap water fit for drinking from today.“Under Drink From Tap-Sujal Mission, people of Puri will be able to fetch water directly from the tap to drink. There is no need for storage or a filter. Tap water will be available 24x7,” said Patnaik.The chief minister said nearly 2 crore tourists visit Puri every year, they will no longer have to carry water bottles with them while in Puri. “The move will now eliminate the usage of 3 crore plastic water bottles. This would mean the city will now be free from nearly 400 tonnes of plastic waste,” he said.The Sujal Mission was launched on October 13 last year to ensure quality tapped drinking water for more than 1.5 million people in more than 15 urban areas. It includes a 24/7 helpline centre with IVRS for grievance redressal, a mobile water testing laboratory and a quick response team for rapid redressal of water supply complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/puri-becomes-the-first-city-in-country-to-have-drink-from-tap-facility-101627318420849.html

Ever since, the clamour for rehabilitation of the colony’s residents has grown louder. While plans have been afoot since 1992 and even got underway in 2000, only a few of the residents have been rehabilitated till date even as many others wait for their turn.Following the devastation caused by the 2019 flood, Ajit Pawar, then Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, instructed the civic administration to speed-up the process of rehabilitating the residents of Tangewala Colony however not much has been accomplished yet. Local corporator Ashwini Kadam clarified, “The plot for the SRA scheme had been identified. Even the SRA had started the process of checking the authorised slums and surveying them. We are hoping that the SRA scheme will start very soon. I had requested the PMC officials and city engineer before the monsoon to instruct SRA to speed-up the process of rehabilitation of these people to avoid future eventualities. Thereafter, PMC wrote the letter to the SRA.”Meanwhile, a source from the SRA confirmed that the rehabilitation process is in the pipeline. The SRA is carrying out the administrative work and will later issue all the permissions,” the source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/speedup-rehab-for-tangewala-colony-residents-pmc-writes-to-sra-101627316859384.html

They also provide natural infrastructure and protection to the nearby populated areas by absorbing storm surge impacts (abnormal rise in water generated by storm) during extreme natural calamities.”A former senior research fellow of the Agharkar Research Institute, Pune and Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, Shindikar said, “Along the Maharashtra coast, estuaries and creeks are the important habitats that harbour mangrove vegetation. Out of the total 68 sampling sites identified along the Konkan coast; 15 are from the Thane and Mumbai districts, 14 from Raigad, 22 from the Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts with 17 creeks. Unfortunately however, there is very limited space left along the western coast for these mangroves to spread and they are shrinking, thereby not being able to provide sufficient tools of resilience to natural calamities like high tides and cyclones.”Shindikar’s research has found that while the mangroves in Maharashtra were explored for more than a century as part of botanical interest and environmental studies, there is no clear-cut information regarding the number of species, area covered and so on. A majority of the mangrove forests in the state have disappeared due to anthropogenic (caused by human beings and their activities) pressures in recent years. Over the past 25 years, nearly 40% reduction in the mangrove cover of the state has been due to human interference, with habitat conversion and felling of trees being the two major threats to mangroves. The estuary or creek ecosystems in general and the mangrove ecosystems in particular are under tremendous pressure from urbanisation and industrialisation.Shindikar emphasised that the key issue is not just destruction but degradation of mangrove ecosystems through pollution, accumulation of silt, changes in salinity, loss of biodiversity and even the economy for if there are no mangroves, there will be coastal devastation which has led to an estimated loss of $650 billion as stated by a recent study in USA.“It is therefore important that the government focuses on diverse aspects of mangrove ecosystems, the scope for mangrove conservation as business and government policies related to sustainable coastal and mangrove management,” Shindikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maha-mangrove-cover-shrinking-conservation-necessary-to-prevent-calamities-101627316559350.html

Later while walking along the banks, we saw the broken sewage lines from where drainage water was flowing into the river,” he said.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), in a survey, identified pollution in the Pavana river and its tributaries flowing about 20km from Dapodi to Ravet. Six major drains namely, Ravet Nala near Ravet STP, Garware Nala Near Bhatnagar, Kalasagar Nala, Chinchwad Nala near SBR 30 MLD STP, Gavade Colony Nala near Manikbag, Chinchwad Station Nala near By Bombay Selection, and the nala near Sandvik were found to be contributing to the pollution.Following the MPCB survey and the 2019-20 Environment Status Report published by the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), the PCMC was issued warning and also served a court order for polluting the Pawana river. Soon after, work began on building an interceptor drainage line to curb the discharge of sewage water into the Pavana river however it is going on at a snail’s pace, defeating the very purpose for which it was undertaken.On his part, Sanjay Kulkarni, environment officer, PCMC, said, “The plan of building an interceptor drainage line is still underway, and has been delayed due to Covid-19 and also due to litigation over land acquisition. But this year we should have the drainage line in place.”Commenting on the issue, Kiran Hasabnis, sub-regional officer, MPCB, said, “It is true that we found that sewage water is indeed flowing into the Pavana river and that there are breaks in the drainage lines. While in some areas, there is still no proper sewage network. The PCMC has a total sewage generation and treatment capacity of 353 MLD but the sewage treatment plant (STP) holds around 312 MLD and treats only 287 MLD of sewage. The difference of 32 MLD is discharged into the river.”Hasabnis however added that the PCMC plans to bridge this gap in sewage treatment by installing a new 210km drainage line under the AMRUT scheme which was to be completed by 2020, and five new STPs with a capacity of 62 MLD proposed to be built at different locations. The Pavana river originates from the Pavana lake near Lonavala and flows a total distance of 60km to meet the Mula river at Sangvi near Pune. Along its journey, the river flows through Kalewadi, Punawale, Chinchwad and Pimpri.It has been reported that the river is severely polluted due to sewage (untreated and treated) and garbage from these cities and their suburbs. The accumulation of silt and discharge of untreated waste are the major causes of pollution in the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pavana-river-still-carrying-sewage-water-from-broken-drains-101627315959285.html
26-07-2021||Lucknow||Yogi launches MyGovUP portal to connect citizens with state govt policies, services||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday launched the MyGovUP portal to enhance citizens’ communication with the Uttar Pradesh government. With this “innovative effort”, now the citizens can share their opinion on the government’s policy and the government can receive their feedback on programmes of public interest, the chief minister said on the occasion. Mainly, https://up.mygov.in/ is a platform to disseminate the governance schemes and to know the opinion of common citizens on them, said a government statement after the event. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said democracy was a system of governance “of the people, for the people and by the people”. Prior to 2014, public participation in government was negligible and there was no place for the feelings and thoughts of the common citizen, he said. But on this day in July 2014, within two months of the formation of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre, the platform ‘MyGov’ was launched, he said. The platform launched by the Prime Minister to realise the spirit of democracy through technology played a big role in achieving the goal of good governance in seven years, he added. Praising the team of MyGov, the chief minister said, “During the Covid-19 pandemic, we realised the use of technology that how together we can reach the benefits of the schemes of governance with complete transparency and honesty to crores of people.” With the help of technology, over 80,000 e-pos (point of sale) machines were installed in fair price shops and connected to the government’s portal, he said. In his message, Union minister for communications and electronics Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “MyGov is a step towards digital democracy.” MyGov CEO Abhishek Singh also gave a brief overview of MyGov. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal was also present in the programme that was held virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-launches-mygovup-portal-to-connect-citizens-with-state-govt-policies-services-101627315900051.html

Till now, 29,500 online applications have been received for the entrance examination and as usual there is a demand for popular course in Science and Management streams. And some courses and departments are struggling to get admissions. “Currently, students are registering online for various courses offered by SPPU and its deadline is up to July 28. We have received around 29,500 applications, while there is a mixed response to Science and Humanities courses by students. However, language department or courses have got poor response this year. Less number of applications have been received for these department courses for the entrance exams,” said Uttam Chavan, SPPU deputy registrar for the academic admissions department. There are 102 postgraduate courses with various departments in SPPU and 80 courses are of diploma, certificate and undergraduation. “In the Science stream, the maximum demand or entrance applications have come for Chemistry department, followed by Physics and Computer science for this year. Once the deadline is over on July 28, we will check out which department and courses have got less response and then accordingly for those courses open admissions will be done. There will not be any entrance examination held for them,” Chavan said. Usually there is a trend to take admissions for these less-in-demand courses by students who want to study and prepare for competitive exams. They take admission to these courses and on the basis of it they get hostel accomidation in SPPU. So, it is an easy way for students to get hostel facilities and prepare for competitive examination. But this year due to Covid-19 pandemic, the number of such students has drastically gone down affecting the admission process. “There are hundreds of students who come from rural parts of the state and want to get government jobs through competitive examination. But they cannot afford to stay in rented flats, so these students take admission for lesser in demand courses at SPPU and on its basis get hostel admission. But as university hostel is closed since pandemic started, students didn’t appear for such courses in this academic year,” said Kuldeep Ambekar, a student and president of Students Helping Hand organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-courses-chemistry-in-demand-few-takers-for-languages-101627314999830.html
26-07-2021||Other||“Unprecedented” rains triggered floods in Sangli and Kolhapur: Ajit Pawar||PUNE Amid criticism that water management and unauthorised constructions led to flooding last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that “unprecedented” rains triggered floods in Sangli and Kolhapur districts in Western Maharashtra. “When heavy rains started after July 22, there was enough storage capacity in dams in the Krishna river basin, but heavy downpours in the pre-catchment areas of dams caused floods downstream,” he said. Pawar described the pre-catchment area of the dam as the area ahead of the dam’s wall. He added that since its construction, the Koyna dam never received such a huge influx of water. “Around 16.5 TMC water was received in one day in the Koyna dam, which has a storage capacity of 100 TMC. There is a place near Koyna called Navja, where 32-inch rainfall was witnessed,” Pawar said after visiting the flood-hit areas. The deputy CM said the collective water storage in dams in the Krishna basin is at 84 per cent this time, compared to 50 per cent storage in the corresponding period last year. “As far as water storage in the dams in the basins of the Krishna and Bhima rivers is concerned, the current collective water storage is 71 per cent against 37 per cent last year,” he said. Pawar said the work to assess losses caused due to floods has still not been completed. “The real picture about the damage caused to crops and farms will emerge after the water recedes. I have instructed the district administration to continue with the assessment of losses at new places,” he added. Speaking about landslides, Pawar said such incidents were reported from the areas that were not prone to landslips. Responding to a query, Pawar said there was good coordination between the Centre and the Maharashtra government in managing the flood situation. “To avoid flooding in future, emphasis will be given on strengthening the flood management system. I have received some suggestions to have SDRF centres in flood-prone districts so that when such a situation arises, these groups can be pressed into action instead of waiting for help from agencies like the NDRF, Army, coastguard, and Navy,” he said. When asked if the current flood situation in western Maharashtra is a “man-made” crisis, Pawar dismissed such a contention saying “unprecedented” rainfall in “pre-catchment” areas of dams was responsible. “The green cover has not reduced in the areas where the landslide and flooding have taken place. It is being talked about that due to the high tree cutting activities, the incidents of landslide The deputy chief minister said a decision on providing relief to the people affected by floods in Maharashtra will be taken in the next couple of days.Pawar on Monday toured various rain-hit villages in Sangli district and used a rescue boat to reach out to flood victims in some areas.

However, the event was cancelled days before the scheduled date by the Union health ministry due to “unavoidable circumstances”.Jharkhand advocate general Rajiv Ranjan said the state government has filed the plea, as it was a matter of public health.

However, it was cancelled by the health ministry due to certain reasons. We are of the view that the OPD can be made functional even without a formal inauguration.

26-07-2021||Patna||Elderly Covid patients prone to low sodium level: AIIMS study||Elderly Covid-19 patients, especially those with co-morbidities and showing signs of disorientation, need to be promptly hospitalised and checked for fall in sodium level, or it can prove fatal, according to a scientific research based on patients admitted at All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Patna. Low sodium level or hyponatraemia, which is a common electrolyte abnormality in such patients, if unchecked, may lead to brain oedema and can be fatal, said Dr Utpal Anand, associate professor and head, department of gastrointestinal surgery at AIIMS-Patna. Dr Anand has done a scientific research based on case analysis of 500 elderly Covid-19 patients admitted at AIIMS-Patna. His finding, which forms a case series, has been recently accepted for publication in the Medical Journal Armed Forces India (MJAFI), a PubMed-indexed journal. Dr Anand said that existing medical literature suggests restriction of fluid corrects euvolemic hyponatremia, as low sodium level in Covid-19 is mainly due to Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), when excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone due to stress in Covid-19 patients leads to fall in sodium level. However, in his research, he found that SIADH is not the only cause of hyponatraemia. “Hyponatraemia in Covid-19 can be multi-factorial, due to coexistent abnormalities like diabetes and hypocortisolism, a disorder in which the adrenal glands don’t produce enough hormones. Associated pneumonia, respiratory failure and stress in patients with coronavirus can also lead to hyponatraemia,” said Dr Anand. He also found that roughly 14% of the elderly patients, above 60 years of age, sampled for the research suffered from hyponatraemia. “A proper clinical evaluation and interpretation of laboratory parameters like urine osmolality, plasma osmolality, cortisone level, thyroid hormone level, sugar level and lipid profile are important in management of hyponatraemia associated with Covid-19. This will help to identify multiple contributing factors so that a targeted treatment strategy can be instituted in order to avoid serious consequences,” he added. According to Dr Anand, in cases of alteration in behaviour or consciousness, infected elderly patients should urgently be hospitalised and their serum sodium should be promptly evaluated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/elderly-covid-patients-prone-to-low-sodium-level-aiims-study-101627314759145.html

The civic administration had assured of inquiry, but nothing happened. Kunal Khemnar, PMC additional municipal commissioner, said, “To avoid duplication of development works, we have put in place a system to mention longitude and latitude of work and map or design, photograph of area and name of location detailing the work. Action will be taken against officials for duplication of tenders.” On the Bhavani peth tender, he said, “During the inquiry, there were six works and only one map was attached to each work. The location was same and the work was changing the drainage line. We called ward officials and inspected the documents and found that there was a different budget and the contractor attached to the same design and map of work to each work. It was not the same tenders though the work was the same — change drainage pipeline. The work was divided into six parts.” Civic activist Vivek Velankar said, “It is wastage of public money, manpower and machinery.

He also said electricity was free for farmers in seven-eight states but the power tariff was quite high in UP.Replying to a question, Tikait said he had no plans to contest assembly elections and added that farmers were free to support the party they liked.“But farmers will not vote for the BJP because their fight is against this party,” he hastened to add.Yogendra Yadav said that the stir that completed eight months (on Monday) had been able to bring self-respect back to farmers.“Despite the long agitation, the Centre has not paid any heed to our demands. We are here to announce the intensification and extension of our agitation with Mission UP-Uttarakhand,” he said. The stir, he said, would gradually spread across the country.“We will also raise local issues apart from highlighting issues of national importance during the agitation,” Yadav said.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Farmer leaders and the Centre have held several rounds of talks but the impasse remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bku-to-intensify-farmers-stir-in-poll-bound-up-uttarakhand-tikait-101627305578922.html

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Stone crusher of Baghapurana MLA’s son sealed in Mukerian||The Punjab forest department has sealed the stone crusher of Baghapurana Congress MLA Darshan Singh Brar’s son as it was being run illegally on forest land at Bringli Patan village in Mukerian. The department found that the stone crusher was being run on forest land without clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, officials said on Monday. According to records, the Congress MLA’s son, Gurjant Singh Brar, set up the stone crusher on the pretext of generating employment. The forest department’s action came after the Hindustan Times report last week that Brar Stone Crusher, registered in the name of Gurjant Singh Brar, does not have the approval from the central government as under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Dasuya divisional forest officer (DFO) Atal Mahajan said, “A team of the department’s staff led by the forest range officer sealed the stone crusher on Friday as it did not have the NOC. Now the firm will not be able to use this unit until it gets clearance under the Act.” Located in delisted forest area According to the affidavit filed by Gurjant and other documents linked to the firm, Brar Stone Crusher is situated on a delisted forest area under Section 4 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). The delisted forest land can be used only for cultivation and livelihood purposes and that too after approval from the central government under the Forest Conservation Act. However, the firm was found using forest land for non-forest purposes on September 1, 2020. Therefore, the department had imposed a penalty of around ₹6 lakh on the unit. The firm had sought diversion of 0.405 hectares of forest land for the stone crusher in February 2019. But it is yet to get approval. “They have applied for NOC under the FCA, but the case is pending at the higher level,” said the DFO. Gurjant and MLA Darshan Singh Brar did not respond to repeated calls and messages. Earlier, Gurjant had said that the stone crusher was operating according to rules. “We have all mandatory approvals, including forest clearance from the central government as required under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act to run this stone crusher,” he had said Pending penalty-cum-royalty Besides, the mining department has also imposed royalty of ₹1.56 crore, including a penalty of ₹78 lakh, on the stone crusher for allegedly obtaining 1,30,298 tonnes of minerals illegally. However, the MLA’s son is yet to deposit the amount and challenged the department’s decree of imposing the royalty by filing an appeal before the director of the mining department.

26-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi zoo to be reopened from August ; tickets available online from July 31||The Delhi zoo is set to be reopened for visitors from August 1, more than three months after it had to be shut due to the number of covid-19 cases peaking during the second wave of the pandemic, zoo officials said on Monday. Delhi zoo director Ramesh Kumar Pandey said it will be opened in two shifts as earlier. “We are planning to open the National Zoological Park (Delhi zoo) from August 1. Preparations are on in order to keep things in order. It will be opened in two shifts as earlier. Online booking will open from July 31, a day ahead of the opening,” said Pandey.The morning shift will start from 8am to 12pm while the second shift will be from 1pm to 5pm. “Visitors can buy tickets either through the zoo’s website or at the entry gates using QR codes. This time, we will allow 1,500 entries in each slot, adding up to 3,000 daily visitors,” said a senior official.The zoo was closed on March 18 last year, and remained so for over a year due to the pandemic and bird flu. It finally reopened on April 1 this year, only to be closed again on April 15 as the second wave of the pandemic struck. In April, the zoo allowed only 2,000 daily -- 1,000 in each slot.Pandey said the zoo recorded only 124 animal deaths, the lowest over the last three years, while it remained closed for public in 2020-21. “We have introduced cycles for staff to move around the premises and have asked them not to use (other) two-wheelers or cars. This to keep a healthy environment within the zoo premises,” he said.He added that at present, there are 94 species and 1,162 animals in the zoo. “Soon, we will be increasing the number of species to 100 as part of various exchange programmes that have been pending,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-zoo-to-be-reopened-from-august-tickets-available-online-from-july-31-101627303898930.html
26-07-2021||Dehradun||Leadership rejig in Uttarakhand Cong fuels more differences ahead of 2022 polls||The newly appointed leader of Opposition in Uttarakhand, Pritam Singh, who was former state president of Congress, took charge formally on Monday while new state president Ganesh Godiyal will take charge on Tuesday. However, despite the new appointees taking charge, it seems all is not well in the party ahead of the 2022 elections due to differences among party leaders over the new appointments by party central leadership, observers say. The new appointments were made by party national president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday night which ended the month-long crisis in Uttarakhand Congress over the appointment of the new leader of Opposition after the demise of party senior leader Indira Hridayesh. Under the new appointments, former party MLA Ganesh Godiyal was appointed the party’s new state president while former state unit head Pritam Singh was chosen as the new leader of Opposition in state assembly along with four new working presidents of the state unit - Jeet Ram, Bhuwan Kapri, Tilak Raj Behad and Ranjit Rawat. Former chief minister and party national general secretary Harish Rawat, who is also the Punjab unit in-charge and credited with solving the party’s crisis there, was appointed the president of the 2022 election committee president along with the member of Rajya Sabha Pradeep Tamta as vice president and former minister Dinesh Agrawal as the convenor. Party leader Aryendra Sharma was appointed the state unit’s new treasurer. Ever since the new appointments were made, differences erupted among the leaders of the state unit citing the side-lining of former state president Pritam Singh in the new team by removing him from the position a few months ahead of the next assembly polls. Also, there were differences over the appointment of Aryendra Sharma as the new treasurer of the party as he had fought against the party as an independent candidate in the 2017 elections. Amid the differences, party state in-charge Devendra Yadav would be landing in Dehradun from Delhi along with new state president Godiyal and president of election campaign committee Rawat on Tuesday. He would hold meetings with the newly appointed office-bearers to chalk out a strategy for the 2022 state assembly elections. However, if party insiders are to be believed, his visit would be focused on dousing the fire over differences on new appointments and get the party together for the upcoming assembly elections. A party MLA privy to the developments, on the condition of anonymity, said, “It is obvious that not all are happy in the party after new appointments. Many of the Pritam Singh-led group is unhappy that he has been removed from the post of party state president just months before the elections. On top, Godiyal, who is considered close to Rawat with who Singh’s differences are open, has been made the new party state president.” “This development is significant because Singh has practically lost power in ticket distribution for the polls in which the state president has a major say. With Rawat’s aide as new state president and he himself being the president of the election campaign committee, the ticket distribution would be largely in the hands of Rawat which Singh and his aides can’t tolerate,” said the party leader. On the difference over the appointment of Aryendra Sharma as the new party treasurer, he said that “Party MLA Harish Dhami was largely upset over it as he accused him of indulging in anti-party activities in the 2017 election.” Dhami however, while speaking to media persons, denied any reports of being angry over Sharma’s appointment and said he is “with the party at all fronts.” Political analyst and professor of political science at Garhwal Central University, MM Semwal, on the differences said, “This is always the story in Congress which is its biggest drawback in Uttarakhand.” “The problem is, within Congress, there are many Congress led by various factions. The new team also seems to be the result of that factionalism. It clearly has imprints of Harish Rawat all over it. Being the senior-most and very shrewd politician in Congress, he could have never allowed any leader to have the upper hand in upcoming elections. With the new team, he clearly has the steering wheel,” said Semwal. He said, “Also, he has wide public outreach in the party unlike any other leader in Congress. His elevation in state unit will definitely benefit the party as a whole, but not some leaders in the state unit.” Meanwhile, party state in-charge Devendra Yadav denied any differences in the state unit after new appointments. “The new team is made with a focus on winning the 2022 state assembly elections which we are sure to win. There are no differences whatsoever in the party as we all believe in collective leadership,” said Yadav. On Harish Rawat being the party CM face for 2022 elections after being appointed the election committee president, he refuted any such development and said, “The CM face would be decided only after winning the polls as per the party’s tradition.” Earlier on Monday, after taking charge as the new leader of Opposition in the state legislative assembly, Pritam Singh “expressed gratitude” to all party members for extending their support to him while being the state president and urged them to do the same in the new role. “After the unfortunate demise of the former leader of Opposition and senior party leader Indira Hridayesh, we are now down to 10 MLAs in the House of 70. However, we will put all our efforts into attacking the government on behalf of the people in the assembly sessions and try to play an active Opposition,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/leadership-rejig-in-uttarakhand-cong-fuels-more-differences-ahead-of-2022-polls-101627303238709.html
26-07-2021||Other||Goa, Delhi power ministers face off over free power: ‘Let people decide’||Delhi power minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Satyendar Jain on Monday insisted that his party’s plan for Goa, to provide free electricity up to 300 units if they come to power would be hugely beneficial to the people of the state while taking potshots at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for spending money on “buying MLAs” instead of people’s welfare. Speaking during a specially organised debate on Goa’s tariff structure versus Delhi’s, Jain said that the announcement will benefit 87% of Goa’s power consumers.“We are promising free electricity up to 300 units per consumer per month whether that works to ₹700- ₹800 or to ₹1,000 to ₹1,200 in Goa, it is what we are promising. You are saying you will not give it free. Let the people decide. Ultimately it is the people who will decide what is best for them,” Jain said.Also Read | ‘Pramod Sawant to be BJP’s face in Goa for 2022’: JP NaddaIn response, Goa power minister Nilesh Cabral accused the Delhi government of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. “Nothing is free in this world. Whatever they are providing for the people of Delhi is taken from the taxpayers of Delhi and besides they have borrowed crores of rupees,” Cabral said. He also accused the Delhi government of subsidising power rates to benefit private discoms (distribution companies), which continued to rake in profits at the cost of the taxpayer. “In Goa, our tariff structure is different. Here, the Goa government is itself the distributor and we have kept rates low. Our power tariff, no matter how many units one uses, doesn’t go beyond ₹4 per unit for the consumer. In Delhi, if you cross 200 hundred units, even after the subsidy from the government, the rate is higher than what is paid for the same number of units in Goa,” Cabral said. Jain taunted the Goa government for refusing to give uninterrupted power despite being in power in the state for close to 10 years running. “For how long you are going to keep giving excuses? The people of Goa will judge whose plan for Goa is better,” he added. Jain came to Goa to debate with Cabral after throwing down a “challenge” over Goa’s power structure. He said that AAP’s model would involve giving the people of Goa 24*7 free power without interruptions, free electricity to farmers and free power to agriculturists as promised by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-delhi-power-ministers-face-off-over-free-power-let-people-decide-101627302818681.html

The DCW said it is in the process of identifying more widows.The DCW said it has carried out a social survey of these 791 women in order to assist the Delhi government in the rehabilitation process. The survey was carried out on the grassroots level by the commission through its Mahila Panchayat network, according to news agency PTI.“The past few months have been very difficult for humanity, especially India which was ravaged by the third wave of the Corona pandemic. The entire country came in the grip of the disease and several thousands died. In Delhi too, hundreds of women were widowed and several children became orphans,” the DCW said in a letter to the Delhi government.Also Read| 'Troubling rise' in neurological cases among post-Covid patients: HospitalOf the 791 identified women surveyed, it was found that 774 (97.85%) have children. “Further it was seen that while the majority of women, i.e 384 women have 1-2 children, a large section of them - i.e 360 widows (almost 45.51%) have around 3-5 children.

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||A book is a mirror, a lamp and a window||In common discourse, there are views that favour reading books and those that disfavour reading them. As far as their popular appeal is concerned, the latter are more imaginative compared to the former. As children, we would get sick of our parent’s constant refrain, “Padhoge likhoge banoge nawab,” to goad us to study. On the other hand, in Hindi cinema there’s no dearth of songs that cock a snook at or deride rote learners. I’m reminded of a song in which a damsel tries to wean her beau away from a book with the plea that it’s more edifying to read faces than books, stating the obvious that books are inanimate and cannot substitute the real world of flesh and blood. There is another song from the blockbuster, Roti Kapda aur Makaan, which questions the whole point of an education that steals your prime without compensating you with a job. Actually, the part of humanity that has no truck with the written word is God’s plenty compared to the minuscule population of bibliophiles. For a normal person, the lure of being out and about is more enticing than the desk-bound pursuit of tomes. As a teacher for whom books are bread and butter, I often ask myself, what after all makes reading worth all the strain in the eye. There is surely nothing pristine or primordial about either books or reading. Sages and seers have attained enlightenment or seen the divine light without the aid of books simply because inquisitiveness, common sense and wisdom predate books. And it’s more common to link genius with lack of education than with its abundance. It’s held that genius is born not made. Even from a historical point of view, books are a relatively recent invention. Ages and ages of human life went by before scripts were developed and books and manuscripts came into existence. Today many may believe that unlettered leaders are a liability but history bears testimony that some of the greatest emperors were not formally educated. On the contrary, today a literate person is often at the receiving end. He or she is a perfect candidate for getting pilloried for trivial mistakes as transgressions of an educated person are less easily tolerated by society. Then what is it that justifies reading and makes it a good investment? One answer could be that it hasn’t got much to do with the origin of books or the question whether wisdom is within or without. Books have no monopoly over knowledge because age, experience and inborn sagacity have an equal claim. Yet, their value lies in the rare property of magical transformation into mirrors, lamps and windows. At different times and depending on how we perceive them, books act as mirrors when they truthfully reflect the realities of our life, lamps when they perform the illuminating function and make old and familiar things appear in a new light and windows which encase everything in the world whether near or far. In this sense, they do not drive a wedge between the animate and inanimate worlds. Rather, they thrive in the annihilation of such divisions. ajayverma71patiala@gmail.com The writer teaches at the Punjabi University Regional Centre in Bathinda||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-book-is-a-mirror-a-lamp-and-a-window-101627301618678.html

Also, the tree census of newly merged villages is likely to begin after the budget approval in February- March next year.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had allocated the tender of tree census to SAAR IT Resources Pvt Ltd in 2016.According to the Environment Status Report (2019-2020) released by PMC, the census of 47,53,670 trees is complete.“These species which are considered rare have been found from all over the city. The process of counting is still underway,” said Yogesh Kute, head geospatial, SAAR IT Resources Pvt Ltd.According to the civic authorities, these 104 trees have been categorised as rare trees because they are less in number.“These trees are classified as rare because only a few would be seen in the city. Trees such as African Mangosteen, Anjani, Dahiwan, Lal Zumbar, Silk floss cotton are not common,” said Ashok Ghorpade, head of PMC’s garden department.He added that the number of extinct tree species could be known only after the census is complete.According to the civic officials, almost all the green cover in the city’s original limits has been documented so far. “Almost 98 per cent of tree census is complete. Rest is pending because of the permission issues in the private properties,” said Ghorpade.Meanwhile, PMC’s boundary has been extended twice after the geo-enabled tree census started in the city.In 2017, the state government merged 11 villages into the PMC limits, while recently, 23 more villages have been merged into civic limits. The number of trees in PMC limits is expected to rise exponentially as the tree census in these newly merged villages has not been done yet.“A fresh tender will be floated for the tree census in these newly merged villages. It will be done after getting the budget approval,” said Ghorpade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/census-finds-104-rare-species-of-trees-in-pune-city-101627300539189.html

26-07-2021||Other||New rules leave no room for ambiguity on shelf life of pre-packed foods||It has taken the food regulator a very long time to remove the ambiguities in the shelf life information on pre-packed foods and uphold the consumer’s right to information, informed choice and safety. But it has finally happened.From November 17 this year, that imprecise and nebulous term – “Best Before” – that has led to so much of confusion, food wastage and financial loss to consumers, will finally be banished from the packages. And in its place, the more precise term “Date of Expiry” or “Use By” date will denote the accurate shelf life of a food product. In other words, we will no more be throwing away perfectly safe food on the ground that it is past the “Best Before” date.Equally important, the ”Use By” or the “Expiry” date can no more be hidden somewhere on the package where consumers cannot see it. The two important dates that tell consumers how fresh the product is and how long it can be stored and consumed, now need to be grouped together and will have to be printed in a clear, conspicuous and easily discernible manner, using indelible ink.The Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020, notified on November 17, 2020, finally corrects the anomalies that existed for decades in the law governing shelf life information, and food businesses are expected to comply with the regulations from November 17 this year. Hopefully, the food regulators across the country will stringently enforce it.The legal requirement for printing of shelf life is not new. Long before the Food Safety and Standards Act , 2006 came into being, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules framed under the PFA Act, 1954, mandated that pre-packed foods specify the shelf life. However, the intent of the law was completely lost because of the absence of precision on how the shelf life should be specified.Shelf life information basically comprises two parts – (a) the date of manufacture or packaging that helps consumers buy freshly packed or manufactured food; and (b) the date of expiry that indicates how long the food can be stored and consumed.For an informed decision, these two components of the shelf life should always be together, like you see on medicine packages. But unfortunately, bowing to pressure from food businesses, the authorities never specified in the PFA Rules that these two pieces of information be printed together.Even worse, the rule makers asked the manufacturers to give the “Best before” date and not the “Expiry” date, and even here, instead of asking businesses to print it in the simplest of formats -- the month and the year in numerals -- also gave them the option of indicating that the food is “Best before (number) months” from the date of manufacture.The businesses of course made the most of the slack provisions and the loopholes in the rules. They not only separated the two components of the shelf life information, but also tried their best to conceal the second part of the information by either printing it in minute letters or by hiding it in an obscure corner of the package. Additionally, instead of printing the dates in numerals, most of them chose the “Best before (number) months” from the date of manufacture option.Thus, the rule makers and the businesses together complicated a simple requirement of law . With this format, they denied the crucial shelf life information to all those who could not read English. The rule makers were particularly insensitive to the poor and the illiterate, who were forced to buy only pre-packed edible oil and ground spices because of the prohibition enforced under the PFA Act on their sale in loose form in the 1990s. The ban, meant to prevent adulteration of these commodities, continues under the new law too.When the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 , a more modern food safety law with a sector regulator , replaced the archaic PFA Act, these lacunae that violated the spirit of the law should have been rectified and consumer rights upheld. But regrettably, the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and labeling) Regulations, 2011, did not bring about the required changes.Now finally, the new regulations reflect the intent of the law and consumers should ensure that it is enforced strictly without further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-rules-leave-no-room-for-ambiguity-on-shelf-life-of-pre-packed-foods-101627299697719.html
26-07-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Monsoon disasters more man-made than natural||Cities and rural areas inundated by flood waters. Landslides. Human casualties. All this is, by now, usual for Maharashtra every monsoon season. This year was no different as most of us saw how Taliye, a hamlet in Raigad, was flattened, as a portion of a hillock gave way burying most houses – and villagers living inside. The heavy rain brought two-thirds of Chiplun, a commercial hub of Ratnagiri on the Mumbai-Goa highway, under water. Next we heard of Mahad, another Konkan town, where Babasaheb Ambedkar had carried out a satyagraha to asserts the rights of Dalits over water in public places. The water flowing through the Vashishti and Savitri rivers ravaged these towns and nearby areas. Unprecedented (60cm) rains within 24 hours in the Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani belt of the Western ghats, contributed to the flood situation in neighbouring Ratnagiri and Raigad districts as the Vashisthi and Savitri rivers originate in the same area. If the rains broke all the records, the disaster unfolding on the ground was partially man-made, as management of water and a flurry of constructions along the riverside – some of it unauthorised – has come under the scanner once again. On Sunday, when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited Chiplun, locals were angry because they were not alerted of a possible flood. An early warning, as locals said, would have helped them shift their belongings, some of it washed away, and the rest drenched in water. A large number of constructions along the river, the voluminous release of water from the Kolkewadi dam and torrential rains flooded Chiplun city, and citizens had no prior warning. Once the flood waters recede, a probe will be ordered into the illegal constructions, according to district collector BR Patil. Similar scenes are being witnessed in Kolhapur and Sangli, where most parts are submerged, with a stretch on the Mumbai-Bangaluru national highway still inundated on the third consecutive day. Going by local accounts, the water levels in the Panchaganga and Krishna rivers are higher than 2019, when floods wreaked havoc in these two districts. The only difference this time is there is no major discharge of water from dams on the upstream, while Almatti, located downstream, was also discharging water to avoid any swelling in its backwaters. The answer to frequent flooding in Kolhapur and Sangli perhaps lies in how the flood lines of the Panchganga river there were “redefined” to provide benefits to the construction sector. Post the 2019 flood, Pune-based environmentalist environmentalist Sarang Yadwadkar had accessed some documents of the irrigation department through RTI. The documents showed around 500 hectares along the Panchganga river, which should have been in the flood-affected area (prohibited zone), marked as a residential zone in Kolhapur’s development plan (DP), by “redefining” the flood lines. The irrigation department marks two flood lines - blue and red, demarcating the river area on the floodline. The red line is decided on the maximum water level possibly once in a century and the blue line is for the average maximum flood discharge in 25 years. According to Yadwadkar, the irrigation department issued a circular in 1989 to mark the flood lines for all rivers in Maharashtra, though it was ignored. The government agencies, mostly convenient to the real estate lobby, marked flood levels in place of flood lines. These levels, according to Yadwadkar, were later superimposed on the Development Plan maps of Kolhapur, making it possible for constriction activity near the Panchaganga, Krishna and other rivers. Encroachment on riverbeds always reduces the carrying capacity of floodwaters, something Pune also witnessed during its September 25, 2019 flash floods, when the Ambil Odha turned killer. Heavy rainfall often results in swollen rivers rupturing their banks and floodwater gushing through houses built on the floodplains, leading to major devastation. Even as there was discharge of water from the Radhanagari dam this year, the Panchaganga was swelling in Kolhapur city. Every disaster brings lessons which the government can either learn from, or chose to ignore at its own peril. The price, of course, will be paid by common citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-monsoon-disasters-more-man-made-than-natural-101627296278603.html

A virtual inauguration of the OPD at the new AIIMS building was scheduled for June 26 this year. However, it was cancelled days before the scheduled date by the union health ministry due to “unavoidable circumstances”. Jharkhand advocate general Rajiv Ranjan said the state government filed the plea as it was a matter of public health. The court, after hearing the matter on Monday, issued notices to the Centre and AIIMS seeking their reply on the issue. “Both the chief minister and the union health minister had given their consent for the virtual inauguration. However, it was cancelled by the health ministry for certain reasons. We want to know why the OPD can’t be made functional even without a formal inauguration. Opening it would benefit the locals,” added Ranjan. Also Read | Heavy rain warning for parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and N-W plainsSeeking replies from the Centre and AIIMS, the court has listed the matter for hearing on August 26. The virtual inauguration and cancellation of the event last month courted controversy as the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the Centre, blamed each other for the postponement of the inauguration.

The order was uploaded on Saturday night.Hearing a petition by lawyer-activist Pratima Das, who is seeking ₹20 lakh compensation for being falsely charged with sedition in 2008, a division bench of Orissa high court comprising chief justice S Muralidhar and justice BP Routray expressed surprise that although this petition was filed in 2011, it was listed only twice for hearing in the last 10 years--on February 23 and September 6, 2012. Since police officers were named in the case, the high court ordered that the state provide the correct addresses of the officers within four weeks.Also Read | Offline classes in Odisha schools begin amid Covid containment normsDas, 41, a resident of Choudwar, was arrested in August 2008 for her alleged links with Maoists in Odisha and was sent to Alipingala jail of Jagatsinghpur district. While she was in Alipingala jail, police implicated her in another criminal case registered at the Jamankira police station in Sambalpur district and charged her with sedition among other cases. She was chargesheeted in two cases under various grievous charges, including murder, dacoity and sedition. She remained in jail till November 17, 2010, till the courts acquitted her of all charges, including sedition.After her acquittal, she moved the Orissa high court in November 2011 seeking ₹20 lakh compensation and punishment for three police officers and four junior officials for fabricating a case against her, which, she said, caused her mental trauma and public humiliation. The police officers are RK Sharma (additional DG law and order), DS Kuttey (OSD to chief minister) and Sanjay Kumar(IG, Sashastra Seema Bal) while the junior officials are Bichitrananda Samal, Pradeep Kumar Panda, Manas Ranjan Garnaik and Niranjan Mishra.“In neither of the two cases could the prosecution substantiate any of the charges against me, including the allegation of seditious activity. I was branded a Maoist. The charges led to massive personal and professional humiliation for me for two years, three months and five days. My family could never return to normal. Newspapers had a field day branding me as Maoist,” said Das, demanding legal action against all the seven officials.RK Sharma, one of the seven officials named in the case, said he is yet to see the order and would be able to comment only after going through it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/orissa-hc-orders-issue-of-notice-in-decade-old-false-sedition-case-101627289017583.html

They also had political connections after Ganesh joined the Bharatiya Janata Party but the party has now removed him from his post as president in the traders’ wing after reports of cheating surfaced against him.Also Read | Five districts in Tamil Nadu to get rains todayCases were filed against the brothers by two people who claimed they were cheated of the ₹15 crore and ₹25 lakh respectively that they invested in the sibling’s firm. The first case has six accused out of whom Srikanthan (full name not available), a manager of the brothers’ company, was arrested last week. “We arrested him soon after the case was registered. We have formed different teams to search for the main accused (the brothers),” said a senior police official involved in the investigations. “An FIR has been filed under three sections, including 120 (B) and 420 IPC. “It’s a serious offence. We are also investigating a foreign involvement but we cannot confirm it at this point,” he said. Details are not available on the second case yet.The alleged fraud came to light after posters came up all over Kumbakonam town in Thanjavur district over a week ago with a picture of a helicopter, stating that the business run by the helicopter brothers cheated people to the tune of ₹600crore. Police couldn’t confirm the number of people allegedly duped as only people have filed a case so far. The brothers, through agents, collected deposits from the public over a period of two years with a promise of doubling their money in a year. Later, they cited the Covid-19 pandemic for not returning the deposits.“There are more victims in this case. We want them to come forward and file a complaint and we will take legal action. Justice will be done for the two who have already complained,” said the senior official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tn-police-form-teams-to-nab-helicopter-brothers-in-financial-fraud-case-101627285777219.html

26-07-2021||Jaipur||No differences remain, Rajasthan Cabinet rejig soon: Ajay Maken||After a public resolution to the turmoil in its Punjab unit, the Congress appears to have shifted its focus to Rajasthan.Central Congress leaders, tasked with addressing the concerns raised by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his supporters last year, held a meeting with state party leaders in Jaipur on Sunday, and said they have reached a consensus on the issue of state cabinet expansion but the final decision will be taken by the party high command in Delhi.The meeting, called by the state party chief Govind Singh Dotasra, was attended by 26 legislators, 12 ministers and 28 party office-bearers, according to a state Congress leader who asked not to be named. Among them was Pilot and nine legislators who back him, the person added.Congress general secretary Ajay Maken, who is in charge of Rajasthan for the party, presented a unified front after Sunday’s meeting. “I can say that there is no disagreement or contradiction among the party leaders and they all have left the final decision about the cabinet expansion to the party high command,” he told reporters, adding that the decision of the Delhi leadership will be accepted by all.He did not give a timeline for the cabinet expansion, one of the key demands of the Pilot camp, but party functionaries aware of the mattersaid the announcement may be made next month.Maken and All India Congress Committee general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal arrived in Jaipur from Delhi on Saturday, and held discussions with chief minister Ashok Gehlot at his residence in the state capital the same day.The central leaders on Saturday spoke to the CM about the issues raised by the Pilot camp: cabinet expansion, political appointments in state boards and corporations, and implementation of promises made before the 2018 assembly elections in Rajasthan, said a person familiar with the development.This was the first time since the Pilot camp’s rebellion that the central Congress leaders held such discussions with Gehlot, he added.In July last year, Pilot and 18 MLAs revolted against the chief minister, leading to a 30-day-long turmoil that ended with a compromise formula after the party high command in Delhi was roped in. Pilot was removed as the deputy to the CM, but the party formed a three-member panel comprising Maken, Venugopal and late Congress leader Ahmed Patel to resolve the issues raised by them.Nearly a year on, the Congress’s swift response in mitigating a similar crisis in Punjab — of infighting between the factions led by chief minister Amarinder Singh and newly appointed state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu — reinvigorated the Pilot camp.Since June, Pilot and his supporters have publically demanded that their issues be addressed by the party.In an interview to HT in June, Pilot said: “It has now been 10 months. I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven’t been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard.”Last week, the 43-year-old leader said he was in touch with senior Congress leaders and hoped that the required steps will be taken soon. “We are in touch with the high command and I believe that the AICC is going to take necessary steps required to be taken,” he said on Wednesday.Chaksu MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, a Pilot supporter who attended Sunday’s meeting, indicated that the outcome could be positive. “We met Maken and Venugopal, who assured us that the party leadership is looking into the issues, and soon expansion and appointments will be made on merits,” he said.At present, there are 21 members (including the chief minister) in the state cabinet, and nine slots are vacant. Rajasthan can have a maximum of 30 ministers.Maken is set to return to Jaipur later this month and hold individual discussions with Congress MLAs. “I am returning on July 28-29 and will hold a one-to-one dialogue with Congress MLAs over district and block (appointments) as AICC wants to know the feedback of MLAs before taking any decisions. We will also ask them for good names for appointments on boards and corporations,” he said.The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, however, said a cabinet expansion will not be the solution to Congress’s problems in Rajasthan. The Gehlot government is “going to fall and the cabinet expansion, appointments and organisational posts cannot save them... The posts are limited and expectations of their workers and leaders are high”, said BJP legislator and state spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma.The Congress’s pivot to Rajasthan comes after the party averted a political crisis in Punjab, which goes to the polls early next year. Another panel formed by the party quelled Sidhu’s dissent against CM Amarinder Singh, and coronated the cricketer-turned-politician as the Congress Punjab unit chief last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/no-differences-remain-rajasthan-cabinet-rejig-soon-ajay-maken-101627284439873.html
26-07-2021||Bangalore||BS Yediyurappa announces his resignation as Karnataka chief minister||Putting an end to speculation, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday announced his resignation during a function celebrating the second-year anniversary of his government in Bengaluru. “I have made the decision….I will go the Raj Bhavan, I will submit my resignation,” the 78-year-old said. “I’m not sad. I’m happy. I can’t thank in words Prime Minister Modi, Amit Shah, and (JP) Nadda to let me be chief minister even though I was over 75 years,” he said. The speculation over his resignation began soon after his return from New Delhi on July 17. During his visit, he had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda. Soon after the meeting, he denied the rumours of his resignation; however, two days later, he hinted at a possible change in leadership. Also Read | Karnataka floods: 9 dead, 3 missing in disaster-hit areas, says ministerTalking to reporters on Thursday, he said that he will abide by the decision of the national high command. “Amit Shah and our national president (JP) Nadda have immense faith in me. As you know, no one above the age of 75 years is given any posts or positions by the party. But considering my work, the national leadership has given me the opportunity to be in power till 78. My aim is to strengthen the party and bring our government back to power once again,” Yediyurappa said. Following this statement, several leaders of the Lingayat community had come out in Yediyurappa’s support. The Lingayat community forms around 16-17% of the state’s population and, over decades, has played a pivotal role in the Karnataka state elections. Some leaders in the community had warned the BJP of “consequences” if he is removed from power. Yediyurappa has been chief minister of Karnataka for four terms. He was forced to quit as chief minister in 2011 after serving since 2008 when the Karnataka Lokayukta named him in a report on illegal mining in the state. He was also prosecuted by the Central Bureau of Investigation, but the case was quashed by a sessions court in Bengaluru. He was chief minister for a week in 2007 and for three days in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bs-yediyurappa-announces-his-resignation-as-karnataka-chief-minister-101627282176758.html

While the center recorded the details of the beneficiary with the promise that the concerned primary health centre (Sadar PHC in this case) will administer the dose, the health manager at Sadar PHC in Darbhanga, Rewati Raman, said he had no knowledge of any programme for doorstep vaccination.“I am not aware about doorstep vaccination for aforesaid target group. So far, I have not received any written or oral instructions from concerned authorities,” he said.However, district immunization officer (DIO) Amrendra Kumar Mishra assured to do the needful in this regard.On the other hand, civil surgeon Sanjiva Kumar Sinha said it was not necessary to issue a written communication when a decision had already been made at the government’s level. “It is assumed [to be] known to all [through] from newspaper (sic). If we get such [a] request from public, it will be fulfilled,” he said.District Programme Manager (health) Vishal Kumar said currently the entire focus of the health department was on vaccinating 216,000 people within the municipal limits of Darbhanga by July 31. Once the department manages to ease the pressure at vaccination centres, the focus will be on door step vaccination, he said.Some district administration officials said that apart from administration of vaccine at all PHCs, a vaccination drive had been launched to cover cent percent population in urban area between July 25 and 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/doorstep-vaccination-for-elderly-a-non-starter-in-bihar-s-darbhang-101627279836660.html

The hill top is dotted with seven Buddhist Stupas and the remains of five of these Stupas can still be witnessed there.Halfway to its top, there are three caves, known as Mahakaala caves where Lord Buddha meditated for six years before achieving enlightenment. Hence, the area is known as Pragbodhi. At the site of his meditation at the Mahakaal cave, there still exists an image of Lord Buddha, emaciated after years of fasting and meditation.It’s to mark this incident in the life of Lord Buddha that the state tourism has planned to install his statue atop the hill. Besides, the area around Pragbodhi too is being developed with a cafeteria, souvenir shops and basic amenities for tourists."While Lord Buddha's site of enlightenment has already achieved UNESCO status, there’s the plan to develop his site of meditation. Pragbodhi is now gaining popularity and tourists, especially those from foreign countries make it a point to see Pragbodhi and the Mahakala cave at Dungeshwari hill. But the place needs tourist facilities," Narayan Prasad, Bihar tourism minister said at a meeting held at Gaya on Saturday to review tourism projects related to the twin cities of Gaya and Bodh Gaya.The minister said that Bihar state tourism development corporation (BSTDC), the commercial wing of the state tourism, which has been handling these tourism projects, has been asked to develop world class facilities at Pragbodhi considering the high flow of foreign tourists. “They have also been directed to finish the pending works...before the onset of tourism season in October,” he said.The minister added that a Buddha statue atop the Dungeshwari hill will enhance tourism attractions at Pragbodhi. Besides, a ropeway too has been planned for this hill. “At present, visitors need to walk to the hilltop. Ropeway will make the trip to the hilltop easier and convenient,” he said.An official from the BSTDC, who did not want to get quoted, said the tender for the ropeway at Dungeshwari is yet to be floated by the tourism department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-developing-pragbodhi-buddha-meditated-here-for-6yrs-before-enlightenment-101627267915278.html

26-07-2021||Mumbai||Relief from rain likely for Maharashtra today; key highways shut as Army relief ops on||A respite from heavy torrential downpour is likely on Monday for the flood-hit Maharashtra as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted rainfall at isolated places in the state, accompanied by strong winds. "Heavy rainfall at isolated places has been forecasted by the weather body for central Maharashtra, Coastal Karnataka, Konkan and Goa," a forecast by the IMD for Monday read. The rains will be accompanied by strong winds of 45-55kmph gusting to 60kmph over southwest and central Arabian sea, a forecast read, advising fishermen to not venture into these areas.In the later part of the week, the state can continue to expect relief from the rainfall as the monsoon now travels upwards to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The country will witness normal to below normal monsoon conditions this week, the IMD said in its forecast.The reduced downpour will help the rain-battered state to carry out relief operations, crippled last week due to continuous record-breaking rainfall. At least 153 people lost their lives, 64 have been missing and 230,000 people have been displaced in the worst floods Maharashtra has seen in decades.Pummeled by the rains, key state and national highways in Maharashtra remain disconnected from the rest of the country for four consecutive days. The Mumbai-Bengaluru highway, partly submerged near Kolhapur, continued to be shut for vehicular traffic for the third day on Sunday. Kolhapur-Pune, Mumbai-Goa, Kolhapur-Ratnagiri were shut till Sunday evening in patches in Ratnagiri, Kolhapur and Sindhudurg.Nearly 2,000 Karnataka-bound vehicles, including trucks, are stranded on the national highway, the district police told PTI.

26-07-2021||Delhi||For the first time, entire bus fleet operated by DTC declared ‘overage’||The entire fleet of 3,760 buses run by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has been officially declared “overage” this year, a first in the history of the state transport utility, which was set up in 1971, according to data accessed and analysed by HT.The data also showed that 99% of the fleet has crossed the technical operational limit for low-floor CNG buses. The DTC categorises a bus as “overage” after a run of more than eight years. As per the procurement contracts under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), the maximum operational life of a low-floor CNG bus is 12 years or 750,000km, whichever is later.Of the total 3,760 buses, none of them is even as young as 6-8 years. At least 32 of the buses are 8-10 years old, 3,072 are between 10 and 12 years old, and 656 are older than 12 years. The number is alarming considering that the city needs 11,000 buses, according to a government affidavit submitted to the high court in 2018, and that the DTC itself is mandated to have 5,500 buses.Even if the 2,990 cluster buses, which are run by private operators, are included, Delhi’s current state run buses strength goes up to 6,750 only.Delhi transport minister and chairperson of DTC Kailash Gahlot said the issue has been extensively discussed in recent board meetings of the corporation.“Yes, it is true, and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also expressed concern as our state-run buses are the lifeline of Delhi’s public transport. Our DTC and cluster buses together carry at least one million passengers more than the Delhi Metro every day. So, we planned a revival of the DTC by pumping in 1,300 new buses in the next seven months,” he said.It has been difficult for the DTC to get a successful tender for procurement of buses. Records seen by HT showed that the last time DTC finalised a tender was in 2008, and buses from that tender kept coming in small batches till October, 2011. After that, the DTC floated five tenders between 2013 and 2019, but none of them could be executed either due to unreasonable comprehensive annual maintenance contract (CAMC) or due to lack of enough bidders. It was finally in 2020 that a tender for 1,000 AC low-floor CNG buses was finalised with two bidders getting the contract in 70:30 ratio.However, allegations of irregularities in CAMC has indefinitely delayed the acquisition of 1,000 AC low-floor CNG buses. A probe committee appointed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has given a clean chit to the DTC over the tendering and procurement of the buses. The three-member panel, however, recommended floating fresh tenders for its AMC over what it described as “procedural lapses” arising out of a “bona fide decision-making process”.Gahlot said, “The DTC and I personally worked for months to make this tender successful. This was the DTC’s biggest achievement in 12 years as all earlier bus tenders kept failing...We hope that of the 1,300 buses, at least 300 electric buses for which the work order was issued in March this year, is not obstructed. People need more buses and this has been reiterated not just by the Delhi government but also the Supreme Court and high court.”Once the buses attain their shelf life, they are ideally supposed to be scrapped. However, records showed that because new buses are not being added, DTC has been forced to operate all such buses. No buses have been sent to the scrapyard in the current financial year, and only two buses were scrapped in 2020-21. In 2019-20, 80 buses were withdrawn from operations owing to age-related maintenance problems. Between 2011 and 2017, 368 buses were scrapped on an average annually with 2,209 vehicles being withdrawn during this period.But running old buses is pushing up maintenance costs.Vijay Bidhuri, managing director, DTC, said the situation has been so precarious that the corporation urged the state transport authority (STA) to allow its buses to ply till the age of 15 years. “There was no other way but to run them beyond their prescribed age. Fortunately, the STA has now allowed us to operate DTC buses till they attain 15 years. But, this is only a stop-gap arrangement. It has given us 2-3 years maximum to replace our entire fleet. We need to add new buses to DTC’s fleet because our expenditure on maintaining these old buses is also increasing. Even as we are running overaged buses, we cannot compromise on safety and have to keep the buses in their best possible condition, which is an expensive affair,” he said.This age of the DTC buses has also started reflecting on its operational statistics. In 2015-16, the DTC used to operate 33,497 trips every day, which has now come down to about 30,000 trips on an average per day.Annual internal audits by the DTC have also shown that an overaged fleet was a key factor in low productivity. Besides, the number of breakdowns have gone up because the entire fleet is composed of low-floor buses as mandated by the high court and Supreme Court to make public transport more accessible to the disabled. Low-floor buses have lower ground clearance, because of which they are more vulnerable to breakdowns, especially where roads are not in good shape or flooded stretches.Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE’s executive director and in-charge of research and advocacy, said because 100% of DTC’s fleet is “overaged”, the effective increment of Delhi’s bus fleet size has been very small. “Around 700 new buses have been added since 2019 in Delhi, but this is only under the cluster scheme. The DTC continues to operate with old buses, which effectively nullifies the increase in the city’s bus fleet because 56% of it constitutes DTC buses. Clearly, Delhi still needs a lot more buses to match the requirement of 11,000 buses as prescribed in the route rationalisation study by the Delhi government, and also to meet the growing demand,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/for-the-first-time-entire-bus-fleet-operated-by-dtc-declared-overage-101627257675531.html

On Friday evening, however, he was in Humayunpur, a small village in south Delhi, for dinner with his family – his second culinary excursion to the place in the past month.“ We love northeastern food, and right now there is no better place than this village to find it,” says Taneja, sitting inside The Categorical Eat-Pham, a restaurant known for Manipuri cuisine. “ What makes this village different is affordability, variety, and authenticity of food its restaurants offer.”There are many gourmands like Taneja who swear by Humayunpur’s growing reputation as the city’s new food hot spot. The village, near Safdarjung Enclave, has witnessed a slow and silent culinary revolution with over 60 trendy, budget-friendly restaurants and cafes offering Chinese, Korean, Nepalese and North-east Indian cuisine coming up in the last three years, putting Humayunpur on the city’s ever-expanding culinary map.Deepak Dhunger Chhetri, who last year opened his restaurant, Mila’s Mama Kitchen, in the village, describes the place as a “laboratory of young food entrepreneurs”. “Most of them have no previous experience in food business, and they are the people who have transformed this village into a food destination. A decade back, one could see buffaloes roaming the streets here, ” says Chhetri, who is from West Bengal and has lived in the village since 2011.In the 1960s, most agricultural land around the village was acquired by DLF and developed into Safdarjung Enclave, but Humayunpur continued to be a nondescript village. In the early 2000s, migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and southern states began making the village home, prompting the villagers to add additional floors to their houses.By the early 2010s, it began to attract young migrants from North-east India who came to Delhi for jobs and education. By 2015, about 50% of the tenants living in its multi-storey houses were people from the North-east. That is when the first few restaurants opened, catering mostly to the North-eastern community. The big restaurant boom in the village began in 2018 and almost a dozen new restaurants were opened in a few months before the lockdown in the Capital in March 2020.Several of these restaurants in the village are owned by young women from the North-east. “I came to Delhi in 2010 to study, but I always wanted to open a restaurant in the Capital. When I opened my restaurant here three years back, most of my clients were migrants from North-eastern states, but today, a vast majority of them are north Indians,” says Dickey Bhutia, who hails from Kalimpong, and runs a restaurant called LHA Kitchen, which is known for its Tibetan and Nepalese cuisine.Bhutia employs 15 people, three of them hired only this year. “ The business is nearing the pre-pandemic levels now. Except for the parking problem, the place has everything going for it. It is centrally located, the rents are reasonable compared to other urban villages and, most importantly, the landlords here are pretty cooperative. Unlike many other urban villages, I feel at home and safe here. ”Though low compared to other villages, the rents have trebled here in the past five years. On average, the rent for a 700 sq ft commercial space on the ground floor is ₹85,000 a month, which is a third of the rent for a similar space in Hauz Khas village. Most landlords in the village live on the upper floors and have rented out the ground floor. In fact, Humayunpur is one of the many villages in the Capital that are categorised as ‘Lal Dora abadi’. While Lal Dora villages are exempted from the building bylaws and other regulations of municipal or urban development authority and no permission is required for construction in them, the properties sold in these villages cannot be registered. The restaurant boom has not had any major effect on the property prices so far.“Local educated youngsters encouraged their elders to start renting out to commercial establishments like restaurants and boutiques. A majority of the restaurants survived the pandemic as these young villagers understood our situation and waived off the rent during the lockdown on their own,” says Ashok Mutum, co-owner, The Catregoral Eat-Pham. “They ensure that our community and businesses face no trouble here.”Radhika Abrol, a village resident and the local MCD councillor, says that the village attracts not just food lovers but also a lot of filmmakers. “A few short films have been shot here over a couple of years. It is because ours is a tolerant multi-cultural village, a fascinating mix of the urban and the rural. Since the number of restaurants is growing fast, my immediate priority is to set up an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) here,” says Abrol.“Most restaurants owners are migrants who live in the village. They have flourished here; we do not bother about what they eat, whom they invite home, when they return home. No village in Delhi can match us in terms of tolerance, ” says Rakesh Singh, a local resident.Many like Abu Sarwar Choudhary from Assam, who in 2017 opened Bhansaghar, a restaurant that offers Nepalese cuisine, says that Humayunpur’s culinary journey was disrupted by the pandemic, and about a dozen restaurants shut shop last year. “Many more new restaurants would have opened here if it was not for the pandemic. The footfalls were doubling every year and most restaurants were usually filled to capacity in the evenings”.Last year in March, Deepak Dhunger Chhetri temporarily shut Mila’s Mama Kitchen three days after inaugurating it as the government imposed the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. But despite being forced to close again during the second wave this year, he says he has no regrets. “Business will return soon because our reputation has spread far and wide mostly through word of mouth publicity and our aggressive marketing on Instagram. I still believe Humayunpur is the place to be if you are an aspiring restaurateur without deep pockets ” says Chhetri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/silent-culinary-revolution-brews-at-south-delhi-s-humayunpur-village-101627257110510.html

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Weekend curfew lifted in J&K||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday lifted the weekend curfew from all districts of the Union territory though some restrictions such as night curfew will stay in place.As per the orders issued by state executive committee (SEC) chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta while there will be no weekend curfew in any district, night curfew will remain in force in all the districts from 8pm to 7am.Businesses will be able to stay open during curfew relaxation hours in all 20 districts. The order said that the maximum number of people permitted to attend any indoor or outdoor gathering will be restricted to 25. “Public and private educational institutions are permitted to seek personal attendance of limited vaccinated staff for administrative purposes,” it said.Deputy commissioners have been asked to focus on the positivity rate in their respective medical blocks. There has been a sharp decline in the daily Covid cases and deaths in the UT with the single-day infections falling below 100 and fatalities remaining in single-digits this week. Officials said there has been a significant improvement in terms of total weekly cases, positivity rate, bed occupancy, case fatality rate, vaccination coverage and extent of compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour. 166 fresh cases, no deaths in J&K No virus-related death was recorded in Jammu and Kashmir while 166 new infections were detected on Sunday.

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh hires hi-tech machine to rid Sukhna Lake of weeds||Struggling to clear the Sukhna Lake of the widespread weed growth, the UT administration has, for the first time, put into use an Aquatic Weed Harvesting Machine (AWHM).Over the years, though de-weeding was taken up regularly; it was done manually, which could clean the Sukhna Lake only partially. Now, with AWHM, the administration aims to clean the entire Sukhna Lake area of weeds in one go.“We expect to remove all the weeds from the lake within three months. The machine, hired for three-and-half months at a cost of ₹12 lakh from a Mumbai firm, will help us clear the lake more effectively and that too in one-go. This is the first time, an AWHM is being used in the lake,” said CB Ojha, UT chief engineer.The artificial lake was created in 1958 by damming Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Shivalik Hills.There is heavy weed infestation in the lake, which has led to its area decreasing from the original 228 hectares to 148 hectares, as per department officials.Aquatic weeds (water-borne grass), such as potamogeton crispus, Hydrilla verticillata and Vallisneria spiralis etc., grow in the Lake and hinder the boating experience for visitors, besides giving it a shabby look.In a bid to conserve the lake, the Punjab and Haryana high court has also repeatedly been directing the UT to check weed growth and take necessary measures to preserve its original character and beauty.“Earlier, manual removal of weeds was a slow process. It took a long time and we were not able to clean the lake properly. Workers involved in the cleaning of the lake also reported getting infections and allergies because of the work. So, it became imperative to remove these water weeds through specialised machinery and equipment,” said Ojha.One of the options was to adopt the Dal Lake model. “After assistance from Jammu and Kashmir Lakes and Waterways Development Authority didn’t materialise for cleaning up the lake with the same technique, the department floated tenders for hiring machines on its own,” he added. What is an aquatic weed harvesterIt is an environmentally friendly method of controlling excessive aquatic plant growth and nuisance vegetation in a water-body like lake. It helps in the removal of submerged, emergent and free-floating vegetation in a lake. “Like a farm harvester, an aquatic weed harvester cuts the vegetation, collecting and storing the weeds on board. Aquatic weed harvesters are fitted with a pick-up conveyor at the forward end of the machine, which can be lowered under water to cut weeds. One horizontal and two vertical cutter bars severe the vegetation as the machine moves forward through the water and when the storage hold becomes full, the weed harvester returns to shore to unload,” said Ojha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-hires-hi-tech-machine-to-rid-sukhna-lake-of-weeds-101627244848929.html
26-07-2021||Delhi||Over 9k children trafficked during pandemic: Report||Dilbar was on his way to Delhi along with 16 other children from West Bengal in August 2020 when some activists spotted them in Bihar and sounded out the authorities about a possible case of child trafficking. When the train stopped at Delhi’s Anand Vihar station, the police and members of a child rights foundation were waiting to rescue them.This wasn’t the young boy’s first trip to Delhi for work. The 11-year-old had worked in a sewing factory for six months before he had to return due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown in March. “My uncle got me a ticket in August,” said Dilbar who has been living in Mukti Ashram, a short-term rehabilitation centre run by Bachan Bachao Andolan for rescued boys in Burari on the outskirts of the national capital Delhi. His uncle faces prosecution under the child labour law.Data compiled by Bachan Bachao Andolan (BBA), the non-profit founded by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi, indicates that Dilbar is among the 9,000 children who were rescued when they were being trafficked for labour between April 2020 and June 2021 as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the country. At 3,183, the largest number of children were rescued in Uttar Pradesh, followed next by Telangana (2,805), Andhra Pradesh (593), Rajasthan (430) and Gujarat (333).Child rights activists, and even the Union home ministry, have warned about a possible increase in instances of child trafficking after the country started emerging from the national lockdown in June and July last year. The BBA had then underscored that there would be greater demand for child labour because factory owners will look to cover their financial losses by employing cheap labour.BBA executive director Dhananjay Tingal said the assessment wasn’t off the mark.“Last time, even when the modes of transport were limited, (still) children continued to be trafficked,” he said, adding that there was a substantial increase in the number of distress calls received by the foundation.To be sure, the foundation started getting SOS messages within weeks of the national lockdown imposed in March 2020. “In many places, the children were left without any food or work.” Experts have pointed out how systems designed to help children failed to keep up with the alarming spread of Covid-19; the economic situation pushed many into destitution.There were also reports of an increase in child abuse and trafficking during the Covid-19 lockdown.Enakshi Ganguly, the co-founder of child right’s organization HAQ, said no one had done a systematic study but there was some evidence to indicate an increase in the vulnerability of children, with a rise in school dropout rates and an increase in child labour.The study by the Campaign Against Child Labour in states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan shows very clearly that there is an increase in child labour. “They found that it was a combination of not having schools, devices and economic distress that led children to drop out of school and venture into child labour. The connection between child labour and child trafficking is a very thin line. There is no reason to believe not an increase in trafficking. An increase in vulnerability creates a situation where children are bought and sold.”The National Crime Records Bureau hasn’t released official statistics for 2020. The 2019 report, however, counted a 2.8% increase in cases from 2,837 in 2018 to 2,914 in 2019. The total number of persons trafficked in 2019 was 6,616.Tingal said when the lockdown was lifted in August, the foundation did notice a trend of children travelling in trains meant for migrants and even in buses. “The major mode of transport was buses,” he said. “From August to October, there was a sharp increase in the number of children travelling without parents or guardians in these, it was then we realized that they were being trafficked. We rescued nearly 400 children during this period and nearly 100 traffickers were arrested.”It is in this context that the government is expected to again introduce a bill targeted to deal with trafficking during the monsoon session. The draft bill has specific provisions to prosecute traffickers and those who help them such as Dilbar’s uncle. It proposes seven to 10 years of jail and up to ₹5 lakh fine for those convicted. There is also a provision to enable the National Investigation Agency to investigate trafficking cases.Ganguly of HAQ said strengthening social structures was the only way to stop child trafficking rather than more punitive laws and penal reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-9k-children-trafficked-during-pandemic-report-101627244144138.html

In addition to it, the European Union (EU) is also giving a grant of ₹98 crore to the project.After the signing of the agreement, the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) will start the tendering process, which is expected to be finished by year-end. The work on the project is planned to start early next year.Facing a lot of criticism for the project, which will cost more than ₹590 crore and will lead to increase in water tariff, the CSCL and the MC will also launch a major awareness campaign to involve resident groups, welfare associations, etc,. on the day of the signing of the agreement.Outreach programme to involve resident groups to be launchedNP Sharma, MC chief engineer-cum-chief executive officer of CSCL, said, “AFD officials, the European Union representatives, Union government officials and political leaders will be invited. On August 20, we will also start an outreach programme for city residents involving different citizen groups, resident welfare associations and other stakeholders.”Presentations, video documentaries and interactive sessions have been planned to spread awareness about the project and allay fears around it. “All the benefits of the projects will be shared with the city residents on the occasion,” said Sharma.Sharma said that in addition to providing 24x7 water supply, the project aims to improve the quality of supply in terms of water pressure: “The water quality in terms of its purity will also be improved; the entire water network will be modernised, energy efficient devices will be used and its capacity expanded. Wastage of water will be sharply reduced.”By 2039-40, 5.2 lakh tonne CO2 emission to go downThe ₹98-crore EU grant mandates environment, health and social aspects be considered. “The project activity will reduce CO2 emissions by 5.2 lakh tonne up to 2039-40. The project qualifies as a ‘climate’ as well as ‘clean technology’ project as the total greenhouse gas emissions shall reach a lower level than the current CO2 emitted by the existing system,” added Sharma.Meanwhile, the ₹160-crore project for 24x7 water supply in Manimajra is already in the implementation stage: ₹70 crore will be spent on capital works and the rest ₹90 crore on maintenance works for the coming 15 years.There are approximately 13,700 water connections in Manimajra which will be covered under the project. Decreasing the non-revenue water (NRW) or leakage from 50% to 15% in this area is the major segment of this project. Besides the pipelines of outer areas, the authority will also lay those inside the houses so as to stop contamination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/24x7-water-supply-project-chandigarh-mc-to-sign-agreement-with-french-firm-101627244369699.html

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||CAT-3 installation found unviable at Chandigarh airport||The long wait for a CAT-3 instrument landing system (ILS) at the Chandigarh International Airport has ended in authorities finding it unviable.With obstructions in the airfield, installation of the system is not possible, which means cancellation of flights amid heavy fog in the winter will continue.A radio navigation system, ILS provides pilots short-range guidance to land in poor visibility conditions. Over the years, fog and inclement weather have been hitting operations at the Chandigarh airport every winter.An aircraft requires at least 100-metre visibility to land safely. At present, the airport has a CAT-2 system, which works only till as low as 350-metre visibility. The CAT-3 system permits flight operations even when visibility drops to as low as 50 metres.Sanjeev Vashisht, member of the Chandigarh International Airport Advisory Committee, said, “To install CAT-3 ILS, the air force first needs to remove some obstructions. In the present situation, this is not possible.”Ajay Bhardwaj, chief executive officer of the airport, said the remaining work on the CAT-2 system was completed and aircraft will be able to land when visibility was between 350metres and 800 metres. “Upgrade of CAT-1 ILS is 60% completed. It will be ready before winter and will be used when visibility is between 550 metres and 1,200 metres.”While the Airport Authority of India (AAI) controls the functioning of the civil terminal in partnership with Punjab and Haryana, the runway operation and air traffic control is under the Chandigarh Air Force station.Was in the works for two yearsEarlier allowing flight operations only till 6pm, the airport started round-the-clock landings in April 2019, with a wider runway and CAT-2 system in place.Back then, all stakeholders, including the civil aviation ministry, Indian Air Force (IAF) and AAI, had agreed to install the much-needed CAT-3 ILS at the airport to facilitate flight seamless operations.The AAI board of directors even approved allotment of work to Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division, but the agency eventually failed to get permission from the defence ministry.A month before, taking note of a 2015 petition on infrastructural deficiencies at the airport, the Punjab and Haryana high court had also directed the Chief of Defence Staff, departments of civil aviation and military affairs, defence ministry, AAI and other stakeholders to examine and decide on installation of the advanced ILS.The directions had come after the department of military affairs submitted that the installation of CAT-3 ILS will entail demolition and relocation of most of functional infrastructure of a military airfield as well as national air defence assets. This would be detrimental to the operational needs of the IAF, military flying and national air defence, the court was informed. The case remains sub-judice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cat3-installation-found-unviable-at-chandigarh-airport-101627244129664.html
26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Mann Ki Baat: PM appreciates Chandigarh vendor for encouraging residents to get Covid shot||For his initiative on encouraging people to get vaccinated, a city-based street-vendor, Sanjay Rana, who sells chhole bhature in Sector 29, received words of appreciation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his radio programme “Mann ki baat” on Sunday.Modi in his broadcast said, “In Chandigarh’s Sector 29, Sanjay Rana ji runs a food stall and sells chhole bhature on cycle. To eat this delicious chhole bhature for free, you will have to show [proof] that you have taken the Covid-19 vaccine on the same day. It is said that for the welfare of the society more than money, the commitment to serve others and a sense of duty are much more required. Our Sanjay brother has proved this right.”Rana, 45, a resident of Ram Darbar, thanked Modi for highlighting his initiative: “It is a great honour for me to be recognised by the PM for this initiative.” Stating that it was his six-year-old niece’s idea, Rana said, “One day, she came to me and suggested we should start offering free meals to encourage people to get vaccinated. I liked the idea very much and immediately started the offer.”A plate of chhole bhature costs ₹40, but Rana said that he offers free meals to 25-30 people every day. “I will continue the offer in the future also, particularly now that my efforts have been recognised.”He said that he now gave more priority to customers who had been vaccinated. “My shop is famous in the whole area by the name of Cycle Wale Cholle Bhature. Many famous people of the city also come to me for it.”Notably, the efforts of Rana in encouraging people to get jabbed first came to public notice after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore tweeted about him. It was then picked up by the local media which reported on Rana’s initiative.Badnore on July 10 had tweeted: “Hats off to the spirit of #Chandigarh hawker! My heart filled with gratitude to see his bit of duty towards his country and the extent of awareness this man has favouring #vaccination and offering free #CholaeBhatura to all those who get vaccinated.”Rana said he has been told by the UT officials that the administrator has also expressed desire to eat his chhole bhature: “I am told he will come tomorrow to have chhole bhature from my stall.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-appreciates-chandigarh-vendor-for-encouraging-residents-to-get-covid-shot-101627243828900.html

The survey regarding the implementation of the project has already been completed and the MC has decided to start from Madanpura village.Talking about the project, deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi said, “We had noticed that houses in villages did not have proper identification or addresses, which makes it difficult for a person coming from outside to locate them. Also, this numbering system will help in the smart city concept in the future. We will start the project from Madanpura village.”Bedi said that at present the house numbering was either based upon the name of the owner or a haphazard manner. The MC will simplify it as it is followed in Chandigarh. “We will also try to give proper lane numbers along with house numbers somewhat on the patterns of Chandigarh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-to-allot-house-lane-numbers-in-villages-on-chandigarh-pattern-101627243588871.html
26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGIMER contractual staff suspend work over mistreatment of three workers||Nearly 700 contractual workers stopped work at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) for several hours on Sunday alleging mistreatment of three workers, who, they claimed, were implicated in a theft case by a junior resident. The contractual workers started gathering around 8am and suspended work in the emergency and other centres of the hospital till about 2.30pm. They also submitted a complaint against the junior resident of the cardiac centre, a constable and an assistant sub-inspector. In a complaint to PGIMER director and Chandigarh senior superintendent of police, the contractual workers submitted that on July 24, three workers, including hospital attendant Virender Kumar and two sanitary attendants named Chinki and Rahul, were working at the cardiac centre.Around 10:30pm, a resident doctor claimed that his mobile phone was missing. He accused the three workers of theft and called the police who took them to the police post. “After a while, the doctor got a message that his phone was lying in a table drawer. He might have kept it there and forgotten. The doctor left the police post, but the workers were kept in police custody and beaten up even after the phone was found,” the complaint stated. It was further stated that the cops didn’t question other staff members posted in the night shift and even made casteist remarks against the workers. PGI contract workers association president Sanjeev Kumar said, “The three were beaten brutally and are admitted at the trauma centre. We have a meeting with the administration, who have assured us that PGIMER will bear the cost of treatment and give them compensation.” He said the union wants action against the doctor and two policemen. Sector 11 station house officer Ranjodh Singh, said, “We have got the medical examination done and are looking into the compliant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pgimer-contractual-staff-suspend-work-over-mistreatment-of-three-workers-101627243529233.html
26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Uneasy calm in HP Cong after Virbhadra Singh’s death||While the BJP is gunning for the four byelections to be held in Himachal, the Congress is struggling to get its act together after the death of former six-time chief minister Virbhadra Singh – one of the party’s tallest leaders. The veteran leader’s death has not just left a deep void in state politics but has brought the Congress at a crossroads ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. After the 87-year-old scion of the Rampur-Bushahr royal family succumbed to post-Covid complications on July 8, infighting within the party intensified with different groups engaging in a covert struggle to take over the reins. Singh, whose career spanned across six decades, was said to be the party’s binding force, though a small faction remained opposed to him.Leaders vie for top posts While the party’s high command has not indicated that it wants to replace the incumbent state chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore – who was once a loyalist of the deputy leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, but had later switched sides – it is learnt that Congress legislature party leader Mukesh Agnihotri is keenly vying for the post of Pradesh Congress Committee president, as is Naina Devi legislator Ram Lal Thakur.Former minister Harsh Mahajan who was a close aide of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, and former urban development minister Sudhir Sharma are also lobbying for the post, while the names of five-time legislator Harshwardhan Chauhan and Congress senior leader Asha Kumari are also doing rounds.A person in the know of the party’s internal affairs, requesting anonymity, has said that the party could appoint Shimla rural legislator Vikramaditya Singh as the working president. Sanjay Dutt, the party’s co-in charge in Himachal Pradesh, has already given his feedback on the state of affairs in Himachal to the high command.Recently, GS Bali, a senior leader from Kangra and former transport minister had created ripples in the party circle by demanding that the next projected chief minister should be from the biggest district of the state.A few legislators including former Pradesh Congress Party chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu and senior leader Dhani Ram Shandil are vying for the post of Congress legislature party leader.BJP sprints ahead in campaigningThe party is also lagging behind in its campaign for the byelections, while the Jai Ram Thakur-led government has gone into election mode. Thakur recently visited Jubbal-Kotkhai and announced a sub-divisional office for the Jubbal and Kotkhai . The seat fell vacant after the demise of the former horticulture minister Narinder Bragta. Though the party is yet to officially announce its candidates, it has already projected Narendra’s son Chetan as its candidate. Former chief parliamentary secretary, Rohit Thakur, the grandson of former chief minister Thakur Ram Lal is touring Jubbal-Kotkhai but so far, no senior leaders have shared the dais with him.The party is also weighing its options for the Arki Vidhan Sabha seat that fell vacant after the death of Virbhadra Singh. It is likely that his wife, former Lok Sabha member Pratibha Singh, will contest from the segment. A few local leaders such as Rajendra Singh Thakur, son of former minister Hari Dass, and Mahila Congress chief Jenab Chandel, both from Arki, held closed-door meetings with Pratibha Singh. Virbhadra Singh’s core group is projecting Pratibha Singh as its successor. Congress Chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore has already made it clear that in Arki and Mandi parliamentary seats the party would give preference to Virbhadra Singh’s family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uneasy-calm-in-hp-cong-after-virbhadra-singh-s-death-101627243228972.html

After being closed due to the pandemic outbreak in March 2020, the schools had reopened in October 2020 for Classes 9 to 12 but were shut again in March 2021 as the cases started to surge with the onset of the second wave. The state government had recently issues directions to reopen all schools in view of the improving situation. Majority of the private schools will start at 7.30 or 7.40 am and will get over by 12.30 or 2pm.Safety strategiesAt several schools, students have been asked to come on alternate days to avoid crowding.Kundan Vidya Mandir School principal Navita Puri said, “We are reopening the school for students of classes 10 to 12. Adequate Covid safety measures have been put in place. Over 80% parents consented to send their wards to school. We are also receiving queries from parents of junior class students regarding reopening of school.”Parents have been asked to pick-and-drop their wards on their own from the school.Harmeet Kaur Waraich, principal of Nankana Sahib Public School, Gill Road, said, “At least 90% parents have agreed to send their wards to school. We have increased the number of rooms to accommodate students and one student will be seated on each bench to maintain social distancing. We will abide by all Covid-19 norms.”Govt schools to open from WednesdayGovernment schools, meanwhile, will reopen for physical classes from Wednesday as the state education department has directed them to hold parent-teacher meetings on July 26 and 27.For parent-teacher meetings, many schools have asked students to report roll-number wise or in alphabetic order and time slots have been allotted accordingly. During the meeting, school teachers will inform parents regarding the performance of their ward in the tests held in July and regarding the preparation for National Achievement survey.Pradeep Sharma, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Lalton Kalan, said, “During the parent-teacher meet, we will ask parents to submit the consent form and also motivate them to get their ward vaccinated if she/he is 18 years or above. We will also ensure that social distancing is maintained when the school reopens on July 28.

We have decided to raise an agitation against the decision. Banning plastic carry bags is not a solution to the problem and we have been taking up the matter since 2016. The MC should work on solid waste management and the industry will also support the civic body in the same. Like the union government, the state government should allow plastic carry bags with width up to 50 microns.”“There are 1,800 manufacturers and traders in the state. If the MC bans single-use plastic including, carry bags, the industry will suffer losses of thousands of crores. It will also lead to large-scale unemployment and result in loss to the government as its revenue collection through GST will be affected. The banned bags are also being supplied from other states. How is the government planning to stop them? The government and the MC should review the decision. We, along with our workers and families, will stage a peaceful protest outside the office of MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal in large numbers on July 31,” said Batra.Puneet Makhija, general secretary of Kesar Ganj Plastic Merchant Association, said rather than banning plastic carry bags, the government should install dustbins in the markets and work on managing the waste. Enforcement should be there to prevent the dumping of garbage in the open.One of the MC officials, requesting anonymity, said this will again put pressure on the government ahead of assembly elections, which will further affect the drive.Despite repeated attempts, mayor Balkar Sandhu remained unavailable for comments.Ban on plastic carry bags must save the environment: SeechewalEnvironmentalist and member of NGT monitoring committee Balbir Seechewal said that plastic carry bags need to be banned. “Apart from damaging the environment, the plastic waste also chokes sewer lines and pollutes the water bodies. Directions have been issued to the MC and PPCB to impose the ban, but they have failed to do so. The matter will be raised in the next meeting of the NGT monitoring committee,” he said.MC general house approves resolutionEven as the civic body is struggling to impose a ban on plastic carry bags, the MC general house had approved a resolution to ban single-use plastic in the city during its meeting on July 14. An MC health branch official, requesting anonymity, said the department is yet to finalize the list of items that have to be banned. The resolution has been approved just to complete a formality under the ‘Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge 2021-22, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ban-on-plastic-bags-ludhiana-industry-to-raise-agitation-on-july-31-101627242929597.html

In April this year, she found out that her husband is a drug addict. She tried to convince him to give up drugs but instead of supporting her, the in-laws started harassing her. Her brother-in-law also touched her inappropriately during a heated argument, the woman told the police.She said that when she complained to her parents, her husband apologised and promised to make amends.

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana mulls giving marks to Class 12 students for planting trees||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday announced that his government is toying with the idea of motivating students to plant trees by giving 10 additional marks to Class 12 students in final assessment. Addressing people on the occasion of state-level Van Mahotsav held through video conferencing, Khattar cited the example of Philippines where it is mandatory for every student to plant trees in order to get their graduation degree. Khattar said that in a bid to encourage students to plant trees in Haryana too, a possibility of granting at least 10 additional marks to class 12 students in final assessment is being explored by the education department so as to motivate students to plant more and more trees. Under the Paudhgiri Abhiyan, ₹50 is given as an incentive every six months to the children studying from classes 6 to 12 who take care of their planted sapling for three years. Calling upon the people of state to take “green pledge” by planting at least one tree during their lifetime to increase the green cover, Khattar said protecting the environment has always remained the utmost priority of his government. “This year we have set a target of planting 3 crore saplings. I would urge each one of you to become a part of the state government’s plantation campaign to ensure the betterment of mother earth’s heath,” Khattar said. Quoting “matsya-purana”, the chief minister said: “A pond equals ten wells, a reservoir equals ten ponds, while a son equals ten reservoirs, and a tree equals ten sons.” The chief minister said that the forest area of Haryana should be 20 per cent of the total geographical area because Haryana is a plain state. Being a plain and agricultural state, the notified forest area in Haryana is only 3.52 per cent and the total tree covered area is 3.62 per cent. “Thus our total forest and tree covered area is around 7 per cent. To increase it to 20 per cent, it is very important to plant more and more trees. This is a collective responsibility and keeping this in mind, special schemes are being implemented by forest and education department,” he said. e-Paudhshala mobile app launched On this occasion, Khattar launched citizen-centric e-Paudhshala mobile application for free distribution of plants from government nurseries. He said that all the saplings to be distributed to the panchayats under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan launched by the Prime Minister and the saplings to be distributed under our Paudhgiri Yojana will be distributed through this mobile application. “All citizens and government offices can get saplings from the nursery of the forest department by placing their demand through this app. The mobile application is available on both android and iPhone platforms,” he said. He said that through this application, anyone can check the availability of plants of their choice in the nearest nursery and the app also has a navigation facility to reach the nursery. Citizens can click pictures of plantations and share them with the Haryana forest department through this app. Through this app, the important role and contribution of citizens in making Haryana green will be acknowledged and recorded, Khattar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-mulls-giving-marks-to-class-12-students-for-planting-trees-101627242568655.html

Earlier, the protesters raising slogans against the state government held a protest march towards the minister’s house. Heavy police force and anti-riot vehicles were deployed outside the minister’s house.“Before coming to power, the Congress had promised to regularise all contractual employees. It has been more than four years but our demand has not been met,” said SSA Non-Teaching Staff (Mid-Day-Meal) Union’s state president Asish Julaha. He said, “In 2018, the state government regularised 8,866 contractual teachers working under the SSA, but the decision on nearly 1,000 non-teaching staff remained pending. We will intensify our struggle if our demand is not met in the coming days.” They lifted their protest only after Soni assured them that their “genuine demand” was being considered by a committee of ministers. Soni said, “The government is already considering their demand which is genuine.

The board has admitted to have faced a daily loss of ₹70 lakh as the unit number 7 has been non-operational for months. The inquiry was launched at least 10 days ago to ascertain the reasons behind the delay and ensuing losses as the unit was to be restarted on March 3. A private company was given the maintenance work of the unit in October 2020 with a timeframe of six months. It is still not clear as how long will it take to resume the operations, officials said. The Bhakra dam has 10 power generation units. With another unit also under repair, only eight are in functional at present. The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) was keen on restarting the unit owing to peak load season in June. The private company that was given the work order for ₹1.67 crore has maintained that it was unable to make the unit number 7 operational due to some snag in the parts as an entire turbine had to be dismantled twice. “For repair work of the parts, a process to incur additional work cost of ₹30 lakh was initiated, to which the board’s finance department raised objections. It asked the power generation department to complete the work as per the provisions and rates agreed to in the initial tender,” said a BBMB official. Another board official said, “Due to the delay, a penalty of ₹34 lakh penalty imposed on the private company. It is not practically possible to run all 10 generation units as the basic function of the Bhakra dam is to regulate flow of water and power generation depends on the amount of water flowing from the penstocks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bbmb-incurs-rs-100-crore-loss-due-to-delay-in-power-unit-repair-starts-probe-101627242151313.html

Talking to the media before an executive committee meeting of the party in Ludhiana, the three laws have not come into effect despite being passed in both the houses of Parliament. “Therefore, I will urge the representatives of the farmer unions to begin talks so that people protesting at the Delhi borders could return to their homes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always been a supporter of farmers and has done a lot of work for the agriculture sector.Interestingly, mediapersons and police personnel were asked to vacate the hall as soon as the meeting began. A party leader said the move was taken to avoid any controversy as matters such as infighting in the state and district units were discussed during the meeting.‘Sidhu’s elevation a diversionary tactic’ Sharma said that elevation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief was a tactic to deviate the attention of people of Punjab from the mis-governance of the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress Government.“Illegal mining and drug smuggling are still rampant in the state. The industry is reeling under power cuts and rising electricity tariffs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/renew-talks-to-end-impasse-on-3-laws-punjab-bjp-chief-to-farmers-101627242089697.html

26-07-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers don’t allow OP Chautala to speak at Khatkar toll plaza||Former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief Om Prakash Chautala was not allowed to address the farmers at Jind’s Khatkar toll plaza on Sunday. Chautala urged the protesting farmers multiple times to give him mike but Khera Khap president Satbir Pehalwan turned down his request. The 86-year-old INLD leader left the venue in a huff and reached Baddowal toll plaza where he was received well. Khatkar toll plaza falls under the Uchana assembly segment and Baddowal comes under Narwana. The INLD leader had represented both the constituencies in the past and were considered his strongholds. Pehalwan said their stand against political figures was clear from day one of the farm agitation. “Chautala was not an exception for us as he also has political ambitions. We will not allow any leader to speak from our stage. The politicians can extend support but we will not allow them to speak from the main stage. We briefed Chautala about the same but he was mounting pressure to let him address the gathering,” the khera khap president said. Khattar toll plaza falls under Uchana constituency which Chautala had represented before he was convicted in the teachers’ recruitment scam. Now, his grandson Dushyant Chautala, who is deputy chief minister in the BJP-JJP coalition government, represents the constituency. Speaking at Baddowal toll plaza, Chautala said the BJP government will have to repeal three farm laws and the Union government’s countdown has started. “This is not an agitation of farmers and labourers but of all the people. The BJP government had brought these laws to snatch farmers’ land and hand over the same to big businessmen,” he said. After being released from the Tihar jail, the INLD patriarch has been visiting toll plazas in Haryana to extend support to the farmers protesting against the three laws. Farmers deface Khattar, Dushyant pictures After staging a showdown against minister of state Anoop Dhanak, farmers protesting against three farm laws defaced the pictures of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala on the welcome signboard outside Uklana town in Hisar district.Dhanak, a JJP leader, had reached Uklana at 8.45am on Sunday, nearly an hour and 15 minutes before the scheduled time to take part in a tree plantation programme, but scores of farmers reached there and showed him black flags.Seeing the tense situation, police detained two local farm leaders, Satish Bithmara and Satish Jangra, for some time. In the second incident, farmers protested the visit of BJP leader Sonali Phogat at Kajla village in Hisar’s Agroha. Amid heavy security, she and other BJP workers left the meeting. Meanwhile, farmers held a protest outside the venue of a block-level meeting of the BJP at Salwan village in Karnal on Sunday. A heavy police force was deputed and barricades installed near the venue. The protest remained peaceful and the farmers ended their sit-in after the meeting was over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-don-t-allow-op-chautala-to-speak-at-khatkar-toll-plaza-101627241429846.html

26-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Bamiyan boys||When you hear the word Bamiyan, what do you see in your mind’s eye?May be, the Buddhas of Bamiyan.These were two monumental statues of Gautama Buddha, dating from the 6th century and carved into a sandstone cliff in the Bamiyan valley of Afghanistan. In 2001, both statues were destroyed by the Taliban government.Cut to 2021. About a dozen young men are picnicking on the grass, hundreds of miles away from Bamiyan, in a park in central Delhi. They all are natives of that same Bamiyan region, and all have seen the Bamiyan Buddhas. “We have seen the place where the Buddhas used to be,” clarifies one of them.Lots of Afghans have left their homeland for fear of violence, and many have found a home in Delhi—some lanes in Lajpat Nagar and Bhogal could be mistaken for mohallas in Kabul or Kandahar. These young men are some of them; they live in Malviya Nagar. They have been following the news of the Taliban’s looming comeback in Afghanistan. “We are tensed about our relatives and friends,” says one of the men.Sitting in a semicircle, each person appears to be a living embodiment of his own village or town in Afghanistan. Being with them is like being transported into their land. The men gamely agree to reveal where they grew up in Afghanistan (which wasn’t necessarily the Bamiyan region), and what is their dream as they build a new life in Delhi.Salman Rahmani, 20 years old, coming from Shibar village: “I want to be a doctor.”Shams, 22, from Parwan province: “I want to marry… I want to marry a particular girl I have known for some time.”Ahmadi, 20, from Kabul: “I have no ambition.”Raees, 21, from Samangan province: “I want to be an engineer who works with cars.”Khal Padshah, 30, from Turkman village: “I’m not young anymore, but I’m still single. My dream is to get married.”Humayun Muhammadi, 25, from Kaloo village. “I want to be a motivational speaker.”Niyaz Ali, 40, from Wazirabad district: “I have four sons, I have no dreams.”Mustafa Azhar, 24, from Kaloo: “I’m a communist, so I want to be happy and see others happy.”Ziauddian, 26, from Shibar: “I hope to be a football player.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-bamiyan-boys-101627240344016.html

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday formed a five-member committee to plan the Brahmin outreach, issues and strategy, said people in the party aware of the developments.The effort to woo Brahmins (an upper caste) comes days after the BSP held a Brahmin conference in Ayodhya on Friday (July 23).Former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday held a meeting at the SP’s state headquarters in Lucknow with five prominent Brahmin leaders in the party. Senior party leader and former UP assembly speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, former cabinet ministers Abhishek Mishra and Manoj Pandey and former SP MLAs Sanatan Pandey and Santosh Pandey were the five present at the meeting. The leaders at the meeting decided to launch tours and conferences in different parts of the state to connect with the upper caste. The series of conferences will begin on August 24 in Ballia, where Abhishek Mishra recently inaugurated a Parshuram temple under the programme that he launched nearly a year ago with the SP to establish a shrine dedicated to Parshuram in each of the 75 districts of the state.Lord Parshuram was a Brahmin warrior saint who many Brahmins worship.The SP’s Brahmin conferences will attempt to tell people that all communities were taken care of when the Samajwadi Party was in power while they were being harassed under the present government, said a senior party leader.Manoj Pandey, who was the religious endowment minister in the previous Akhilesh government, had launched the Shravan Yatra to facilitate pilgrimages at government expense.While the SP government had declared Parshuram Jayanti a holiday, the present government withdrew it soon after assuming office.The SP will also tell people about the work its government did for the improvement of Sanskrit schools in the state. The party will also highlight the fact that it gave tickets to 42 Brahmins in the 2012 UP assembly elections and 23 of them won.Akhilesh Yadav and Abhishek Mishra both tweeted a picture of Sunday’s meeting.Though Akhilesh captioned it “SP office”, Abhishek tweeted: “Thanks to the national president (Akhilesh Yadav) for giving so much time. We all discussed several important subjects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/samajwadi-party-to-renew-brahmin-outreach-hold-conferences-from-augustend-101627240348911.html

The force behind the ₹2.5-crore project is chief minister’s good governance associate Pankhuri Gupta, who raised funds for the hospital by roping in NGOs, social activists and philanthropists. “The portable hospital project required ₹2.5 crore. I contacted different NGOs for funds, and recently the American India Foundation agreed to provide the required funds and now the hospital is being set up,” Gupta said. The hospital will have an intensive care unit and ventilators to treat critical patients. The IIT Madras-incubated start-up Modulus Housing developed portable hospital units named ‘MediCAB’, initially launched in Wayanad district of Kerala. The unit has a prefabricated modular technology and telescopic frame for easy transportation. According to Gupta, the life of this hospital will be around 15 years and once the Covid-19 subsides, it can be utilised as a normal hospital. Dr Shailender Mamgain, chief medical officer, Kaithal, said the hospital will strengthen the medical infrastructure in the district. He said the staff — a paediatrician, two medical officers and eight staff nurses — to run the hospital will be recruited through the National Health Mission (NHM). If required, a Neonatology Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be added to the hospital as there is a possibility that the third wave may target the children, Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/100bed-portable-hospital-to-be-operational-soon-in-kaithal-101627240290897.html

A review report confirms the audit shortcoming of calculating the fee. The social justice and empowerment department is not releasing funds saying audit reviews are not accepted.

Two vials of Covishield, which is administered free by the state, were recovered from Mithun Mondal, the accused, said Vaibhav Tiwari, superintendent of police, Bauipur police district. “Some police officers posed as consumers and nabbed the accused. The Covishield vials seized from him appear to be genuine but we have sent those for a test. The accused has named some people. We have also found some documents. A probe is on,” Tiwari told the media. Police are trying to find out how many people bought vaccines from Mondal. It has been found that he vaccinated some people at a house in Sonarpur. The arrest came amid a shortage of vaccines in some districts. Mondal was working as a coordinator for the vaccination programme. It is suspected that he stole the vials from a health centre in the Diamond Harbour area of South 24 Parganas. Police officers probing the case said he stole vials from unused stocks and later made entries in the registers, showing the vials as used. As a result, people he vaccinated for money received certificates.“Frauds like these surface because of the mismatch in demand and supply,” said minister Firhad Hakim. Accusing the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh said, “The Centre is regularly sending vaccines to Bengal. There is a crisis because TMC leaders are selecting the recipients while common people are being deprived.”Mondal’s arrest comes a month after the Kolkata Police arrested Debanjan Deb, the imposter who posed as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer posted at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and held at least two vaccination camps for the general public where an antibiotic was allegedly used on a few hundred people. Deb has been charged under several sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 307 (attempt to murder). His father is a retired officer of the state excise department. The police seized stamp papers, forged documents of various government departments from Deb’s residence. During interrogation, Deb told the police that he wrote a letter to the Serum Institute of India as well, asking for Covishield vaccines. A 10-member special investigation team (SIT) of the Kolkata Police is probing the case. Deb has so far confessed about two vaccination camps. One was held for students and teachers at City College North in the Bowbazar area while the other was held for local residents of Kasba in south Kolkata. Nobody received any certificate or intimation on their mobile phones. TMC Lok Sabha MP from Jadavpur and popular actress Mimi Chakraborty blew Deb’s cover by informing the police when she felt suspicious after getting a jab at the camp in Kasba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/health-worker-held-in-bengal-for-stealing-free-vaccines-giving-jabs-for-money-101627240169243.html

One of them tried to snatch a gun from a police official and in defence, other officials had to open fire at the drug peddler. Rest five peddlers immediately ran away and managed to escape. Police officials recovered 72 grams of suspected brown sugar from one person. There is a possibility that more amount of drugs were available with the peddlers who escaped,” Barua said.

Phoolan Devi, who belonged to the Nishad community and was elected MP on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Mirzapur in eastern Uttar Pradesh in 1996 and 1999, was shot dead at the gates of her official bungalow in New Delhi on July 25, 2001, when she was a sitting Lok Sabha memberThe supporters of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by Bihar animal husbandry minister Mukesh Sahni organised protests in various districts of Uttar Pradesh after the administration refused to grant permission to the party to install statues of Phoolan Devi in 18 districts of UP. The police detained the supporters of VIP in these 18 districts, including Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Agra, the party claimed.Terming the police action as a disrespect to Phoolan Devi, VIP’s state unit president Lautan Ram Nishad said the party had decided to launch a statewide protest over the issue.The members of the Nishad, Majhwar, Kewat, Bind, Kashyap and Mallah communities were being harassed by the BJP government, he said. VIP would also launch a movement seeking reservation for the Nishad community in government jobs, he said. The party has also decided to contest the 2022 assembly elections in UP on its own strength, he added.Hitting back at the VIP, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Jai Prakash Nishad said VIP had no support base in Uttar Pradesh but it was trying to create confusion among the Nishad community on Phoolan Devi’s death anniversary.“The members of the Nishad community know that the BJP government led by Yogi Adityanath has launched several welfare schemes for the community,” he said. The BJP created a five-member state fishermen’s cell on July 17 to mobilise the support of Nishads in the assembly election. Jai Prakash Nishad, who has been appointed state convenor of the fishermen cell, said the BJP government constructed a grand park in the name of Nishad Raj at Shringverpur in Prayagraj. The community will support the BJP in the assembly election, he said. In an apparent bid to woo Nishads, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav unveiled the statue of Nishad community leader Manohar Lal Nishad in Unnao on July 22.Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Vishambhar Prasad Nishad said since its launch, the SP was fighting for the rights of the backward community.“The Samajwadi Party government not only withdrew cases against Phoolan Devi (in 1994) but also sent her to the Lok Sabha from Mirzapur (in 1996 and 1999). The party ensured a respectable cremation for Phoolan Devi after her killing in Delhi on July 25, 2001. Each year, the party organises programmes on her birth and death anniversaries across the state. To misguide the Nishad community, the BJP leaders are supporting VIP president Mukesh Sahani and Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) party chief Dr Sanjay Nishad. The Samajwadi Party will get the support of the Nishads in the assembly election,” he said.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) state unit president Bhim Rajbhar said party chief Mayawati launched several schemes for the welfare of the “suppressed communities,” including Nishads, when the BSP was in power in UP.Under the BSP government, they not only got fishery rights but were also allotted agricultural land for their livelihood, he said.An ally of the BJP, Nishad party chief Dr Sanjay Nishad said the supporters of the party organised programmes across the state to mark the 20th death anniversary of Phoolan Devi. “She took up the gun to fight for the rights of the weaker sections in the society. When the Nishad party comes to power in UP, it will set up a women’s self-defence centre in the name of Phoolan Devi. The effort of the rival parties to divide the Nishad community will prove futile as they are united under the banner of the Nishad Party,” he said.Jaalvanshi Morcha national president Gyanendra Nishad said the supporters of the morcha organised a yatra across UP to mobilise the Nishad community. “We also visited Shekhpur Gudha Ka Purwa, native village of Phoolan Devi (in Jalaun district of Uttar Pradesh), to meet her mother Moola Devi. We will launch a movement seeking reservation for the community in government jobs,” he said.Phoolan Devi’s husband Umed Singh, who runs Eklavya Sena, said if Phoolan had belonged to the upper caste, the ruling political party would have installed her statues and constructed temples. “Rather she is abused as a dacoit and bandit queen,” he said.The Eklavya Sena will oppose the use of her name for political gains, he said.A political observer SK Srivastava said the boatmen community (Nishads, Majhwars, Kewats, Binds, Kashyaps and Mallahs) constituted 18% of the OBC votes in UP.Along with organising the death anniversary of Phoolan Devi, the political parties were trying to woo the community whose votes will be decisive in around 160 assembly constituencies in east and Central UP in the 2022 assembly elections, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/phoolan-devi-s-20th-death-anniversary-parties-vie-to-woo-nishad-community-in-up-101627239449493.html

Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year in protest against the three laws. Out of them, a small group of 200 farmers are now staging a protest at Jantar Mantar in central Delhi after getting special permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-insulting-farmers-it-must-repeal-agri-laws-says-priyanka-101627239448325.html

Whatever may happen and whatever cost we may have to pay, we wouldn’t let these laws be implemented in Punjab,” Sukhbir told PTI in an interview.In September last year, Sukhbir’s wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal quit as Union minister in protest against the legislations.The protesting farmers claim these laws will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.‘Alliance with BSP permanent’ Talking about the SAD’s new alliance with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Badal said the alliance between the two parties is permanent and that the Akali Dal’s story with the BJP was over.On the party’s future course of action, Sukhbir said the SAD is talking to various regional parties so that they all can come on one platform before the 2024 general elections.“There is a need for regional forces to get together. Regional forces are more connected to the ground and have better understanding of the people. We have been talking to various parties. Regional parties should come together and form a front before the 2024 general elections. And I am sure before 2024, this front will emerge as very strong force,” he said.Sukhbir further said it would be a second front rather than a third front as the main opposition Congress is no more a pan-India party. The BJP will be the new front’s main target, he said. ‘Farm laws will be main issue in assembly polls’ In the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab, Sukhbir said farm laws will be the main issue for the SAD. “If the party is voted to power, we will provide government job to a family member of all those farmers who lost their lives during the ongoing protest against the laws. Besides it will provide free education to the children of deceased farmers and pension to the parents of those who died young,” Sukhbir said.He also said the party will bet big on new and young faces and will try to field as many women as possible in the assembly elections slated for early next year.On a question about reports of alleged snooping on politicians, activists and journalists using Pegasus spyware, Sukhbir termed it an attack on democracy and demanded establishment of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) headed by an opposition MP to probe the matter.“This entire snooping episode is an attack on the Constitution, democracy and rights of the people. It is completely unethical and a JPC should be formed headed by an opposition MP to investigate it,” Sukhbir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/regional-parties-should-form-national-front-for-2024-lok-sabha-polls-sukhbir-101627239148245.html
26-07-2021||Lucknow||Barring farmers, all in Uttar Pradesh to have smart prepaid meters in next 3 years||Barring farmers, all other electricity consumers in Uttar Pradesh, like in most other states, will necessarily have prepaid smart meters on their premises in next two-three years with the facility of recharging these meters through a mobile phone under the Centre’s new Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme.The Union power ministry has issued the office memorandum to states, explaining the scheme to them in detail and informing them of the terms and conditions required to avail the new initiative having a budgetary outlay of ₹3,03,758 crore. “President’s sanction is conveyed for the implementation of the “Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme—A Reforms-based and Results-linked Scheme” with the objective of improving the quality and reliability of power supply to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally-efficient distribution sector,” says the Office Memorandum received here by the chief secretary and the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) chairman offices, among others.The scheme aims to reduce the AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% and average cost of supply (ACS)-average revenue realization (ARR) gap to zero by 2024-25.In order to attain the key objective of loss reduction in electricity distribution for installation of prepaid smart meters in the mission mode in the first phase in (i) all electricity divisions of AMRUT cities with AT&C losses above 15% (ii) all Union Territories (iii) MSMEs and all other industrial and commercial consumers (iv) all government offices at Block level and above (v) other areas with high losses.“Prepaid smart metering system with communion features are important interventions in reducing distribution losses in the utilities and automatic measurement of energy flows and energy accounting as well as auditing without any human intervention,” Union power secretary Alok Kumar said over phone.States, according to him, and as also given in the Office Memorandum, would be incentivized for deployment of prepaid smart meters by December, 2023 at the rate of 7.5% of the cost per consumer meter worked out for the whole project or ₹450 per consumer meter, whichever lower, would be provided to states for installing meters within the targeted timeline in a mission mode. Moreover, these prepaid smart meters remain connected with advanced information and communication technology (ICT) like artificial intelligence, machine learning and block chain technology making it possible for discom to analyse data scientifically every month and take informed decision on loss reduction, demand forecast etc.The scheme, however, exempts farmers from the requirement of installing prepaid smart meters on electricity connections of their tubewells/pumping sets.“Looking at the scattered nature of agriculture connections and their remoteness from the habitations as well as their proposed solarisation, the smart meters need not be installed on agriculture connections,” clarifies the Office Memorandum.To avail funding under the scheme, discoms are required to prepare an action plan for strengthening their distribution system and improving its performance by way of various reform measures that also include segregation of agriculture feeders for which alone ₹20,000 crore have been earmarked under the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/barring-farmers-all-in-uttar-pradesh-to-have-smart-prepaid-meters-in-next-3-years-101627239096569.html

We are moving ahead with his leadership. We have an arrangement where the parliamentary board (officially) declares this. I cannot do this. But there is no scope to think about anyone else,” Nadda said.When asked whether the Union Minister of State Shripad Naik, whose name has also been doing the rounds, was in contention, Nadda sidestepped the question and chose to praise the work Naik was doing in Delhi.“He is doing a very good job in Delhi and he is taking care of things... Everybody has interests, but the interest has to be taken care of by the party. He has been assigned a job in Delhi, which he is doing very well,” he said.Naik, who was among the earliest leaders of the BJP and among the four elected as MLAs on a BJP ticket the first time BJP opened its account in the state in 1994, had earlier expressed his willingness to take the reins of the party “if the party were to give him the task” but said he wasn’t hankering for it.Instead, Nadda said, the party has made giant strides from 2017.“I am optimistic as far as the party in Goa is concerned... I can say with joy that the Goa BJP from 2017 has grown ahead in 2021. The party has taken a big leap in the last four and a half years. Structurally, the BJP has become a formidable force. Party office bearers and MLAs are full of confidence and ready to serve people,” Nadda who was addressing a press conference to culminate his two-day visit, said.“A big number joined us from the Congress. They have felt good after joining the BJP and they have assimilated themselves totally and fully. They have praised the functioning of the party. That makes me more optimistic. It has made me more confident,” he said.The BJP, through engineering defections, ‘imported’ thirteen MLAs from the Congress and two from the MGP to bring the party’s tally to 27 in the 40 member house from a mere 13 it was elected with.Addressing possibles fissures within the BJP between the old guard and those recently inducted, Nadda said the party was eager to settle everyone’s desires.“In political parties, leaders may have some desires. Settling those desires is the work of the party, which is a natural process and will continue as a process. We will do that,” he said. Nadda also took potshots at the Congress calling it a ‘rudderless boat’ that lacked direction.“From Delhi to Goa, Congress is a rudderless boat and the sailor does not know which side to sail. So this is the situation with the Congress. It does not know the winds also, where the winds are blowing,” he said.“I am told that the opposition led by Congress has got no issue related to people that they want to raise. Therefore, they raise such issues (snooping). Second, as far as Parliament is concerned, we are ready for all kinds of discussions and we are going for discussions. But Congress, along with the opposition, is so dejected, they are so issueless that they do not know what to do,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pramod-sawant-to-be-bjp-s-face-in-goa-for-2022-jp-nadda-101627238129506.html
26-07-2021||Other||Three murders rock Sitapur||LUCKNOW: Two sensational crimes rocked Sitapur, adjoining the state capital, on Sunday, including the murder of a 35-year-old woman during a robbery and recovery of two bodies from a field. Police said both the incidents were reported under Talgaon police station limits. In the first incident, a group of armed miscreants sneaked into the house of a family in Agarpur village of Talgaon at around 4 am on Sunday. The miscreants attacked the family members with cane and iron rod when they woke up, and also opened fire on facing resistance. Sitapur additional superintendent of police (ASP), South, Rajiv Dixit said a woman identified as Vinita died after suffering bullet injury while her husband Ramhet, his brother Santosh and his wife Anita were injured in the attack with rods. Dixit said some labourers, who had worked in the house, were suspected of leaking information about the family. He said one suspect Desraj had been taken into custody and was being interrogated after registering an FIR of loot, murder and attempt to murder against three unidentified miscreants. The ASP said two bodies of a 35-year-old unidentified man and a 45-year-old woman were recovered from a cane field in Ratnapur Gadi village of Talgaon at around 10 am. He said primary examination of the bodies suggested that they were murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and more than two people were suspected to be involved in the crime. A local informed that the woman’s body was beheaded and her head was found nearly 10 metres away from the body. He said the crime scene clearly showed signs of struggle by the woman, as her torn clothes, slippers and other belongings were found lying scattered around the spot. The man’s body was found nearly 50 metres from the woman’s body, he added. The ASP said a dog squad and a team of forensic experts had been called on the spot to collect evidence and help in cracking the case. Besides, the police were making efforts to ascertain the identities of the two deceased after registering an FIR of double murder, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-murders-rock-sitapur-101627237828196.html

The meeting will also be attended by senior officials of the Public Works Department, a portfolio that comes under Jain.“Circle officials in PWD were asked to identify 500 locations and submit the list to the chief minister’s office. The locations have been identified. Most of them are government schools and parks. The polls will be 100-feet high and the flags will be visible from a long distance. At in the five locations, preliminary work began last week,” said the official.The Delhi government presented its seventh annual budget on March 9, and termed it a “deshbhakti (patriotism) budget”, in view of the nation celebrating 75th Independence Day this year. It announced a range of programmes and measures to evoke patriotism in citizens and Sisodia, who is also the finance minister of Delhi, proposed ₹45 crore for installing the national flag at 500 different locations across Delhi. The government also allocated ₹20 crore for events to be held on themes such as Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar.The flag project, however, was delayed in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/100feet-high-national-flags-to-come-up-at-five-places-in-delhi-before-august-15-101627237769503.html
26-07-2021||Delhi||Cinemas get ready for patrons, bookings to open in a couple of days||Cinema owners in the city on Sunday said they will take a couple of days to get ready for the patrons and open bookings after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed cinema halls and multiplexes to operate from Monday after remaining shut for more than three months under a lockdown enforced in April in view of an unprecedented spike in Covid-19 cases.Staff at several cinemas and multiplexes was cleaning and disinfecting the auditoriums even though ticket counters and online bookings stay shut.“We will open at the earliest as per operational readiness,” said a statement by INOX, which did not elaborate much on future plans.Devang Sampat, CEO, Cinepolis, said the multiplex chain will start opening in the next few days. “We will start opening in 3-4 days . Right now, we are preparing our premises in line with Covid protocols. All our staff has been vaccinated, and we will be following all the rules. Opening with 50% capacity is not a constraint. We would require a ramp up period for the audience to know and for movies to start releasing,” said Sampat.He added that a number of films were lined up for viewers. “There are at least 30 Hollywood films which are ready to release, there are around 40 Bollywood titles and many regional titles,” said Sampat.An executive at another multiplex chain, who asked not be named, said: “The operational costs are too high. We have to be slightly more confident about the footfall. The industry has already faced heavy losses in the past several months. Risks have to be calculated. Even though we are trying our best to start at the earliest.”Cinema halls, multiplexes and auditoriums will be allowed to run with 50% seating capacity, according to the DDMA order issued on Saturday. They have also been directed to ensure social distancing in the common areas, have provisions for hand sanitisation, ensure 100% mask compliance, maintain air conditioning under World Health Organization (WHO) standards, and take other Covid-19 appropriate measures.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said, “Indoor spaces without much ventilation, such as cinema halls and multiplexes, are high risk areas in terms of transmission of virus. People have to be extremely cautious and the theatre owners must ensure strict adherence to the regulations without any compromise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cinemas-get-ready-for-patrons-bookings-to-open-in-a-couple-of-days-101627237767564.html
26-07-2021||Delhi||More seats on Metro from Monday, but queues unlikely to get shorter||Queues outside Metro stations, which have often stretched for hundreds of metres in the past weeks, are likely to get slightly shorter from Monday with the Delhi Metro allowing passengers to occupy all the seats in each train, as it lifted the 50% cap on seating that was in place to ensure distancing inside coaches.However, standing is still not allowed inside trains, according to the guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday as part of its phased relaxations of curbs in place to thwart the spread of Covid-19.“In view of the revised guidelines issued by the government yesterday (July 24), wherein, travel in the Delhi Metro has been permitted from existing 50% of its seating capacity to 100% with ‘no standing’ travel from tomorrow (July 26) … DMRC would like to reiterate and make it clear that from Monday, even with these revised guidelines, a maximum 50 passengers per coach are permitted, as against 300 prior to Covid-19,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director at DMRC, in a statement.DDMA on Saturday allowed multiplexes, swimming pools, spas, auditoriums and entertainment parks to open in the Capital from Monday, and lifted seating limits on the Delhi Metro and public buses, effectively relaxing most restrictions after a decline in Covid-19 cases following a deadly fourth wave of infections.The statement added, “Entry to stations therefore [will] continue to be regulated. As a result, though the queues may reduce slightly, but they might still be there outside stations, especially during peak hours owing to the compliance and adherence to the Covid appropriate behaviour inside Metro premises as per government guidelines.”Vikas Yadav, 29, a frequent commuter on the Metro, said he was unsure if the updated Metro guidelines will have any impact on the queues outside stations on working days, especially during the peak hours. “On working days, the situation is certainly more stressful. One has to wait in queues outside stations such as Janpath or Rajiv Chowk for nearly an hour to enter the station in the evening hours. I am not sure if increasing from 50%seating capacity to 100% would make any visible difference in the queues outside metro stations,” said Yadav.Officials said the alternate seating aboard coaches was often violated. As a result, after being shut for a brief period in light of the fourth Covid-19 wave in Delhi in April, when Metro services were permitted to resume in June, authorities decided to regulate footfall inside stations itself to adhere to the 50% capacity rule, a move that led to serpentine queues outside stations.The same 50% cap on seating applied to public buses before the Saturday relaxations as well, but is much more difficult to implement in bus stands, which are unregulated and unguarded, said transport officials. “Buses were crowded even when the seating cap was in place. So, increasing it to 100% will not make any difference in this case. The rule is hardly followed during peak working hours,” said Radheshyam Kumar, a regular commuter on the 740 route connecting Uttam Nagar with Anand Vihar.HT travelled on public buses on several routes criss-crossing east, west, south and north Delhi between Friday and Sunday and witnessed passengers beyond sitting capacity in a few cases on the evening hours of Friday, which was a working day. On weekend days most buses could visibly adhere to the seating capacity rule.“The buses have a driver and a conductor. When seats are full, we have been directed to not open doors. But it gets difficult during working hours when you have a few seats and an open gate at a crowded bus stand. And a large number of people end up boarding the vehicle. There is no practical way to manage it,” said a bus driver who did not wish to be identified.A senior Delhi government official said, “We have come across instances of such violations and have taken the matter into consideration. Civil defence volunteers and home guards will be deployed in the crowded bus stands from Monday to regulate crowds and ensure that the seating capacity rule is adhered to.”(With inputs from Sadia Akhtar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/more-seats-on-metro-from-monday-but-queues-unlikely-to-get-shorter-101627237710008.html
26-07-2021||Delhi||Years after notification, Delhi’s land pooling plan still in limbo||Three years after the land pooling policy was notified, with an aim to develop 95 villages in Delhi in a planned manner, it is yet to be implemented, prompting residents to demand that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) address their concerns and set a time frame for its speedy execution.The policy, which was notified twice in 2013 and 2018, provides a road map for the planned development of the city’s urban extensions and meet the growing needs for housing. Nearly 1.7 million (17 lakh) dwelling units are proposed to come up in these 95 villages, which were urbanised for this policy in 2017.While hundreds of land owners have registered and agreed to pool over 6,500 hectares, the DDA is yet to operationalise the policy. The land owning agency is in the process of making changes to the policy and the Delhi Development Act, 1957, for its speedy implementation.Village residents say they want the DDA to execute the policy in a timebound manner, do away with the external development charges (EDC) — this has to be paid by land owners for laying infrastructure and developing the area—and address land ownership issues.Bhupender Bazad, president of the master plan committee of the Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, said, “It’s soon going to be decade since the policy was in the planning stages and it’s about time the DDA took concrete steps to execute it. Recently, we had a meeting with the agency, where it was decided that we will take back our land if the policy is not implemented in the next few months. The DDA should set a time frame and adhere by it.”According to the policy, land owners will have to pay the EDC for infrastructure development, but they are unhappy about this. Landowners say since they are anyway giving 40% of the land for infrastructure services such as parks, roads, social infrastructure, etc., they should not be asked to pay the EDC on top of that.Dharam Singh, a resident of Jhuljhuli village, said, “We are giving 40% of the land for infra development. Why should we pay external development charges as well? The DDA should do away with that clause, as village people don’t have the money to pay the EDC.”A senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “EDC is for the development of the area and landowners will be getting back developed land with proper services in place. This will only benefit them in the long run. Moreover, landowners can pay the EDC in five stages.”The consortium (association of land owners) will get 60% of the total pooled land for development, of which 53% will be residential; 5% commercial and 2% for public and semi-public facilities.The villagers also said they should have control of the gram sabha land — kept aside by owners for essential services of the village — and not the DDA.Paras Tyagi, who runs the Centre for Youth Culture and Law and Environment, a public policy research organisation working in the rural and urban villages of Delhi, said, “Under the policy, DDA will get control of the gram sabha land, which actually belongs to the village. Residents want that land to be utilised for the welfare of villagers and projects of the village. While new developments will come up in these urban villages, the DDA should also plan for the development of villages that pooled their land.”Pradeep Dagar, a resident of Dhansa village, said, “Both in land pooling and the green development area policies, the DDA should ensure that the gram sabha land is reserved for the development of the village. The land was given by our families for that reason alone and it essentially belongs to us.”But DDA officials say that is not possible. “Under the policy, we will be planning an entire sector for a stipulated population, which includes the population of the village as well. We will provide infrastructure for villages, where gram sabha land is available, within the sector. It will be an integrated plan,” said the senior DDA official quoted above.Another issue that land owners want the DDA to address is of joint ownership. “In most cases, land is jointly held by multiple members of a family. In case any of the joint owners refuses to participate in land pooling, then the others can’t pool their land. DDA has to bring a provision where individual ownership of land is acknowledged,” said Bazad.Senior DDA officials said the amendments to the land pooling policy will be notified soon. The DDA has also proposed changes in the Delhi Development Act, 1957, for effective implementation of the policy.DDA officials said changes in the Act were needed for making legal provisions. A second senior DDA official said, “There are issues related to land parcels that have not been pooled in sectors where we have reached the percentage of land required to implement the policy. Currently, there is no provision to get control of these land parcels. If this issue is not addressed, development in land pooling sectors can’t happen.”Sabyasachi Das, former planning commission in-charge with the DDA, said, “There are several issues in the land pooling policy that have to be addressed. To get 70% contiguous land parcels (a condition in the policy), which is essential for comprehensive planning, there is a need to amend the Delhi Development Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-of-95-villages-in-delhi-seek-changes-in-land-pooling-policy-for-its-speedy-execution-101627237708750.html
26-07-2021||Delhi||Govt steps up enforcement at markets; unfair to lay all blame on us, say traders||After several recorded instances of violations of Covid-19 regulations at markets in the city over the last four weeks, the state government has deployed 149 teams to enforce masking and distancing norms in these usually crowded spots.In the last four weeks, at least 30 markets in the city — including Laxmi Nagar market, large parts of Sadar Bazar, Gaffar Market in Karol Bagh, Lajpat Nagar Central Market, Tilak Nagar market and several local markets in Nangloi, Madangir, and Rohini — have been temporarily suspended for violating Covid-19 regulations.Between July 1 and 25, government records showed, at least four containment zones were set up in market areas. Delhi currently has 309 containment zones.“These teams are entrusted with not only imposing fines on people found violating Covid-19 regulations in the markets, but also recording videos and sending inputs every day to the sub-divisional magistrates concerned. On the basis of such inputs, actions such as temporarily shutting down a market – which in itself is an extreme measure – are taken. It cannot be helped. Rules have to be followed to prevent another potential wave of the disease,” said a top official of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).GROUND REPORTOld Delhi’s Meena Bazaar saw a moderate crowd on Sunday. While the portion of the market comprising street vendors were relatively busier than week days, the cloth market wore a largely deserted look. While violation of physical distancing was not very pronounced, mask discipline was quite poor with people not wearing a mask or wearing it below the nose.Rekha Gupta, a resident of Daryaganj, said that she was passing through the area and decided to take a look at the market. “Due to the weekend, the market is a little crowded, it seems. Many people are not wearing masks either. As long as people wear a mask, stepping out should not be a problem. I came for routine shopping but one needs to understand that staying at home is not a solution. But people must wear masks at least,” said Gupta.Tabeer Qureshi, sat alone in his garments shop, as he waited for customers. Qureshi said that violation of physical distancing norms was out of the question since the market was hardly getting visitors. “Very few people are coming to Chandni Chowk these days on weekdays. Among the visitors, many do not wear a mask and shopkeepers cannot force them to wear one. We can only request them to wear a mask. If they don’t listen, we can’t do much.”Ashok Luthra, who owns a jewellery store in south Delhi’s GK I market, said that while physical distancing became a challenge at times, shop keepers reminded visitors about covid protocols. “The market gets crowded at times but we ask people to disperse if such a situation arises. We ask them to leave or come later if the crowd is significant. Masking is not a major issue since most people tend to wear one. If they don’t, we request to wear a mask,’ said Luthra.Shreya Tripathy, 26, researcher, who was at the market to meet a friend, said that it was relatively less crowded than other markets such as CP. “The market seems largely empty. It is definitely not as crowded as other markers such as CP. People are mostly wearing a mask so that’s good,” said Tripathy.On Saturday, HT also visited the Sadar Bazar and Gandhi Nagar markets, which were found to be moderately crowded and people not wearing masks could be spotted now and then.WHAT TRADERS SAY“In the last few weeks, several markets have faced temporary suspension orders. It is unfair to put the entire burden of Covid-19 regulations on market welfare bodies. Local agencies and authorities too have responsibilities in this regard. We will meet the chief secretary soon to discuss the issue,” said Brijesh Goyal, president of chamber of trade and industry -- a collective of market and trader welfare bodies based in Delhi.Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar market traders’ association, said: It is time the authorities should crack down on illegal encroachment instead of cracking down on market associations. If shop owners are found flouting rules, action should be taken against the particular shops instead of closing an entire market.”“Shop owners are complying with Covid-19 regulations but they cannot do it alone. It has to be done through proper coordination with the police, civic agencies and district authorities. We shall meet the senior officials in this regard on Monday,” said Devraj Baweja, president of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Confederation.Kapil Gandhi, president of New Market welfare association Tilak Nagar, said: “There are encroachment issues in the market. We need better coordination from the authorities instead of such crackdowns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-govt-steps-up-enforcement-in-delhi-markets-traders-say-unfair-to-lay-all-blame-on-them-101627237708155.html
26-07-2021||Delhi||Path cleared for extension of Delhi’s Barapullah elevated corridor||The Delhi government is in the final stages of acquiring an 8.5-acre land parcel in the Yamuna riverbed which will pave the way for the completion of the extension of the Barapullah elevated road corridor up to Mayur Vihar in east Delhi, senior government officials who are aware of the development said.The extension will provide signal free road access between east Delhi and south Delhi. Currently the Barapullah elevated corridor, known as the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Setu, connects Sarai Kale Khan in south east Delhi to AIIMS in south Delhi. The road corridor was developed for ferrying athletes during the 2010 Commonwealth Games.The officials said this is the first land acquisition case processed by the Delhi government under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, said two senior Delhi government officials.Almost five years after the government initiated the process to acquire two land parcels for the 790m-long section (500m and 290m) of the elevated corridor between Mayur Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan, the revenue department notified the draft Rehabilitation and Resettlement scheme identifying the beneficiaries last month.The land parcels belong to residents of Nangli Razapur village, located near Sarai Kale Khan ISBT. Villagers say that they have been waiting for compensation for the past five years. Rajbir Tanwar, a resident, said, “We have held several meetings with government officials in the past five years. But till date there is no clarity on when we will get the compensation amount.”A senior south east Delhi district official said, “This is the first case processed under the RFCTLARR Act, 2013, by the government. We recently held a public hearing on the matter and have sent the file for final approval. We have been informed that the PWD department has released part payment to the revenue department for the acquisition process.”Once the final approval is given, it will be sent to Delhi lieutenant governor for approval and declaration of the scheme. “We plan to notify the declaration by September. We will have to acquire the land within one year from the date of declaration,” said the official.Villagers said they want the government to confirm the compensation amount. Bhopal Singh Chauhan, a farmer and village Pradhan, said, “In the meeting, officials didn’t tell us about the compensation amount. Our demand is that the government should pay ₹3 crore per acre.”The compensation amount, the district official said, will be finalised at later stages.Delhi PWD officials said that the ₹1,260 crore-project, which is crucial for addressing traffic congestion on Vikas Marg and Delhi Noida Direct flyway, is more than 80% complete and the remaining work will be completed within one year from the day they get possession of the land.A senior Delhi PWD official said, “Just 18% of the work, mainly related to the two stretches which have to be constructed, on the elevated corridor is left. If we get the land by October this year, it should be complete by December 2022.”Ever since the RFCTLARR Act came into force in 2013, the Delhi government’s land and building department officials said that no land has been acquired till date.A senior official aware of the development said, “As this was the first to be processed, it took some time as we had to appoint a committee to do the Social Impact Assessment and follow all the provisions of the Act. We have 5-6 requests for land acquisition from DMRC and PWD. We are trying to expedite the process so that such delays don’t happen in the future.”Anuj Dayal, executive director corporate communication, DMRC, “Out of these, about 8.71 hectares of permanent land has already been received by us. Deliberations are in progress for the rest of the land requirement. We are not facing any major issue pertaining to land acquisition as yet for phase 4.”Infrastructure and urban planning experts say that the new land acquisition Act has made the process difficult. The DMRC has a direct purchase policy and even the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has provisions in its Act which makes land acquisition faster and easier. Experts say, there is a need to have a direct purchase policy for crucial infrastructure projects.Sarvagya Srivastava, former engineer-in-chief of Delhi PWD, under whose tenure the Barapullah Phase-III project was conceived, said, “There is a need to have a direct purchase policy so that crucial infrastructure projects don’t get delayed,” said Srivastava.He added, “It is due to bureaucratic inefficiency and indifference that such an important project has been stuck, which may lead to cost escalation and inconvenience to the public.”A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the matter.The DMRC has a procedure in place to ensure transparency in the acquisition process. Dayal said, “Only in exceptional circumstances, to avoid any delay in the completion of the projects, we enter into direct negotiation with private parties. In Phase 3, the DMRC acquired bare minimum land from private parties through direct negotiation.”The Delhi Development Authority’s Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) project, which is also referred to as the third ring road, is another case in point. The 79km-long corridor, which will connect four national Highways (NH 1, 2, 8 and 10), was approved by the UTTIPEC, the apex body for approval of traffic and transportation projects in Delhi, in 2016. But the DDA couldn’t start the work due to which it was transferred to the NHAI in 2018 to expedite the process.Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner (incharge) at DDA, said, “One of the reasons for the UER-II project being transferred to NHAI was land acquisition on the new approved alignment. NHAI and DMRC both have provisions to expedite the land acquisition process.”Nivit Kumar Yadav, director Industrial pollution unit, at the Centre for Science and Environment, said the Act of 2013 is aimed at protecting the interest of farmers who are directly or indirectly dependent on their land.“The acquisition process is time consuming. It provides for several opportunities to the government to discuss and negotiate with the local community whose land is being acquired. Moreover, to acquire land for crucial infrastructure projects the state government should come up with schemes or policies. Several states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand etc have come up with alternative solutions to acquire land. Land pooling is one such solution which has been used in Andhra Pradesh’s Amravati,” said Yadav, who also looks after the environment impact assessment and land acquisition related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/path-cleared-for-extension-of-delhi-s-barapullah-elevated-corridor-101627237649349.html
26-07-2021||Pune||Pune hospitals with less than 50 beds to get first stock of vaccine doses||PUNE Smaller hospitals in the district, most in city areas, will finally get a private vaccine stock, this after payments were made in advance. Smaller hospitals have been out of the fray of the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Pune as major hospitals got the vaccine stock in April. Smaller hospitals with less than 50 beds are yet to get their first stock of the vaccine doses. State officials have confirmed that after days of waiting, smaller hospitals would get stock on Monday. Serum Institute of India, the largest manufacturer of Covishield, is located within the city, but hospitals have been waiting for 8-10 days. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the hospital board of India, said, “The smaller hospitals have had to wait for months now since April 1, when the central government first approved and permitted hospitals to vaccinate people. During this time while smaller hospitals waited to get their stock the major hospitals rushed to hoard a large number of vaccines, given that there was a huge demand. This lead to a disparity in vaccine distribution.”Dr Nivedita Oswal, in charge of a private hospital in Hadapsar, listed as one of the beneficiaries to get the vaccines, said, “Firstly, we could not get the vaccine because the PMC delayed giving us approval. During this time, big hospitals hoarded vaccines. Now when the system was updated and it was declared that even smaller hospitals with less than 50 beds could get the vaccine directly from the manufacturer, we are yet to get the vaccine despite making full payment in advance. I run a small 15-bed hospital and we have a huge demand from people to get vaccinated, especially those who are awaiting their second dose. I made the payment directly to the manufacturer on July 17, however, we are yet to receive the vaccine. The Cowin app says that the vaccine has been dispatched days ago.”Dr Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer, PMC, said, “The PMC no longer supplies vaccines to the private hospitals like it did in the initial months, since now they can directly procure it from the manufacturers. PMC is only involved with providing permissions. However, the supply of vaccine comes from the manufacturer and the state distributes it accordingly.”Dr Jayshree Jadhav, district vaccine store officer said, “Right now we have got 22,500 doses to be distributed to smaller hospitals which were stored at the Aundh hospital. Although we had got the stock earlier, it was yet to be updated on the Cowin app. So we diverted that stock for routine immunisation. However, now it has been updated and so by Sunday evening or Monday, all the hospitals on the list will get their stock.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hospitals-with-less-than-50-beds-to-get-first-stock-of-vaccine-doses-on-monday-101627235909325.html
26-07-2021||Pune||PMC to rent 38 EVs at cost of ₹23.28 cr||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to rent 38 electric vehicles, with drivers, for eight years at the cost of ₹23.28 crore. These vehicles will be used by office bearers and administration. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar put the proposal before the standing committee, where it will now be discussed. Kumar moved this proposal as an “emergency”, without floating of tenders or inviting expressions of interest. The Energy Efficiency Private Limited company will provide the vehicles to the PMC. After completion of eight years, the company will allow PMC to purchase the vehicles at five per cent of the cost. PMC also adopted a policy to purchase electric buses for public transport. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said that as per the proposal, the contractor will need to bear all taxes. Recently, the PMC approved an e-bike proposal and approved charging stations at 500 places in the city. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has objected to the setting up of charging stations without all administration procedures being followed. The PMC proposal is in consonance with the state government’s new policy to promote electric vehicles in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra government on July 13 announced its new electric vehicle (EV) policy with the aim of having such vehicles achieve 10 per cent share of total registrations by 2025. The new policy, which has updated the one announced in 2018, was released by additional chief secretary (Transport) Ashish Singh and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Singh had said, “The policy has some ambitious targets. Electric vehicles must comprise at least 10 per cent of total vehicles registered by 2025. We also want to achieve 25 per cent EV share in public transport in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik. It includes converting 15 per cent of the MSRTC fleet into EVs by 2025.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-proposal-to-rent-38-evs-with-drivers-for-eight-years-at-cost-of-rs-23-28-cr-101627235908091.html
26-07-2021||Pune||Central Railways (CR) restores train operations including Deccan Express||The Central Railways (CR) restored several train operations that were cancelled, diverted or short-terminated due to landslides over the past few days. On July 22 a major landslide happened in the ghat section of Lonavla, due to which all train operations going through the section were cancelled. While all trains between Pune and Mumbai were cancelled, now after repair works, train operations are back to normal.One of the major trains between the two cities is the Deccan Express, which was back to its normal schedule timings from Sunday. Similarly, several other trains originating, passing through and running on this route started operating normally.The landslide happened at several sections in the ghat area and mud with huge rocks came rolling over the railway tracks. While at some of the spots even the soil under the tracks was washed away, railway traffic was stopped due to broken electricity supply lines.“After the landslide happened, the railways worked on a priority basis to clear the mud and debris from the railway tracks. Still the route was closed for two days and now we are restoring train operations as per earlier normal schedule times,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson.Trains back on track The following trains which were announced earlier as cancelled due to landslides and water logging on Konkan Railways and South-West Railways have been restored:01007 CSMT-Pune special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202101008 Pune-CSMT special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202101003 Dadar-Sawantwadi special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202101004 Sawantwadi-Dadar special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 28.7.202101133 CSMT-Mangaluru special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202101134 Mangaluru-CSMT special JCO from 26.7.2021 to 28.7.202101151 CSMT-Madgaon special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202101152 Madgaon-CSMT special JCO from 26.7.2021 to 28.7.202101111 CSMT-Madgaon special JCO from 24.7.2021 to 28.7.202101112 Madgaon-CSMT special JCO from 24.7.2021 to 27.7.202101113 CSMT-Madgaon special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 28.7.202101114 Madgaon-CSMT special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202101411 CSMT-Kolhapur special JCO from 26.7.2021 to 28.7.202101412 Kolhapur-CSMT special JCO from 25.7.2021 to 27.7.202109578 Jamnagar-Tirunelveli special JCO 23.7.2021||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/central-railways-cr-restores-train-operations-including-deccan-express-101627228946734.html
26-07-2021||Ranchi||Deadly April and May dwarf Jharkhand’s official Covid-19 toll||The total number of deaths registered in the months of April and May in 2021 in several districts of Jharkhand has witnessed a massive spike, as high as six times in some cases, compared to the corresponding period in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic first hit the country, rasing questions over the actual coronavirus toll in the state.As per the data accessed under the Right to Information Act from the state’s statistics department, which compiles registered births and deaths, there has been massive surge in the number of total registered deaths in at least 12 of the 24 districts in the state during April and May.Three other districts, which could not provide data for May, also showed a sharp spike in registered deaths in the month of April. At least 14 districts, which provided month-wise data of registered deaths, recorded a spike even in the month of March 2021 as compared to the previous year. Three other districts could not provide month-wise figures of registered deaths while data from other six districts was awaited.Of the 15 districts which provided month-wise figures of both the years, only Giridh district has witnessed a dip in the number of registered deaths during April and May in 2021 as compared to the corresponding period the previous year. However, registered death figures are still higher in the district for both the months than the official Covid-19 death count during the entire year.In other districts which provided month-wise data, the registered deaths in the months of March, April and May in 2021 was at least twice or thrice the figure during the corresponding period in 2020. In some of the districts, the spike in registered deaths during the second wave months was manifold compared to the previous year.Sample this: In Palamu, the total number of registered deaths in March this year is 415 as compared to 66 last year. In April, the district has 201 registered deaths in comparison to 25 last year. In the month of May, the registered deaths in the district soared to 794 this year as compared to 82 last year. The pattern in the district continued in June with 478 registered deaths this year as compared to 224 last year.Major spike has been witnessed in other districts as well, including Jamsedhpur, Dhanbad, Chatra and Latehar. Even tribal-dominated districts such as Dumka and Khunti have seen a surge in the numbers. Latehar district also showed an increasing trend from March to June this year.Though the cause of death in case of registered ones was yet to be provided, these numbers do raise questions about the Covid toll as provided by the health department.As per the data released by the health department, 5,122 people have died due to Covid-19 in the state since the pandemic began. Of these, 3,878 died in April and May this year when the second wave was at its deadliest.Statisticians, however, said while the numbers have witnessed an unusual increase, some other factors also need to be factored in while analysing the figures.“The national lockdown had brought almost everything to standstill in April and May last year. That could be one reason for fewer registered deaths last year. It is important to compare the data of the later months as well because many people apply for death registration late. However, the actual reason for the spike could be ascertained only if the cause of death is established,” said Hriday Kumar, joint secretary in the planning and statistics department.A health department official, while conceding that the number of deaths during the second wave has been higher, said the exact cause of death due to the pandemic could be established only through a “verbal autopsy”.Anil Kumar Singh, civil surgeon of Palamu district, which has recorded worst surge in registered deaths, said a social audit was being done to ascertain the cause of deaths.“The spike is unusually higher and Covid-19 could be one of the reasons. There has been a dip in the accident-related deaths almost everywhere largely due to the lockdown restrictions. We need to see if people also died due to other complications. A social audit is already underway to conduct verbal autopsy to establish the actual cause of deaths, especially due to Covid-19 as the government is planning for some monetary compensation. Things should get clearer once the survey is completed,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/deadly-april-and-may-dwarf-j-khand-s-official-covid-toll-101627139537419.html
26-07-2021||World||Record-shattering heatwaves caused by pace of warming: Study||Heatwaves that obliterate temperature records as in western Canada last month and Siberia last year are caused by the rapid pace, rather than the amount, of global warming, researchers said Monday.The findings, reported in Nature Climate Change, suggest that humanity is likely to see a lot more deadly scorchers in the coming decades."Because we are in a period of very rapid warming, we need to prepare for more heat events that shatter previous records by large margins," head author Erich Fischer, a senior scientist at ETH Zurich and a lead author of the UN climate science assessment currently under review, told AFP.The heatwave that ravaged British Columbia saw temperatures hit 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 Fahrenheit), more than five degrees above the hottest day recorded in Canada up to that point.Current rates of warming -- about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decades -- are likely to continue for at least another 10 to 20 years no matter how quickly humanity reduces the carbon pollution that drives global heating, the study warns.But efforts to curb greenhouse gases over the next decade will pay off later."The future probability of record-shattering extremes depends on the emissions pathway that gets us to a given level of warming," Fischer said.Up to now, research on how global warming will affect heatwaves has focused mostly on how much temperatures have risen compared to some reference period rather than on how quickly.That is, of course, critically important, and the science has shown without a doubt that a warmer world will produce more and hotter heatwaves.But not taking into account how quickly temperatures rise fails to capture a key part of the picture.Climate on steroids"Without climate change, one would expect record temperatures to become rarer the longer we measure," Fischer explained.Likewise, if average global temperatures stabilise -- at, say, 1.5 degrees Celsius above mid-19th century levels, the aspirational target of the Paris Agreement -- dramatic new records would progressively become less frequent.Fischer compares it to track and field, where the longer a discipline exists, the harder it is top a world record. The long and high jump records, for example, have stood for decades, or are only ever surpassed by a centimetre or two.But if athletes start taking performance-enhancing drugs, as happened in US baseball during the late 1990s, records are suddenly broken often and by a lot."The climate currently behaves like an athlete on steroids," Fischer said.At current rates of greenhouse gas emissions, the world is on track to continue warming at current rates to more than 3C by 2100."This is a very important study," commented Tim Palmer, a research professor at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the findings.But climate models with far higher resolution -- like a camera with 64 mega-pixels rather than 16 -- are needed to simulate the monster heatwaves observed the world over the last 20 years."This new study shines a valuable spotlight on the high potential for record-shattering extremes," including the kind of extreme rainfall that ravaged Germany and China earlier this month, noted Rowan Sutton, a professor at the University of Reading's National Centre for Atmospheric Science, in Britain."Whilst it may not seem rapid to us, Earth is warming at a rate that is unprecedented in the history of human civilisation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recordshattering-heatwaves-caused-by-pace-of-warming-study-101627321909964.html
26-07-2021||World||Delta variant of Covid-19 now dominant in most European countries, says ECDC||The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and World Health Organisation’s (WHO) regional office for Europe warned on Monday that the Delta variant of Covid-19 is now dominant in the region. The two bodies also recommended measures like faster rollout of Covid-19 vaccination to all eligible groups, implementation of public health measures and increased access to testing.“Surveillance data reported to WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show that between June 28 and July 11, 2021 the Delta variant was dominant in the majority (19 countries) of the 28 countries that reported sufficiently complete genetic sequencing information,” the joint statement by the ECDC and the WHO’s Europe office read.Also read | Over half of Europe's adult population 'fully vaccinated' against Covid-19: EUWarning against the rising number of infections across Europe since the past four weeks, the ECDC said a five-fold increase in the infections was observed among the people in the age group of 15 to 24 over the past month. It also urged the priority groups including older people and those with chronic diseases, as well as healthcare workers to receive their full dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to protect themselves from severe illness.“Based on current trends the Delta variant will be the globally dominant strain over the coming months and has already been identified in almost all European countries. It will continue to spread, displacing the circulation of other variants unless a new more competitive virus emerges,” the statement further said.In their statement, the ECDC and WHO also mentioned the increased risk of infections due to travelling. It directed the people to think about the need and assess the risks before travel and also issued directives for safe commuting.The Delta variant or the B.1.617.2 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in India and according to the WHO, is more transmissive than the Alpha variant first detected in the United Kingdom. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said that the Delta variant has been reported in 96 countries as of July 5, 2021. The WHO termed the Delta variant as a variant of concern earlier on May 11 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-of-covid-19-now-dominant-in-most-european-countries-says-ecdc-101627321521247.html
26-07-2021||World||US to continue travel restrictions due to Covid-19 surge||The United States will keep existing Covid-19 travel restrictions on international travel in place for now due to concerns about the surging infection rate because of the delta variant, according to a White House official.President Joe Biden earlier this month said that his administration was “in the process” of considering how soon the U.S. could lift the ban on European travel bound for the U.S. after the issue was raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during her visit to the White House.The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said while the administration understands the importance of international travel, cases are rising in the U.S. — particularly among those who are unvaccinated and will likely continue to increase in the weeks ahead.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans against travel to the United Kingdom this past Monday given a surge in cases there.Most of continental Europe has relaxed restrictions on Americans who are fully vaccinated, although the United Kingdom still requires quarantines for most visitors arriving from the U.S. Airlines say, however, that the lack of two-way travel is limiting the number of flights they can offer and seats they can sell.But the rise and prevalence of Covid-19 variants in Europe, especially the delta mutation that is also spreading throughout the U.S., has caused the Biden administration to tread slowly about increasing transatlantic travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-continue-travel-restrictions-due-to-covid-19-surge-101627318899259.html
26-07-2021||World||Yi says China, Pak to launch offensive in Afghanistan to drive out terrorists||China and Pakistan have decided to launch "joint actions" in Afghanistan to stop the war-torn country from becoming a "hotbed for terrorism" and drive out terrorist forces from there, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday.The decision was taken during a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the southwestern the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday.During the meeting, Wang and Qureshi "decided to launch joint actions on Afghan issue," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here.Also, a press release posted on the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wang in his talks with Qureshi "emphasised that as Afghanistan's neighbours, China and Pakistan are directly impacted by the Afghan situation. It is necessary for the two countries to strengthen cooperation and respond to changes".This was "one important agenda during Qureshi's visit to China," said the press release titled 'China and Pakistan Decide to Launch Joint Actions on Afghan Issue'."After in-depth communication, we decided to launch joint actions," which included making "every effort to pursue peace, give top priority to avoiding the spread of war, and prevent Afghanistan from spiralling into a full-scale civil war," Wang said."We will work together to combat terrorism and push all major forces in Afghanistan to draw a clear line against terrorism, firmly combat the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and other terrorist forces, and resolutely stop Afghanistan from becoming a hotbed of terrorism,” Wang said.China and Pakistan will actively promote peace through talks, advance effective intra-Afghan talks, and take substantive steps towards political reconciliation and building a broad-based and inclusive political framework, he said.He said both nations will promote coordination and cooperation among Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, explore the building of Afghanistan-related cooperation platforms, and help Afghanistan achieve peaceful reconstruction and live in amity with all its neighbours.China, which wants the Taliban to sever links with terrorist groups in Afghanistan, has stepped up its diplomacy to reduce frictions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over Islamabad’s backing for the Taliban and settle for a power-sharing settlement with the Afghan government.Wang-Qureshi meeting took place under the shadow of the recent bomb attack on a shuttle bus carrying Chinese engineers at Dasu area of Upper Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where a Chinese company is building a 4320-mw dam on the Indus river.Nine Chinese personnel were killed and 27 others injured.China had rushed a special team amid confusing signals from Pakistan that it could be a gas blast. Islamabad later admitted it as a bomb blast stating that an explosive substance was found.The Dasu bus blast had accentuated Beijing’s concerns as thousands of Chinese personnel worked in the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan installations, projects and personnel in Pakistan.While Pakistan is concerned over the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been waging an insurgency against the country for several years, China is worried over the regrouping the Uyghur militants from Xinjiang who operate under the aegis of ETIM, which Beijing alleges has links with Al-Qaeda.Observers say there is confusion as no one has claimed responsibility for the incident, raising questions whether it has an Afghan connection.Although no organisation has claimed responsibility yet, Chinese experts believed that the terrorist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban or the ETIM were behind the attack, a report in the state-run Global Times said on Monday.Due to a changing environment in Afghanistan, the ETIM terrorists may have fled to Pakistan where they collaborated with the Pakistani Taliban to launch an attack on China, the paper quoted experts as saying."But they also warned that if the situation in Afghanistan further deteriorates, Pakistan as well as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be in danger," it said.The 12th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the UN issued last month confirmed the presence of the ETIM militants in Afghanistan."The ETIM consists of several hundred members, located primarily in Badakhshan and neighbouring Afghan provinces,” said the report, which was submitted to the UN Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yi-says-china-pak-to-launch-offensive-in-afghanistan-to-drive-out-terrorists-101627318718117.html
26-07-2021||World||More global support needed for Afghanistan to contain Taliban’s campaign||The next two to three months are crucial for blunting the Taliban’s campaign to capture territory across Afghanistan, with the group benefiting from active logistical and tactical support from across the border in Pakistan.Since the US announced its intention to withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan earlier this year, the Taliban have focused on capturing as much territory as possible, especially in rural areas, and taking control of border crossings with countries such as Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan. India believes the best-case scenario is a political settlement based on a power-sharing agreement in Kabul that retains the constitutional systems and institutions built up over the past two decades, and is open to possible changes to the existing system to accommodate all stakeholders.The Afghan defence forces, which lost some of their earlier momentum in recent weeks, have now begun reorienting their strategy to contain the Taliban campaign but will require more support from the international community to intensify their operations, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.A dynamic strategy that focuses on securing the most important Afghan provinces and good military leadership will be key for the Afghan forces in the coming weeks, especially as there are indications that the Taliban will widen its campaign in August to target provincial capitals and urban areas, particularly in Kandahar, Helmand, Paktia and Ghazni. The Afghan forces have also benefited from a shake-up of the higher echelons of the security set-up, during which President Ashraf Ghani replaced his defence and interior ministers and the army chief to sharpen the fight against the Taliban.The people pointed to the $3.3 billion pledged by the US last month for Afghan forces – including $1 billion to ensure the air force can support combat operations and for the delivery of additional aircraft, $1 billion to purchase supplies such as fuel, ammunition and spare parts, and $700 million to pay the salaries of Afghan troops – but said more backing from the international community will be needed in terms of air support, maintenance of air assets and intelligence and surveillance.The Afghan forces have to adjust to the new reality and are expected to continue the fight as long as salaries are paid and there is good leadership, the people said.The Taliban have benefited from the logistical and tactical support from Pakistani soil, and all supply lines from the Pakistani side remain open, the people said. There are reports that thousands of Pakistani terrorists from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are fighting in Afghanistan while Pakistani identity cards had been found on many fighters killed in recent weeks.There are also reports of terrorists injured in Afghanistan being treated at hospitals in the Pakistani cities of Chaman and Quetta, both in Balochistan province, and pro-Taliban rallies have been organised in Quetta and Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Madrassas or seminaries in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have issued calls for men to join the jihad in Afghanistan.In the past year, most terrorists based in Pakistan’s North and South Waziristan regions have also been pushed into Afghanistan. These developments have coincided with greater scrutiny of Pakistan’s efforts to curb terrorism by Western powers and watchdogs such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).For India, the presence of fighters from the LeT, the JeM and the Haqqani Network, which has deep-rooted ties with Pakistan’s military, remains a key concern. The Haqqani Network was linked to attacks on the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 and 2009 and the network also has ties with Al-Qaeda. The people also described reports of the Taliban controlling 85% of Afghan territory as exaggerated and said the group is believed to control about 45% of the country or about 212 of the 420-odd districts, while more than 110 districts are under government control. In the worst-case scenario, of all the Afghan stakeholders failing to reach an agreement on a political settlement and the Taliban capturing power by force, there are fears that the group won’t be able to control all parts of Afghanistan, leaving ungoverned areas that could be used by foreign terrorists to pose a threat to countries across the region, including several Central Asian states. “The Central Asian states will be most affected in terms of security. China too has its concerns about groups like East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). The Tajikistan border is the most tense now as large stretches are controlled by the Taliban,” one of the people cited above said. While the core ideology of the Taliban – including the establishment of an Islamic emirate and disregard for human rights – remains unchanged, the group is not a monolith and has several power centres and factions. While some Taliban commanders on the ground believe they have won the war, others such as the political leadership based in Doha have a different outlook and some are open to power-sharing.The Taliban are learning from their experiences and they don’t want to be seen as taking over provinces by force. They also want some sort of recognition from the world, and are visiting Iran and Russia to get “some sort of legitimacy”, the people said.These factors are also believed to have shaped India’s move to open channels of communication with the Taliban, as first reported by Hindustan Times. The external affairs ministry has not formally confirmed such contacts but has said India is in touch with “various stakeholders”.Though there are differences in the approaches of countries such as Iran, Russia and the US to the Afghanistan issue, there is convergence in opposing any forcible or military takeover in Kabul, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-global-support-needed-for-afghanistan-to-contain-taliban-s-campaign-101627317460161.html
26-07-2021||World||Mary Simon sworn in as Canada’s 30th governor-general||Social activist, journalist and former diplomat Mary Simon was sworn in as Canada’s 30th governor-general on Monday making her the first person of indigenous heritage to hold the post.She was sworn in by the chief justice of the Canadian Supreme Court at a ceremony in the chamber of Senate of Canada in the country’s capital, Ottawa, in the first-ever socially distanced event, with limited attendance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Simon, 73, was born in the village of Kangiqsualujjuaq in the Nunavik region of the province of Quebec. During her career, she has championed the rights of the indigenous Inuit people of Canada. She served as Canada’s ambassador to Denmark from 1999 to 2001 while also serving as ambassador for circumpolar affairs from 1994 to 2003, during which she negotiated the creation of the Arctic Council. In 2008, she delivered the formal response of the Inuit to an apology from the Government of Canada on residential schools in the House of Commons.She was appointed to the position by Queen Elizabeth II as the governor-general is the monarch’s representative in the country. That appointment was announced on July 6.It also comes at a time when hundreds of unmarked graves of indigenous children have been unearthed across Canada. These graves were discovered at or near residential schools that had been run by the Catholic Church in the past.Simon’s appointment was seen as a symbol of an attempt at reconciliation with the indigenous people during a time of crisis.While her appointment was largely praised, there were a handful of complaints to the commissioner of official languages of Canada, as she does not speak French, but is fluent in English and Inuktitut, the Inuit language. Those complaints, numbering over 400, are being investigated by the watchdog.The post of governor-general fell vacant following the resignation of Simon’s predecessor Julie Payette in January. In a development unparalleled in Canadian history, she resigned following the submission of an independent report about a toxic work environment in her official quarters of Rideau Hall in Ottawa. While other governor-generals in the past were unable to complete their tenures due to death or illness, this is the first time an incumbent had to leave the office amid controversy.A former astronaut, Payette was a high-profile selection by the Trudeau government to become governor-general in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mary-simon-sworn-in-as-canada-s-30th-governorgeneral-101627316499983.html
26-07-2021||World||China attacks US at bilateral talks, hands list of demands to revive ties||Striking an aggressive stance at the face-to-face talks with the US, China on Monday for the first time handed down to Washington a list of demands and remedial actions to be taken by the Biden administration to end the "stalemate" in bilateral ties.Talks between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to improve the relations got off on a rough note at the northeastern Chinese port city of Tianjin, with Xie launching a blistering attack on Washington, accusing it of being the "owner of coercive diplomacy".Sherman, the No. 2 diplomat of the US, is the highest-ranking American official to visit China since President Joe Biden took office six months ago.She started her meetings with Xie, who is in-charge of the US-China relations, and is due to hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a resort hotel in Tianjin.Besides launching a well-publicised scathing attack on the US, accusing it of "bullying" other countries with "might is right" coercive diplomacy by imposing sanctions, Xie also handed down a "List of US Wrongdoings that Must Stop" and a "List of Key Individual Cases that China Has Concerns".The list included removal of US sanctions imposed on the Chinese officials and their families and revocation of the Washington’s judicial request to Canada to extradite Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing in Beijing.Meng, who was arrested in Vancouver in 2018 on a bank fraud warrant issued by the previous Trump administration, is still facing trial.In the list of wrongdoings, China urged the US to revoke the visa restrictions on members of the ruling Communist Party of China and their families unconditionally, revoke the sanctions on Chinese leaders, officials and government agencies, cancel visa restrictions on Chinese students and stop harassing them, stop suppressing Chinese companies and “oppression” Confucius institutes, he said.In the second list, China has expressed concern over rejection of visas for Chinese students, the unfair treatment of Chinese citizens and harassment of the Chinese consulates and Embassy in the US and racial attacks on Chinese and Asians.Sherman arrived in China on Sunday evening from Mongolia. The meeting was held in Tianjin as Beijing is not hosting any foreign dignitaries due to Covid-19 protocols.On her arrival, she tweeted, "heartfelt condolences (from the United States) to those who have lost loved ones" in severe storms and flooding last week in China’s Henan province resulting in the deaths of 69 people.Monday’s pattern of the US-China talks followed the highly contentious first meeting in March in Anchorage, Alaska where Wang and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi exchanged barbs with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.China also came under immense pressure mounted by the US and allies over the allegations of genocide in Xinjiang over mass detention camps holding thousands of Uyghur Muslims.The Biden administration's special envoy on climate John Kerry visited Shanghai in April this year for meetings with his Chinese counterpart.The China-US relationship turned adversarial under previous US President Donald Trump who besides imposing trade sanctions also squarely blamed China for the spread of the coronavirus, which had first emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and the possibility of it leaking from a bio-lab in the city.Biden sought to firm up Trump’s stern China policy by uniting Washington allies like the EU, Canada, Australia and Japan, which has further riled China.He had a lengthy phone conversation with Xi after he took over and reports say the two countries may work out plans for a bilateral summit soon."I know him pretty well," Biden said earlier and described Xi as "very bright" and "very tough" but without "a democratic, small D, bone in his body", highlighting the autocratic style of functioning of the 68-year-old Chinese leader.Under pressure especially over the Covid-19, China is drumming up support against independent inquiry by the World Health Organisation (WHO) into the origins of the coronavirus.China has mounted a massive campaign at home and abroad to avert any such move to facilitate international investigators to probe the Covid-19 origins in Wuhan.Zhao said about 55 countries including Russia, Belarus, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have written to the WHO expressing opposition to the politicisation of the Covid-19 origin.Ahead of the talks, Wang Yi said on Saturday that China will give the US a "tutorial" on how to treat other nations equally."The United States always wants to exert pressure on other countries by virtue of its own strength, thinking that it is superior to others," he said, according to his comments posted on the foreign ministry website."However, I would like to tell the US side clearly that there has never been a country in this world that is superior to others, nor should there be, and China will not accept any country claiming to be superior to others,” he said.In his speech at the talks, Xie said the China-US relationship is in a stalemate, fundamentally because some Americans portray China as an "imagined enemy," and Washington must change the highly misguided mindset and dangerous policy."It seems that a whole-of-government and the whole-of-society campaign is being waged to bring China down. It is as if when China's development is contained, all US domestic and external challenges would go away,” he said.The US policy seems to be demanding cooperation when it wants something from China. "China wants to work with the US to seek common ground while shelving the differences," he said."After all, a healthy and stable China-US relationship serves the interests of both sides. And the world expects nothing less from the two sides," he added, according to a report by state-run Xinhua news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-attacks-us-at-bilateral-talks-hands-list-of-demands-to-revive-ties-101627305610486.html

This includes stabilisation of Afghanistan, Chinese aggression in Indo-Pacific, counter-terrorism and cementing of defence cooperation."The Deputy Secretary also raised the cases of American and Canadian citizens detained in the PRC (People's Republic of China) or under exit bans and reminded PRC officials that people are not bargaining chips," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said about the talks which were held in Tianjin, a city some 100km from capital Beijing, adding that the discussions were "frank and open".The number 2 US diplomat also affirmed the importance of cooperation in areas of global interest, such as the climate crisis, counter-narcotics, non-proliferation, and regional concerns including around the Korean peninsula, Iran, Afghanistan, and Burma, the State Department said.The two leaders also discussed ways to set terms for responsible management of the US-China relationship, it added.Sherman was in China on a two-day visit, during which she also met key officials. She expressed the United States' sincere condolences for the lives lost in the devastating floods in Henan province this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-red-cards-china-over-xinjiang-tibet-and-repression-in-hong-kong-101627306057399.html

According to Harrington, she conducted the research to prove or disprove MIT's theory. She studied 10 key variables, including population, industrial output, population, fertility rates, pollution levels, food production etc.Herrington concluded that the world could actually experience a "total societal collapse" by 2040. Her data was found most closely aligned with two particular scenarios from the original study: Business-as-usual (represented as BAU2) and CT (Comprehensive Technology). According to Herrington's report, which was published in the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology, both scenarios "show a halt in growth within a decade or so from now" and indicate that continuing business as usual, that is, pursuing continuous growth, "is not possible."The KPMG researcher's study has been described in details by various publications, including Vice, The Daily Mail and Livescience. It is also available on KPMG's website.In their research, the MIT researchers had envisaged 12 scenarios, most of which projected a point at which natural resources would become so scarce that any future growth would become "impossible", and personal welfare would decline. Published in that year's bestselling book, The Limits to Expansion, the study had described the imminent "collapse" as a point which would see standards of living around the world deteriorate, for decades, and not a point which would be the "end" of the human race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mit-study-on-collapse-of-human-society-may-become-reality-says-a-new-research-101627298936281.html

He added.Infected patients who show no or mild symptoms can now be housed in community-care facilities rather than hospitals."That means that as many as 60 per cent of infected cases may recover in community-care facilities. The government aims to raise the number to 80%, with some patients even recovering at home," Wong informed.While easing the curbs, the government will closely monitor all the health outcomes, especially the hospitalisation and intensive care units in the country, Bangkok Post reported.A few months back, Singapore surfaced a sudden spike of cases in April, most likely caused by undetected imported cases, causing the government to take a couple of steps back in its re-opening process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-ease-covid-curbs-aims-to-allow-quarantine-free-travel-from-sept-101627299506641.html
26-07-2021||World||Saudi foreign minister eyes mending ties during Pakistan visit tomorrow||Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud is scheduled to visit Pakistan on Tuesday to meet the country’s leadership on bilateral and global issues, Islamabad said on Monday. The Saudi minister’s visit is aimed at boosting bilateral ties with Pakistan which has been under stress in recent times, according to a report by news agency PTI.Al Saud will be accompanied by a delegation of senior officials of the Saudi government, the Pakistan foreign office said. Al Saud’s trip follows months after Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan’s visit to Saudi Arabia in a bid to mend ties. The meeting came after Prince Bin Salman called up Khan in March and invited him for a visit.Al Saud is also expected to meet his counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and exchange views on the entire gamut of bilateral relations along with discussions on regional and international issues. Pakistan’s ties with Saudi Arabia came under strain when Islamabad refused to send troops for the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen in 2015.Pakistan has also expressed its displeasure with the growing bonhomie between Saudi Arabia and India. Pakistan’s difference with Saudi came into open after it pulled out of a summit of Muslim leaders in Malaysia in 2019 as Saudi Arabia was not part of it. Islamabad saw it as an effort to create a rival group of non-Arab Muslim countries. It also returned $3 billion to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the summit fallout. Qureshi also criticised the Saudi government for failing to organise a meeting of OIC foreign ministers on the Kashmir issue.“It will provide a timely opportunity to review progress in bilateral cooperation in line with the vision of the leadership of the two countries. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long-standing and historic fraternal relations, rooted deep in common faith, shared history and mutual support,” Pakistan’s foreign office said in reference to Saudi foreign minister’s upcoming visit.The visit also comes amid the worsening situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban is aiming to take control of the nation as US and NATO troops are scheduled to withdraw completely by the end of August. Pakistan said that the visit of the Saudi foreign minister will reinforce the positive momentum in high-level exchanges and deepen bilateral cooperation across several fields. Ahead of the visit, 62 Pakistani prisoners were repatriated from Saudi Arabia via a special flight, according to news agency Dawn.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-foreign-minister-eyes-mending-ties-during-pakistan-visit-tomorrow-101627297127874.html

Do bad things and get good results. How is that ever possible?” Xie said.The US notion of “engaging other countries from a position of strength” is just another version of the big bullying the small and “might is right”.This is pure coercive diplomacy, Xie addedThe talks took place in the backdrop of tension between the two countries over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong and US’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters.Chinese President Xi Jinping had warned US counterpart Joe Biden that confrontation between China and the US will be disastrous for both countries and the world in their first phone call in February after the latter became president in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-demonising-china-to-build-national-purpose-chinese-diplomat-101627296878153.html

The charity, which works for the welfare of children, confirmed Allen's death on its Facebook page.An experienced and veteran climber, Allen was involved in an avalanche and was rescued in 2018 when he was scaling Broad Peak, which like K2 lies also in the Karakoram Range, along the Pakistan-China border.“Rick died doing what he loved the most and lived his life with the courage of his convictions," said the charity's statement.Pakistan is home to several top mountain peaks and climbers flock from all over the world to attempt to scale the summits.Earlier this year, three climbers — Pakistani mountaineer Ali Sadpara, Jon Snorri of Iceland and Juan Pablo Mohr of Chile — died while attempting to summit the 8,611-meter (28,250-foot) high K2. Their bodies could not be traced and retrieved despite several attempts by Pakistani search and rescue team aided by the military.Last week, famous South Korean climber Kim Hong Bin fell into a crevasse and went missing in bad weather after scaling the 8,047-meter (26,400-foot) high Broad Peak. A rescue operation to try and find him has been put on hold because of bad weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-climber-dies-in-avalanche-on-k2-in-pakistan-says-pakistani-official-101627289296934.html
26-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Malaysia to not extend state of emergency beyond August 1||Malaysia's government will not extend a controversial coronavirus state of emergency beyond August 1, a minister said Monday, as parliament convened after a months-long suspension that sparked widespread anger.The king in January declared the country's first nationwide state of emergency in more than half a century to fight Covid-19, following the advice of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.It allowed the government to rule by decree and suspend parliament, prompting critics to accuse Muhyiddin of using the crisis to avoid a no-confidence vote and shore up his weak coalition.Despite the emergency and a nationwide lockdown, the outbreak only worsened, fuelled by the highly infectious Delta variant. Malaysia's caseload breached the one million mark at the weekend, and there have been around 8,000 deaths.Facing mounting public anger and pressure from the king, Muhyiddin agreed to reconvene the legislature for a five-day sitting before the state of emergency officially ends next month.However, the opposition has slammed the short session as a sham that will not truly test the embattled premier's support.As lawmakers gathered in the 222-seat lower house Monday wearing masks and separated by transparent screens, Law Minister Takiyuddin Hassan announced the government would not request an extension of the state of emergency.Muhyiddin also defended his handling of the pandemic in an address to the legislature, saying he understood "the public's anxiety amid the spike in Covid cases"."The government is not sitting back and watching the public suffer -- (we are) acting to save lives."Other ministers are due to brief MPs on matters related to the pandemic.But opposition lawmakers expressed anger at not being able to debate or vote on anything during the session, pointing out the king himself had called for important issues to be scrutinised."The prime minister has acted as a traitor for not adhering to the wishes of the king," opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim told the legislature.Muhyiddin, who seized power in March last year without an election after the collapse of a reformist government, has seen his administration riven by infighting.The biggest party backing him, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), announced it was withdrawing support for his coalition earlier this month.But UMNO itself is split -- some of its MPs still back Muhyiddin -- and his position seems secure in the short term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-malaysia-to-not-extend-state-of-emergency-beyond-august-1-101627289472198.html
26-07-2021||World||Imran Khan's party wins PoK elections marred by irregularities, violence||Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is set to form the next government in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) as it emerged as the largest political party in the legislative assembly elections in the region which was marred by allegations of irregularities and violence, local media reported, citing unofficial results.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) has won 23 seats while Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was second with eight seats and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secured just six seats, the state-run Radio Pakistan reported.Muslim Conference (MC) and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) were successful in one seat each.However, Geo TV reported that PTI won 25 seats, followed by PPP with nine and PML-N six. One seat each was won by Muslim Conference and Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Party.Thus, PTI got a simple majority to form the government without support of any other party. It is for the first time that it will form a government in PoK.Traditionally, the ruling party in the country wins the elections in Pok.The assembly has a total of 53 members but only 45 are directly elected, while five seats are reserved for women and three are meant for the technocrats.The 45 members directly elected included 33 residents of PoK and 12 refugees’ who came over the years from Kashmir and settled in various cities of Pakistan.India has previously slammed Pakistan for its decision to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan and said any action to alter the status of the militarily occupied region has no legal basis.PTI Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry, who is the front-runner candidate for the 'Prime Minister' of the region, won from his seat. Former 'Prime Minister' and PML-N leader Raja Farooq Haider retained his seat. Another ex-'Prime Minister' and chief of Muslim Conference, Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan, also won.A total of 587 candidates contested the elections in 33 constituencies of various PoK districts and 121 candidates in 12 constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir refugees settled in Pakistan.Pakistan's Opposition parties, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), have accused Khan's party of "rigging" the elections held on Sunday.“There is proof of systematic rigging in the election,” PPP's vice-president Senator Sherry Rehman.She said PTI workers attacked the PPP worker during polling time, while police had uprooted a camp belonging to her party. "There is a clear difference between the voter lists of several polling stations,” she said.PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, claimed that to rig the election the PTI "goons" attacked her party's workers in Gujranwala's Alipur Chatha area."PTI has been allowed to engage in hooliganism with complete liberty," she said.However, the region's Election Commission rejected the allegations and said that the polls were held in a fair and peaceful manner.The chief election commission, Abdul Rashid Sulehria, told the media that he was satisfied with the election process.At least two PTI workers were shot and killed in clashes with PPP activists at a polling station in Charhoi area of Kotli district on Sunday. The two men were shot dead by unidentified persons, police said.Also, at least four soldiers were killed while three soldiers and a civilian driver were injured when their vehicle plunged down a ravine off a curvy mountain road in Laswa area of the region, the military said in a statement on Sunday.The soldiers were part of army troops deployed to help maintain peace during the elections.In another incident, five police constables were injured after Jamaat-e-Islami activists attacked them with batons at the Dhal Chakhya polling station of Jhelum valley district.A PML-N candidate Choudhary Muhammad Ismail Gujjar kicked up a storm as he threatened on Sunday that he would "seek India's help" if the local administration failed to address his concerns after his party's polling agents were removed from a polling station, the Geo News reported.Following their exit from the polling station, the agents got into a heated argument with the deputy commissioner after which the polling process was halted there.He, however, later clarified on media that his statement was directed towards the administration.Region's Secretary Election Commission Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan claimed that the elections were held in a free, fair and transparent manner.He expressed satisfaction over the law and order and appreciated the performance of the police and the Pakistan Army for ensuring the peaceful conduct of the elections, in which there were 32 lakh people eligible to vote to elect 45 members of the assembly for a five-year term.The last general election for PoK Legislative Assembly was held in July 2016 and won by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.In this election, the PTI nominated candidates for all the 45 constituencies, while PML-N and PPP each issued tickets to candidates for 44 seats. Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), the radical Islamist party which was banned in April by the Pakistan government for its violent activities, contested on 40 seats. The TLP was not de-registered by the Election Commission of Pakistan even after the ban, enabling it to take part in the elections.Apart from the ticket holders of different political parties, a total of 261 independent candidates were also in the race for the 33 constituencies in PoK, while 56 independents were running for the 12 refugees’ seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-party-wins-pok-elections-marred-by-irregularities-violence-101627287541598.html
26-07-2021||World||Robert Moses, American civil rights activist, dies aged 86 in Florida||Robert Parris Moses, a civil rights activist who was shot at and endured beatings and jail while leading Black voter registration drives in the American South during the 1960s and later helped improve minority education in math, has died. He was 86.Moses, who was widely referred to as Bob, worked to dismantle segregation as the Mississippi field director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement and was central to the 1964 “Freedom Summer” in which hundreds of students went to the South to register voters.Moses started his “second chapter in civil rights work” by founding in 1982 the Algebra Project thanks to a MacArthur Fellowship. The project included a curriculum Moses developed to help struggling students succeed in math.Ben Moynihan, the director of operations for the Algebra Project, said Moses’ wife, Dr. Janet Moses, told him her husband passed away Sunday morning in Hollywood, Florida. Information was not given as to the cause of death."Bob Moses was a hero of mine. His quiet confidence helped shape the civil rights movement, and he inspired generations of young people looking to make a difference," said former President Barack Obama on Twitter.Moses was born in Harlem, New York, on January 23, 1935, two months after a race riot left three dead and injured 60 in the neighborhood. His grandfather, William Henry Moses, has been a prominent Southern Baptist preacher and a supporter of Marcus Garvey, a Black nationalist leader at the turn of the century.Like many Black families, the Moses family moved north from the South during the Great Migration. Once in Harlem, his family sold milk from a Black-owned cooperative to help supplement the household income, according to “Robert Parris Moses: A Life in Civil Rights and Leadership at the Grassroots,” by Laura Visser-Maessen.Moses didn’t spend much time in the Deep South until he went on a recruiting trip in 1960 to “see the movement for myself.” He sought out the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta but found little activity in the office and soon turned his attention to SNCC.“I was taught about the denial of the right to vote behind the Iron Curtain in Europe,” Moses later said. “I never knew that there was (the) denial of the right to vote behind a Cotton Curtain here in the United States.”The young civil rights advocate tried to register Black people to vote in Mississippi’s rural Amite County where he was beaten and arrested. When he tried to file charges against a white assailant, an all-white jury acquitted the man and a judge provided protection to Moses to the county line so he could leave.In 1963, he and two other activists — James Travis and Randolph Blackwell — were driving in Greenwood, Mississippi, when someone opened fire on them and the 20-year-old Travis was hit. In a press release from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Moses described how bullets whizzed around them and how Moses took the wheel when Travis was struck and stopped the car.“We all were within inches of being killed," Moses said in the 1963 press release.A reoccurring theme in Moses' life and work was the need to listen and work with the local populations where activists were trying to effect change, whether that was registering Black voters in some of the most staunchly anti-integration parts of Mississippi or years later working with students and teachers to come up with ways to improve math knowledge.In an interview with the National Visionary Leadership Project, he talked about the need for civil rights workers to earn the trust of the local population in Mississippi.“You had to earn the right for the Black population in Mississippi to decide that they were going to work with you because why should they risk everything to work with you if you were somebody or a collection of people who were just not serious?" he said.He later helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which sought to challenge the all-white Democratic delegation from Mississippi in 1964. But President Lyndon Johnson prevented the group of rebel Democrats from voting in the convention and instead let Jim Crow southerners remain, drawing national attention.Disillusioned with white liberal reaction to the civil rights movement, Moses soon began taking part in demonstrations against the Vietnam War then cut off all relationships with whites, even former SNCC members.Moses worked as a teacher in Tanzania, Africa, returned to Harvard to earn a doctorate in philosophy, and taught high school math in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He later taught math in Jackson, Mississippi, while commuting back and forth to Massachusetts on the weekends.The press-shy Moses started his “second chapter in civil rights work” by founding in 1982 the Algebra Project using money he received through the MacArthur Foundation Fellows program — often referred to as “genius” grants — to improve math literacy among underserved populations. Ben Moynihan from the Algebra Project said Moses saw the work of improving mathematics literacy as an extension of the civil rights work he had started in the 1960s.“Bob really saw the issue of giving hope to young people through access to mathematics literacy.... as a citizenship issue, as critical as the right to vote has been," Moynihan said.Ernesto Cortés Jr., director emeritus and senior advisor to the Industrial Areas Foundation which helps develop community organizers, worked with Moses over four decades during which Moses would come to seminars and training. Cortés said Moses did not talk fast and was very attentive and deliberate. One of the key lessons Moses imparted was his “steadfastness” — sticking to a goal despite being repeatedly knocked down — and his generosity.“Bob always looked to develop other people, and give them recognition and give them their due,” Cortés said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-moses-american-civil-rights-activist-dies-aged-86-in-florida-101627276219929.html
26-07-2021||World||France passes law that makes special Covid-19 passports, vaccines mandatory||The French parliament on Monday approved a law that made special virus passports a part of daily life and vaccination mandatory for health workers as the nation continued its fight against a resurging coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. A compromise was reached between the two Houses of parliament amid massive protests against the new measures that many believe were an infringement to civil liberties.President Emmanuel Macron last week ordered that the health pass -- proof of full vaccination or a negative test -- would be required for the French to visit any public venues such as cinemas, nightclubs or even trains and planes. It initially applies to only adults, but will become mandatory for everyone above 12 years of age starting September 30. The health pass can be in paper or digital format.The law also requires all workers in the healthcare sector to start getting vaccinated by September 15 or risk suspension. The new law further says a government decree will outline how to handle vaccination documents from other nations.The rules will be applicable through November 15 depending on the pandemic situation.The bill was unveiled just six days ago. Lawmakers worked through the night and the weekend to reach a compromise version approved by the Senate on Sunday night and by the National Assembly after midnight.The new legislations are part of the Macron government’s bid to make vaccinations the top weapon against Covid-19 as new variants emerge taking a toll on the country’s health infrastructure. More than 1,11,000 people have lost their lives to the virus in France, which is registering about 20,000 new infections daily compared to just a few thousand earlier this month.Macron appealed for national unity and mass vaccination to fight the resurgent virus, and lashed out at those fueling anti-vaccine sentiment and protests.About 1,60,000 people staged protests across the country on Saturday against the special pass rule and mandatory vaccinations for health workers. Many marchers shouted “liberty!” and said the government should not tell them what to do.On a visit to a hospital in French Polynesia, Macron asked, “What is your freedom worth if you say to me ‘I don’t want to be vaccinated,’ but tomorrow you infect your father, your mother or myself?”While he said protesters are “free to express themselves in a calm and respectful manner,” he said demonstrations won’t make the coronavirus go away.He slammed “people who are in the business of irrational, sometimes cynical, manipulative mobilization” against vaccination. Among those organising the protests have been far-right politicians and extremist members of France’s yellow vest movement tapping into the anger at the Macron government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-passes-law-that-special-covid-19-passports-vaccines-mandatory-101627270463494.html

There were 38,091 Covid-19 cases logged in Brazil, 39,742 in India and 37,245 in the United States during the same period. However, in terms of the total number of infections and deaths, Indonesia is still far behind the top countries with 3,166,505 cases and 83,279 fatalities.Indonesia has become a new global virus epicentre after exceeding Brazil and India in terms of daily Covid-19 case and death counts earlier this month. Indonesia’s confirmed Covid-19 cases have jumped back to around 40,000 a day after declining from over 56,000 on July 15. Its death toll has also remained at near-record highs.Also read | Covid-19 can infect embryos, result in miscarriages: StudyOn Sunday, President Joko Widodo loosened Covid-19 curbs for another week until August 2 even as coronavirus disease cases remained high following near month-long restrictions.

26-07-2021||World||Tunisian president suspends Parliament, fires PM; Opposition cries 'coup d'etat'||Tunisian President Kais Saied announced Sunday the suspension of parliament and dismissal of Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi following a day of protests against the ruling party, who condemned the move as a "coup d'etat".Thousands of Tunisians had marched in several cities protesting against the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, criticising what they said were government failures in the North African nation and crippling coronavirus rates.Since Saied was elected president in 2019, he has been locked in a showdown with Mechichi and parliament speaker Rached Ghannouchi, a rivalry that has blocked ministerial appointments and diverted resources from tackling Tunisia's many economic and social problems.Car horns sounded after Saied announced parliament's suspension following an emergency meeting at his palace."The constitution does not allow for the dissolution of parliament, but it does allow for its work to be suspended," the president said, citing Article 80 which permits such a measure in case of "imminent danger".Saied said he would take over executive power "with the help" of a government headed by a new chief appointed by the president himself.He also said that parliamentary immunity would be lifted for deputies."What Kais Saied is doing is a coup d'etat against the revolution and against the constitution, and the members of Ennahdha and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution," Ennahdha wrote in a statement on its Facebook page.Earlier on Sunday in the capital, Tunis, hundreds rallied in front of parliament, shouting slogans against Ennahdha and premier Mechichi.Demonstrations were also reported in the towns of Gafsa, Kairouan, Monastir, Sousse, and Tozeur."The people want the dissolution of parliament," the crowd chanted.Several protesters were arrested and a journalist was injured when people hurled stones and police fired tear gas canisters, an AFP reporter said.Despite a decade passing since the 2011 revolution which overthrew dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia remains prone to chronic political turmoil that has stymied efforts to revive crumbling public services.The country's fractious political class has been unable to form lasting, effective governments.Tunisia has been overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases, including more than 18,000 people who have died in a country of around 12 million.Last week Mechichi fired his health minister over his handling of the pandemic, as cases skyrocketed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tunisian-president-suspends-parliament-fires-pm-opposition-cries-coup-detat-101627262205150.html

Wang’s comment, according to Chinese official media, was in response to US state department spokesperson Ned Price’s statement that Sherman’s discussions in China will be held from a “position of strength”.“The US has always put pressure on others with its self-claimed strengths in a condescending manner,” Wang was quoted as saying in the state media. “But I want to tell the US side that there is never a country that is superior to others, and there shouldn’t be one.”Much of the focus will be on Sherman’s two-day visit and talks in Tianjin, a port city some 100km from Beijing.It will be the first face-to-face talks between Washington and Beijing in months as the two negotiate acrimonious ties.Ahead of her visit, US officials told reporters in Washington that Sherman will tell Beijing that while Washington welcomes competition, it wants to ensure that ties do not veer into conflict. “She’s going to underscore that we do not want that stiff and sustained competition to veer into conflict,” a Reuters report from Washington quoted a US official as saying.“The US wants to ensure that there are guardrails and parameters in place to responsibly manage the relationship,” the official said. “Everyone needs to play by the same rules and on a level playing field.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-slams-us-before-top-diplomat-s-key-visit-101627249195968.html

Attendees carried signs and banners reading “Wake up Australia” and “Drain the Swamp”.In France, where police deployed tear gas and water cannon against some protesters, an estimated 160,000 took to the streets in nationwide protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s health pass that will drastically curtail access to restaurants and public spaces for unvaccinated people.“Freedom, freedom”, chanted demonstrators in France, carrying placards denouncing “Macron, Tyrant”, “Big Pharma shackles freedom” or saying “No to the pass of shame”.Meanwhile, around 5,000 people demonstrated in Athens, carrying placards touting slogans such as, “Don’t touch our children”, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.In Italy, protesters gathered in Rome to rally against a mandatory “green pass” for indoor dining and entertainment.Fauci warns US headed in ‘wrong direction’The US is in an “unnecessary predicament” of soaring Covid-19 cases fuelled by unvaccinated Americans and the Delta variant of the virus, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert said on Sunday. “We’re going in the wrong direction,’’ said Dr Anthony Fauci, describing himself as “very frustrated”.He said recommending that the vaccinated wear masks is “under active consideration’’. Also, booster shots may be suggested for people with suppressed immune systems who have been vaccinated, he said.UK health min says sorry for controversial remarkUK health secretary Sajid Javid, who was in self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, posted an update on Twitter to announce his “full recovery” but his words sparked a controversy. He said people should no longer “cower” from the virus.“Please - if you haven’t yet - get your jab, as we learn to live with, rather than cower from, this virus,” he wrote in a tweet, which he deleted on Sunday and issued an apology after he was accused of insensitivity towards people following lockdown rules.On Saturday, in a sign of return to normalcy, nearly 10,000 fans attended the Kaleidoscope music festival at London’s Alexandra Palace grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rage-over-covid-19-lockdowns-101627248879629.html

Such action under direct tax laws includes searches, surveys, enquiries, assessment of income, levy of tax, interest, penalties, etc. and filing of prosecution complaints in criminal courts, wherever applicable,” Chaudhury said.Giving further details about the prosecution and the cases filed, the minister said as many as 173 complaints were filed in courts in 2020-21 fiscal year alone, of which 16 conviction orders have been passed.This was followed by 1,226 complaints in the 2019-20 fiscal year which saw 49 conviction orders, while in 2018-19 FY, 3,512complaints were filed of which 105 conviction orders were passed.The most number of complaints (4,527) were filed in 2017-18, but only 75 conviction orders were passed.The black money Act deals with the issue of black money stashed away abroad. Apart from prescribing more stringent penal consequences, this law includes the offence of wilful attempt to evade tax in relation to undisclosed foreign income and assets.India has been a leading force in the efforts to forge a multilateral regime for proactive sharing of financial information known as Automatic Exchange of Information which will greatly assist the global efforts to combat tax evasion.The Automatic Exchange of Information based on Common Reporting Standard has commenced from 2017 enabling India to receive financial account information of Indian residents in other countries.India has entered into an information sharing agreement with the United States under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of USA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-measures-helped-detect-several-crores-of-undisclosed-income-lok-sabha-told-101627323793143.html

Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law and violates Article 14 of the Constitution,” said the petition.The counsel for the authorities sought time to seek instructions and file their replies, following which the matter was listed for September 13.The petition said that cities like Mysore, Bhopal and Ludhiana have already built separate public washrooms for them but the national capital is still seen nowhere taking such an initiative.The petition further added that every human being, of any gender, has some basic human rights, including facilities for using separate toilets and it is not fundamentally or morally correct to ask any specific gender to use a public toilet which is made for another gender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-plea-seeking-separate-toilets-for-transpersons-101627323760016.html

The order will pave the way for a consortium of India banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) to pursue a worldwide freezing order on Mallya’s assets in a bid to seek the repayment of debts owed by the liquor baron’s now-defunct company Kingfisher Airlines.“As at 15.42 [UK time], I shall adjudicate Dr Mallya bankrupt,” Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs said in his ruling during a virtual hearing of the Chancery Division of the High Court, news agency PTI reported.Mallya, 65, is wanted in India for fraud and money laundering charges. He is on bail in the UK while a “confidential” legal matter, largely believed to be regarding an asylum application, is resolved in connection with the unrelated extradition proceedings.“I have to decide if there is a real prospect of payment of petition debt in full within a reasonable period of time… there is insufficient evidence that [Mallya’s asset realisations in India] will pay the debt in full within a reasonable period of time,” Judge Briggs further said in reference to arguments about the restoration process in India following a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court order for the attachment of Mallya’s assets.Following the order on Monday, Mallya’s barrister Philip Marshall sought for an adjournment of the order but the judge declined the request to appeal against the bankruptcy order. The judge also said that there was no “real prospect of success” in the case of such an appeal.The consortium of Indian banks was represented by a law firm named TLT LLP and barrister Marcia Shekerdemian. They argued for the bankruptcy order to be granted in favour of their clients, who are owed over GBP 1 billion. They also pointed out that the long ongoing case would complete its “third birthday in September this year."The SBI-led consortium comprises of 13 Indian banks, including Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co.

26-07-2021||India||Two held for creating 99 fake accounts and duping Amazon of ₹26 lakh||The Uttar Pradesh police arrested two men on Monday for allegedly duping e-commerce platform Amazon of lakhs of rupees. The duo, who hail from Haryana’s Hisar district, were arrested by officials of Noida’s Cyber Crime police station.Police said the accused — Anil aka Alok Singh, a 27-year-old B.Sc graduate and Sachin Jain, a 30-year-old Class XII pass out — created at least 99 accounts on Amazon using fake credentials and linked various banks to these accounts which were then used to order electronic goods. The orders were either paid in cash on delivery or prepaid. The duo, however, after receiving the products, would sell them off at cheaper prices at Delhi's Gaffar Market and contact Amazon seeking a return by claiming that the products that they received were ‘defective’.Amazon, according to its policy, would send a delivery partner to pick up the item and refund the money.“After receiving the goods, they would sell them off at cheap prices in Delhi's Gaffar Market and then contact Amazon, saying they wanted to return the products as they were 'defective’. The duo would collude with the delivery agents who fraudulently marked these orders as 'picked up' on the database and get them a refund in the bank accounts linked with their Amazon accounts,” the police said in a statement.The authorities froze multiple bank accounts linked to the Amazon accounts used by the duo. Police said the frozen bank accounts had around ₹26 lakh in them. A probe has been initiated, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-held-for-creating-99-fake-accounts-and-duping-amazon-of-rs-26-lakh-101627315329469.html
26-07-2021||India||6 Assam police personnel die in clashes with Mizoram; Amit Shah steps in||Silchar/Guwahati: Six Assam Police personnel were killed and dozens of people injured as a decades-long border dispute with neighbour Mizoram sparked violent clashes on Monday, prompting both chief ministers to publicly trade charges, and forcing Union home minister Amit Shah to intervene.Violence broke out at the Assam-Mizoram border shared by Cachar district’s Lailapur and Kolasib district’s Vairengte around 11.30am over allegations of encroachment. Thousands of civilians on either side of the border hurled stones and charged at each other and security personnel with sticks and rods. Visuals showed policemen firing tear-gas shells and air pellets as people torched vehicles and huts.“I am deeply pained to inform that six brave jawans of Assam Police have sacrificed their lives while defending the constitutional boundary of our state at the Assam-Mizoram border. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted.Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana accused Assam Police of entering Mizoram’s territory and committing arson. “Upon learning of the arson committed by Assam Police, residents of Vairengte town, Kolasib district proceeded to the site to inquire. These unarmed civilians were assaulted by Assam Police by lathi charging them and firing tear gas, thereby causing injuries to several civilians,” read the statement.The hostilities pared down after the chief ministers spoke on the phone. Shah also spoke to both chief ministers, asking them to resolve the border issue amicably without any violence, people familiar with developments said. Senior Union home ministry officials are closely watching the developments at the interstate border, said the people quoted above.Officials at Silchar Medical College Hospital (SMCH) in Assam confirmed on the condition of anonymity that 36 people were admitted with injuries from air gunshots and stone-pelting. Cachar superintendent of police VC Nimbalkar was in the intensive care unit. Details of injuries on the Mizoram side were not available.Later, the Mizoram chief minister office said two residents of Vairengte and local police officer were also injured in the incident.The violence came two days after the chief ministers shared a stage with Shah and spoke of resolving the border dispute amicably.Assam’s Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6 km long border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. Mizoram was a part of Assam till 1972 when it became a Union Territory. It became a state in 1987. The territorial dispute has festered since then and fuelled sporadic clashes, the latest of which rocked the region in August 2020 and February 2021.According to Mizoram officials, tensions first flared up around 11.30am, when around 200 Assam police personnel attempted to construct a camp inside Mizoram’s territory. Assam maintains that the site in its territory.“I was near border area when people from Mizoram started firing. We tried to run away but a bullet touched my right arm and I fell on ground,” 25-year-old Fajar Ali, a resident of Assam who sustained an air gun injury on his hand said.In a statement, Lalchamliana rejected these charges and said Assam Police personnel forcibly crossed the border post and damaged vehicles on the National Highway. He said Assam launched a volley of tear gas canisters and grenades at Mizoram Police around 4:50 pm. “Mizoram Police responded spontaneously by firing back at Assam Police,” he said.Mizoram said after Shah spoke to both chief ministers, Assam Police withdrew and handed the post back to the CRPF.The clashes took a political turn at 1.50pm when Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga tweeted a video of the clashes and tagged Shah and Sarma. “Shri @AmitShah ji….kindly look into the matter. This needs to be stopped right now,” he wrote.At 2.53pm, he tweeted a video of a couple sitting in a car with windows smashed in. “Innocent couple on their way back to Mizoram via Cachar manhandled and ransacked by thugs and goons.How are you going to justify these violent acts?” he asked.Sarma responded four minutes later, blaming Mizoram for the flare-up.“Honble Zoramthanga ji could you please investigate why are civilians from Mizoram holding sticks and trying to incite violence ? We urge civilians to not take up law and order on their own hands and permit peaceful dialogue to take place between governments,” he tweeted, tagging Shah and the Prime Minister’s Office.At 3.25pm, he further wrote, “ Honble @ZoramthangaCM ji , Kolasib ( Mizoram) SP is asking us to withdraw from our post until then their civilians won’t listen nor stop violence. How can we run government in such circumstances? Hope you will intervene at earliest.”The tensions appeared to ease as evening approached. Sarma tweeted at 4.36pm that he spoke to Zoramthanga and said Assam will maintain status quo and peace along the border. “I have expressed my willingness to visit Aizawl and disscuss these issues if need be,” he said.Zoramthanga responded minutes later. “Hon’ble @himantabiswa ji, as discussed I kindly urge that Assam Police be instructed to withdraw from Vairengte for the safety of civilians,” he said.The Opposition condemned the violence.“We condemn the incident of firing on Assam Police personnel from the Mizoram side as reported in media. It is a matter of disgrace that such incident took place hours after union home minister left Assam [on Sunday]. It is also a matter of concern and humour that CMs of both states are arguing on Twitter on this issue,” said Assam Congress media in-charge Bobbeeta Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-assam-police-personnel-die-in-clashes-with-mizoram-amit-shah-steps-in-101627315720005.html

He has no experience of the pain of the villagers, poor and farmers. He lies habitually day after day in his unsuccessful attempt to stay politically relevant," Tomar told news agency ANI. The agriculture minister further said, "Congress and Rahul Gandhi should think that when they announced in their election manifesto that they'll bring the farm laws, they were either lying then or they're lying now. They should clarify. He shouldn't try to mislead the farmers or create an atmosphere of anarchy."Congress &Rahul Gandhi should think that when they had announced in their election manifesto that they'll bring the laws, then they were either lying then or they're lying now. They should clarify. He shouldn't try to mislead farmers or create atmosphere of anarchy: Agri MinisterUnion ministers, as well as leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including Tomar, have often targeted the Congress over a set of similar reforms mentioned by the party in its manifesto for the 2019 general elections. The protests against the reforms completed eight months on July 26. Farmers, mostly from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, as well as from parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping against the "black laws" on the borders of Delhi since November 26 last year. Earlier this month, they announced a "Kisan Sansad" (farmers' Parliament) which, they said, will be held in parallel with the ongoing Monsoon session of Parliament which began on July 19 and is scheduled to end on August 13. The farmers have been allowed to protest at Jantar Mantar, near the Parliament, with a maximum of 200 protestors allowed at the site each day.Total 11 rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers' unions have failed to resolve the dispute. While the farmers want the laws to be repealed, the central government has repeatedly stressed these won't be rolled back and offered to hold discussions "clause by clause."Also Read: 'Tractor rally not a bad thing, will hold one in Delhi on I-Day': Rakesh TikaitOn January 26, a tractor rally taken out by the farmers in Delhi resulted in clashes with the police on the streets of the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/he-lies-habitually-agriculture-minister-tomar-takes-on-rahul-gandhi-for-stand-on-farm-laws-101627306347518.html

26-07-2021||India||FM Sitharaman tables bankruptcy code bill aimed at small firms||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday introduced the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill 2021, or IBC, in Lok Sabha aimed at reworking some of the processes to deal with small businesses going belly up. The bill was necessitated by the financial stress wrought by the pandemic. Sitharaman, who was supposed to make an explanatory statement, tabled the bill amid pandemonium, as Opposition members resumed noisy protests over various issues no sooner than the House began its proceedings. President Ram Nath Kovind had invoked the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance on April 4. An ordinance is a law promulgated when Parliament is not in session. The IBC, a reform enacted in 2016, amalgamates various laws relating to the insolvency resolution of business firms. It lays down clear-cut and faster insolvency proceedings to help creditors, such as banks, recover dues and prevent bad loans, a key drag on the economy. Also Read | New restrictions on insolvency resolution professionalsThe government had made some changes to bankruptcy processes to account for the financial shocks of the pandemic, as India witnessed a rare recession last year. The finance ministry had increased the minimum default threshold for initiation of bankruptcy proceedings from ₹1 lakh to ₹1 crore to save especially small, micro and medium enterprises. Such firms make up over half of India’s manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) and are the largest source of regular employment. GDP is a gauge of national income or output. The government had also suspended filing of applications in case of defaults for a calendar year from March 25 2020. These measures constituted a relaxation of IBC processes. As part of measures aimed specifically at small businesses, the ones hardest hit by Covid-19, the government promulgated the IBC ordinance, which now needs to be passed by Parliament. Under these measures, the government introduced so-called “pre-packages” as an insolvency-resolution process. This allows for a prior bankruptcy-resolution agreement between a creditor, such as a bank, and an investor without initial approval from the National Company Law Tribunal, the bankruptcy regulator. “Many business here have closed. I am trying to open mine, but the main fear is ‘what if Covid comes back’. Who will want to sink money again,” said Yashwant Dubey, a bearings maker in Partapur industrial estate, a small business hub near Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-sitharaman-tables-bankruptcy-code-bill-aimed-at-small-firms-101627304258768.html

They arrived from Ahmedabad Mail Express at Haridwar railway station where they were stopped for mandatory Covid-19 testing. The pilgrims were also not carrying Covid negative reports with them.The pilgrims were shifted to a dedicated Covid care centre as soon as their RT-PCR reports came positive. Government Railway Police station house officer Anuj Singh said in case passengers arriving don’t possess negative RT-PCR report conducted within 72 hours prior to their arrival or in case of doubt over the report, mandatory RT-PCR testing is being done at the station. At Shyampur-Chidiyapur, Lahadpur Bhagwanpur, Kali Nadi, Tejapur check posts , Gokalpur in Jhabredsa and Khanpur, at least 150 vehicles were made to go back.

On Sunday, the Haridwar police booked 14 Kanwariyas for illegally entering despite the ban on the yatra. The yatra, which started on Saturday, will conclude on August 6. The Kanwariyas were arrested for entering Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat area to take Ganga waters back to their areas. They were booked under IPC section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act. On July 13, Uttarakhand government cancelled Kanwar Yatra, fearing millions of devotees thronging the banks of the Ganga in Haridwar could spark a devastating third wave of Covid. The decision came after opposition from doctors who warned that the impact of the Kanwar Yatra could be worse than the Mahakumbh, which was also held in Haridwar this year and sparked infections in many parts of northern India. The state’s decision followed a request from the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh to review its July 6 decision to suspend Kanwar Yatra. Kanwar Yatra attracted 36 million pilgrims in 2019 when it was held last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-first-sawan-monday-6-pilgrims-test-positive-for-covid-in-haridwar-101627300238836.html

Shah was on a two-day visit to Meghalaya during the weekend where he held a closed-door meeting with chief ministers of the northeast states.A clipping shared by Zoramthanga on Twitter showed police trying to stop a clash among men armed with sticks. In reply to the tweet, Assam Police said miscreants from Mizoram were indulging in stone-pelting and attacking Assam government officials stationed at Lailapur to protect Assam's land from encroachment.Shri @AmitShah ji….kindly look into the matter.This needs to be stopped right now.#MizoramAssamBorderTension @PMOIndia @HMOIndia @himantabiswa @dccachar @cacharpolice pic.twitter.com/A33kWxXkhGIn reply, Sarma shared a clipping and said a superintendent of police from Mizoram was asking Assam’s officials to withdraw from their post, failing which civilians from the neighbouring state would not stop the violence. He too sought immediate intervention of Shah and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). “How can we run government in such circumstances?” Sarma wrote.Soon after, Zoramthanga wrote to Sarma, "After a cordial meeting of CMs (chaired) by Shah, two companies of Assam Police with civilians lathicharged and tear gassed civilians at Vairengte Auto Rickshaw stand inside Mizoram today. They even overrun CRPF personnel/Mizoram Police."Dear Himantaji, after cordial meeting of CMs by Hon’ble Shri @amitshah ji, surprisingly 2 companies of Assam Police with civilians lathicharged & tear gassed civilians at Vairengte Auto Rickshaw stand inside Mizoram today.

26-07-2021||India||La Niña to return in September, may continue till winter||La Niña conditions associated with cooling of Pacific waters is likely to return in September, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). Global meteorological phenomenon of La Niña is linked to very cold and harsh winters in India and above normal monsoon rains.While above average rains are likely in August and September when La Niña conditions set in once again, IMD scientists said it was too early to give specific forecasts. La Niña conditions prevailed from August-September 2020 to April 2021. In India, La Niña was associated with an above normal monsoon last year, early winter onset as well as a harsh winter.According to IMD Pune’s El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) bulletin for July, currently, neutral ENSO conditions are prevailing over equatorial Pacific region. The latest Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) forecast indicates neutral ENSO conditions likely to continue up to July-September season, and August-October onwards cooling of temperatures over equatorial Pacific is likely to enhance and to reach to the La Niña threshold.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Centre said on July 8 that La Niña is likely to emerge during the September-November season and last through the 2021-22 winter (66% chance during November-January).“Our MMCFS model shows a high probability of La Niña developing from September. It is associated with good rains during the southwest monsoon season and because of clouding associated with rains, below normal temperatures are also expected. But we can’t tell yet what its impact will be on monsoon in August and September. IMD will soon issue a forecast for monsoon in August. La Niña has a negative impact on the northeast monsoon over peninsular India. That also needs to be monitored,” said O P Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD.DS Pai, who heads IMD’s climate research and services, said La Niña conditions will develop at the end of monsoon so there are less chances of any adverse impacts like flooding etc. “We normally see cooler temperatures during La Niña years mainly due to cloud cover,” he added.La Niña conditions developing in September will coincide with the post monsoon cyclone season. “While there is no direct correlation, a lot of studies have indicated that La Niña affects the track of cyclones developing over Bay of Bengal, they are more likely to move west wards,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.Due to La Niña, the atmospheric circulation patterns change. The frequency of cyclone formation increases but slightly to the north from its normal position. So, you may see more cyclones forming near Odisha, West Bengal, Bangladesh and they have a higher chance of recurving as opposed to cyclones forming near Tamil Nadu or south Andhra Pradesh coasts during non-La Nina years, Pai had said last year.A paper published in International Journal of Meteorology in 2019 on impact of ENSO on the Bay of Bengal tropical cyclone (TC) activity during post-monsoon (October–December) season for a period of 44 years (1972–2015) found that La Niña years are characterised by more frequent and intense cyclonic events compared with El Niño years. There is 1% deficiency in monsoon rain since June 1 with 26% excess rain over Peninsular India; 3% excess over Central India; 17% deficiency over east and northeast India and 11% deficiency over northwest India.IMD warned of an intense wet spell over northwest India from July 26 to July 30. The western end of the monsoon trough at mean sea level is running along its normal position while its eastern end runs close to the normal position. The western end is likely to shift northward during next 24 hours bringing widespread rains to the western Himalayas.A cyclonic circulation is lying over North Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood at mid and upper tropospheric level. Under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to form over North Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around July 28.Widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh till July 29 and reduction thereafter. Isolated extremely heavy rain (over 20cm) is also likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on July 27 and 28 and over northwest Uttar Pradesh on July 27.Widespread rain with isolated heavy falls very likely over Konkan, Goa, ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra during the next three days and increase to isolated heavy to very heavy rai over the region from July 29. Enhanced rainfall activity with heavy to very heavy rain is also likely over east and adjoining Central India (Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar) from July 27 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/la-ni-a-to-return-in-september-may-continue-till-winter-101627296638396.html

He added that a decision is exected before the 2024 General Elections."Don't know if it's wrong or right but friends told me that a serious discussion is being held on a proposal to increase the strength of the Lok Sabha to 1,000 or more before 2024. Architectural plan of new Parliament chamber should be tabled at Parliament," Tewari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.This comes a day after the Congress leader's tweet where he said that the new Parliament chamber is being constructed as a 1000-seater. Tewari added that a serious public consultation is needed on the issue.The new Parliament complex has a deadline of 2022. The new design envisages a triangular complex, with a tricoloured beam lighting up the sky overhead. Parliament will have 55 per cent additional seating capacity for MPs in its new building.This is part of the Central Vista redevelopment plan that has a deadline of 2024.In December 2019, former President Pranab Mukherjee hsd called for almost doubling the strength of the Lok Sabha to 1,000 lawmakers, from the current 545.The first Lok Sabha election in 1952 had 461 seats but within three years, the seats swelled up to 499.The documents in Parliament show the seats went up to 522, then to 530 and later, to the current capacity of 550.From time to time, Parliament has cleared constitutional amendments to increase the seats of both Houses. The share of seats from each state depends largely on the census and the current strength of 545 seats was construed with reference to the 1971 census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manish-tewari-claims-govt-discussing-increasing-lok-sabha-strength-to-1000-101627293493498.html
26-07-2021||India||Odisha human rights panel seeks report on gangster’s death in police ‘encounter’||The Odisha Human Rights Commission on Monday sought a report on convicted gangster SK Hyder Ali’s death in police firing while trying to escape on Saturday afternoon.Taking suo-motu cognizance, the commission issued notices to additional chief secretary (Home), Odisha DG, director general of prisons and Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Commissionerate Police.According to police’s version, 58-year old Hyder, serving sentence in a murder case and accused in several other cases, was being shifted to a jail in Baripada town of Mayurbhanj district in a police van from Choudwar circle jail on Saturday when he asked the cops to stop for attending to nature’s call. After getting down from the police van at Simulia in Balasore district, he tried to snatch an AK-47 from the sub-inspector and flee, forcing the cops to fire at him, they said.Balasore additional district medical officer Sushant Nayak said four bullets were found in the gangster’s body.Hyder’s wife Hasina Bibi alleged that her husband was killed in cold blood by police. “For 16 years my husband was lodged in jail and every time I cooperated with the police. Even when he escaped from the jail in April this year, I fully cooperated with the cops. I demand investigation into my husband’s death by an independent agency,” she said.Former director general of police (DGP) Sanjiv Marik said people were rightly suspicious of the circumstances leading to the gangster’s alleged encounter. “It is hard to believe that 10 policemen failed to overpower an old person who should have been hand-cuffed as he was a dreaded convict and had escaped from SCB Medical College in Cuttack in April during treatment. A thorough inquiry by an independent agency, ideally by a high court judge, should be conducted to ensure transparency,” said Marik.The police inspector who led the escort team to shift Hyder to Baripada Circle Jail wrote in his FIR that at around 3.20 pm, Hyder asked him to stop the vehicle to attend nature’s call. “I, along with my staff, asked the driver not to stop the vehicle from a security point of view, but Hyder insisted, claiming he was suffering from acute diabetes and had to attend to the call of nature. Hyder then requested that his handcuffs be unlocked to attend to nature’s call and wash his hands. As soon as the escort havildar unlocked one side of the cuff, he immediately snatched away an AK-47 from havildar Surya Kumar Rout and pointed the gun towards the escort party while hurling abuses in Hindi,” Gangadhar Saseni, a police inspector from Cuttack said in the FIR.The inspector said to save the police personnel from imminent danger of death, sub-inspector Asit Jena fired 3 rounds from his service pistol in Hyder’s lower part of the body, below the waist, with the purpose to immobilise him and to prevent him from opening fire.In April this year, Hyder, serving life sentence since 2015 in a case of abduction and murder of a trader, escaped from a government medical college cum hospital in Odisha after drugging the policeman in charge of his security. He was arrested 5 days later from Sangareddy district of Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-human-rights-panel-seeks-report-on-gangster-s-death-in-police-encounter-101627293338247.html

The link attached in these messages to reactivate frozen bank accounts could be the bait to steal away vital information of the account holders, the police warned.In their recent statement, Chennai police said that they have received many complaints of late about the customers receiving messages warning about their bank accounts being put on freeze. When the gullible customers panic and click the attached link, the miscreants are stealing their vital financial information. In ten minutes where the customers investigate the attached links and try to follow the instructions, the account details are hacked by the miscreants. The hackers are also withdrawing money or taking out online transactions using the information filled in the link.The department has received many complaints about people losing money after receiving such messages and clicking the attachments. The public who happened to receive such messages should be careful. Though these messages appear to be the ones sent by the bank, it is better to avoid such suspicious messages. These messages may try to create panic as they warn that the accounts will be frozen permanently if the customers don’t act. Such messages are not true and only intend to make the customers act on the messages. Hackers use multiple methods to steal away financial information from people. The short messages warning about frozen bank accounts are one of the methods which exploit the fear psychosis of the customers. Avoid exploring such messages received in phones, police appealed to the public. If they still doubt the status of their bank accounts, it is better to contact their banks directly to clear their doubts, the statement further noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hackers-using-sms-alerting-frozen-bank-accounts-chennai-police-warn-public-101627283550088.html

26-07-2021||India||Foreign govts, tourism sector to India: Ease restrictions on in-bound travellers||There is increasing pressure on India from both foreign governments and the tourism sector to gradually ease Covid-19-related restrictions on foreign travellers, especially those who are fully vaccinated, though authorities are approaching the matter cautiously to ensure there are no further outbreaks.Over the past few months, India has been asking other countries, especially members of the European Union (EU), the United States and China, to remove travel and quarantine restrictions on Indian nationals, especially those who have been vaccinated.The most recent instance was foreign secretary Harsh Shringla asking the United Kingdom to review its ban on travel from India during a visit to London, citing the case of large Indian cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai being “practically free” of Covid-19. The issue is also expected to figure during US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit to India this week.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing last week that India has been taking up the need to ease travel restrictions for Indians with other countries following the improvement of the Covid-19 situation. “We believe that this easing will be an important step towards economic recovery post-Covid for all our countries. There have been some positive steps in this direction of easing restrictions...and we hope that more countries will continue to take steps towards normalising the movement of people from India.”Much of the work being done by India is meant to facilitate students and professionals who want to join classes beginning in the autumn in European countries, particularly Germany and France, and the US or return to their jobs.Also Read | Revenge travel revamps trends in tourismAt the same time, foreign governments and India’s tourism sector have been nudging the Indian government to review the ban on foreign tourists. The tourism sector, which offers direct and indirect employment to millions, has been hit hard by the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.“By and large, all categories of visas, except for tourist visas, are now allowed but everything depends on the Covid-19 situation across the country. Things are better in the cities but there are pockets where there is a feeling that the situation is yet to stabilise,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.“It’s all about the number of cases – no one wants a situation where there’s an increase in numbers, especially due to imported cases. There is also a need for more vaccine confidence and wider rollout of the vaccination programme,” the person added.The other major factor related to in-bound travel is the ban on scheduled international flights, which is now in place until July 31.The ban was first imposed in March 2020 after the Coronavirus outbreak began spreading around the world. India currently operates some flights under the Vande Bharat Mission for repatriating Indian nationals from around the world, and has put in place air bubble arrangements with 28 countries, ranging from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan.The people cited above acknowledged that India could expect more pressure to ease its own travel restrictions in the face of other countries such as Germany, France, Switzerland allowing the entry of fully vaccinated Indian nationals. Almost half of the 27 members of the EU now allow the entry of fully vaccinated Indians, while other countries are allowing the entry of those vaccinated with doses approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).“The restrictions put in place are largely to protect people from another outbreak but there is also a realisation that economic activities have to be resumed. The situation is dynamic and is being constantly reviewed,” said a second person.Any decision on easing travel restrictions will have to be made jointly by Indian authorities following consultations involving the home ministry, health ministry and external affairs ministry. India has also been insisting in recent weeks on vaccine equity whenever there has been talk of “vaccine passports” such as the EU Digital Covid Certificate that entered into force on July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-govts-tourism-sector-ask-india-to-ease-restrictions-on-in-bound-travellers-101627284456961.html

The visit, though scheduled several months ago, would have coincided with a trip to New Delhi by US secretary of state Antony Blinken. Ahmadzai, who was appointed last month as part of a shake-up of the higher echelons of Afghanistan’s security set-up, was to have been in India during July 27-30. The visit was postponed because of the “intensity of the war and Taliban’s increased assault and offensive” in Afghanistan, the Afghan embassy said without giving details. Ahmadzai was scheduled to hold talks with his Indian counterpart, General MM Naravane, and meet National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other top security officials. He was also scheduled to travel to Pune to meet Afghan cadets being trained at various institutions. Also Read | Taliban killed 43 people in Afghanistan’s Ghazni, residents sayThe visit was to have provided an opportunity for the two sides to hold consultations on the security situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of a campaign by the Taliban to capture territory and crucial border crossings with other countries. Intense fighting has been reported from various parts of Afghanistan as Afghan forces attempt to take back districts and key centres captured by the Taliban in a campaign that has coincided with the speedy drawdown of US and NATO forces. The US recently conducted air strikes to slow down the advance of the Taliban. India plays a key role in training Afghan military personnel – some 300 cadets are currently training in the country – and is also helping in the medical treatment of injured Afghan military personnel, with a number of them being treated in hospitals across the country. For India, a key security concern is the presence in Afghanistan of more than 7,000 Pakistani terrorists from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. These fighters are fighting alongside the Taliban in many areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-army-chief-postpones-visit-to-india-because-of-taliban-offensive-101627283916992.html

For our safety, we are wearing the helmets. If police and local goons beat us, our heads will be safe," the RJD MLA was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The opposition MLAs were also seen distributing black masks at the Assembly.Police personnel had been called to assist the marchals carry out the legislators after a few of the opposition leaders restricted Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha from leaving his chamber.The monsoon session of the Assembly is likely to be an eventful and chaotic one as the opposition parties have chalked out a strategy to corner the coalition government of the Janata Dal -United (JD-U) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on issues such as rising prices of fuel, cooking gas, fertilisers and edible oil.Earlier, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav wrote to the Speaker, saying opposition legislators were scared to enter the House due to the March 23 incident. “Our MLAs are now afraid of entering the House and raising questions there...let us know the result of the investigation on the March 23 incident. That was a black day which will never be forgotten," Yadav wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-oppn-mlas-reach-assembly-in-helmets-as-monsoon-session-begins-101627282378053.html
26-07-2021||India||Offline classes in Odisha schools begin amid Covid containment norms||After being closed for three months due to rising Covid cases, high schools and higher secondary schools across Odisha reopened on Monday for class 10 and 12 students with adherence to Covid containment guidelines.The classes began from 10 am on Monday and will continue till 1.30 pm without a break after the schools were sanitised and necessary infrastructure to enforce Covid containment measures was put in place.Odisha school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash said the offline classes will continue with online learning. “The offline classes are not compulsory and students will need to bring a consent letter from their parents and guardians before attending classes. No student should be coerced to come to school. Only those who feel comfortable attending school should do so. There will be no attendance system,” said Dash, adding that every school has to determine its functioning depending on the number of students and the size of classrooms available.“Maximum 20-25 students should be allowed to sit in a classroom to ensure safe distancing among students. For schools with an adequate number of classrooms, all students may be accommodated on a daily basis. All students have to wear masks,” he said. Students have been advised not to bring food with them.Officials said offline classes were necessary as the government was able to reach out to only 40% of the students via online teaching and 150 days of regular teaching days have been lost. As both the Board of Secondary Education and Council of Higher Secondary Education have reduced syllabuses, resumption of physical teaching in classrooms has become a necessity.The reopening of schools came as the number of new Covid cases declined on Monday with the state reporting 1,637 infections in the last 24 hours and Test Positivity Rate of 2.19%. However, the number of fatalities continued to be high with 62 new deaths reported in the past 24 hours, taking the Covid death toll to 5,574. This year Odisha has reported 3,698 Covid deaths compared to 1,876 deaths last year.The minister said schools that don’t have 100% access to potable drinking water and adequate functional toilets will not be allowed to reopen.The state government in its guideline has said that there has to be adequate soap (solid/liquid) and running water in all washrooms and toilets in schools. Hand sanitizers for the teachers, students, and staff must be available mandatorily in each classroom. The schools will also have to display the state helpline and numbers of local health authorities etc. in case of any emergency. A separate isolation room will have to be kept ready in case a student or staff develops Covid symptoms.The Odisha government is also planning to reopen class 9 and 11 from August 16 and September 15, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offline-classes-in-odisha-schools-begin-amid-covid-containment-norms-101627281996915.html

Tamil Nadu public works department (PWD) officials sent out the first warning message to the Idukki district administration.Situated at the confluence of Mullayar and Periyar rivers in Kerala, the gravity dam commissioned during the British Raj in 1895 is the lifeline of five southern districts of Tamil Nadu -- namely Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga, and Ramanathapuram. The water is diverted from the Periyar river into the Vaigai dam for the drinking and irrigation needs of Tamil Nadu. Though the dam is situated in Kerala, Tamil Nadu’s PWD still maintains the dam.Mullaperiyar dam’s catchment areas have been receiving substantial rainfall after the southwest monsoon turned intense in Kerala, reported Tamil newspaper Dinamalar. On Sunday, the Periyar dam area received 10.4mm rainfall, while Thekkady received 10mm rainfall and the water level touched 136 feet of the dam’s total capacity of 152 feet. The current storage level of the dam is 5,929 ft. The dam is receiving an inflow of 4,875 cusecs of water. As much as 900 cusecs of water are discharged from the dam for irrigation purposes of Tamil Nadu.With a steady increase in the dam level, the first flood warning has been issued to Vallakadavu and Vandiperiyar areas on the riverbank in Kerala. Similarly, a flood warning has been issued to people living along the riverside in Tamil Nadu starting from the Lower Camp area. After the water level touched 136 feet, the PWD officials manning the dam sent out the communication to 23 officials both in Tamil Nadu and Kerala including Theni and Idukki district collectors.The second flood warning will be issued once the dam level touches 138 feet and the third will be issued once it touches 141 feet. The final flood warning will be issued once the dam level touches 142 feet, according to the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-alerts-kerala-after-mullaperiyar-dam-level-touches-136-feet-101627279999837.html

A protester said this would be the first time women will independently run parliament (Kisan Sansad).A Twitter handle of the farmers collective, Jai Kisan Andolan, said 200 women, as allowed by the Delhi government, have left from Singhu border for the historic event." किसान संसद आज तीसरे दिन "आज तीसरे दिन सिंघु बॉर्डर से 200 महिला किसानों का जत्था "जंतर मंतर" के लिए रवाना हो चुका है, यह एक ऐतिहासिक दिन है आज महिलाओं किसानों द्वारा किसान संसद चलाई जाएगी।#WomenFarmers_AtParliament #FarmersProtest pic.twitter.com/0kXgHXbiwdThe morcha launched a peaceful stir against the farm laws at the Jantar Mantar on July 22, around the same time when the monsoon session of Parliament began.

26-07-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee to reach Delhi today; will meet PM Modi this week||Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will be arriving in Delhi on Monday, her first trip to the national capital after returning to power in West Bengal for the third consecutive term. The Trinamool Congress supremo is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this week during the visit. With the monsoon session going on, Banerjee is also likely to visit the parliament and meet several political leaders during her stay.“I am going to Delhi for two to three days. I didn’t go to Delhi after coming to power for the third time because of Covid. I had sought an appointment with the Prime Minister, and he has given me time. I will also try to meet the President. This apart, several political leaders have requested that they want to meet me. I would try to adjust and accommodate as far as possible in two to three days,” Banerjee had said on Thursday while announcing her Delhi trip.This will be the first meeting between Modi and Mamata after the two met for 15 minutes in the aftermath of Cyclone Yaas. The centre-state relation then nosedived as the Union government recalled Alapan Bandyopadhyay, the then chief secretary of the state, for skipping the PM’s review meeting.Banerjee’s relations with the Centre remain frosty in the aftermath of a series of confrontations including a bitter electoral battle followed by alleged post poll killing and rape of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and supporters, and questioning of governor’s office, to name a few issues. Banerjee’s recent appeal to unite opposition to oust the BJP from the seat of power in Delhi in 2024 underlines the political friction between the two parties. Banerjee’s party has also hit out at the Centre over the Pegasus snooping row, which continues to rock parliament.“Journalists, political opponents, members of the judiciary, cabinet colleagues... now, not even the ARMY spared. There is no ambiguity here. This is a CRIME. Who is responsible? #Pegasus Discuss this in #Parliament today. PM-HM must answer,” tweeted Derek O’Brien, TMC Member of Parliament (MP) and the leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha.The Trinamool Congress had earlier alleged that Abhishek Banerjee, TMC’s national general secretary and CM Mamata Banerjee were spied upon using Pegasus malware before the West Bengal Assembly elections.Last week, Banerjee had demanded that the Prime Minister and Union home minister explain in the parliament if the Central government had a hand in the alleged snooping on prominent politicians, activists, journalists and ministers using a spying malware made by an Israeli company.The BJP however mounted a counter-attack saying that the TMC wanted to divert attention from a report filed by the national human rights body which slammed the state government for post poll violence.“The NHRC report has unmasked the government and all its lies are now out. In a bid to divert the attention the TMC is now raising such allegations. But this won’t stand,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-to-reach-delhi-on-monday-will-meet-pm-narendra-modi-this-week-101627277071630.html

26-07-2021||India||'Tractor rally not a bad thing, will hold one in Delhi on Independence Day': Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has supported the tractor rally call given by farmers of Jind in Haryana on Independence Day. Tikait said a tractor rally is not a "bad thing"."Carrying out tractor rally is not a bad thing. People of Jind (Haryana) are revolutionary. They've taken the right decision of carrying out the tractor parade on August 15. Don't know what Samyukt Kisan Morcha decides," Tikait said on Sunday."It will be a moment of pride to see the tractor parade with national flags mounted on them. It builds a spirit of nationalism," he added.The remarks come months after a similar tractor rally led to clashes between the farmers and the policemen on streets of the national capital on Republic Day. The farmers even reached the historic Red Fort and hoisted a flag (other than the Tricolour), which led to escalation of the confrontation.The BKU leader has been sitting with the farmers who have launched a protest at Jantar Mantar in the form of a 'Kisan Sansad'. Two hundred farmers visit the site every day and carry out a sit-in from 11am to 5pm. This is yet another attempt to intensify their nearly eigh-month-ling protest against three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year.Asking the Haryana government to let farmers do the flag hoisting in Jind, on Independence Day, Tikait said, "People of Jind are revolutionaries, if they have said they won't let ministers unfurl the national flag in their villages, then they won't. What will the ministers do by hoisting flags? Let farmers do it on August 15."The farmer leader further said that 'jatha' (group) of farmers from Moradabad, Hapur and Amroha - all in Uttar Pradesh - will come to the protest site in Delhi and carry out a tractor parade on roads on August 15.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year demanding the scrapping of three agri laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Several rounds of talks have taken place between the Centre and the farmers but the impasse remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independence-day-rakesh-tikait-says-farmers-to-hold-tractor-rally-in-delhi-101627275654081.html

This is the biggest-ever seizure of pangolin scales in Odisha.Dhenkanal divisional forest officer (DFO) Prakash Chand Gogineni said the scales were seized from Damodarnali area of Kapilash range in Dhenkanal district following an intelligence input from the WCCB. The DFO said that Ratnakar Rout (51) and Firoj Khan (52), from Dhenkanal town, had stored the pangolin scales at a godown in Banasinga area of Sarangi range in the division."They were collecting scales from poachers within Dhenkanal and nearby areas, but could not sell it due to the pandemic. Our team posing as customers struck a deal with the smugglers and arrested them," he said. The joint team has seized a two-wheeler and two mobile phones from their possession.Last month, the special task force of the crime investigation department (CID) had seized 4.82 kgs of pangolin scales from a village in Mayurbhanj district. In April this year, a live pangolin was rescued by the Special Task Force (STF) in Cuttack district. During the last 1 year, STF has seized 3 live pangolins and 10 kg pangolin scales.The Indian pangolin is a solitary, shy, slow moving, nocturnal mammal that is protected under Schedule I of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. It is also listed under the Appendix I of the International Convention of Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that prohibits its commercial trade. According to the IUCN Pangolin Specialist Group, poaching for illegal international trade for meat and scales, primarily destined for Asia, mainly China and Vietnam, are the main threats to pangolins resulting in declining populations of the species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-14-kg-of-pangolin-scales-seized-in-odisha-s-biggest-ever-recovery-101627271205716.html

Kerala logged over 17,000 new cases, pushing its infection caseload to 3,271,530. Government data also showed that about half of India’s Covid deaths since April 2020 were reported in just two months, April and May this year, underscoring the devastation that the second wave unleashed.As on Sunday morning, 453,770,580 had been provided to the states and Union Territories.

26-07-2021||India||Congress sees strife in Chhattisgarh, MLA accuses minister of conspiracy||Congress, which is reportedly dealing with internal strifes in its Punjab and Rajasthan units, now faces inklings of a conflict in Chhattisgarh. Brihaspat Singh, a party MLA, alleged on Sunday that an attack was carried out on his convoy a day prior at the behest of state health minister TS Singh Deo. "The accused, while allegedly attacking my convoy's follow vehicle, were asking for me from my security personnel," Singh was quoted as saying. "It means the plan was to attack me."Also Read | Chhattisgarh Cong MLA alleges his convoy was ‘attacked’ at behest of ministerBrihaspat Singh, Congress MLA from the Ramanujanj constituency, alleged that one of the persons who attacked his convoy in the Ambikapur town on Saturday evening was a distant relative of Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo.Singh indicated that the health minister, once a leading contender for the post of the chief minister in Chhattisgarh, may not have taken the MLA's comments praising CM Bhupesh Baghel for his work; hence the attack. "Recently, during a press conference, I said that there is no rotational chief minister post arrangement in the state and that chief minister Bhupesh Bahel has been doing a great job," the Congress MLA said while speaking to reporters. "If he continues to do the same work he will remain in the post for the next 20-25 years."Also Read | Bhupesh Baghel to work in UP if Congress wants someone else as Chhattisgarh CMFor context, the CM post-sharing formula has been the talking point in Chhattisgarh's political circle after Congress came to power in December 2018 when Baghel and his two senior cabinet colleagues T S Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu were the top contenders for the post. Since then speculations were rife that consensus was built for the top post based on a two-and-a-half-year power-sharing formula between Baghel and Singh Deo.Highlighting the matter, Brihaspat Singh said, "It is very unfortunate that family members of the state's health minister attacked (my convoy) on his directions." The Congress MLA claimed that if he would have been in "that car" (his follow vehicle), he would have been "attacked with guns."Reacting to the allegations, Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo simply said that the people in his area and in the state know him very well and are aware of his image in the public domain. "In Surguja and parts of the state, people know more about me than myself," the minister, who represents the Surguja seat, was quoted as saying. "There is nothing more to say than this. My image is completely in the public domain, nothing is hidden.”(With inputs from HT correspondent)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-sees-strife-in-chhattisgarh-mla-accuses-minister-of-conspiracy-101627266431783.html

However, at the same time, strict monitoring should be followed daily for various aspects like daily cases, positivity rates, bed occupancy as well as liquid-oxygen consumption,” said Dr Salunkhe.He said the timings of the shops can be extended from the closing time of 4pm along with an emphasis on vaccination of those working in these establishments. However, Salunkhe said, local trains need to be opened in a staggered manner. “There should be strict enforcement on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he added.The Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association, an association of restaurant owners, has petitioned the government to extend the timings. “The government needs to allow us to operate till at least 11pm as the cases have come down drastically. We are ready to operate at 50% capacity and also follow all guidelines. The rules need to be relaxed as we are unable to sustain at all in this restrictive timings,” said Shetty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-6-843-new-covid-cases-state-may-relax-some-curbs-101627268011170.html

26-07-2021||India||Urban poor, rural population ill-prepared to deal with Covid at home: Survey||The poor in urban areas and those in rural India are not prepared to deal with Covid-19 at home, many did not have the basic medical equipment to check vital health parameters and also lacked awareness about the symptoms of the coronavirus disease, a survey conducted across 10 states has said.The survey was conducted by Sambodhi Panels, an initiative of Sambodhi Research and Communications, between June 30 and July 11 in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan. It came just after the peak second wave of the pandemic and as several states eased Covid-19 restrictions. It also comes at a time when experts have warned of the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic.Also read | Half of total Covid-19 deaths logged between April, MayThe survey by the research organisation shows that among 7,116 households only around 20 per cent had thermometers and about 50 per cent had drugs available to treat symptoms like fever and headaches. "Only 9 per cent households had oximeters while a dismal 3 per cent had access to oxygen cylinders. Also, only 40 per cent of respondents were aware of medical suppliers/shops nearby to access in case they had COVID symptoms," Sambodhi Panels said in its survey.According to the survey, people in the 10 states are largely uninformed about newer variants of the coronavirus and the symptoms associated with the disease.The respondents also did not know when to take a person with Covid-19 to the hospital, the survey showed. About 35 per cent of the respondents said that patients should be hospitalised at the onset of the first symptom and 18 per cent were of the view that a Covid positive result was reason enough to get the person admitted to a hospital."It seems that there is a need to increase information dissemination among vulnerable sections of society on newer Covid variants, associated symptoms and recommended treatment protocols so that people take appropriate measures," Swapnil Shekhar, co-founder of Sambodhi, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | Covid-19 can infect embryos, result in miscarriages: StudyNearly respondents or 95 per cent were able to associate at least one of the early symptoms to Covid-19 such as fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing and headaches. And only 18 per cent of them associated diarrhoea with Covid-19 and just 4 per cent and 2 per cent with conjunctivitis and skin rashes respectively.However, the survey shows around 88 per cent knew about how to care for Covid-19 patients at home and 70 per cent of the respondents said they had arrangements for isolating Covid positive family members and 76 per cent said they would be able to arrange food for them.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/urban-poor-rural-population-ill-prepared-to-deal-with-covid-at-home-survey-101627258486744.html

On this day every year, the Prime Minister pays his tributes to the armed forces at the 'eternal flame', Amar Jawan Jyoti, at India Gate in Delhi. Celebrations are also conducted in the Kargil sector and elsewhere across the country to commemorate the contributions of the Indian Army.Dubbed 'Operation Vijay', the military campaign held in the month of July in 1999 saw the Indian Army troops clearing the Kargil sector of the infiltrators, which included both Pakistani soldiers and rebel forces.

26-07-2021||India||From jobless construction worker to YouTube sensation, Odia man gets a mention in Mann ki Baat||Soon after the lockdown was announced last year in the wake of the Covid outbreak in India, 35-year-old Isak Munda, a tribal construction worker from a remote village of Sambalpur district in Odisha lost his job. With no money and four kids and a wife waiting for food at home, Munda was desperate for work.A Class-7 pass-out, Munda thought of earning money by uploading videos on YouTube and monetizing those. He took a loan of ₹3,000 from a microfinance company and uploaded a clip of him having rice and sambar at his house. As the video went viral he started posting more such videos on YouTube becoming an Internet sensation which brought him lakhs of rupees from the social media site for the viral videos.On Sunday his sudden fame on YouTube earned him praise from PM Modi during his Mann ki Baat radio talk when the PM said the Odia tribal youth was celebrating culture as well as cuisine and motivating everyone.“His initiative is unique in many ways, especially because it provides an opportunity to the urban people to see a lifestyle of which they know very little. In his video, he highlights local delicacies, traditional recipes, his village, lifestyle, family and food habits,” the prime minister said.A visibly elated Munda said he never thought PM Modi would talk about his videos. “My and I family are feeling very happy about it. I would keep posting more such videos,” he said over the phone from his village Babupali in Jujumara block of Sambalpur.It was on March 26 last year when Munda first uploaded a clip of him having rice and sambar at his thatched house.After losing his livelihood, he was watching videos on his mobile phone when a video popped up. In the video, the presenter suggested making videos and uploading them on YouTube to earn money. He watched the video on a loop and decided to give it a try.He soon created a YouTube channel called “Isak Munda eating”, he started posting 3-7 minutes-long video clips wherein he would consume staple food of fermented rice with green chilli or sometimes mutton and chicken curry. The first video of him eating rice and sambar garnered 7.7 lakh views, his most popular one so far, while the subsequent ones also gathered views ranging from 60,000 to 7 lakh. Most of his videos showed him having fermented rice, mushroom curry, egg curry, fish curry and tomato curry with his wife, an eight-year-old daughter, a six-year-old son, a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter.With more and more people subscribing to his YouTube account, the social media platform started sharing its revenue with Munda as advertising is the most common way for YouTube creators to earn money on the platform. Advertising revenue is generated when people watch advertisements that run on YouTube videos. Munda’s miseries ended in July last year when he received ₹37,000 in his bank account from YouTube. A month later, he got ₹5 lakh as people started liking his videos.With the money from YouTube, Munda’s life has started looking up as he built a pucca house for his family and bought furniture. He now has over 7.7 lakh subscribers, far higher than some Odia news channels. He is being invited to people’s homes for dinner while video bloggers are visiting him to show his rise to fame. “I earn around ₹2 lakh a month. I would help my near and dear with the money that I am earning from YouTube,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-jobless-construction-worker-to-youtube-sensation-odia-man-gets-a-mention-in-mann-ki-baat-101627242448522.html
26-07-2021||India||BSY govt completes 2 years today, decision on his future as CM likely||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said on Sunday a decision on whether he will remain in office was likely to be known by Monday, the day his government completes two years in office.Preparations for a grand event to commemorate the second anniversary of the Yediyurappa government are underway at the Karnataka Vidhan Soudha, even as there is no clarity regarding the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) decision on his future as the chief minister. On Thursday, Yediyurappa said that following the event, an announcement on whether he will continue as the CM will be made.He said he will speak on the achievements of his government at the function, as planned, on Monday. “After that, other things you will come to know”.Talking to reporters in Belagavi on Sunday morning, the Lingayat strongman said that no decision had been conveyed to him by the BJP high command so far. He was in the district to inspect flood-hit areas. On his return to Bengaluru later in the evening, Yediyurappa said the situation remained the same.“I’m going to work till the last minute. If they (central leadership) ask me to continue as the chief minister, I will. If they ask to resign, I will do so and continue working for the party,” he said in Bengaluru.When asked when the decision could be made known to him, he said: “I hope that the decision will be given by today (Sunday evening) or tomorrow (Monday) morning.” Yediyurappa said he will continue to work for the party for another 15-20 years.Amid speculation about a change of guard in Karnataka, BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday ruled out any leadership crisis in the state and said Yediyurappa has done good work. “Karnataka is doing well. Yediyurappa is taking care of the things in his own way.” When asked if there was a leadership crisis in the state, Nadda said: “That is what you feel. We don’t feel so.”During this visit to flood-affected areas in Belagavi on Sunday morning, when questioned about the possibility of a Dalit chief minister replacing him, Yediyurappa said: “I’m not the one to decide about it, it is for the high command to decide. Let’s first see what decision they will take…”Asked whether he was satisfied with his work in the last two years, he said: “If you are satisfied, that’s enough for me.”Reiterating that he will abide by the decision of the central leadership, the 78-year-old said he was “content and satisfied” and will not cross the disciplinary line. “I got most of the positions in the party which no one else might have got in Karnataka, for which I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and party president JP Nadda”, Yediyurappa said.While the BJP is yet to make any announcement, Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said the state government is interested more in politics than issues affecting the people.“People of the state are struggling to save their lives due to flood and Covid and the government has failed to save them. Hence, he (the CM) has asked to dissolve this assembly and go to the people and get a fresh mandate.”Speaking to reporters at his Sadashivanagar residence in Bengaluru, he said: “Dissolve the current assembly and face the elections. Let us see who will form a new government as per the people’s mandate. The day Yediyurappa took over, he himself mentioned that a big political instability is prevailing. This is his administration and this is his gift to the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-govt-completes-2-years-today-decision-on-his-future-as-cm-likely-101627237827595.html
26-07-2021||India||Telangana temple conferred UNESCO heritage tag||The Ramappa temple at Palampet in Telangana’s Warangal has been conferred the tag of UNESCO World Heritage site, the culture ministry said on Sunday.“It gives me immense pleasure to share that @UNESCO has conferred the World Heritage tag to Ramappa Temple at Palampet, Warangal, Telangana. On behalf of the nation, particularly from people of Telangana, I express my gratitude to Hon PM @narendramodi for his guidance & support,” Union Culture Minister G Kishan Reddy said in a tweet.Ramappa temple, a 13th century engineering marvel named after its architect, Ramappa, was proposed by the government as its only nomination for the UNESCO World Heritage site tag for the year 2019.“Excellent! Congratulations to everyone, specially the people of Telangana. The iconic Ramappa Temple showcases the outstanding craftsmanship of great Kakatiya dynasty. I would urge you all to visit this majestic Temple complex and get a first-hand experience of its grandness,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.As many as 22 sites in the southeastern Chinese city of Quanzhou including a temple with links to Hinduism were inscribed on to the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday.The new listing of “Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China” by the world’s top cultural organisation boosts the credentials of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s maritime silk road, the sea route part of the Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI), which aims to link China with Asia and beyond through infrastructure projects on land and sea.China has been promoting the coastal province Fujian and the city of Quanzhou as an important ancient sea trade zone where multicultural communities including from Tamil Nadu mingled a millennia ago.The listing decision was made on Sunday during the UNESCO World Heritage Committee’s 44th ongoing online session chaired from Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian, the same province where Quanzhou is located.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi had decided to establish “sister-state relations” between Tamil Nadu and Fujian during the latter’s visit to Mamallapuram for the second informal summit in October, 2019 – it was because of Quanzhou’s ancient links with Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-temple-conferred-unesco-heritage-tag-101627237770269.html
26-07-2021||India||After six-month delay, start-up targets satellite launch in October||The earth observation satellite developed by the Indian start-up Pixxel will target an October launch with Indian Space Research Organisation mission, a company official said on Sunday. The satellite was to be launched aboard the PSLV-C51 mission in February this year but the company had to back out due to a last minute glitch in the software.“There was a problem with GPS acquisition and logging in the satellite which we were able to resolve in a couple of days. But we had missed the window to ship the satellite to ISRO launch site. The satellite is completely ready and we used the time to do another round of testing. We were waiting for the next opportunity that ISRO mission would go to the orbit we need. We will be launching the satellite in October,” said Awais Ahmed, founder and CEO of the company (incorporated as Sygyzy).The work on the second satellite, in a planned constellation of 36, is also 60% complete and is likely to be launched in December. “We have been working on two more satellites in parallel; they are 30% complete and will be launched next year,” said Ahmed.The company aims to complete the constellation of hyperspectral satellites by 2023.This would be first satellite by an Indian start-up; barring the satellite of the non-profit SpaceKidz India that was launched as per a non-commercial agreement by ISRO on PSLV C51 mission in February. The PSLV C51 mission carried on board a three-satellite system developed by an industry consortium and SindhuNetra by DRDO for monitoring the Indian Ocean Region.Pixxel is designing the world’s highest resolution hyperspectral imaging satellites that can provide 10 to 50 times more detailed information. “A normal phone camera works in the visible RBG range, whereas something like a night goggle works in the infrared range. A hyperspectral image can capture data in both visible and infrared spectrum thereby providing great details,” said Ahmed. Explaining it further, he said, “If we take agriculture for example, our satellite will be able to provide granular data on not just the health of soil but the nutrients present in it. It will be able to identify the crop. It will be able to tell whether the crop has been under-irrigated or over-irrigated from soil moisture data.”After a break of over four months due to the second wave of the pandemic, ISRO is targeting a launch next month of its own earth observation satellite GISAT 1 (also known as EOS-3 as per the new nomenclature). The satellite launch was postponed last year after a technical glitch and then later because of the ongoing pandemic.Ahmed said that the opening up of the space sector last year was a great help for start-ups like his. Pixxel had initially planned launches with the Russian space agency and had to get the testing done in Netherlands.“Testing a satellite in another country is expensive and time consuming. Once the space sector was opened up in the country, we wanted to go with ISRO for the launch. What was better, we were able to use the ISRO satellite testing facility in Bangalore. This was the first time that their testing facility was opened up for a commercial satellite. Not only did we get the facility, which would have been expensive to set up. We also got the expertise of scientists who have been testing all ISRO satellites,” said Ahmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-six-month-delay-start-up-targets-satellite-launch-in-october-101627237587576.html
26-07-2021||India||Half of total Covid-19 deaths logged between April, May||About half of India’s Covid-19 deaths since April 2020 were reported in just two months, April and May this year, according to government data, which underlines how deadly the second wave of the pandemic in the country was and how it overwhelmed the health care infrastructure.Forty-one per cent of the total Covid-19 deaths in April and May in India came from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi, according to the data shared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) with HT in reply to a Right To Information application.NCDC said that of the 329,065 people who died of Covid-19 between April 2020 and May 2021, 166,632 fatalities were reported in April and May 2021. As many as 120,770 people died in May and 45,882 in April, two months when the second wave of the pandemic was raging across the country.Close to 60% of the total Covid-19 deaths in 14 months in Delhi, Karnataka and Punjab, took place in April and May this year, the data shows.In June, 69,354 Covid-19 deaths were recorded, which included those added after data was reconciled. Before April-May, the highest deaths reported in a month was in September 2020, with 33,035 deaths. September-October was considered the peak of the first Covid-19 wave.All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that the devastation of the second wave should prepare people for the third wave, especially with the possibility of new variants emerging. “As of now, there are no signs to indicate that third wave would be as lethal as the second one,” he added.Experts said that the indications of another Covid-19 wave began emerging in March this year, when the Covid-19 deaths more than doubled nationally, with spikes seen in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat. This was also the time when political parties were aggressively campaigning for assembly elections in Assam, Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu and preparations were being made for the Mahakumbh in Haridwar.“The (increased) deaths indicate that state governments ignored the second wave signs and reacted late,” said Dr Shaheed Jamil, who earlier headed the central government’s advisory group on Covid-19 genome sequencing.NCDC is the health ministry’s nodal agency to maintain all Covid-19 disease records under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). However, non-Covid-19 deaths are not reported to IDSP, NCDC joint director Dr Vinay Kumar Garg said in the RTI response. He added that they don’t have data on the cause of deaths reported during the pandemic.Uttar Pradesh, which reported a total of 20,346 deaths between April 2020 and May 2021, recorded 8,108 deaths in May, 2021, and 3,438 in April, 2021. Its neighbour, Uttarakhand, which has 1/20th of UP’s population, reported 3,899 deaths in May, which is 48% of the total deaths in Uttar Pradesh for that month. Close to 1,100 Covid-19 deaths that took place in April and May in Uttarakhand were reconciled in the June data and not reflected in NCDC’s May Covid-19 death data.Bihar, which reported 2,624 deaths in May, added 3,951 deaths in the first week of June, taking the death toll to 6,575. These cases were added after the Patna high court asked the state government to conduct an audit of all deaths in the state. “This includes deaths that took place in April and May,” said a senior Bihar health department official, asking not to be named.Dr DS Negi, director general, medical health, Uttar Pradesh, said their strategy was to test, trace and treat suspected patients, which helped in quick isolation of positive cases and identification of contacts. “This helped us to identify positive Covid cases and isolate them early. Patients got critical care and we could save many lives,” he said.If Covid deaths of all states are compared, Maharashtra reported the highest Covid-19 deaths (26,859) among Indian states in May followed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Delhi.The highest death rate for a million people for both the entire Covid-19 period and April-May this year was of Goa followed by Delhi, Puducherry, Maharashtra, Chandigarh and Uttarakhand, showed the analysis of NCDC’s death data along with the 2021 Census population projection.“We are reporting all the deaths because our surveillance is stringent and our machinery is robust. Not just Covid, we are topping deaths due to Swine Flu and its cases. This isn’t anything to be proud of but it is because we report all deaths. This year, we have reported around 80,000 deaths due to Covid-19,” said Maharashtra surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said: “While we understand the gravity of the situation it is also important for one to understand that the data presented by the Delhi government has been completely transparent at all points, even if it gave others the opportunity to take jibes at us.” Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said despite a spurt in Covid cases, the state was able to save many lives because of adequate health facilities.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on July 20, said health was a state subject and the central government has provided all help to the states. “Due to concerted actions of central and state governments, the isolation bed capacity and ICU bed capacity, which was merely 10,180 and 2,168 before the first lockdown (as on 23rd March 2020), could be increased to 18,21,420 isolation beds and 1,21,671 ICU beds (as on 16th July 2021),” he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/half-of-total-covid-19-deaths-logged-between-april-may-101627237468817.html
26-07-2021||India||In Mann Ki Baat, Modi urges citizens to lead ‘Unite India movement’||Ahead of the 75th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called on Indians to follow the “Nation First, Always First” mantra and lead a “Bharat Jodo Andolan” (Unite India Movement) in the same manner Mahatma Gandhi led the “Bharat Chhoro Andolan” (Quit India Movement) in 1942.“Just like Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi) led the ‘Bharat Chhoro Andolan’ (Quit India movement), every Indian must lead the ‘Bharat Jodo Andolan’ (Unite India Movement). It is our responsibility that we do our work in such a manner that it helps in uniting our country which is full of diversities,” Modi said in his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast. The need of the nation is to unite and work towards national progress, he added.The PM also reiterated the Centre’s plan to celebrate “Amrit Mahotsav” to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence in a befitting manner through several programmes, and highlighted the culture ministry’s initiative to have a record number of Indians sing the national anthem together. “On the 15th of August this time…this is an endeavour connected with the National Anthem. It’s an effort on [the] part of the ministry of culture to have a maximum number of Indians sing the national anthem together… I hope you connect yourselves with this novel initiative,” the Prime Minister said.For this, he added, a website http://rashtragan.in has been created where people upload their renditions of the anthem.During his address, Modi also wished the Indian contingent participating in the Tokyo Olympics and called on people to support the team on social media by joining the “Victory Punch Campaign”. “You also share your victory punch along with your team and cheer for India,” he said.PM Modi also spoke about the Kargil Diwas on Monday, observed in honour of the those killed during the 1999 war when Indian forces recaptured crucial strategic heights and the Indian territory that was surreptitiously captured by Pakistani forces.In his address, the Prime Minister spoke of a number of people such as farmers cultivating apples and ‘ber’ (Indian jujube) to earn livelihood, a Chandigarh food stall owner offering free Chole Bhature to vaccinated people.Among other issues, the Prime Minister highlighted the importance of adhering to Covid-appropriate protocols ahead of the upcoming festivals, saying: “You must remember that Corona has not yet gone from amongst us. You must not forget the protocols related to Corona.”He also urged people to conserve water, and pointed out how “we used to yearn for rainfall and therefore saving every single drop of water has been part of our customs”.Citing a study conducted by MyGov, the PM highlighted that close to 75% of people sending messages and suggestions for Mann Ki Baat are below the age of 35 years. “It means Mann Ki Baat is being guided by the views of the youth of India. Mann Ki Baat is a medium where there is positivity and sensitivity,” he said.Ahead of the PM’s address, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioned the pace of Covid-19 vaccination, and said had the country’s “Mann ki Baat” been understood, such would not have been the state.“Had you understood the country’s ‘Mann ki Baat’, such would not have been the state of vaccinations,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, with the hashtag “WhereAreVaccines”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mann-ki-baat-modi-urges-citizens-to-lead-unite-india-movement-101627237287504.html
26-07-2021||India||Uneven, sub-par monsoon drags kharif sowing||An erratic monsoon, consistent with weather patterns thought to be linked to the climate crisis, has been a drag on India’s summer or kharif crops, with planting down 8% from a year ago, official data shows. Farmers have only a slim window or time-frame left for normal sowing, which is usually until the last week of July.The June-to-September rainy season is critical for the Indian economy, Asia’s third largest, as nearly half the population depends on the farm sector and almost 60% of the net-sown area lacks irrigation access.Good summer harvests, which boost rural income, are important to support the broader economy trying to recoup losses from a second wave of Covid-19 during April and May.The rain-bearing system, which was nearly 8% deficient around the middle of July since its onset, has picked up. The rain tapered off around June 19 unexpectedly. The deficit, as on July 25, has narrowed. The monsoon is now 1% lower than normal.Rainfall was fairly poor in many parts in the initial weeks of July, agriculturally the most critical month. More than the deficiency, this year’s uneven rain has been a cause of concern, agriculturally and climate-wise.When compared to normal levels for this time of the year, total sowing is down 3%, the latest available official data shows. Average acreage of the past five years is considered normal.“I expect sowing to catch up as the rains have revived,” said KJ Ramesh, a climatologist and former chief of the India Meteorological Department, the national weather forecast agency.Longer monsoon pauses and short spurts of very heavy rainfall are tell-tale signs of the climate crisis, experts say. “The consensus is that the number of rainy days will decrease because of climate change but overall quantum of rainfall will remain same. So, there will be segments or periods of very heavy rain,” Ramesh said.Jeet Singh Sandhu, vice-chancellor of the SKN Agricultural University, Jaipur, said: “Rainfall in the month of July is most important for kharif crops. The sowing window lasts till about July 25-28 after which late-sown varieties can be sown.” Most such crop varieties are a fallback option.“There could be a major shift in soybean, cotton and maize acreages across the rainfall deficit states if monsoon fails to revive as forecast,” said Hetal Gandhi, an economist with Crisil Ltd, Mumbai, a ratings firm.As on July 23, farmers have planted 72 million hectare in all compared to 79 last year. The normal area for the corresponding week is about 74 million hectares.The area under rice, the biggest summer staple, stands at nearly 20.7 million, which is nearly normal but less than the 22 million hectares sown last year.However, pulses sowing has taken a hit, with farmers being able to sow about 87 million hectare, which is 12% below normal. The country occasionally witnesses a shortage of pulses. Soaring prices of pulses prompted the government to invoke the Essential Commodities Act on July 7 to regulate its trade. The curbs were eased last week.The acreage for oilseeds, which give edible oil, stands at 14.5 million hectare against a normal of 14.7 million hectare. Coarse cereals have been sown on 11 million hectares, down from a normal of 13 million hectare, a 15% shortfall.India meets two-thirds of its domestic edible oil requirements through import. Last month, the government had to cut duties on edible palm oil by 5% and lifted restrictions in its imports to ease prices.The monsoon has dumped catastrophic excess rainfall in some states, such as Maharashtra, where flooding has claimed several lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uneven-sub-par-monsoon-drags-kharif-sowing-101627237227476.html
26-07-2021||India||Amid protests, govt looks to push key bills in House||After the first week of Parliament’s monsoon session was mostly washed out due to disruptions by the Opposition, the ruling dispensation plans to push key bills this week as there are just 14 working days remaining in the session, people aware of the developments said on Sunday.Protests rocked Parliament last week over the alleged targeting of phones with Israeli military-grade spyware, three controversial farm laws, and income tax raids at a newspaper office, forcing repeated adjournments and allowing little business to be conducted in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.“The passage of bills to replace ordinances are high in the priority of our legislative business. We have a total of 25 bills and the ordinances in this monsoon session,” a senior minister said on condition of anonymity.According to notices issues by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the government has listed five ordinances to be taken up during this week’s proceedings. They are: The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance and The Essential Defence Services Ordinance.The shelf life for an ordinance is up to six weeks after the first day of the subsequent Parliament session following its promulgation. If the government fails to replace the ordinances with bills in this session, the executive orders for laws will lapse and the government will need to bring fresh ordinances or let the temporary laws expire. The ordinance on air quality management in the national capital region and neighbouring areas expired in a similar fashion earlier this year.Another ordinance on The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) has not been brought as the Opposition and the government have reached an agreement that it will be sent to a select committee for further review, the people quoted above said.The government also wants to seek approval of the Lok Sabha for the Factoring Regulation Bill and The National Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management Bill in this week. These two bills were slotted in the last week but couldn’t be passed due to the din over the Pegasus snooping charges, fuel price hikes and the farm laws.The Upper House of Parliament has listed The Marine Aids to Navigation Bill and The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill.In the five days of the Monsoon Session of Parliament since Monday last week, only a debate on the Covid-19 pandemic in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday can be counted as substantive business so far, underlining the Opposition’s emphasis on protests over discussions on the other issues.The government and the chairmen of both Houses have repeatedly urged protesting MPs to participate in debates.Amid this planned flurry of legislative business, both Houses are also expected to discuss the country’s economic situation, a pet topic of the opposition parties. “It is likely to be discussed on Thursday in the Rajya Sabha,” a senior MP said, asking not to be named.But uncertainty over the legislative agenda continues as the Opposition is determined to carry over their last week’s protests into this week. The Congress is likely to demand a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the Pegasus issue and will only allow a debate on the snooping charges if the Union home minister participates in the debate, a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.Other opposition parties including the Trinamool Congress are also likely to step up their offensive against the government and participate in little business. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is visiting Delhi on Monday and her presence (she is set to come to the party’s parliamentary office) is likely to boost her party’s fight in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-protests-govt-looks-to-push-key-bills-in-house-101627237168993.html
26-07-2021||India||India ready to discuss rights, democracy with US’s Blinken||India has signalled that it is open to engaging on human rights and democracy with those who recognise the value of diversity in the backdrop of reports that US secretary of state Antony Blinken will raise these issues during his visit to New Delhi this week.Ahead of Blinken’s visit that has been scheduled on July 27 and 28, US acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asian affairs Dean Thompson said last week that both human rights and democracy would be raised during the secretary of state’s engagements in India.“With respect to the human rights and democracy question, yes, you’re right; I will tell you that we will raise it, and we will continue that conversation because we firmly believe that we have more values in common on those fronts than we don’t,” Thompson said in response to a question during a news briefing on July 23.“And we believe India is going to be a really important part of continuing those conversations and building strong efforts on those fronts in partnership as we go forward,” he added.People familiar with the planning for Blinken’s visit said on condition of anonymity on Sunday that India, as a long-standing pluralistic society, is open to engaging with those who recognise the value of diversity.“Issues such as human rights and democracy are universal and extend beyond a particular national or cultural perspective. India is proud of its achievements in both domains and is always glad to share experiences,” one of the people cited above said.The Indian side will also raise global issues such as political and cultural rebalancing, especially New Delhi’s support for a multi-polar, democratic and diverse world order. The Indian side expects international conversations on these issues to reflect this evolution.“We believe in equity and fairness, whether in development, climate change or global decision-making,” the person cited above said.Discussions during Blinken’s visit will also cover working together at the United Nations, especially with India holding the presidency of the Security Council in August.Despite the growing convergence between India and the United States on security and strategic issues as well as the fight against Covid-19, human rights and freedom of expression have emerged as potential irritants between the two sides. Following the scrapping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, the US had called for the easing of restrictions on the region.In February, during his first phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after assuming office, US President Joe Biden had “underscored his desire to defend democratic institutions and norms around the world and noted that a shared commitment to democratic values is the bedrock for the US-India relationship”.Also in February, the US had urged the Indian government to resume talks with protesting farmers who have gathered on the outskirts of New Delhi since late 2020. The American side has in the recent past also expressed concerns over India’s amended citizenship law.The Indian side has usually rejected such criticism by foreign governments, including the US, and said the country’s institutions and Constitution provide adequate safeguards for human rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ready-to-discuss-rights-democracy-with-us-s-blinken-101627236927473.html
26-07-2021||India||Assam opted for growth by re-electing BJP: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that the people of Assam voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the second consecutive term because “they have permanently given up agitations, terrorism and arms in favour of development”.“A lot has been written and discussed about the BJP’s return to power in Assam. In my view, the party’s win means that Assam has permanently given up agitations, terrorism and arms in favour of development,” Shah said in Guwahati — his first visit to the region since the April-May election in Assam, in which the BJP swept to victory.Giving the analogy of construction, Shah said the first five years of the BJP government in Assam were akin to the laying of the foundation of a building, and the next five will be spent on the construction of it.Shah said that the faith reposed by the voters in the BJP once again showed that they approved of the five years of the government headed by Sarbananda Sonowal and were confident that chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma would carry on with the good work.“Only in the BJP you can witness an incumbent CM making way for another after running a state successfully for five years, and Sonowal happily welcomed Sarma. The move has benefited Assam as Sonowal is now a cabinet minister while Sarma handles the state,” the home minister said.Shah, who was on a two-day visit to Meghalaya and Assam, mentioned that it is the first instance since Independence that the northeast has five ministers in the Union cabinet. He said development of the region is a priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He informed that a new peace deal with insurgent groups in the Karbi Anglong region of Assam will be signed soon, and all peace accords signed with groups in the northeast will be implemented.Shah laid the foundation stone of a new medical college hospital at Tamulpur in lower Assam and launched an Assam government scheme to provide ₹1 lakh each to the family members of the nearly 5,000 people who died due to Covid-19 in the state by handing over cheques to three beneficiaries.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also spoke at the gathering and listed the schemes launched by his government to provide financial aid to various people affected by Covid-19: children who lost parents, women who lost husbands and families that lost their loved ones.Shah had earlier inaugurated a new radiotherapy block and linear acceleration machine at the State Cancer Institute attached to the Guwahati Medical College. He returned to Delhi after the event.Earlier in the day, Shah visited Sohra (Cherrapunjee) in Meghalaya, which was formerly the wettest place on earth. He was accompanied by Union ministers G Kishan Reddy, BL Verma and Jitendra Singh, Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma and officials of the Assam Rifles, Shah planted saplings as part of a green drive called Green Sohra Plantation Drive. It’s part of the Assam Rifles’ Sohra Afforestation Project that is spread over almost 10,000 hectares.Shah then inaugurated the Greater Sohra Water Supply Scheme funded by the ministry for the development of the northeastern region or DoNER under the North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme with a sanctioned amount of ₹2,481.25 lakh.CM Conrad Sangma called it a first-of-its-kind initiative of the Meghalaya government to bring together the ministry of home affairs, defence officials, and village communities for a novel and humanitarian purpose in the field of natural resource management in a very important and ecologically fragile landscape.The home minister also paid floral tributes at the statue of Swami Vivekananda at Ramakrishna Mission, Sohra.Earlier on Saturday, Shah met a delegation of the Meghalaya cabinet led by CM Sangma and promised that the Centre would examine in detail the demand for the implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) in Meghalaya.Rural development minister Hamletson Dohling told journalists after the meeting that the minister gave them a patient hearing. Dohling claimed that this is the first time that the Union government has given the state a chance to raise the issue at the national level.“He (Shah) gave a patient hearing when I raised this issue. He said that he would look into it and let us know (about the Centre’s decision),” he said.On Saturday evening, the home minister met with the leaders of a few select civil society groups to discuss their demands, especially for ILP and solution of the boundary row with Assam. Attendees later said there was no commitment from the top National Democratic Alliance leader and it remained a routine assemblage.“The Union home minister only listened to our submission on the ILP but there was no assurance or commitment on it, which is a big insult to the people of the state,” Khasi Students Union president Lambokstarwell Marngar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-opted-for-growth-by-re-electing-bjp-shah-101627236928094.html
26-07-2021||Today's||The big picture is of convergence||Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s visit will be the latest of a half-dozen high-level interactions between India and the new United States (US) administration.Superficially, bilateral relations are marked by the minor and the messy. The haste of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, irritants in the trade and digital sphere, Congressional lectures over Russian S-400 missiles, and the state of civil rights in the Narendra Modi government dominate headlines. These problems exist, but they are marginal to the larger relationship.Washington and New Delhi have never been geopolitically closer than today, though some gaps still need filling. The disjointed world of the pandemic means grand strategic statements are left unsaid while small frictions get amplified. Most notably, the two leaders — Modi and Joe Biden — have yet to meet face-to-face.Also Read | US demonising China to build national purpose: Chinese diplomatThe drivers behind this convergence are evident in the US’s stated priorities. The most striking shift in President Biden’s worldview is his attitude towards China. Beijing has moved from being a country of interest to a clear and present danger. Two years ago, Biden was dismissive of talk that China was even a serious competitor. During his campaign, Quad received only a passing mention. Once in office, his geopolitical idee fixe is Beware the Dragon. He now talks of a world where autocracies and democracies are in mortal combat for the future of the 21st century. And the apex struggle is the US versus China.But the new administration does not see this as being just about carriers and missiles. Biden’s Indo-Pacific advisers note that in Chinese lore, the greatest generals are not those who defeat their enemies in pitched battle, but who defeat them without fighting. The heart of the new China response is domestic revival. Biden recognises that unless he heals the racial and class divides tearing his country apart, Donald Trump’s America First will become mainstream US thinking. China will win the eastern hemisphere by default. From this flows the need to build coalitions of the willing around technology and innovation with one common characteristic — reducing dependence on China. The administration has already issued a series of strategy papers on 5G, semiconductors, and more.There is an acceptance that the US is no longer a hegemon, just a first among equals. Polls show that American willingness to wear the badge of globocop is at historical lows. The present US economic boom is overly dependent on foreign funds. Less than a decade ago, Washington owed the world the equivalent of 17% of its Gross Domestic Product. Today, that figure is 67%. So Biden’s team has fashioned a strategy that adjusts to these new realities.There is a renewed emphasis on allies and partners. There is also a determination to end “forever wars” — unwinnable military commitments that leak blood, treasure, and public support but are no longer at the core of the US’s national interests. This means Afghanistan and Iraq, but also increasingly swathes of West and Central Asia. The one multilateral issue Biden is all sweet and light about is climate. “Climate is religion with the Biden team,” said one Indian official.Take a look at the priorities here and it becomes evident why US officials refer to India as a “defining relationship”. New Delhi is a big fit with almost all of these foreign policy goals. Whatever tack the US takes to handle China, it becomes much easier with India on board. Reportedly, Washington believes India and the US will be the core of Quad for at least the next few years. At least half the techno-alliances, such as the ones in Artificial Intelligence and pharmaceuticals, become more credible with India in the mix. The US also sees India as the perfect climate partner. Not only is the world’s third-largest carbon emitter at a tipping point but Modi is even more fervent about a green transition than Biden.The Biden foreign policy has so far found its primary opponent to be Covid-19. Washington has been as distracted by the need to jab its people as any other capital. Quad’s working groups have made minimal progress in large part because member-states have been riding out viral waves. Biden has pushed on ahead. His administration has been creating new strategic groupings, proposing summits on climate and democracy, and issuing a flurry of documents and papers. There is no certainty as to what will work, but the sense is that time is of the essence, and pushing out drafts is good enough. China, after all, is not standing still. Also the president’s “foreign policy for the middle classes” needs to get traction or else next year’s congressional elections may put the Republicans back in charge.The result of all this haste is a certain degree of confusion in US foreign policy statements. Senior Indian officials applaud the US’s general direction regarding China, but feel there are enough voices in Washington arguing for settling with Beijing that they still question the US’s commitment to Quad. What both sides agree is that the nature of India’s polity is a footnote in the relationship. Given China’s techno-totalitarianism, the persistence of Trumpism and its Afghan abandonment, Biden represents a much more humble Washington. Which is for the better as the two countries need to talk more about cabbages and kings, and less about whether pigs have wings.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-big-picture-is-of-convergence-101627299638397.html
26-07-2021||Today's||To understand Project Pegasus, return to Michel Foucault||The revelations from the Pegasus Project are sensational. They claim a military-grade spyware purportedly sold only to State-run entities had been used or were possibly deployed against journalists, dissidents, Opposition politicians, and individuals of interest in various countries.Yet, beyond the public’s immediate interest on questions such as who targeted whom, or the pique of those surveilled by Pegasus, lie some larger questions.Why are modern societies under constant surveillance? Is the world akin to a very large prison where individuals are watched? Are these somehow means to a desirable end? Or are we foredoomed, as George Orwell predicted? These questions are beyond the scope of the Pegasus Project for they belong in the distinct realm of political or economic philosophy. Suddenly, philosophy appears less abstract and inaccessible, as it helps us to problematise issues that matter in our daily lives.Also Read | Project Pegasus: India is at the crossroadsIf one wants to understand surveillance as a political concept, one cannot escape Frenchman Michel Foucault, one of the world’s most famous thinkers of the late 20th century. His works crisscrossed the sprawling boundaries of history, science, sexuality, philosophy, and economics. Foucault was primarily interested in analysing power, knowledge, and discipline.Keeping with the theme of this piece, which is to primarily answer the question of why modern society is constantly monitored, we have to first begin with Foucault’s explanation of power. For Foucault, knowledge is an inseparable twin of power, so much so that one doesn’t exist without the other.If power were a multi-storey building, then knowledge is its very foundation. If anybody or any institution wants to exercise power over you, then that entity first must have some basic knowledge about you. The deeper the knowledge, the more effective is the power that is applied.For instance, if the authorities want to apply their power to fine errant motorists on a busy street, they have to first have the knowledge of such drivers. That knowledge comes from CCTV cameras.What makes Foucault a celebrity scholar is that he studied the evolution of knowledge and parsed its consequences on our lives. One place to start understanding all this is, of course, his 1975 classic, Discipline and Punish.Everyone experiences power all the time — a student tied to his school desk; the security man guarding the door; the worker on his factory floor; the capitalist facing market power; and citizens subjected to the larger, hegemonic sovereign power of the State. The school is a specific site where power and discipline are exercised. All manifestations of power lead to social change.With the advent of democracy, at least in France, Foucault argued that modern society turned more humane. We no longer lash offenders in public squares. But whatever the form of government, the exercise of power is still at the core of its functions.The idea behind the exercise of sovereign power is to control people’s “bodies” and “minds” so that their behaviour could be changed to what is considered the norm or “normal” and even lawful. That’s why insane people were once consigned to mental asylums.Homosexuality was and is still (in some quarters) considered a break from “normal practice”, something to be “cured”.Power helps make citizens comply with what is deemed correct. The repeated exercise of power aims to create self-correcting obedient citizens. In some cases, this is necessary. You will, for instance, automatically stop at traffic red lights.However, the exercise of power can be unequal, unjust, and even work to benefit some, disadvantaging others. So, “where there is power, there is resistance…” Foucault writes. Gay people now resist their discrimination, and rightly so. Some deem the biometric Aadhaar a surveillance tool. Others see State power itself as intrusive.It is by a more grounded understanding of how, where, and why power is exercised that we can take the next rational steps to distinguish bad power from good.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-understand-project-pegasus-return-to-michel-foucault-101627289377548.html
26-07-2021||Editorials||The reckless exploitation of the fragile Himalayas||Nine tourists were killed and three others injured in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur district on Sunday when boulders fell on their vehicle during multiple landslides, triggered by heavy southwest monsoon rains. On July 12, heavy rain-triggered flash floods in the state’s Kangra district swept away three people, buildings, and vehicles. Uttarakhand too has seen its share of natural disasters this year, starting with the massive flash flood in Chamoli in February that killed more than 80 people.Also Read | Himachal landslide: 9 tourists dead, 3 injured; PM Modi expresses condolenceThe Himalayan landscape is susceptible to landslides. Formed due to the collision of Indian and Eurasian plates, the northward movement of the former puts continuous stress on the rocks, rendering them weak and prone to landslides and earthquakes. This, combined with steep slopes, rugged topography, high seismic vulnerability, and rainfall, make a deadly cocktail. Top this with the utter disregard for the fragile topography and climate-sensitive planning. From the mega road expansion project in the name of national security (Char Dham Highway) to building cascading hydroelectric power projects, from unplanned expansion of towns to unsustainable tourism (even in the middle of the pandemic), the Indian State has ignored warnings about the fragile ecology. Such an approach has also led to pollution, deforestation, and water and waste management crises.It is important to have early warning and better weather forecast systems, and a trans-boundary coalition of Himalayan countries to share and disseminate knowledge about the mountains. But what is most critical is to review the area’s present status and draw up a sustainable plan that respects the specific requirements of this fragile region and the impact of the climate crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-reckless-exploitation-of-the-fragile-himalayas-101627300298624.html
26-07-2021||Editorials||The end of the BSY era||When BS Yediyurappa resigned as Karnataka’s chief minister (CM) on Monday morning, it truly marked the end of an era for both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the state. For the party, Mr Yediyurappa was the last man standing from the old guard who had retained a position of power in the formal governance structure. Now 78, he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh over five decades ago and rose up the Jana Sangh and the BJP hierarchy — all the way from a district to state unit president; from a member of the legislative assembly first elected way back in 1983 to a member of Parliament elected in 2014 (the short national stint was only because he wanted to stay focused on the state); from a three-term leader of opposition in the assembly to a four-term chief minister, though two of those terms were of less than a week’s duration. But beyond the formal positions, it was Mr Yediyurappa’s blood, sweat, and tears that enabled the BJP to cross the rubicon and become a truly national party with an imprint in the south.Also Read | Why BS Yediyurappa matters for the BJP in KarnatakaIn the state, Mr Yediyurappa draws his power from the Lingayat community, which constitutes over 15% of the population and with a network of sub-religious institutions, wields disproportionate influence over politics. But the Karnataka satrap also went beyond his caste base to expand the BJP’s footprint among other communities. This multi-caste alliance has been a strength, but has also generated tensions as is visible in the battle for succession between leaders of Lingayat and non-Lingayat communities in the state. Mr Yediyurappa’s administrative record is hard to judge — for he never fulfilled a full term in office. But perhaps in a symbol of the close nexus that begun to mark the nature of India’s compromised crony capitalism in the 2000s, he faced corruption allegations on land and mining issues, most infamously due to his perceived links with the mining barons of Bellary. This eroded the party’s image as one with a difference.The BJP now has to ensure a smooth leadership transition, keeping all factions and castes happy. It also has to ensure that the exit doesn’t have implications for the stability of the government. Memories of its electoral setback when Mr Yediyurappa briefly left the party between 2012 and 2014 will be fresh in the BJP’s mind. And it has to ensure that Mr Yediyurappa does not cash a long shadow over his successor. How it navigates these challenges will determine the future of the party in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-end-of-the-bsy-era-101627297297983.html
