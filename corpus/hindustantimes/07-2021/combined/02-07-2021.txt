The total power demand in Ludhiana central zone is 6,400 MW, of which 2,800MW is utilised by the industry. Last year, the power consumption was 6,000 MW. “The increased power consumption in summer is causing the transformers to overload, resulting in unscheduled blackouts in certain areas,” a PSPCL official said.“We have had to replace transformers in some areas, which is a time-consuming process,” the official said, adding that a downpour would reduce the use of air conditioners and reduce the load on transformers. 10 to 12-hour power cuts After three transformers catering to Anand Nagar, Chander Nagar, Joshi Nagar, Pritam Nagar were damaged last night, residents had to manage without electricity for around 10 to 12 hours. Irked they lodged around 3,500 complaints on the helpline number (1912), but to no avail. An irate resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “Authorities must intimate the public about power cuts in advance so that we can plan our ‘work at home’, accordingly.” Residents of BRS Nagar also reported a three-hour power outage from 12.30pm to 3.30pm due to maintenance work. Mohit Sharma of Pritam Nagar, said, “It is difficult to stay without electricity for long periods. There was a power outage in our area last night. However, despite lodging several complaints power was resumed only after 4pm. The long power cut has affected all the eatables stored in the refrigerator.” Another resident from Chander Nagar, Kimti Rawal, said, “Power supply was disrupted in our area around 7pm yesterday and was resumed in the evening. Water supply was also affected due to the power outage.” “Besides, it is difficult to do without air conditioners in this heat. Authorities should have made contingency plans to prevent overloading of transformers before the summer season began,” Rawal added. PSPCL chief engineer, distribution (central), Bhupinder Singh Khosla, said, “Power consumption has increased by 400 MW this year. In the areas where transformers get damaged, workers swiftly make the repairs and resume power. All tubewells in the district have been provided an eight-hour power supply so farmers can irrigate their fields.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/twoday-industrial-shutdown-pspcl-unable-to-pull-the-plug-on-power-cut-101625250411113.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||JNPT denies non-compliance with Bombay HC order for transfer of mangroves to state||In a fresh affidavit filed before the Bombay high court (HC) on June 30, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) has denied allegations of non-compliance regarding the transfer of mangrove lands at the port authority’s property in Uran, Raigad to the forest department. On the heels of a 2004 petition filed by the Bombay Environment Action Group (BEAG), the HC, in September 2018, ordered that mangroves on all government land be transferred to the forest department within three months.As per an assessment by the forest department, there are around 1,194 hectares (ha) of mangroves in Uran that need to be handed over to the state for protection and to be notified as reserve forest under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Until February this year, JNPT’s website contained a declaration that it has 913.6 ha of mangroves on its land in Uran. This section has now been removed, as HT first reported on June 14. Till date, there has been no handover of mangroves from JNPT to the forest department.Given the long-standing delay, city-based NGO Vanashakti in December 2020 served a contempt notice to JNPT. Subsequently, in January this year, Vanashakti filed a fresh public interest litigation (PIL) to expedite HC’s final judgement from September 2018 which concerns protection for over 3,000 ha of mangroves across the state. The PIL also alleges that there has been wilful destruction and reclamation of mangroves by various authorities, including JNPT, in violation of environmental safeguards.In response to the petition, a JNPT representative has denied allegations that they “have violated or committed wilful disobedience of the (HC’s) final order and judgement”. This is on the grounds that JNPT were not a party to the original PIL filed by BEAG in 2006. Experts, however, contested this claim, saying HC’s directions are applicable to all government authorities, including JNPT. They also pointed out that JNPT has been previously penalised by HC-appointed mangrove protection and conservation committee for destroying at least 4,500 mangroves to make way for its container terminal-4 port expansion project.In their affidavit, JNPT also submitted that the state has not directly approached them seeking transfer of mangrove land. On the contrary, after receiving Vanashakti’s contempt notice in December, JNPT itself wrote to the mangrove cell in January, asking for “details about JNPT’s mangrove vegetation land out of 1194 hectares of Raigad district”. The forest department, on its part, has maintained that they do not have any idea about the extent of mangroves under JNPT’s jurisdiction, bringing the matter to a deadlock which, experts say, has only prolonged the final goal of bringing Uran’s mangroves under legal protection. The forest department subsequently wrote to JNPT administration in February and May this year, with the subject ‘Transferring Mangrove Forest to Mangrove Cell”. On February 12, Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell), had asked the port authority to notify mangrove area under its control under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act “at the earliest”.Stalin D, director of Vanashakti, criticised both JNPT and the forest department for the long-standing delay in bringing Uran’s mangroves under the purview of the Indian Forest Act. “The forest department is equally responsible for this lapse. While it is incorrect of JNPT to say they have not been approached, it is as much the responsibility of the forest department to have written to them earlier. Both parties have started passing the buck to each other only after contempt notices were sent out.”HT had reported on June 14 that JNPT has approached the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre (MRSAC) for demarcation of its mangrove area. “Following demarcation of mangrove area of JNPT through MRSAC after approval, the port trust may handover mangroves land to forest department,” a senior JNPT official had said to HT.Debi Goenka, a life member of BEAG and second petitioner in the initial PIL which led to the HC’s final judgement, also criticised both JNPT and the state government over inaction. “It seems neither the mangrove cell nor JNPT is interested in implementing the orders of the HC. It is shocking that both do not know what the area of mangroves within JNPT’s jurisdiction is. JNPT is also clearly aware of the proceedings, as they themselves had filed an application in the HC for permission to destroy 14 ha of mangroves for expansion of the port. Unfortunately, this permission was given to them even though the CRZ clearance obtained by JNPT specifically prohibited the destruction of mangroves. In this era of climate change, it is unfortunate that government agencies are wilfully disobeying the Bombay HC,” Goenka said.BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, which has been campaigning to save Uran’s mangroves, said, “JNPT is sitting on roughly 9 lakh mangroves, by the thumb rule of a 1,000 trees per hectare. That is the size of roughly 90 Azad Maidans. Given that they have been fined previously for destruction of mangroves, their dillydallying is extremely concerning. The fear is also that their excuse will also pave the way for other agencies to hold on to their mangrove, which rightfully should be transferred to the forest department immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jnpt-denies-non-compliance-with-bombay-hc-order-for-transfer-of-mangroves-to-state-101625250350494.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Yellow, amber, orange, red: Coloured action plan for Delhi’s Covid-19 response||An expert committee set up by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to guide the state government’s Covid-19 preparations is drafting a colour-coded action plan aimed to help the government put in place a string of measures, ranging from lockdown-like curbs to reserving hospital beds, to tackling an outbreak, a senior government official said on Friday.The committee has decided on four colour-coded alerts in increasing order of severity — yellow, amber, orange, and red. The alerts are similar to the plan the state puts in place as it tackles air pollution in the city in the winter, said the official.Under the Graded Response Action Plan, air quality scale is divided into several levels — moderate, poor, very poor, severe, and severe-plus or emergency. When the city’s air quality reaches a particular level, government and air quality monitoring and enforcement agencies are dictated to follow a list of dos and don’ts that need to be implemented.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Every alert will come with its own set of preventive and mitigatory measures,” said the official.“The aim is to avoid unnecessary delays. It is expected to give a better and more uniform sense of what nature and scale of restrictions are required to be implemented at what stage as new cases and other parameters such as positivity rate witness spike.”The eight-member expert committee, comprising doctors, heads of hospitals, and bureaucrats, is in the final stages of drafting the graded action plan. On May 27, Kejriwal set up the preparation committee along with another 13-member committee, which is focused on the medical and technical aspects of Covid-19 preparation, including medical oxygen, drugs, paediatrics, and so on. The eight-member committee has been tasked with drawing up guidelines on the announcement of a lockdown and the degrees of curbs that various Covid-19 scenario require, the number of tests that should be conducted in a day, containment policy, contact tracing targets, the reservation of hospital beds, and other such issues.“The committee is expected to prepare multiple action plans based on various combinations of factors such as new cases, test positivity rate, deaths, case fatality rate and active cases on a stage-by-stage basis,” said the senior government official.A colour-coded alert will be issued if a host of Covid-19 metrics meet a preset target, said the official. For instance, a particular alert will be issued — as part of the state’s daily health bulletin — if the test positivity rate remains a certain number for a fixed number of days, and the number of new cases cross a certain benchmark, on a certain number of occasions in that period.“The plan should be prepared in such a manner that each stage of the plan can be activated within a short time,” the official added.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said, “Such a strategy can be very useful in sending the right message to the masses. Currently, the government shares only numbers. Numbers that appear as a threat to me can seem relatively safe to another person. A colour-coded system can help bring in more objectivity and people can better assess what level of precautions to take at what stage. A graded action plan will also ensure better allocation of resources, protect the contact tracing and home isolation models and make triage easy for the surveillance teams.”Triage is the process of determining the priority of patients’ treatments by the severity of their condition or likelihood of recovery with and without treatment.Delhi witnessed its fourth and worst Covid-19 surge in April and May. At its peak, the city recorded more than 28,300 cases in a day on April 20 and a positivity rate higher than 30% in mid-April. A severe shortage of medical oxygen in the city during the wave – which also witnessed hospitals running out of beds, ICUs, ventilators and life-saving drugs – further contributed to the high number of deaths.On Friday, Delhi recorded 93 new cases and a positivity rate of 0.13%, the government’s health bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/yellow-amber-orange-red-coloured-action-plan-to-guide-delhi-s-covid-19-response-101625250172805.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Put barricades on Mumbai-Goa Highway, avoid accidents: HC to state, NHAI||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the public works department (PWD) of the state government to submit a report on the Mumbai-Goa Highway widening project after a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed claiming that the delay in completing the project was resulting in loss of lives due to accidents, which were occurring due to improper barricading of work areas. The HC also directed the authorities to ensure filling up of potholes that had developed due to monsoon to ensure safety of vehicular traffic. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Owais Pechkar, a resident of Chiplun in Konkan, was informed that he was a regular commuter on the Mumbai-Goa Highway and sought directions to the authorities to resolve the delay in the road-widening project as well as other issues faced by daily commuters of NH-66 who were at a risk of accidents due to potholes. Referring to an earlier PIL filed by him in 2018, Pechkar submitted that though the HC had directed NHAI and state to ensure that the highway was rid of potholes, nothing had been done so far, hence he was forced to file another PIL highlighting the same issues and others. In its 2018 order, the HC had suggested that the state rope in experts to suggest technologies to address the pothole problem over a longer period of time, but, Pechkar said, nothing had been done in that regard. After hearing the submissions, the bench concurred and asked NHAI and PWD to look into the issues including potholes as monsoon is underway and safety measures needed to be taken to avoid accidents and save lives. The court also said that it was the responsibility of the authorities to place warning signages and barricades where road-widening work was going on. It also sought a progress report of the highway widening work and asked the authorities to inform by when it would be completed. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state assured the court that the court’s observations would be conveyed to the officers concerned and who would respond in the next hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/put-barricades-on-mumbai-goa-highway-avoid-accidents-hc-to-state-nhai-101625250003110.html

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||BJP, farmers slam Punjab govt over power crisis in Ludhiana||With both domestic power consumers and industrialists disgruntled over the choppy power supply at the height of the heatwave, members of the Bhartiya Janata Party staged a protest against the Congress-led Punjab government and the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited outside the chief engineer’s office on Ferozepur Road on Friday. Heavy police force was deputed to ensure law and order. The BJP workers alleged that it was the state government’s mismanagement, which had led to the power crisis in the state.“On one hand the government has hiked the power tariff in the state, while on the other, they have failed to provide uninterrupted power supply to the farmers and industry,” they said. Slamming the PSPCL officials, the saffron party workers alleged that residents had been forced to bear the sweltering heat during prolonged power outages, while the PSPCL officials were themselves sitting in air conditioned rooms. Ludhiana BJP president Pushpinder Singal said, “The industry is already reeling under losses due to the ongoing pandemic and the unscheduled power cuts have added to their woes. Farmers are not getting power supply to water the paddy crop. All this due to the state government’s failure to meet the power supply demand sin the state.” BJP leaders threatened to agitate outside the subdivisional offices of the PSPCL, if the government failed to resolve the problem.Paddy crop getting damaged: BKU Lambasting the union government over rising fuel prices and the state government over its failure to provide uninterrupted power supply, which was damaging the paddy crop,the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Ekta (Ugrahan) staged a protest outside the mini secretariat. Protesting farmers submitted memorandums with the deputy commissioner’s (DC) office, the one on fuel prices was addressed to the Prime Minister and the one on power supply to the chief minister. They said the state government had promised to provide eight hours of uninterrupted power supply during paddy season, but power was only being supplied for around 5 hours. “As we have to use diesel generators to operate the tubewells in absence of electricity, the rising prices of fuel have taken a toll on us,” they said. District general secretary, Sudagar Singh said,”Rather than providing relief to the residents, both the state and Union governments are filling their coffers. Fuel should be brought under GST and tax should not be more than 5%. To compensate for the damage already caused to the paddy crop, the state government should provide electricity for 12 hours now.”Farmers stage counter protest against BJPWhile the BJP leaders were staging a protest against the state government, a small group of farmers staged a counter protest against the saffron party for passing the contentious farm laws. However, they were pacified by the farmers deputed at the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-farmers-slam-state-govt-over-power-crisis-in-ludhiana-101625249992169.html

He also said the directors of Jarandeshwar SSK mill would appeal in court against this action.“While selling Jarandeshwar sugar mill, MSCB followed all the due procedures. Around 12-15 companies had applied in the tendering process. The highest bid was offered by Guru Commodity situated in Mumbai for ₹65.75 crore and the mill was sold at this price. Other mills were also purchased by various companies. Many owners of the mills appealed against this in courts but the results were not in their favour,” said Pawar.ED on Thursday said it had attached assets worth ₹65.75 crore belonging to Jarandeshwar SSK situated at Chimangaon-Koregaon in Satara in connection with the money laundering case involving MSC Bank, while adding that a firm linked to the deputy CM and his wife Sunetra was involved in the case.However, Pawar categorically denied any wrongdoing in this matter. He claimed that multiple investigations have already been done by several other agencies but nothing has come out of it. “An agency has a total right to do the inquiry. During the tenure of the last government, the criminal investigation department (CID) had done an inquiry after it received complaints, but nothing came out of it. After that, the anti-corruption bureau started an inquiry but nothing came out of that as well. Many PILs have been heard in the high court regarding this matter. A committee of retired judges had also done an inquiry in the selling of these mills. The allegations of me snatching the sugar mills have been made earlier as well. But the sugar mill was not sold by the board of directors; it was done after the order of Bombay high court,” said Pawar.He added that the current directors of Jarandeshwar SSK would appeal in the courts against the action taken by the agency. “There are no irregularities in the operations of Jarandeshwar SSK. When the directors of this mill were called by ED for inquiry, they showed all the records to them. So why has ED started this action now is beyond me. The directors of Jarandeshwar SSK will appeal in court for justice. Thousands of farmers and workers are dependent on this mill for their livelihoods,” said Pawar.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Chandrakant Patil alleged that the wrongdoings related to Jarandeshwar SSK is just the tip of the iceberg of fraudulent selling of 24 cooperative sugar factories, and all such transactions are now on ED’s radar. “The action on the Jarandeshwar SSK is just the beginning. Sugar mills and cotton mills acquired for meagre amounts through MSCB are now under ED’s radar. The fraudulent pattern to take over sugar mills has been unveiled. After ED’s action on Jarandeshwar SSK, the transaction paperwork has come into public domain,” said Patil.He also refuted allegation that the action taken by the central agency was to create political pressure. “Those who complain about the action first should accept that there has been a fraud. Those who have done wrong will have to pay for it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sugar-mills-sold-after-hc-order-no-irregularities-in-procedure-ajit-pawar-101625249931472.html

The farmers are now demanding that power supply to agriculture feeders should be extended to 12 hours from the current eight hours a day.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) state president Ratan Mann has demanded the government to extend immediate relief to the farmers.“Most farmers could not even complete the sowing in lack of rain. The government should not only increase electricity supply but should also provide subsidised diesel to farmers so that they could prepare the fields for transplantation and nurture their crop,” he added.Yamunanagar farm leader Satpal Kaushik said that he has written to Haryana power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala and requested him to increase power supply to 12 hours immediately.He said that not only the paddy growers but sugarcane and vegetable farmers are also finding it difficult to irrigate their crop as eight-hour power supply is not sufficient.“It is a tough time for farmers. We cannot see our crop dying due to lack of water. As the current power supply is insufficient, we are spending ₹300-400 per hour on the diesel pumps to get extra water,” said farmer Manveer Singh, of Gharauda in Karnal.Dr Narender Goyal, of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra Damla, advised farmers to avoid using fertilisers during the heat wave and maintain the required moisture in their fields to cut the impact of dry spell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delayed-monsoon-farmers-demand-12-hour-power-supply-to-feeders-101625249931028.html

The PG exams for distance mode students will start from July 3.MA (English) pass out Monika Kumari, who hails from a Bhiwani village, had to shift to Rohtak to appear for the first semester exam to improve her scorecard.“I shifted to Rohtak as my village falls on the Rajasthan border, where internet connectivity is a major issue. During my first exam, I had requested my friend to give her phone for four hours. To take the online exam, two phones are required. The first phone is used to switch on the camera and join the meeting to write the paper,” she said.“The second one is used to click photos of the answer sheet and send the same via email in PDF format. If we click the answer sheets with the help of the first phone, we will have to leave the meeting, and if we do so, the invigilator will find us guilty of indulging in malpractice. Now, I have spend ₹14,000 to buy another phone so that I can take the exam without any hurdle,” she added.Another student Jyoti, of Jhajjar village, said she has been visiting a private library in Rohtak to appear for the online exam.“There is slow and poor internet connectivity in my village. I got compartment last time and have now paid ₹1,200 for the library to use their internet to write the paper. It is difficult to remain active in the online meeting for four hours and I have to keep my phone on charge during the entire time. I have been uploading the PDFs with the help of my friends,” she added.A PhD scholar, pleading anonymity, said he could submit his answer sheet in PDF format just four minutes before the allotted time due to poor connectivity.“Students staying in urban areas take just 10-15 minutes to upload the PDFs while I have to struggle for 50-55 minutes in submitting the PDF due to poor connectivity. Many of us don’t have Wi-Fi connection and are appearing in the exam via phones. If anyone calls on our number, till we disconnect the call, our video switches off. Then we struggle to convince the invigilator that the video was switched off due to a phone call,” the scholar added.MDU controller of examination BS Sindu said some students have faced problems in online exams but most students have smartphones. “In the next semester exams, we will provide both online and offline options to students,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-from-rural-haryana-face-internet-connectivity-issues-while-taking-exams-101625249751216.html

02-07-2021||Other||4 yrs on, Karnal Smart City remains a distant dream||Making Karnal a smart city still remains a distant dream as works on most big ticket projects approved under this scheme have not been started yet.In June 2017, Karnal, the constituency of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, was included in the Centre’s Smart City Project with promise to improve quality of life, smooth traffic movement, sanitation, security and safety and better health facilities but in the past four years, no major changes have occurred.As per officials monitoring the project, in the beginning, the blueprint of Karnal Smart City Limited (KSCL) had 57 projects – including 40 projects of ₹1,022.08 crore kept under area-based development on 720 acres and 17 projects of ₹149.75 crore were under PAN City Solutions. But now, the project is not limited to just 720 acre but will cover the entire city. Total 24 projects approved earlier have been dropped and 23 new projects were added taking the number of total projects to 56.As per the status report, of the 56 projects planned, only 13 small projects of ₹10.27 crore – including city bus service, installation of musical fountains have been completed in the past four years.Work on 20 projects of ₹182 crore, including a city surveillance system of ₹152 crore, is under construction. But work on 33 major projects of around ₹474 crore is yet to start.Several projects including open-air gyms, smart utilities, earmarked cycle track, rejuvenation of Atal Park, city surveillance, redevelopment of old bus stand, etc are under-construction for over two years.Ramanjeet Kuar, councilor from ward 11 of the Karnal MC, and her husband Gurinder Singh are not satisfied with the slow progress of works. They said, “There is nothing on the name of smart city yet. We don’t think anything has been done to improve quality of life in city. Building entry gates will not help until we provide basic facilities to people.”However, the officials also blame the Covid-19 pandemic for delay in execution of under-construction projects.Nishant Kumar Yadav, CEO of KSCL and Karnal deputy commissioner, said work on many projects was delayed due to the pandemic but efforts are being made to speed up completion of the projects. Over the delay in disbursement of funds, he said that allocation of funds is based on expenditure done.“As the area under the smart city project has been extended, I am hopeful that Karnal will be a smart city in the next three years,” said the CEO.However, Karnal MC mayor Renu Bala Gupta said the project is being monitored by the CEO and the MC does not have any major role to play, but some projects were delayed as they caused inconvenience to some residents.Karnal was included in the smart cities’ list by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on June 23, 2017. It took one-and-a-half-years to appoint a consultant for the project and now the DPR of two major projects, including construction of 2.1km flyover along the railway road and redevelopment of a 1km stretch between Namaste Chowk to Meera Ghati Chowk, has been proposed but residents of these areas are opposing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-yrs-on-karnal-smart-city-remains-a-distant-dream-101625249453245.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Javed Akhtar moves HC against misleading statement by Kangana Ranaut for renewing passport||Writer, poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar has moved an intervention application before the Bombay high court (HC) in the petition filed by actor Kangana Ranaut, alleging that the actor deliberately misled the court and got an assurance from the Passport Authority of India for expediting her passport renewal application. Akhtar stated that though the HC had asked Ranaut if any criminal proceedings were pending against her before any court, the actor said there were no pending criminal proceedings against her pertaining to the two cases filed against her in the sedition and copyright violation case but did not mention the defamation case filed by him against the actor which is pending before the magistrate court. The application is expected to come up for hearing next week. The intervention application filed by Akhtar on July 1 through advocate Jay Bharadwaj stated that a defamation case against the actor was filed by Akhtar in November 2020 for making malicious, false and defamatory remarks against him in a television interview after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, and the magistrate had directed the police to investigate the complaint by Akhtar. It further states that the magistrate had issued a bailable warrant against the actor on March 1, wherein she got bail on March 25 but the case is still pending. Referring to the hearing of Ranaut’s plea for renewal of her passport in HC on June 28, Akhtar’s application stated that the actor when asked a specific question on pendency of any criminal case pending against her in any court, Ranaut had deliberately not divulged the pendency of the case titled Javed Akhtar vs Kangana Ranaut in the magistrate court. On June 28, when the Ranaut’s interim application for renewal of her passport was heard by the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Revati Mohite-Dere, the Passport Authority had said that if Ranaut made a statement that there was no pending criminal proceeding against her, it would expedite her application. Advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, representing the actor, had given a statement that no criminal proceedings were pending in any court against Ranaut in the two cases filed against her in the Bandra and Khar police stations. Ranaut had moved the interim application in her petitions challenging the two first information reports (FIR), claiming that renewal of her passport which was due to expire in September was being delayed due to police complaints against her. Following this statement, her passport was renewed the next. Akhtar said Ranaut’s counsel had limited the statement to the criminal proceedings arising out of two FIRs and did not mention about pending criminal defamation case against her, and therefore his petition was required to be heard by the HC. Earlier in February, Dindoshi sessions court had dismissed Ranaut’s appeal against the order by the magistrate court which had issued process against her based on Akhtar’s defamation complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/javed-akhtar-moves-hc-against-misleading-statement-by-kangana-ranaut-for-renewing-passport-101625249451455.html

They hit the dog with a thick stick, then hung it on the boat with a fishing hook and continued raining blows till it seemed dead.Police said the accused has had spats with the dog owner Christuraj in the past, at least on one occasion over the dog urinating near their vessel. It is not clear where Christuraj was when the dog was being beaten.A person who captured the incident on his mobile phone later shared the clip with Christuraj who put it out on social media. Local reports said the police did not initially act on his complaint. Later the Thiruvananthapuram chapter of People for Animals intervened and a FIR was registered.The video touched off massive outrage.Upset at Bruno’s inhuman treatment, Justice Jayasankaran Nambiar on Thursday wrote a letter to Chief Justice S Manikumar. This letter was later treated as a suo moto petition.In Friday’s order, the judges said instances of cruelty to animals reported in the media had become “frighteningly frequent” in the last couple of years and “we believe that the State must now resort to affirmative action to alleviate their misery”.The bench, which will hear the case next on 13 July, ordered the police to report the action taken in the case relating to Bruno’s death and requested Kerala’s director of prosecution to give “personal attention” so that the wheels of justice are set in motion.“We feel immediate steps are required to initiate a change in the attitude of our citizenry to the welfare of animals so that gruesome incidents, such as those reported in the media, do not recur in future,” the division bench said.The judges noted that Kerala’s animal welfare board was last constituted in 2008 on a three-year-term and faced problems in its functioning and directed the state government to report back within a month with the corrective steps that it has taken.The bench also nudged the government to spend more on veterinary hospitals that desperately need an upgrade, explore the option of holding animal adoption camps at least thrice a year and giving district authorities the power to investigate complaints of infringement of animal rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-court-initiates-animal-rights-pil-after-dog-killed-by-3-names-it-after-bruno-101625249271611.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Begin process to restore Maratha quota, remove 50% cap: Outfits to Centre, state||A day after the Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the review petition filed by the Central government challenging its decision over 102nd Constitutional amendment, the Maharashtra government and Maratha outfits have demanded steps by the Centre to restore the Maratha reservation. The outfits have demanded that the Centre as well as the state begin constitutional procedures to restore the reservation.The SC verdict could be a favourable development from the viewpoint of the state government as the order has made it clear that the power to give the reservation to any community lies with the Centre. While quashing the reservation given to the Maratha community in education and jobs through the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act 2018, the SC had, on May 5, said that state’s powers of giving reservation have been done away by the 102nd Constitutional amendment in August 2018. The review petition filed by the Centre challenging the Apex court’s verdict was dismissed by the SC on Thursday. The Maharashtra government, reacting to it, has demanded a Constitutional amendment to restore the reservation.State public works minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation Ashok Chavan said the SC, through Thursday’s verdict, has reiterated that the power to give reservation lies with the Centre. “The Central government now needs to amend the Constitution to restore state’s power and to do away with the 50% cap on reservation. The Centre should take a call on it in the ensuing monsoon session of the parliament,” he said. Meanwhile, the SC verdict has led to blame game between the ruling and opposition parties in the state. While the Congress has blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for “misguiding” the community during its rule in the state, BJP leaders said that the ruling parties should stop blaming the Centre for everything. “The latest SC verdict has established that only the Centre is empowered to give reservation. The BJP misled the Maratha community by enacting the law in 2018 when the state had no right to do so,” said Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole.BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar said the process for inclusion of any caste in the list of backward classed needs to be initiated by the state. He added that once the Centre approves the backwardness of the community, enactment of the law is also the responsibility of the state government. BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and demanded that the state immediately begin the process of survey by the state backward classes commission. He said that the inclusion is done by the Centre on the basis of the report submitted by the state government.Virendra Pawar, one of the coordinators of Maratha Kranti Morcha, said Maratha outfits would have to simultaneously fight its battle with the state as well as the Centre. “Our fight now starts from the scratch after the review petition was dismissed by the Apex court. The state government will have to recommend the inclusion of any community backward classes to the Centre, for which new survey is necessary. Maratha outfits are all set to take this battle forward by chalking out new strategy,” he said.According to insiders in the state government, the verdict has, in a way, put the onus on the Centre to take steps for the restoration of the reservation. “The Centre will now have to take constitutional step to establish its stand that the state’s power on reservation is intact. Even if the Centre does so, the state cannot cross the 50% limit as the SC had refused to review the cap while giving its May 5 ruling. Therefore, we have demanded constitutional amendment to remove that cap too,” said an official form the state government.The officer said that the state cannot ask the backward classes commission to conduct survey to prove the backwardness of Maratha community as it would be contradictory to the review petition filed the state. The state government has filed its review petition challenging the 50% cap and Apex court’s remarks questioning the standing of the Gaikwad commission report which was base for the Maratha reservation.The state government-appointed committee under retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale had recommended fresh survey of the community to establish their backwardness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/begin-process-to-restore-maratha-quota-remove-50-cap-outfits-to-centre-state-101625249270448.html

The collected data is expected to be submitted before the Supreme Court to restore the political reservation to the community which was struck down in March this year.The notification has stated that the commission for backward classes will conduct the rigorous iniquity into the nature and implications of backwardness within the local bodies on the basis of records, reports, survey and other available data. The commission is expected to gather the information through surveys and records available in government offices, educational institutions and organisations.The SC had struck down political reservation granted to OBCs in local body election for the want of empirical data on the backwardness of these communities, which led to debate and blame game between political parties. The reservation can be restored by submitting the report on the empirical data to the SC.“This should have been done long ago when the SC first enquired about it in its ruling in December 2019. Had it been done in time, the reservation could have been saved. Instead of taking the steps, the state government kept blaming the Centre for not producing the empirical data,” said Leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-asks-backward-classes-commission-to-collect-empirical-data-of-obcs-101625249210383.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi forest dept arrests man for smuggling leopard claws||The forest department, along with the wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB), arrested one person for illegally smuggling and selling a bag of leopard claws and teeth at Delhi’s Kashmere inter-state bus terminus (ISBT) on Friday. Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forests (north division), said acting on a tip-off, the team--projecting themselves as prospective buyers--met the man at Kashmere Gate ISBT around am on Friday and caught him with a bag of leopard claws and teeth. “The seller has been arrested and the parts have been seized. We were hoping that the man would turn up with more items because we had received information that he was in possession of more such animal parts and that such items were being transported to other states from Delhi,” said Madanpotra. He said the department is not going to release the price of the animal parts in the illegal market, as the Wildlife (Protection) Act prohibits making such information public to ensure this trade is not encouraged in any way. The Indian leopard has been listed as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)--an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources-- because of its depleting population. Poaching of the animal for the illegal trade of its skin and other body parts is strictly banned. Forest officials said such illegal trade and transit has increased over the last few years and teams are often on alert to track such criminals. The operation often involves coordination from forest and wildlife departments from other states as well. A senior forest department official explained that even though Delhi is not quite the hub for wildlife-related crimes, it is an important transit point from where poachers and middlemen transport animals, dead and alive, and their body parts. “After illegally poaching protected animals such as leopards, tigers, crocodiles, and even trading several protected species of birds from the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal among other places, these illegal traders often use Delhi as a transit point to take these items further into north east India and then even across border to Nepal, Bhutan or China. The value of these items in the black market is quite high,” the official explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-forest-dept-arrests-man-for-smuggling-leopard-claws-101625249091450.html

No power cuts. Uninterrupted power supply,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet.Earlier in a tweet, Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain said, “Delhi successfully met ever-highest [highest in two years, as per government records] electricity peak demand of 7,323 today. Heartiest congratulations to (the) Delhi power sector for this achievement.”The highest peak power demand ever in the Capital was 7,409 MW, recorded on July 2, 2019. As the mercury soared, Delhi recorded peak power demands of 6,921 MW on Wednesday and 7,026 MW on Thursday. Thursday was also the second time in two years that Delhi crossed the 7,000-mark for peak power demand.Last year, Delhi’s peak power demand was recorded at 6,314 MW on June 29. In 2018, the peak demand was 7,016 MW, recorded on July 10, government records showed.The demand this year may further go up to 7,400 MW, if the ongoing heatwave in the city continues, said a senior power department official who did not wish to be identified.The BSES discoms -- BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) -- said they successfully met the peak power demands of 3,079 MW and 1,640 MW in their respective areas on Friday.

The water should be allowed to seep into the soil completely and the next irrigation should be done after two days. This way, farmers will need to consume less water, reducing the incidence of pests and diseases.Due to the current power crisis in the state, farmers are facing problems in operating tubewells for watering the paddy crop in absence of uninterrupted and required power supply.PAU head of agronomy department, Dr MS Bhullar, said, “In case of direct seeded rice, no attempt should be made to pond the water and the irrigation frequency should be five to seven days depending upon soil type. These techniques will also help taper down the electricity demand in the state and farmers to tide over the current crisis.”Rain deficit aggravated situationThe varsity experts stated that the water requirement of transplanted as well as direct sown rice reaches a high point in the fourth week of June.PAU’s head of climate change and agricultural meteorology department Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu revealed that the rainfall data available for around five decades shows that more than 45% of rainfall for June month is witnessed during its fourth week in the state. The rainfall pattern is prone to variations on account of climate perturbations which are on the rise.“The last week of June was drier than normal this year. The rainfall deficit for this week (June 24-30) in Punjab is more than 60% as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. This has aggravated the problems related to meeting the irrigation needs of the rice crop,” she said adding that the IMD has predicted subdued rainfall activity in the coming five to six days and heat wave conditions are likely to prevail over the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/adopt-water-saving-methods-to-tide-over-power-crisis-pau-advises-farmers-101625249031276.html

At least two university officials HT spoke to said the varsity is likely to begin the process for online admission from July 6.The university will offer 12 job-oriented undergraduate courses, including BA prgrammes in Digital Media, Business Management, Data Analytics, and Aesthetics and Beauty, in addition to six B.Tech courses and 15 diploma courses. The university will initially admit 6,000 students of which 4,500 will be enrolled in diploma courses and 1,500 in degree courses.So far, 10 existing polytechnic institutes, six skill centres, two Delhi Institute of Tool Engineering, and one engineering college in Delhi have been integrated with the university.“The university is currently working with industry experts on upgrading the curriculum based on our present demands. We have formed a curriculum review committee which is taking a look at all courses and upgrading outdated content. All one-year courses at the [previous] centres have been scrapped,” said Vice-chancellor Neharika Vohra.The Delhi government had given the nod for a new skills and entrepreneurship industry In October 2019.Admissions to the diploma courses will be conducted through an online proctored common entrance test to be conducted in August, and candidates applying to degree courses will have a merit-based admission on the basis of their Class 12 scores, performance in vocational subjects, and extra-curricular activities. Vohra also said that the university would conduct an aptitude-based assessment to help students understand which course is suited for them.The university has also introduced mandatory training in “employability skills” for all students.“The workplace is changing rapidly and the focus of the component is to gain the agility to adapt to different circumstances. From digital literacy and English communication in the workplace to financial literacy, every semester will have a different module for students focusing on ethics and socio-emotional skills as well,” said Preyansi Mani, head of academics at DSEU.The state university has also adopted the Delhi government’s Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum which will feature as a component in all courses.“The weightage may differ from course to course. For instance, in beauty and fashion courses, the component may be higher than the course on banking. But every course will have a component to build entrepreneurial mindset among its students,” Vohra said.Former placement officer at Jamia Millia Islamia, Rihan Suri, who is now pro-vice-chancellor at DSEU, said that the skill university’s industry component is more intense than other Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc) courses.“We want to break the stigma around skill development and are converting conventional degree into professional courses. Those students who study vocational subjects for their Class 12 boards or score in the range of 55-70% can also enrol in the university and develop a career path. Students will also be given the flexibility to switch courses during their degree, based on credits scored by them and the criteria set for different courses,” he said.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said that the university would have to focus on placements, high-profile internships, and industry connections to build on its reputation.“In addition to employability skills, the quality of placement and internships will be critical for the university in the coming years. Students will come only if they see good placement opportunities. In many countries, management is still considered a vocational course. But by adding academic and higher-order elements to it, IIMs secured prestigious placements and ensured excellent career tracks for the students taking the institute to its current status,” she said.The university is holding workshops with vocational teachers and representatives of government and private schools in the Capital to apprise the stakeholders of the courses offered by the university and their relevance to students interested in skill-based learning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/skill-varsity-likely-to-begin-online-admissions-from-july-6-101625248972634.html

BJP and EDMC officials, however, said the charges were imposed in line with a Delhi government notification.“The BJP-led MCD has given a shock on Doctor’s Day. Doctors will now have to pay an additional fee of ₹24,000 annually for the removal of garbage. Each doctor’s clinic will now have to pay ₹30,000 annually to the east MCD for garbage removal -- an additional fee of ₹24,000 introduced alongside the previous annual fee of ₹6,000, which was imposed for disposal of bio-medical waste,” said AAP MLA and party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.“After looting traders with manifold taxes and license fees, doctors are on the MCD’s target. BJP’s MCD has also introduced a professional tax to be levied on professionals like CAs, architects, doctors, etc. It is ridiculous and condemnable that the MCD has stooped down to loot people with irrational taxes and fees. We demand immediate rollback of the additional fees imposed on doctors with their own clinics,” he said.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP general secretary Shri Harsh Malhotra said the additional charges were ordered by the Delhi government. “AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj’s statement on arbitary raising of waste removal charges from ₹6,000 to ₹30,000 annually is misleading. These charges have not been levied by East MCD but ordered by Delhi government on January 15, 2018. East MCD has been forced to implement under repeated reminders from Delhi government. The new charges will be levied as per medical unit, i.e. clinic, nursing home and hospital size and waste generated. Despite new provisions, no substantial rise will happen for normal next door physician clinics and small nursing homes too will be nominally affected. Only larger hospitals will have to pay in higher slab,” he said.East MCD mayor Shyam Sundar said, “The Delhi government should withdraw its gazette notification dated January 15, 2018, immediately to allow relief to medical fraternity and others affected”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-accuses-edmc-of-piling-additional-fee-on-doctors-with-own-clinics-101625248971357.html

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Patients left high and dry as doctors’ strike enters 2nd day in Ludhiana||Medical services, barring emergency and Covid-related services, remained suspended on Thursday for the second consecutive day after doctors in state-run hospitals continued their strike against the recommendation of the sixth pay commission to de-link non-practising allowance (NPA) from basic pay and the transfer of Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) Bathinda unit president Gurmail Ankhi amid statewide protests. The strike was observed under the banner of the Joint Punjab Government Doctors’ Coordination Committee, which is led by PCMSA. Services such as outpatient departments (OPDs), inpatient departments (IPDs), unique IDs for persons with disabilities (UDID), Ayushman Bharat - Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (AB-SSBY) and elective surgeries among others remained suspended as around 400 doctors employed at the civil hospitals in Ludhiana, Khanna and Jagraon, and 10 community health centres suspended work. Protesters said NPA comprised 25% of their basic salary. However, the sixth pay commission, which aims to better doctors’ pay scale, had reduced the component to 20% of their basic salary and had de-linked NPA from basic pay, which will hit their salary and pension benefits. PCMSA member Dr Rohit Rampal said the strike on Friday was primarily against the transfer of Ankhi to Fazilka. “Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday assured a PCMSA delegation that both issues will be resolved, and the NPA issue could be resolved as early as Tuesday, after which we resumed work. However, doctors will continue wearing black batches until the demands are actually fulfilled.” Meanwhile, patients continued to be on the receiving end as they were denied treatment for the second consecutive day. Umesh of Dhandari Kalan, who had come to the civil hospital in Ludhiana for treatment, said, “I met with an accident a few days ago and suffered an injury on my left leg. I noticed that the area around the wound was infected and came to get it checked out but I was told to come another day due to the doctors’ strike. It is difficult for me to visit the hospital again and again with an injured leg.”A social worker at the hospital, Gurpreet Singh said the doctors’ strike at the civil hospital was only affecting the poor stratum of society, which could not afford to visit private practices at a time when the public is already bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Though Covid related services were not suspended, the visitors faced a lot of harassment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patients-left-high-and-dry-as-doctors-strike-enters-2nd-day-in-ludhiana-101625248790876.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||20,324 Covid-19 deaths in Maharashtra in May, 7,332 in June||While the state saw 20,324 Covid deaths in May, the number declined to 7,332 in June. Adding to the high death rate in May was the reconciliation process where 15,000 backlog deaths were added to the cumulative fatality rate from May 1 onwards. The government authorities have called it a case of delayed reporting rather than underreporting or misreporting of facts.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, state government on Covid-19 management, attributed it to the decline in new cases. “The death rates correspond directly to the number of cases and since June had fewer cases, we saw a decline in deaths,” said Dr Salunkhe. “In May, the high number of cases resulted in shortage of hospital beds and oxygen supply. This also raised the number of deaths. However in June, the situation improved significantly,” he added.April-May was one of the toughest phases in the Covid battle for the state, as there was acute shortage of hospital beds, Remdesivir injections and chaos all around.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, blamed the authorities for the spike in deaths. “When the cases started declining last September, the authorities should have beefed up the medical infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. The history of pandemics like cholera, influenza and measles has all shown multiple waves and they should have prepared themselves. These deaths have happened due to their short sightedness,” rued Shaikh.On Friday, the state saw 8,753 new Covid-19 cases, of which 673 were from Mumbai. A total of 221,289 tests were conducted across the state on Friday. The day also saw 8,385 recoveries. The death toll has now reached 122,353 with 156 patients succumbing to the virus on Friday. The total case count stands at 6,079,352.On Friday, there were 116,867 active cases in the state. Pune topped with 17,013 active cases, followed by Thane with 16,339 active cases. In terms of Covid fatalities, Pune leads with 16,823 deaths followed by Mumbai with 15,499 deaths. On Saturday, 377,698 vaccine doses were administered to the citizens. Many parts of the state resumed their vaccination after three days.In view of the upcoming Bakri Eid on July 20, the state has come out with rules which banned all religious functions and asked people to offer namaz in homes and not in mosques. It also said sacrificial animals should be bought online or over the phone as markets dealing with them will be closed. It has also asked devotees to keep qurbani (sacrifice) symbolic. It asked people not to congregate in public places on the day of the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/20324-covid-19-deaths-in-maharashtra-in-may-7-332-in-june-101625248610227.html

On June 15, Mangat, who was on the run after being booked, asked his brother, Mewa Singh, the complainant, to meet him near the ‘akhara’ on Kalewal Road with some clothes. When Mewa reached there, he saw the accused arrive at the spot and attack Mangat with sharp-edged weapons. They also snatched Mewa’s mobile phone and threatened him with dire consequences if he told anybody about the incident. Later, Mangat succumbed to his injuries at the hospital. Allegations of political interferenceOn June 23, the victim’s kin had met commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal alleging that the police were deliberately not arresting the accused because he belongs to the ruling party. The commissioner of police had allayed their concerns. Sub-inspector Harshpal Singh said the arrests were made following a tipoff. “Two cars and two sticks, which were used to commit the crime have been recovered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-worker-3-accomplices-arrested-for-murder-in-ludhiana-101625248550813.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai vaccination scam: BMC seals Shivam Hospital, cancels license||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday sealed Shivam Hospital in the Charkop area after cancelling its license owing to its involvement in the alleged fake Covid vaccination scam in the city. According to BMC officials, they have taken the action in response to the report received from Mumbai Police. The hospital had no patients at the time of sealing.The hospital’s owners were allegedly involved in authorised vaccination camps from March 14 to April 30 at Shivam Hospital in collaboration with the BMC, where around 150,000 people were vaccinated. The hospital later allegedly retained the “unused” or “leftover” Covishield vaccine doses in empty bottles. The hospital allegedly supplied the leftover stock to their associates who held unauthorised vaccination camps at various places across Mumbai.Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s R South Ward said, “We have sealed the hospital and cancelled its license as per the provisions in the Bombay Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1949. The action was on the basis of a report received from Mumbai Police. At the time of sealing the hospital, there were no patients admitted at the hospital.”The hospital came under the scanner after residents of Hiranandani Heritage in Kandivli complained to the authorities about a suspicious vaccination drive. Around 390 residents who were vaccinated did not get any symptoms and they also received vaccination certificates from different hospitals.Meanwhile, on Friday 83,644 citizens were vaccinated as around 300 vaccination centres of BMC and state government were functional for around three hours only followed by 98 private vaccination centres. Till now, 5,551,449 citizens have been vaccinated since the start of the drive on January 16, 2021.

02-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man held for duping 2 by promising oxygen concentrators||The Pant Nagar police have arrested a 35-year-old man from Ulhasnagar for allegedly duping Covid patients and their relatives on the pretext of selling them oxygen concentrators.According to the police, the accused circulated his mobile number on social media. After people approached him for oxygen concentrators, he asked to pay an advance amount through an online mode and later did not deliver oxygen concentrators.A woman from Ghatkopar claimed that she was duped of ₹1.35 lakh, while another man from Gujarat claimed that the accused had taken ₹1 lakh from him.Police officers said the accused, Bunty Jarwal alias Rahul Desai, a resident of Ulhasnagar area, put up a furniture stall at exhibitions held across India, where he exchanged mobile numbers of the people who visited his stall and others, at the centres.During the lockdown, he faced a financial crisis. To make easy money, he circulated messages about supplying oxygen concentrators at a reasonable price, said senior inspector Suhas Kamble of the Pant Nagar police station. The police traced the accused in the Ulhasnagar area. He was arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, said Kamble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-held-for-duping-2-by-promising-oxygen-concentrators-101625248430240.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||FDA rules violation: License of 1,642 suspended, 318 medical stores closed in Maharashtra||Amid the pandemic, the apex drug regulating body, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received several complaints of overcharging and illegal sale of essential drugs for Covid-19 patients. Following this, the officers suspended the license of 1,642 medical stores and closed down 318 stores that were found violating rules, laid down by the FDA.With the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, demand for life-saving drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and oxygen among other medical equipment like oximeters, the thermometer has increased by 400%, as per chemists. Taking advantage of this, many medical stores started selling those medical essentials at a higher than the mentioned maximum retail price (MRP). Some even stocked medicines to increase the prices, which led to the harassment of the relatives of Covid-19 patients.Taking note of it, FDA undertook thousands of raids across the state and took stringent action. “Our inspectors visited the random medical stores as customers and red-handedly caught them violating the FDA rules. We have suspended the license of 1,642 medical stores. In some cases, we found repeated violations, that were earlier given a warning. A total of 318 stores that were repeat offenders have been ordered to close down,” said DR Gahane, joint commissioner of FDA Maharashtra.In the state, there are around 72,000 medical shops and 25,000 wholesalers. Over a thousand showcause notices have been issued to the shops that have been found not following the rules laid under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, during the pandemic.In the city, there are 6,496 medical shops and 4,500 medical wholesalers. During the inspection, 230 were found violating the rules laid by the act whose license has been suspended. Meanwhile, 33 medical stores have been closed down in the city.The highest number of complaints were recorded in April 2021 when the pandemic curve was at its peak and the state was recording the highest number of daily Covid-19 cases in the country.“Every year, we conduct the inspections. But this year, the number of violations was more due to the sudden rise in the demand of the medicines in the pandemic,” he said.However, health activists said the department is running on half of its manpower strength for years. Hence, the department failed to take action against the culprits on time.“Every time, we complained about the hoarding of essential medicines during the pandemic, the officers failed to take timely action. They told us that they didn’t have the manpower. I hope, the authorities learn some lessons and importance of the department and fill up the vacant posts at the earliest,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, from Doctors For You, an NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fda-rules-violation-license-of-1-642-suspended-318-medical-stores-closed-in-maharashtra-101625248370217.html

In the latest case, 1,055 people were allegedly given fake vaccines at an unauthorised vaccination camp.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday sealed Shivam Hospital at Charkop, Kandivli (East). The hospital is owned by Dr Shivraj Pataria and his wife Nita, who are accused of engineering the entire vaccination scam.The doctor couple and Dr Manish Tripathi, another medical practitioner arrested in the case, were on Friday produced before a metropolitan magistrate and remanded to police custody till July 9.The MIDC police have booked 13 persons including Dr Manish Tripathi, Dr Shivraj Pataria and his wife Nita, Arvind Jadhav, Pavan Singh, Dr Anurag, Mohamed Karim Ali, Neha Sharma, Roshni Patel and others after a complaint was received from Inter Gold (India) Private Limited, a firm based in Andheri (East).The complainant claimed that 1,055 vaccine doses were given by Pawan Singh in April and May, but only 48 people got vaccination certificates.A police officer said that BMC had not given any permission to organise the camp at Inter Gold (India).The Samta Nagar police have arrested one Dr Anurag, who is the 14th accused to be arrested in connection with an unauthorised vaccination camp at the Intercontinental Diamond store.The Kandivli police have on Thursday arrested absconding accused Rajesh Pandey from Baramati. Pandey, a key accused, had been misusing his identity as an employee of Andheri-based Kokilaben Ambani Hospital and defrauding people in the name of vaccination.The vaccination scam came to light after Hiranandani Heritage society in Kandivli approached the police complaining they were duped by Mahendra Singh and four others who administered fake vaccines to their society members on May 30. The society members claimed they received the vaccination certificates, but they had names of different hospitals and different dates, but when the residents checked the Co-WIN portal, their status was shown as “yet to receive the first dose.”Thereafter, eight more cases have been filed at Versova, Borivli, Bangur Nagar and Khar, Samta Nagar police stations against the same group. So far, police have arrested 14 accused and are on the lookout for two more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vax-scam-10th-fir-filed-1-055-of-andheri-firm-given-fake-vaccine-13-booked-101625248190230.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Treat family of pilot contracting, succumbing to Covid as a frontliner: Air India pilots to PM||Boeing pilots of Air India have sought an immediate and interim measure wherein the family of any pilot contracting Covid and succumbing to it, be treated as a frontline worker and be compensated as per the government policy in addition to any other personal or group insurance. In a letter written on Friday to the Prime Minister, finance and aviation minister, the Boeing pilots’ association said that one dependent member of such a pilot (spouse, child or sibling) should be provided suitable alternative employment by Air India. The association also pointed out that pilots becoming permanently medically unfit or temporarily medically unfit due to Covid or post Covid complications, must be provided annuity at four times of the normal coverage, due to the impending increased risk while undertaking such flights.The Boeing pilots’ Indian Pilots Guild Pilots (IPG) specified that the airline crew, while still unvaccinated, stood up to the call of duty even during the second wave in April 2021, putting the national interest before theirs and family members’ health and safety. “..success of Vande Bharat is a matter of pride for all aviation personnel who have played a role in this time of national crisis with Air India Ltd. being responsible for transporting at least 3.4 million people worldwide. In the process as many as 460 pilots got infected with Covid, over 30 pilots have needed to be hospitalised and five have succumbed to it, till the date of making this submission,” a senior pilot said.“In the current pandemic situation, the Government of India announced an ex-gratia cover of ₹50 lakh for any frontline worker who contracted Covid 19 and succumbed to it under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package. However, none of the pilots’ families who have succumbed to Covid having contracted the same whilst operating the Vande Bharat or air bubble flights has been so compensated,” the pilot added. This letter comes after the widows of the deceased Air India pilots collectively wrote to Air India chairman and managing director- Rajiv Bansal, for providing appropriate compensation to them and also giving an alternate suitable job to the immediate family of the deceased pilots. The pilots’ letter read, “We are conscious that flying commercial jet aircraft, is fraught with risks and treat it as an occupational hazard. Such risks were recognised by an Award by (Retd.) Justice G.D. Khosla, Former Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court, back in 1966, which provided for a graded scheme of Annuity for pilots and other crew members who may become permanently or temporarily unfit to perform their duties. In the current scenario, the need to look afresh at the said provisions in the context of Covid is more pronounced.”IPG concluded by requesting that, pilots with family members who are at a greater risk of getting infected such as those residing with small children, aged parents/siblings or relatives with co-morbidities with them, should not be compelled to operate flights or face punitive action for refusal to operate Covid relief flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/treat-family-of-pilot-contracting-succumbing-to-covid-as-a-frontliner-air-india-pilots-to-pm-101625248130988.html

The names Saleem Ahmad and Kafeel Ahmad surfaced during interrogation of the previously arrested two brothers.The ADG said the NIA has taken custody of Saleem and Kafeel for further legal proceedings.The NIA officials had earlier informed that the investigation into the Darbhanga parcel blast revealed a trans-national conspiracy hatched by top operatives of LeT to execute terror attacks across India and cause large scale damage to life and property.The NIA had taken over the parcel blast case on June 24.The officials said Imran and Nasir, who had shifted their base to Nampally, Hyderabad, were arrested after their link surfaced in the parcel booked from Secunderabad.The officials said the Indian based LeT operatives Imran and Nasir acting under directions of Pakistan-based handlers, fabricated an incendiary improvised explosive device (IED), packed it in a parcel of clothing and booked it in a long-distance train from Secunderabad to Darbhanga.They said it aimed at causing an explosion and fire in a running passenger train resulting in huge loss of life and property. They said Nasir had visited Pakistan in 2012 and had received training from LeT handlers in fabrication of IED from locally available chemicals. Along with his brother Imran, he was in touch with Pakistan-based handlers of LeT over encrypted communication platforms, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-shamli-link-in-let-plan-two-more-men-held-in-kairana-101625248130221.html
02-07-2021||Lucknow||Hot weather spell exposes chinks in power distribution network||The prevailing hot and humid long summer spell has exposed chinks in the state’s electricity distribution network yet again, causing power crisis in most cities including the state capital.As the load on the network increases especially during night with much use of air-conditioners and hooking of ‘katiyas’, the overloaded and overheated transformers explode and aerial bunch conductors of overhead lines frequently melt rendering people in the areas concerned ‘powerless’ for hours almost every day.“Our locality has been reeling under severe power crisis with frequent tripping and load shedding for last two weeks. We have to stay awake in the nigh till the supply is restored,” complained Ravi Gupta, a resident of sector 14, Indira Nagar.Vijay Lal, a private firm employee and resident of exhibition ground area, Aligarh, said frequent power cuts were intolerable these days because of intense heat even as the sub-station staff remained out of reach for most of the time when they tried to complain. “Frequent outages badly disrupt the internet connectivity as well as affect the office work I do from home these days,” he complained. This situation is despite the fact that there is demand-supply gap in the state and UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) claims that it is meeting all the power demand and providing electricity as per the roster without resorting to any emergency extra load shedding. “The demand has certainly increased very much due to heat and humidity but we are able to meet the demand as there is no shortage of electricity,” UPPCL director (distribution) AK Srivastav said.“The power crisis that people sometimes complain of is due to local breakdowns most of which are unavoidable but all attempts are made to rectify them and restore the supply in the minimum possible time,” he added.The power demand made a new record on Thursday when it was recorded to be 24,926 MW during the peak hours. Informing this through a tweet the same day, energy minister Shrikant Sharma said “The highest-ever power to the tune 24,926 MW was supplied in the state on June 30. Its credit goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s polices and chief minister Yogi Adityanath government’s successful execution and UPPCL personnel’s hard work,” he said. While enough electricity is available in the transmission and distribution sub-stations, the same often fails to reach consumers due to local breakdowns being caused by several reasons with overloading being the main one.Blaming overloading and purchase and use of substandard transformers, cables etc, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said it was an irony that people were reeling under power crisis even in the state capital despite the UPPCL injecting record electricity into the sub-stations.“The issue is that electricity often does not reach end consumer because of distribution bottlenecks in between” he said. He also said 132 sub-stations in the state were overloaded by around 2 crore kw due to poor planning and rampant theft. Verma alleged that most of transformers exploded and cables melted not only because of overloading and overheating but also because of their poor quality. During his meetings with discoms, the energy minister invariably touches the issue of power supply these days. He has repeatedly expressed concern over the complaints he receives about the power supply and has asked engineers to ensure quick disposal of grievances apart from taking steps to eliminate overloading of transformers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hot-weather-spell-exposes-chinks-in-power-distribution-network-101625247890143.html
02-07-2021||Lucknow||Humid weather spell to continue in UP||The hot and humid weather conditions will continue to prevail across the state in the coming days. “There is very little possibility of rain in UP in the next 24 hours because of a high-pressure zone which has developed over the state. The monsoon rain will resume when pressure zone subsides by mid next week,” said director, state metrological department, JP Gupta.Humidity and rise in temperature caused by a halt in monsoon rain have made things unbearable across Uttar Pradesh. While the maximum temperature is hovering around 40 degrees mark, the relative humidity has been recorded over 60% in the last few days, say the data of the Indian metrological department.Night temperature has also recorded a rise in the last few days. Many parts of the state have recorded temperature over 30 degrees during night. The state capital on Friday recorded maximum temperature of 38 degrees, which was one degree above normal, while the minimum temperature was 29 degrees, two degrees above normal, accompanied by 60% relative humidity. The city will experience similar weather conditions on Saturday too, said MeT department.Meanwhile, advising people to stay hydrated, a city physician Dr Rishab Singh said, “People should keep a balanced liquid input to maintain proper hydration and should take light diet. One should also restrict going out in the sun, especially in the afternoon, if possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/humid-weather-spell-to-continue-in-up-101625247770867.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai organisation to fund education of 400 kids who lost parents to Covid-19||Education of over 400 children, who have lost both their parents to coronavirus across Maharashtra, will be funded by crowdsourcing the expenses from citizens, in an initiative taken up by Project Mumbai, a not for profit organisation, in coordination with the state government. A formal memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and Project Mumbai on Tuesday.Project Mumbai will also give free of cost internet data To over 2.41 lakh children studying in Mumbai’s municipal schools, who have been attending online classes during the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic. The organisation has tied up with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), and school principals of all municipal schools have begun to send information about verified mobile numbers of their students, along with the service provider for each number.In the second case, families or relatives of such children can approach women and child development officer or district collector, who will prepare a social investigation report, verify the child’s status and details, and submit it to Project Mumbai. The organisation will reach out to the school and pay the fees directly.This project will take place in two phases. The first phase is for children who have lost both parents due to Covid-19, and the second phase is for children who have lost one parent to Covid-19.Shishir Joshi, from Project Mumbai, said, “We have come across a case that stands out. A child, who previously lost both the parents to Covid-19, has now lost the legal guardian, the grandmother. Project Mumbai will fund the education for this child as well. Our effort is to ensure no child is deprived of education and continuity of her/his schooling in the as-is form. Technology support and other facilities will be provided to these children on a case to case basis.” Money will not be handed to the children’s family, to ensure transparency.”Over 12,000 children have lost at least one parent to Covid-19 and over 400 have lost both parents to the infection across Maharashtra.The organisation is also setting up a toll-free number to counsel such children and their relatives and families (1800-102-4040) and will also have a segment to counsel cases of child abuse. In the case of their second initiative, over two lakh students will be provided with internet data.Joshi said, “Every child needs about 1.5 GB data per day. We are tying up with vendors of service providers to provide internet data packs for the next three months. Hopefully, after that, the situation may improve, or we will continue with the data packs.”In a letter written to principals of municipal schools on June 28, BMC’s education department directed them to compile details of all students, verify their phone number, and check if they need an internet data pack top up; and to submit a detailed list of these students and their phone numbers to the organisation.On June 8, BMC’s education department wrote to the organisation and tied up with them for providing internet data to municipal school students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-organisation-to-fund-education-of-400-kids-who-lost-parents-to-covid19-101625247770270.html
02-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal Guv stopped from reading out assembly speech by agitating BJP MLAs||An agitation by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators at the state assembly on Friday afternoon stopped Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar from reading out the speech prepared by the state government for the inauguration of the budget session. Dhankhar started his speech at 2 pm but had to stop after four minutes as the BJP legislators reached the well of the House and started shouting slogans against the government. They held posters and banners showing images of BJP supporters allegedly killed by Trinammol Congress (TMC) workers during post-poll violence. They objected to some lines in the speech which said some violence took place before the new government took charge and a “section of people” was carrying out a false campaign using fake photos and videos. Amid a ruckus, Dhankhar ended his speech by reading out a few lines from the last paragraphs and left the assembly house around 2.15 pm. Senior legislators said such an incident never took place in the past. “We staged the agitation because the speech prepared by the government did not mention post-poll violence although it is now a national issue. We were not protesting against the governor,” said BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition at the assembly. Suvendu Adhikari claimed that Dhankhar did not read the whole speech to express sympathy for the victims of violence but parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee dismissed the suggestion.“The governor was interrupted by the unruly BJP members but his speech was accepted and placed before the House. In the second half of the session, the speaker passed the motion of thanks as well. So, technically the governor delivered his speech. Those who are denying it do not know parliamentary rules,” said Chatterjee. Although the chief minister was defeated in the state polls by Adhikari she attended the House to maintain protocol, TMC leaders said. The TMC bagged 213 of the state’s 294 seats while the BJP could win only 77. However, two BJP legislators resigned from the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha constituencies. For the first time since Independence, the Left and Congress could not win even a single seat. All this happened a day after ties between Raj Bhawan and the TMC worsened with the ruling party releasing two photographs to insinuate a link between the main accused in the fake Covid-19 vaccination racket and Dhankhar. The TMC also alleged that Dhankhar was accused in the Jain hawala case in the 1990s. Though Dhankhar did not react to the allegations, political observers felt his speech at the assembly might raise a storm. On June 28, chief minister Mamata alleged that Dhankhar was accused in the Jain hawala case and branded him “corrupt”. While rubbishing the allegation on that day, Dhankhar told the media that he was not bound to read out the speech prepared by the state government while inaugurating the budget session. “Am I supposed to read out everything that is written?” Dhankhar said on the evening of June 28. This triggered speculations because in February last year Dhankhar wanted to edit the speech prepared by the state for the budget session. The government rejected his suggestion. Dhankhar finally followed convention and read out the speech that was critical of the Citizenship Amendment Act. In January this year, Dhankhar criticised the government for not inviting him to the year’s first assembly session although the House conducted its business for only two days. On Wednesday, the Governor shot a letter to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying he was “more saddened than anguished” at the allegation Banerjee made against him at the June 21 national speakers’ conference chaired by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. Banerjee complained to Om Birla that Dhankhar was interfering in the functioning of the assembly. Dhankhar also wrote to Banerjee that the allegation, that Raj Bhawan was not clearing some important bills passed by the assembly, is not true. On Friday, however, the acrimony was not visible at the assembly house. The chief minister and the speaker greeted Dhankhar at the gates when he arrived at 1.48 pm. They walked up to the statue of BR Ambedkar and places flowers together. Banerjee escorted Dhankhar to the House and also saw him off. The two were seen talking cordially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-guv-stopped-from-reading-out-assembly-speech-by-agitating-bjp-mlas-101625247712284.html

Confirming the incident, HK Rai, wildlife conservator and field director of VTR said, “Prima facie, the circumstantial evidences suggest that the man was attacked by the tiger. The body has been sent for postmortem examination.”According to the bereaved family members, the victim was attacked while working in his field on the fringe of his native village in Ramnagar block’s Gudgudi panchayat, barely a metre away from his house. Police said victim’s body bore a deep mark around neck and teeth dug on his thigh.“My husband was working in the field along with two other village residents. While others managed to escape, the tiger attacked my husband. But, by the time he could be rescued, he was already lying in a pool of blood,” said the victim’s wife.

Both projects were initiated during the previous BJP regime and are worth several hundred crores. While the Assembly building was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2019, ahead of the Assembly polls, the high court building is still under construction. While the assembly complex, spread over around 39 acres, has come up at a cost of ₹465 crore, the estimated cost of the upcoming HC building is reportedly ₹697 crore. Sources said there had been irregularities in the tendering process of both the projects, as the costs were decreased before being increased substantially after the project to the contractor. Both projects had been awarded to the same construction firm. The Assembly building has also been in the news for all the wrong reasons, as its false ceilings have caved in twice in different parts of the building due to water seepage, raising questions about quality of work. In case of the under construction HC building, a public interest litigation (PIL) has also been filed and being heard by the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/acb-to-probe-irregularities-in-construction-of-assembly-hc-buildings-101625243929905.html
02-07-2021||Patna||4th nationwide sero- survey: 3k samples sent for test from Bihar||Around 3,000 blood samples were collected and sent for test during Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s fourth nationwide serological survey in 70 districts, including six of Bihar. The survey, conducted in the state between June 20 and 25, will ascertain prevalence, called seroprevalence or seropositivity, of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, from a past infection in a given population. A seropositivity of over 70%-80% will help develop herd immunity, said scientists, as the government stepped up its vaccination drive beginning July 1. “The results are expected in August. We have sent the samples for analysis to National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, to test them for presence of antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus in an individual,” said Dr Krishna Pandey, director of ICMR’s Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna. This is the first time that children of six years and above have been included in the survey, along with adults, given the presumption of a third wave of the pandemic affecting children, Dr Pandey said. The first two surveys conducted in May and August last year were restricted to adults, while the third survey in December included persons aged 10 years and above, he said. For the recent, as many as 500 samples were taken from each of the six districts--Arwal, Buxar, Begusarai, Muzaffarpur, Purnia and Muzaffarpur. Of these, 400 samples in each district were of the general populace and 100 of health care workers. The selected district was divided into 10 clusters, each accounting for 40 samples from the general population. Four samples from every cluster were of children between six and nine years of age; 12 of children between 10 and 17 years, and remaining 24 of adults, said Dr (Major) Madhukar, nodal officer of Bihar for serological survey and Scientist B of RMRIMS. This meant that of the 400-target group from the general populace in each district, 40 were children between six and nine years, 120 between 10 and 17 years, and remaining 240 adults, he added. The samples and villages in districts were selected randomly. The last three serological surveys were also undertaken in the same six districts and clusters, but the recent survey has been undertaken in adjoining villages to those selected previously, said Dr Madhukar. PAST SERO SURVEYS IN BIHAR Muzaffarpur reported 0% seroprevalence during the first survey in May last year. Buxar reported 1.25%,, followed by 1% each in Arwal and Madhubani, Purnia 0.75% and Begusarai 0.25%. Arwal reported the highest seroprevalence of 26.20% during the third survey in December. Buxar was next with 26.07%, followed by Madhubani 24.5%, Muzaffarpur 21.70%, Purnia 21.01% and Begusarai 15.01%. “The cumulative seropositivity was 0.7% during the first survey undertaken between May 17 and 20 last year. This meant that only 17 out of 2,400 people surveyed developed antibodies (immunity) against SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr Madhukar. The seropositivity rate in Bihar increased to 7% during the second survey between August 21 and 26 and went up to 22.41% against the national average of 24% during the third survey between December 20 and 25, he added. The recent survey assumes importance given the fact that this is the first such study since the commencement of the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16 this year. It is also the first serosurvey after the second wave of Covid-19 ravaged the country in April and May, besides being the first to include children up to six years of age, believed to be the vulnerable age group in this pandemic. The survey will give scientists a clue on the presence of antibodies among children as well as adults and health care givers. It will indicate the trend of spread and presence of the infection in the community and among health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/4th-nationwide-sero-survey-3k-samples-sent-for-test-from-bihar-101625243875132.html

The decision comes amid a row on Thursday, when social welfare minister Madan Sahni offered to resign, alleging he was overruled by his department’s top official in matters related to transfer and posting of officials in his own department.In the education department, headed by JD-U minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, the transfer orders were issued by the primary education directorate on June 30. On July 1, director Ranjit Kumar Singh issued another order staying the previous order. The communication was immediately sent to all the districts and authorities concerned.Department officials, however, attributed the stay on transfers to upcoming recruitment of teachers for primary and secondary schools through the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies. “Besides, some officials were also upset that they had not been given the transfers as per their choice. But the overriding factor was the teachers’ recruitment, which will get underway soon and having new set of people at the block level would have caused problems in completing the exercise early. The department reviewed its decision and stayed the transfers,” an official said.However, the reshuffl at the higher level involving district education officers (DEOs), regional deputy director of education (RDDE), principals of district institute of educational training (DIRTs) and lecturers in training colleges carried out the same day have not been affected.June is considered the month of transfers and around 2000 officials were shifted this year..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/edu-dept-stays-transfer-of-257-officials-within-24-hrs-101625243874379.html

Road construction department (RCD) division started repair work immediately, West Champaran district magistrate (DM) Kundan Kumar said, adding that efforts were on to restore transport services at the earliest.According to officials, the collapsed part of the road sank deep into the earth near Nainaha Dhala, between Ratwal in Madhubani block of West Champaran. As a result, movement of vehicles has been disrupted on the stretch that integrates UP’s Kushinagar and four blocks of West Champaran--Piprasi, Madhubani, Bhitaha and Thakaraha-- with district headquarters. “Heavy downpour and erosion appear to be the main reason behind the collapse,” Bagaha subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Shekhar Anand said.Built at a cost of nearly ₹ 500 crore, a road and Gautam Buddha bridge (1,848m ) over Gandak river were necessitated to reduce distance between the aforementioned four blocks of West Champaran to Bettiah and boost rural economy. The cutting short of 95km of distance from Dhanaha, a block in Bagaha subdivision, to Bettiah after opening of this bridge in 2013 saved at least two-and-a-half hour travel time between the two destinations, largely inhabited by farmers. The bridge-cum-road was inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar on November 26, 2013.Following the collapse, a large number of the vehicles, including one carrying a wedding party, remained stranded for hours. “When villagers got to know about them, they made arrangements and facilitated their journey to the destination,” said a local Vinod Kumar. Officials said the district administration has also identified as many as 51 locations in Bagaha subdivision alone, where hilly rivers have caused erosions, rain cuts in roads, embankments and other sites. “The concerned departments have started the repair work,” said the Bagaha SDM.Meanwhile, vehicular movement were also affected on Sukana - Jigana road, Gamahariya - Chakaratan road Narkatiaganj - Lauriya road, - Ramnagar road and Narkatiaganj - Gaunaha (in Narkatiaganj subdivision) among others following rainwater flowing over roads after West Champaran experienced 150.96mm rainfall in last 24 hours. At district headquarters, life was thrown out of gear after waterlogging took place at several localities, market areas and main thoroughfare of the town, besides court, conference hall in collectorate and on premises of sub-divisional office. Former Nagar Parishad president Garima Sikariya described the waterlogging problem as man-made. “A loot culture has gained frequency in one and a half dozen schemes worth about ₹87 lakh for smooth drainage. As a result entire town has turned into a pond twice,” said Sikariya.Several villages in Bettiah (Sadar), Narkatiganj and Bagaha subdivision also reeled under water inundation. “Water gushing into houses have not been reported from any part of the subdivision,” Vidhyanath Paswan, SDM, Bettiah, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/biharup-road-connectivity-snapped-as-15ft-long-stretch-caves-in-101625243873676.html

Thousands of people, along with their cattle, have been forced to take temporary shelters on highways, as their homes got submerged under floodwaters from the three rivers. Heavy downpour in the catchment areas of different rivers in Nepal and in Bihar in the past 24 hours had led to considerable rise in water levels at different sections of their course. Many rivers originating from Himalayan regions, including Gandak, Lal Bakeya, Kamla, Adhwara and Khiroi, have jumped the danger levels (DL) and are exerting tremendous pressure on their embankments.Dozens of villages of three panchayats of West Champaran like Bagahi, Sakhuani and Manchnagwa, have been cut off from the rest of state after gushing currents of rain-fed rivers engulfed and damaged the roads network around.Situation in areas crisscrossed by Gandak and Kosi rivers might worsen in the next few days, as massive quantum of water was released from Nepal side through Valmikinagar and Birpur barrages in the past 12 hours, officials of water resources department (WRD) said. “About 2.15 lakh cusec water was being released in Gandak from Valmikinagar barrage around 4pm and 1.54 lakh cusec in Kosi from Birpur barrage, which is alarming in early July,” they said.“We are keeping close watch on all embankments with help of volunteers. All embankments are so far safe. However, dozens of villages in Panapur block of Saran got flooded on Friday after some miscreants cut open Rasauli zamindari bund on Dhanauti Nala, a tributary to Gandak, to fill up a nearby wetland with water,” said an executive engineer of WRD, adding that flood protection materials were being rushed to the site to plug the breach.River Ganga is, however, flowing below danger levels in its stretch throughout the state, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/muzaffarpur-villages-flooded-as-swollen-rivers-drain-out-water-in-low-lying-areas-101625243873083.html

Mohammad Imran Malik and his brother Mohammad Nasir Malik, allegedly associated with terror outfit LeT, were arrested Wednesday night for their alleged involvement in the low-intensity parcel blast at Darbhanga railway station.There was no loss of life or property in the blast. The two have been charged with hatching a conspiracy to detonate an explosion or fire in on Secunderabad-Darbhanga Express, which carried the parcel to Darbhanga. Before their production in the court, both were questioned for nearly two-and-a-half hours by a joint team of NIA and Bihar’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) in Patna. According to an NIA official, one of the suspects had visited Pakistan and received training. NIA sources said both hailed from Shamli in Uttar Pradesh and were currently residing in a rented house in Hyderabad. Nasir was into clothes business. Their father Mohammad Musa Khan is said to be an ex-serviceman and participated in Indo-China war in 1962. NIA officials said Nasir had visited Pakistan in 2012 and received training from LeT handlers led by one Iqbal Kana alias Asif in fabrication of IEDs from locally available chemicals. Kana, also a native of Kairana in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh and a wanted terrorist in India, is currently said to be in Pakistan. He was allegedly in touch with the Malik brothers, besides Haji Saleem and Kafeel Ahmad. Meanwhile, Saleem and Kafeel, who were already taken into custody by UP Special Task Force on June 23 in connection with the Darbhanga blast, were arrested by NIA on Friday in the same case. “The arrested accused met at the residence of Haji Saleem in February 2021 and finalized the plan of planting an IED in a moving train so casualties and extensive damage to property can be caused. Saleem is a close associate of Pakistan based LeT operative Iqbal Kana and was acting as a key intermediary between Iqbal Kana and the arrested accused. He was also involved in channelling funds sent by Iqbal kana that were used in executing the terror act,” NIA spokesperson Jaya Roy said in a statement.Malik brothers were in frequent touch with their handler and were using internet-based texting and WhatsApp and Telegram, NIA officials said. The Darbhanga station blast case was originally registered at Government Railway police station in Darbhanga while NIA registered a fresh case on June 24 and took up the investigation.

More than 84,000 pieces of handloom curtains are lying dumped at the BISHCOTEX office in Patna for nearly two years now. The products are losing shine and colour, while some are also due to damp and humidity, officials said on Friday. These handloom curtains were prepared by BISHCOTEX weavers following the state government’s decision to use handloom curtains in all government offices, hospitals and prisons in a bid to provide employment to handloom weavers, besides promoting handloom products. However, no supply order has been placed so far for these products due to which payment against the order is pending from the government, said Md Naquib Ahmad, BISHCOTEX chairman. Ahmad said by May 2019, more than 60,000 pieces were ready for supply and were brought to BISHCOTEX office.”I had also written about it to the then industry department secretary, S Siddharth, in this regard and his response was quite encouraging, but soon he was shifted to another department.”The society officials also wrote to district magistrates concerned, but there has been no response, he added. When contacted, industry minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, however, said he was unaware of the matter. “I have no idea about the matter. This issue should have been brought under my notice,” he said, adding that he would like to meet the weavers’ union leaders and discuss the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/weavers-worried-as-stocks-made-for-govt-remain-unsold-101625243871185.html

The study by Saha, a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, attempted to assess the scope and distribution of Covid-19, how infected persons and their families coped with it and measures taken by the government agencies and the community in controlling its spread. It involved over 23,000 positive cases, 200 interviews of families, interaction with officials and panchayati raj representatives. Patna was the worst hit in terms of infection and the executive officer of the Patna Municipal Corporation said all 75 wards of the city had reported cases. “The officials, however, mentioned an interesting phenomenon of Covid spread — none of the slums in their areas reported a single case of Covid, whereas many VIP areas of town reported a number of cases,” says the study. Another important finding shared by the PMC was that except for 3-4 persons, none of the 7,300 sanitary employees of the PMC, who mostly stay in slums or their family members, had been affected by Covid. It might be because all the sanitary staff had been vaccinated before the second wave. During the second wave, the study says, the migrant labourers did not return to Bihar in large numbers. “But many families returned during Holi. This festival was celebrated in Bihar from March 26-30, 2021, but it was a low-key affair. However, the arrival of a large number of persons during Holi could have contributed to its spread. Further, markets and offices remained open. Secondly, there was no restriction on the movement of people. Use of mask increased during the second wave, but still many people did not use masks,” it says, adding the lockdown from May 5-June 8 resulted in drop in positivity rate after a major jump before that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/migrants-didn-t-cause-spurt-in-covid-infections-study-101625243870543.html

Officials said penalty for carrying illegally mined sand starts from ₹3,000. Those indulging in illegal mining activities might have to face two-year jail term if found guilty.Officials said the mines department had to proposed hefty penalty as the government’s earning from the sand mining hardly went up despite substantial increase in the ghat (quarry) settlement charges.These were among the 10 decisions that the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar took in consultation with cabinet colleagues through a virtual meeting.The issues affecting construction of much-awaited Ganga pathway are set to be settled after the cabinet cleared a proposal to hand over nearly 40 acres of land, located in Sabalpur area under Sonepur circle of Saran district.

02-07-2021||Pune||State board declares evaluation process for Class 12||Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) on Friday issued a Government Resolution (GR) declaring the evaluation of Class 12 state board students. The board has followed the footsteps of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The evaluation criteria for Higher Secondary certificate (Class 12) are similar to that of the CBSE board. The class 12 examination by the state board was cancelled after other boards cancelled their exams due to rising cases across the state and country. The evaluation of the class 12 students will be done with 40 per cent internal evaluation from class 12 and 30 per cent each from class 11 and class 10 final results. Maharashtra education minister, Varsha Gaikwad in a tweet said that the evaluation pattern for class 12 is released after discussions with various stakeholders. She also said that given the pandemic situation, the board is permitted to pass all students. “The overall assessment will be the measure of a student’s performance in theory papers and orals/practical/internal assessments. Each school will have a result committee headed by the principal and six teachers. They will be responsible for the finalisation of results and the safekeeping of records,” said Gaikwad. For Class 10, the GR stated that the marks of the best three subjects will be considered. “Students who have scored maximum marks in any three subjects in class 10 will be considered for evaluation of Class 12. The oral or practical exam for class 12 subjects will not include marks from class 10 and class 11 subjects,” stated the GR. The GR further stated that for class 11 the final result will be considered. For class 12, the unit test and practice exams and other internal evaluations will be done by the respective schools and colleges. Gaikwad added that repeaters and students who are appearing for Class 12 from private institutes, will have a separate evaluation strategy. “Students who are applying from the ‘improvement scheme’, this cancelled board exam of 2021 will not be counted as a missed opportunity. Such students can avail their eligible number of attempts later,” said Gaikwad. The GR further states that the timetable for the result of Class 12 will be published soon by the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-board-declares-evaluation-process-for-class-12-101625242669698.html

The order comes in the wake of air force authorities informing the police about sharp beam and laser light display in the peripheral public areas around the airport which witnesses air force sorties and domestic flight operations on a very large scale. Joint commissioner of police Dr Ravindra Shisve in an official order stated, “I am convinced that due to the display of beam lights, the pilot’s eyes might get distracted with the possibility of an accident.” The order states that no person must display beam light during the said period failing which action will be initiated under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The order further stated, “Citizens living around the Lohegaon Air Force base and civil airport in its jurisdiction surrounding 15 km (air field radius) under Pune police commissionerate shall be prohibited to use beam lights from 6 pm to 6 am. The prohibitory orders shall be in force from October 5, 2020 for the next two months. Failing to follow the orders, a person shall be liable for action under section 188 from IPC.” There are a number of residential colonies and marriage halls located around the airport. Use of such lights is common during marriages and other public programmes. Management companies, wedding halls, often use such high beam lights which often cause distraction to the pilots. Earlier, the Indian Air Force had said the use of such lights could lead to accidents, thus, endangering many innocent lives. The Lohegaon airport is busy during the day and night as the runway is used by fight jets and along with domestic and international flights. The lights may distract pilots leading to aviation disaster, the order explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/display-of-high-intensity-beam-lights-banned-within-15-kms-of-lohegaon-airport-101625242369639.html
02-07-2021||Pune||Three ambulances drivers in custody for bringing patients to Apexcare hospital||Three ambulance drivers were remanded to police custody on Thursday by the Sangli police in the case of causing death of 87 people in 42 days of the second wave at Apexcare hospital in Miraj. Meanwhile, the two doctor siblings - Dr Mahesh Jadhav, a plastic surgeon, the main accused in the case and his elder brother Dr Madan Jadhav, a neurosurgeon, were remanded to judicial custody. The police have also seized vehicles of these ambulance drivers as a local court remanded them to police custody till July 4. The three people newly arrested in the case were identified as Yunus Ilahi Mujawar (39), a resident of Ganeshnagar in Sangli; Sachin Arun Chandane (37), a resident of Old Medshingi road area of Sangola; and Viren Ulhas Awade (32), a resident of Bethlehem nagar in Miraj, according to the police. Sachin Chandane was cited by relatives of more than two victims of the hospital, to Hindustan Times, as the driver who took patients to Apexcare hospital voluntarily. Two patients who cited him as the person who suggested and took their relative to Apexcare were from Bhose village in Sangola area of Solapur. “We had found a diary in possession of one of the accused in which there were payment details and names of some drivers. Our suspicion is that the drivers got commission for each of the patient that they brought to the hospital,” said senior police inspector Shashikant Chavan of Gandhi Chowk police station where the case is registered. The police had called a group of ambulance drivers to the police station on Monday for questioning and recorded their names and numbers. Explaining the trick of the trade, __, said, “Whenever a new hospital is started, the PRO (public relations officer) of the hospital goes to groups of ambulance drivers and offers them perks in exchange of bringing patients to their hospital. For all we know, the names, in the diary that was found, would have just been noted down, without the drivers’ knowledge, for reference for such activities.” __ is an ambulance driver who was among the 15-20 drivers who were called for questioning. However, statements of multiple witnesses point towards clear involvement of ambulance drivers in the matter, to earn commission from the hospital. Senior PI Chavan reiterated his point, saying, “This could have been passed off as a case of medical negligence and registered as a case of causing death due to negligence (Section 304(a) of IPC) which is a bailable offence. But this is not such a case. There was no treatment given at all. They only wanted to make money.” So far, 13 people including the ambulance drivers, have been arrested in the case registered at Mahatma Gandhi police station in Miraj under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder); 420 (cheating); 406 (criminal breach of trust); 425, 427, 465, 470, 471 (using forged document as genuine); 201 (destruction of evidence); 380, 34 (common intention), and 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Section 51(b) of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/three-ambulances-drivers-in-custody-for-bringing-patients-to-apexcare-hospital-101625242249664.html

According to him, the FIR has been lodged against the owner doctor and license of the hospital has been suspended. To note, Sri Paras hospital hit the headlines recently after a video went viral, In which the owner doctor admitted to allegedly conducting a ‘mock drill’ on patients to check their oxygen dependence, after which 22 patients turned ‘blue’ and were ‘eliminated’. “The probe against the hospital has not ended and only a preliminary report has surfaced. Still, action has been taken against the hospital and it has been sealed. FIR has been lodged against the owner doctor and license of the hospital has been suspended. Further action will be taken if the hospital is found at fault in the final report,” Sharma said. On Sri Paras Hospital being given Covid hospital status in the second wave despite being sealed for anomalies in the first wave, the deputy chief minister said that as the second wave was more intense, the priority was to have more hospitals to save corona patients. Regarding vaccine shortage affecting pace of inoculation in the state, Sharma stated that sufficient number of vaccines were being made available. “Yet, in case there is some shortage, it would be fulfilled in a day or two wherever it occurs. For Agra district also, sufficient quota of vaccines has been sanctioned like other districts,” he said. “ Some political leaders made efforts to spread confusion about vaccines but fortunately the people of Uttar Pradesh did not fall for false propaganda and are now turning up for vaccination in smart numbers, even in rural areas,” he said. “Screening committees are moving in 97,000 revenue villages in the state and are even making medicines available to villagers at home. The emphasis on ‘’Triple T’ i.e. Tracing, Testing and Treatment continues and there is positive outcome in villages after these initiatives,” Sharma said. “In apprehension of a third wave, pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are being prepared. Oxygen plants are coming up at community health centres and primary health centres are being strengthened by making medicines available for the common man,” he said. In reply to another question, the deputy CM said no groups or alliances had succeeded against the BJP and even in the past, such combinations failed to stop the party which had done a lot under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-against-sri-paras-hospital-not-over-yet-says-up-deputy-cm-101625241409558.html

02-07-2021||Lucknow||Phone became more handy than stetho as doctors attended distress calls in Uttar Pradesh||Many doctors had to pick up their cell phones even before taking their cup of morning tea all through the months when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak. The callers were in panic and desperately seeking solace. In Lucknow, many doctors kept an extra battery pack to attend to such distress calls without a break. For instance, work began as early as 7am for Prof Kauser Usman, senior faculty member at King George’s Medical University (KGMU). “Quick response over the phone guided apt diagnosis for early impactful treatment. Secondly, speaking to a doctor made the patient confident, an important factor in fighting Covid,” said Prof Usman who guided over 500 patients over the phone. “The months of September-October 2020 and April-May 2021 were the toughest in Lucknow,” said Dr Samir Misra, senior faculty trauma surgery (KGMU) who had spoken to over 250 patients in distress. “Each caller had someone serious (to seek advice for) and wanted immediate relief,” he said. “The greatest challenge on telephonic guidance was to ensure the patient has understood everything correctly. Since they (patient) and their family members were in panic, it became my responsibility to cross-check what they have understood,” said Prof Suryakant, head of the department of respiratory medicine at KGMU who was in charge of IDH Covid ward in the second wave. The state capital has reported 2.38 lakh Covid-19 cases till now and over 50,000 people consulted doctors over the phone during this period. “The most difficult part was to remember the medical history as every patient called in distress, expecting me to remember their clinical history, which is basic for prescribing medicine,” said Prof Usman. Doctors across specialities took up the job and had their own challenges in dealing with different categories of panic-stricken patients belonging to various age groups. An expert in medicine, Prof Usman got calls from diabetics, too, as diabetes is a key comorbidity for Covid. “Being a joint replacement surgeon, I got calls mostly from my patients. Striking a balance between medicines for orthopaedics and Covid was a challenge that (one) could manage,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, joint replacement surgeon and director of Healthcity hospital in Lucknow. Dr Abhishek Shukla, an expert in geriatric medicine at Aastha Hospice, said, “First I had to be a patient listener and give more time to each call than what I give to one patient in the OPD. Elderly patients wanted to share a detailed explanation personally. My biggest challenge was to understand frail and needy voices over the cell phone. In fact, during the pandemic, we used cell phones to know many things that stethoscope or personal examination (otherwise) reveals.” “We thought one or two (phone numbers) cannot meet the growing need. Hence, in April we launched 10 mobile numbers of different doctors as a helpline for consultancy. About 2500 patients connected with the IMA helpline,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of Indian Medical Association-Lucknow. Doctors spoke, offered medical advice and words of comfort. In a pandemic scenario, patients were largely advised to take online consultations with doctors. The state government, too, launched the e-sanjeevani telemedicine service. Prayagraj’s Dr Debabrata Samanta, a well-known physician with over 28 years of private practice in the Sangam city, faced a unique challenge during the pandemic: His patients were contracting Covid-19 by the dozens, and he could not physically examine them. Reason: Having undergone a kidney transplant in August 2017, he was in the designated vulnerable category himself. So, he started offering tele-consultancy to his patients, attending 50 to 80 calls a day. “Many people called up multiple times as every dip in oxygen level, increase in body temperature or other parameters needed urgent attention,” said the 56-year-old pass out of Motilal Nehru Medical College, Prayagraj. In July 2020, he himself contracted the Covid-19 infection and had to be admitted at the Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon, where he battled the virus bravely for 40 days and beat it in a tough fight. During this period, his wife, Dr Nivedita Samanta, a gynecologist, and one son besides brother, sister-in-law and their two daughters also contracted the infection. Despite the challenges, Dr Samanta, who was quickly back from Medanta post-recovery, again got busy extending tele-consultancy to his patients. “I had to be back at work as patients needed me in these challenging times when general OPDs were just not running. During the peak of the second wave, I treated around 500 patients using the mobile phone and WhatsApp to prescribe medicines,” he said. Dr Sher Mohammad, the medical officer in-charge of the Badagaon primary health centre in Varanasi, gave advice to hundreds of patients, including Covid-19 patients on the phone. “While being in home isolation, as I tested Covid-19 positive in the first week of May, I continued to serve the patients. I gave advice to hundreds of patients on the mobile phone. The patients used to call me and seek advice. It was not an easy task because many patients panicked after testing positive. They used to ask on the phone if they would recover, how long it would take to get well and so on. I consoled them and asked them to follow the advice and guidelines. After recovering, several patients called me back and thanked me. Before testing positive, I attended the patients at the PHC.” Dr Vidit Dixit, assistant professor in the anatomy department, looked after the Covid hospital at LLRM Medical College in Meerut as coordinator. His main task was to convince attendants to keep their patients under treatment in home isolation after examining their condition. “I convinced many patients that they could be treated at home,” said Dr Dixit who thereafter followed up on the home isolated patients through regular phone calls or WhatsApp. “I used to speak to home isolated patients and their attendants in family to know their condition and guide them about medication,” he said. He also counselled many patients to boost their confidence. “It was a big challenge, but I remained composed while interacting with patients and their attendants,” said Dr Dixit, who added that a majority of patients in home isolation initially wanted to get admitted in a hospital to keep themselves under direct supervision of doctors. In Agra, the phone of Dr Ashish Gautam, associate professor at SN Medical College’s department of medicine, kept ringing all the time as he received panic calls during the second wave of Covid-19 in April and May. “A wave of fear and panic had gripped the common man during the second wave. In many cases, over-consumption of medicines was the issue. We had to pacify them and ensure correct precautionary measures,” stated Dr Gautam. “We had to understand the psyche of the caller as he was unable to meet the doctor in person. They were mostly in search of precautions and used to ask when they should get themselves or loved ones admitted in hospital. We used to illustrate the guidelines and parameters of different ailments,” said Dr Gautam. “We continue to be on the phone lines. Now, the queries are about vaccination and related issues. Our main task is to eliminate fear and build confidence,” he said. “They used to send their reports through WhatsApp, and we used to advise them. A man came from Mumbai to attend to his father and mother in Agra who had tested positive for Covid-19. He followed all our advice and got his parents well and himself too. Such cases gave us satisfaction in return,” said Dr Gautam who added that the maximum calls were received between April 10 and May 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/phone-became-more-handy-than-stetho-as-doctors-attended-distress-calls-in-uttar-pradesh-101625239970218.html

Worry strikes, college students seek psychological help||Although the second wave has subsided, and the number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital has reduced, yet the news of an impending third wave seems to be creating havoc in the lives of college students. City-based psychologists share that every time there is news of a third wave coming, the number of calls from college students increases and so does their anxiety and stress level. “Anytime there is news of a third wave, I feel like I’ll never go back to college! We were sure by now that we would be back to offline campus, but that hasn’t happened yet. All this just adds to our isolation,” says Viveka Goswami, a student of Sri Venkateswara College, Delhi University, who is waiting for her final year classes to begin. She adds: “We thought once we are vaccinated, things will be better. Whenever we talk to our parents, or anyone for that matter, they always talk about how they did this or that in college. And we feel we are already missing out on so much, and then if a third wave has to come, then will we even see or be in college again?”“It is almost instant. Any time there is news of when the third wave will hit, or anything about it for that matter, I start getting so many calls from students; definitely more than what I get usually. They react to the fact that the pandemic seems to be a never-ending phenomenon,” says Anu Goel, a Delhi-based psychologist sharing how she often has been attending multiple calls from anxious students. “Last year in fact we weren’t getting that many calls from students. But this year, the number has certainly gone up,” says Delhi-based counselling psychologist Anvi Grover Jain, emphasising how the news of third wave is playing havoc with the mental health of youngsters. “One of my patients finished her graduation, and was so excited to do her masters in college. She even got through Jawaharlal Nehru University. But the fact that she can’t go physically to the college is making her so anxious. The youngsters feel that they are missing out on career opportunities because they can’t go to college,” adds Jain.Imran Noorani, associate professor and consultant chief psychologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, says that many of his young patients are also distressed because they took a gap year. He explains: “Some college students skipped college because they didn’t want to attend it online in the pandemic stricken world. And now, they are distressed because they feel that they won’t be able to join college anytime soon because of the third wave, and they have already lost one year.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/third-wave-coming-worry-strikes-college-students-seek-psychological-help-101625237095085.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Van Mahotsav: Unlock seed bombing, make the most of monsoon||While monsoon might have been playing hide-and-seek with Delhi-NCR, but that hasn’t deterred the conviction of environmentally conscious groups. Armed with face shields, masks, gloves and sanitisers, these eco warriors are elated to be out in the midst of Nature, at an opportune time, when monsoon plantations are the right thing to begin, and seed bombing is the activity that they vouch for! And that’s how they are kicking off celebrations for Van Mahotsav (July 1 to 7), which aims to spread awareness on forest conservation across the country. Participation limited, not plantation “The unlock period is the most opportune time for planting, since it is near the onset of monsoon,” feels Manish Khurana, founder of We Mean To Clean, a Delhi-NCR based volunteer group that conducts cleanliness drives, native tree plantation and awareness programs across the region. “We’re looking forward to conducting quite a few plantation drives this season. We’re following all Covid appropriate behaviour, considering the havoc that we witnessed during the second wave of the pandemic, and might be limiting participation in our plantation drives. We have started the drives in Janakpuri and Vikaspuri and also plan to conduct them at Subhash Nagar, Dwarka, and Rohini,” he says. The volunteers are looking at planting native trees such as Peepal, Neem, Amaltas, and Jamun among others. “We’ll also try to support them with shrubs such as Mehendi. We’ll be preparing the soil with some compost. We plant the saplings and then make sure they are taken care of regularly for at least two to three years until they all become self sustainable,” adds Khurana. Exploding in the soil, for Nature’s sake“It’s a fun activity which helps raise awareness towards the urgent need to protect our fast depleting forest cover,” says, environmentalist Alka Saran, from Let’s Walk Gurgaon, who is too looking forward to native seed bombing. “Monsoons are almost here and it’s time to increase our green cover by planting trees and seed bombing. Seed bomb is a bomb that explodes and plants shrubs and trees! It’s an ancient technique of making earth balls by mixing soil, manure and native seeds and embedding or throwing them in the ground. It is especially useful in hard to reach places like hills and forests. It is also known as aerial reforestation. Besides native tree seed bombs,we also carry Amaltas (Cassia fistula) seed pods which are used to dig and embed seed bombs and left as food for animals who in turn disperse these seeds through their droppings in the forest,” she says. Creating newer habitatsAnother NGO, IamGurgaon has been committed to plant local, native species as part of their mission of planting million trees in the city. Latika Thukral, founder, says, “We have planted around 2.5 lakh plants with 100% survival rate in the last 10 years. We maintain our plants for three years with watering through sewage treated water. Now we don’t even say planting trees but creating habitats. All our planting areas have become haven for birds, butterflies, insects. We will be planting in Sikanderpur forest, Badhshahpur forest corridor,” she says. Making space for medicinal plants Gurugrammer Nilay Agarwal, a social worker and founder of Vishalalakshi Foundation, has been planting trees such as Ashok, Neem, Bamboo, Peepal, Sehjan, and Kadam, across the city and aims to continue the drives in the months to come. “We have identified a slum in Gurugram’s Sector 48, which we cleaned using diggers and excavators and planted trees to make the area green. Often, once we clean an area, people let it stay clean for a while before littering again. But by converting those areas into greener spaces, we ensure they are treated with much more love and concern. We are focusing on the advantages of medicinal plants such as Giloy, Ashwagandha, Shatavari, Safed Musli, Ajwain, Elaichi, Sarphganda. We planted the same, and educated the people living in slums about the same.We ask our volunteers to follow all Covid protocols once they appear for the drive. Masks and gloves are provided at the site and volunteers are requested to bring their own sanitiser and water bottles to avoid unnecessary touch,” says Agarwal.

Over 84,000 pieces of handloom curtains have been lying at the BISHCOTEX office in the state for nearly two years. Stacked at the BISHCOTEX store for the last several months, the products are losing their shine and colour, and some have also gotten damaged due to dampness and humidity. These handloom curtains were prepared by BISHCOTEX weavers following a government decision to use handloom curtains in all government offices, hospitals and prisons. It was intended to provide employment to the handloom weavers and to promote handloom products. However, there is no demand for the curtains, and hence the weavers have not been paid.Also Read | Maize trader shot at, ₹3.70 lakh looted in Bihar’s Purnia“I have no idea about the matter. The case that some handloom products are waiting to be purchased, should have been brought to my notice,” Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, industry minister, said. He said he would meet them and try to help them. Md Naquib Ahmad, chairman, BISHCOTEX, said, he had written about it to the then industry department secretary, S Siddharth, when the products were ready in 2019 and his response was quite encouraging, but soon he was shifted to another department. “We even wrote to the district magistrates about the handloom curtains and the government decision, but there has been no response,” he said. the chairman said that the government had announced the order in 2019. “Weavers were very excited, and they prepared handloom curtains in bulk. But there has been no order,” he said. By May 2019, more than 60,000 pieces were ready and were brought to the BISHCOTEX office, he added.“Weavers are now worried how to recover their investment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-demand-for-handloom-curtains-despite-govt-order-5k-bihar-weavers-left-in-lurch-101625234149600.html

02-07-2021||Kolkata||Ruckus in West Bengal assembly as BJP protest against governor speech for not mentioning post-poll violence||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Friday created a ruckus in the West Bengal legislative assembly, forcing governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to cut his inaugural address short. The leaders raised slogans and carried posters with pictures of alleged victims as the state governor was just minutes into his speech. Justifying the disruption of the assembly session, Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of opposition in West Bengal, said that they protested after finding "no mention" of post-poll violence in the speech."Incidents of (post-poll violence) in Bengal have been barbaric. BJP workers have been murdered; more than 300 women were molested; a few raped," said Adhikari later in the day. "Had no option but to stage a protest after finding no mention of post-poll violence in the governor's speech", he also said. The copies of speech were circulated among legislators before the official speech.Adhikari further alleged that the governor was "forced” to read out the speech prepared by the state government, led by the Trinamool Congress's Mamata Banerjee. "We don't blame the governor," Adhikari also said, adding that his party wants to hold day-long discussions in the House on post-poll violence and the recently held fake vaccination drive in the city.During the demonstration, some BJP leaders also came to the well of the assembly to stage a protest. Following the incident, Dhankhar tabled his speech in the House and left from the newly constituted state assembly.The governor was escorted by Speaker Biman Banerjee and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as he left the assembly premises.Meanwhile, reacting to BJP's protest, the TMC said the saffron party has set a new precedent in anarchy. "What they (BJP MLAs) did today is unprecedented and unacceptable in a parliamentary democracy," TMC chief whip Nirmal Ghosh pointed out.According to a news agency PTI, Dhankhar did seek an inclusion of the matter in the speech, however, the request was denied by the state government.Some incidents of violence were reported from different parts of West Bengal after the TMC chief Mamata Banerjee won a re-election and defeated the BJP, which was hoping to gain power in the state. Since then, the matter has become a flashpoint of the old-running rivalry between the BJP and TMC leaders.BJP has accused the TMC of targeting its party workers and alleged that it carried out atrocities after the violence incidents. Banerjee has maintained that workers from all parties have been killed in the incidents and assured that the government will take the due course of action.The business of the House, which began with the governor's address on Friday, will continue till July 8. The state budget for 2021-22 is likely to be placed in the House on July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ruckus-in-west-bengal-assembly-as-bjp-protest-against-governor-speech-for-not-mentioning-post-poll-violence-101625229733832.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Mumbai’s North-South Divide||As someone who lived the first 17 years of their life in north Mumbai’s Juhu and the rest in south Mumbai (give or take a handful of years spent away in Kolkata and Delhi), I feel I am among those uniquely placed to comment on the eternal north-south debate, that periodically rears its head, accompanied with much good humoured name-calling on both sides of the city’s axis. You know the drift: South Mumbai, which has recently adopted the acronym SoBo, perhaps in the hope that it alludes to “sophisticated”, has been traditionally viewed as the “heart” of the city, the citadel of its establishment and authority, with its world-famous heritage Victorian and art deco architecture. Until quite recently, we referred to this part of Mumbai as “town”. As teenaged Bandra school girls, the thrill of birthday celebrations was a day trip to town; we regarded it as the pinnacle of grown-up sophistication. In those days “town” was an awe-inspiring entity — it was here you could lunch in the air-conditioned plushness of a Nanking; then watch a Hollywood movie in a beautiful, art deco cinema; and later, drop by Colaba to buy your silver trinkets and Kolhapuri chappals. Town people, or “townies”, were regarded by us as altogether another species: Town girls with their short hairstyles and shorter skirts and their tennis rackets and exclusive clubs — we regarded them as more fashionable and confident than us, their poor cousins from the north. As for town boys, we were taught by our elders to be wary of them and give them a wide berth, as far as possible. Truly, in those days, town was what most of us aspired to and were equally intimidated by. ****************************A few years ago, while writing about my mother, the late Usha Khanna who had launched Café Samovar in the early Sixties in the heart of town while being a resident of what was, in those days, the far-flung sleepy hamlet of Juhu, I recall drawing attention to the remarkable daily commute it had called for — boarding a bus from a stand on a sandy lane across the beach, she used to then catch a train from Santacruz station to reach Churchgate, and from there, walk — past the sleek art deco precinct of the Oval Maidan, past the imposing Victorian Gothic fleet of the University of Mumbai, the High Court and Rajabai Clock Tower, until her footsteps brought her to the Indo-Saracenic splendour of the Prince of Wales Museum and its adjoining Jahangir Art Gallery. I like to think that with every step of her journey, my mother gathered the courage and strength that she required for her day ahead. Perhaps, many others among the millions of commuters, who make that daily journey, do so too. ****************************And what did townies make of us, suburbanites? Given that so many of its established families like the Tatas, Birlas and Ruias had weekend cottages in Juhu, Madh and Manori and that so many film folk resided in Pali Hill, Juhu, Bandra and later JVPD scheme, I imagine south Mumbai most likely regarded north Mumbai as the residence of their more colourful, artistic, counterparts and thought of its palm-fringed cottages and clean, inviting beach as an early Goa. Certainly, by the Seventies, the famous Juhu Gang — a rag tag bunch of bohemian filmmakers, writers, actors and star kids — was capturing public imagination. Not too long ago, I was delighted when the internationally celebrated architect Bijoy Jain shared with me that he attributed his world view and success to his childhood spent in Juhu and his proximity to the Juhu Gang. At that time, actor Shashi Kapoor had been one of the more high-profile travellers on this north-south axis. One of the few stars who chose to reside in south Mumbai, he would famously drive down every Sunday to Janki Kutir to have lunch with his father Prithviraj Kapoor and then spend the rest of the day at the Sun-n-Sand, swimming with his family. Interestingly, the other stars who lived in town in those days, such as Sharmila Tagore, Simi Garewal, and Zeenat Aman, could be counted on the fingers of one hand and had certainty seemed a class apart from their north Mumbai counterparts. The standing joke used to be that SoBo snobs were so insular and precious that they required a visa each time they crossed Haji Ali on their way to the the rest of the city. ****************************One of the first few people to breach this long-standing north-south divide had been the late Parmeshwar Godrej. Like everything else she did, Adi Godrej’s dynamic and glamorous wife had shaken things up and rearranged the rules. Until then, there had been little truck between Mumbai’s business elite and its film industry, as there had been between south and north Mumbai. Parmeshwar changed all that. For all practical purposes she and Adi divided their time between their smart apartment in the iconic Usha Kiran, one of the tallest buildings of its era (which also housed Dhirubhai Ambani and his family) and their fantastical, Spanish hacienda-like, sea-facing mansion in Juhu. Here, she proceeded to mix things up further by hosting much sought-after soirees, where the bold and beautiful from both halves of the city would hobnob. Here, Rahul Bajaj would rub shoulders with Amitabh Bachchan and Anand Mahindra with Dimple Kapadia. After this fortuitous fraternising, there had been no holding back. Karan Johar, brought up in Malabar Hill, moved his LV bag and baggage to Khar; AD Singh, a dyed-in-the-linen SoBo-ite, contributed to Bandra becoming the city’s F&B capital with his launch of Olive; and a few years later, the Sea Link more or less put paid to much of the north-south divide. ****************************Slowly, but surely south Mumbai began to lose its sheen and central position in the scheme of things, as the city metamorphosed and changed shape with the development of new areas such as Lower Parel and BKC. Gradually, with money shifting to new businesses and surnames, SoBo’s Old Rich found themselves becoming Mumbai’s New Poor; fashion and jewellery stores and restaurants and bars began reporting far better sales and footfalls in north Mumbai. These days, with so much mobility between north and south Mumbai, I regard all allusions to Mumbai’s north-south divide as an endearing but tired anachronism. Cities constantly move shape, and along with it, their neighbourhoods take on new meanings and attributes. Today, the north appears to have stolen a march over its twin — SoBo, as being a more attractive proposition in a host of ways. The changes are personal too. Even though north Mumbai and its suburbs remain an abiding love and my heart still soars each time I turn left at the Aeroplane Garden, now, having spent over 30 years living in SoBo, I have to admit that it has begun to feel like home. So where do I weigh in on the great north-south debate? All I am willing to say is this: The grass is always greener on the other side…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-mumbai-s-north-south-divide-101625229769585.html

02-07-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC takes cognizance of NHRC report on post-poll violence, orders probe||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) government suffered a setback on Friday when the Calcutta High Court took cognizance of the National Human Rights Commission’s (NHRC) report on post-poll violence in Bengal which mentioned allegations of murder, rape and arson. HT has learnt.The court gave more time to the seven-member panel of the NHRC and asked it to visit the districts and meet more complainants and file the final report on July 13.The five-Judge bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar directed the state police to record statements based on the recommendations of the NHRC and asked the state government to provide medical treatment and ration to the affected families, said Priyanka Tibrewal, one of the lawyers for the petitioners and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader.The bench ordered a fresh autopsy of the body of BJP supporter Abhijit Sarkar who was allegedly strangled to death by a mob in the Narkeldanga area of Kolkata on May 2, the day the assembly poll results were declared. The body is kept in a city morgue.The written order said,"Surprising fact available from the report is that state authorities, had been claiming throughout, that there were no complaints received by them but when the opportunity was given to the complainants to file complaints with the State Legal Services Authority or the NHRC, the authorities were flooded with complaints. People are afraid to even disclose their identity to apprehending threat to their life and property."The hearing was held virtually.The court said that the autopsy has to be done at the army's Command Hospital in Alipore. "The report shall specifically mention about the condition of the body as to whether it was properly preserved in the hospital where it was," said the order.During the hearing, advocate general Kishore Datta told the bench that the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of Abhijit Sarkar’s killing. The Bench said it was only ordering a second autopsy without giving any direction. The victim’s brother, Biswajit Sarkar, is among the petitioners who moved the Supreme Court in May seeking the formation of a special investigation team for probing allegations of violence by members of Trinamool Congress (TMC).The Bench on Friday also issued a show-cause to Rashid Munir Khan, the deputy commissioner of police of the south suburban division of Kolkata Police for failing to give protection to the NHRC team led by Atif Rasheed, vice-chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities on June 29. Rasheed, a member of the team constituted by the NHRC to look into complaints of post-poll violence, alleged that he was attacked while visiting the Jadavpur area. The alleged incident took place at Dompara where the crematorium and morgue workers live as a community.The bench asked why the police should not be held guilty of contempt of court as it was directed to provide protection to the NHRC teams.The bench said the government can submit its submission after the NHRC files its final report on July 13.Leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP, welcomed it saying the state government made false statements in its affidavits filed at the Supreme Court. “The government said all the violence took place when the Election Commission was in control of the administration and nothing happened after the new government took charge. It was a lie,” said Adhikari.“The government will follow the court’s order. But our contention is that Mamata Banerjee controlled the situation after she was sworn in. The violence took place before that. Also, the allegation about the attack on the NHRC team at Jadavpur is not correct,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.The BJP staged an agitation at the state assembly on Friday afternoon, stopping governor Jagdeep Dhankhar from reading out his speech at the beginning of the budget session. Dhankhar had to stop his speech after four minutes and leave the assembly house.“We staged the agitation because the speech prepared by the government did not mention post-poll violence although it is now a national issue,” said Adhikari.The NHRC’s preliminary report was placed on record on June 30. It was filed in a sealed envelope. The court refused to disclose the contents although lawyers for the petitioners prayed for it.NHRC officials did not talk to the media but officials aware of the developments said the preliminary report said the seven members in the panel met more than 100 families and received complaints about 41 murders and 13 rapes. The preliminary report did not mention the role of the local police which is also being probed by the NHRC team. This will be mentioned in the final report, officials said.The NHRC panel includes a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and a member of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority.Divided into two groups, the members have visited north and south Bengal districts. A camp was also held in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata on Monday where many people came to give their statements.On June 21, the Calcutta HC’s five-judge bench dismissed a petition by the West Bengal government seeking recall of the June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during alleged violence after the recent assembly polls. The High Court asked the NHRC to submit its report by June 30.Dismissing the state’s plea for recall, Justice Bindal remarked on June 21 that there are allegations that police are not taking action while more complaints are being filed. He observed that the conduct of the state does not inspire the confidence of the court.Justice Harish Tandon, another judge on the bench, said while 541 complaints had been received by the NHRC, not a single one was received by the West Bengal Human Rights Commission. More than 3400 complaints were received till June 21, Tibrewal told the court.The NHRC panel is led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as an NHRC member on June 2. The other members are National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee.On Tuesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said during the press conference that the BJP was making up the allegations. “One or two cases may be genuine but the rest are made up by the BJP. These are all fake allegations,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-takes-cognizance-of-nhrc-report-on-post-poll-violence-orders-probe-101625228690878.html
02-07-2021||Bhopal||Over 400 duped in the name of fish farming: MP’s EOW||Over 400 farmers, including a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker, have been duped by a private company in the name of doubling their income through contract fish farming in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, people aware of the matter said.Madhya Pradesh’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has initiated an investigation in the matter after Sanjay Vishwakarma, a farmer, filed a complaint in March this year against Fish Fortune company of Gurugram, Haryana.“The company started a contract fish farming business in August 2019 and lured farmers by promising to double their income. Their agents contacted farmers in at least four states and lured us... We trusted them as initially when they gave some money to farmers as profit. In October 2020, I agreed to do fish farming. They took ₹5 lakh as security money from me and also asked me to convert my 1.5-acre agricultural land into a fishpond,” said Vishwakarma. “According to the agreement signed in October 2020, the company was supposed to do fish farming. They were to provide fish seeds and purchase fish every six months from us. We needed to just take care of the fish. But neither they provide any fish seeds, nor they came to see the pond. Now, I lost my land as well as money.” Also Watch | Stampede-like situation at Covid vaccination centre in Madhya PradeshRajesh Singh, another farmer from Vidisha, who filed a complaint on Thursday, said he rented a piece of land and converted it into a pond. “Now I am under huge debt as the landowner wanted his land back in original condition or I have to pay money for that.

Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Gaurav Singh and a personal security officer in the CM’s security staff, Balwant Singh, have been placed under suspension.Officials fought in public on June 23The three officers fought in public on June 23 when Gadkari was visiting the state to inaugurate road projects.According to government sources, Gaurav Singh had allowed people affected by the Chandigarh-Manali four-lane project to protest peacefully when Gadkari came out of Bhunter airport. The Union minister met the protesters and listened to their grievances. This didn’t go down well with the chief minister, who pointed it out to his security staff.Sood raised the matter with Gaurav Singh. This led to a heated exchange and things took ugly turn when Singh slapped Sood. Seeing this, PSO Balwant Singh kicked the IPS officer. The entire incident was caught on camera and shared widely on social media, prompting state police chief Sanjay Kundu to remove all three from their duties and order an inquiry.Gaurav Singh and Balwant were suspended the next day, while Sood was attached at the police headquarters as the DIG Central Range, Madhusudan, conducted the probe. The probe report has since been submitted Kundu, who has forwarded it to the state government for further action.Ex-SP claims Sood violated security protocolIn his statement to the investigating officer, Gaurav Singh alleged that Sood abused him and made last-minute changes in the motorcade in violation of the security protocol. Sood refuted the allegation of misbehaviour and maintained that his concern was the CM’s security. Balwant Singh said he lost temper when the IPS officer slapped his boss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-days-after-kullu-slapgate-sood-back-as-asp-in-hp-cm-s-security-101625227249054.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Charged-up Sidhu among biggest power dues defaulters in Punjab||Navjot Singh Sidhu was all charged up on Friday as he took on the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government for imposing power cuts in Punjab but what the Amritsar East Congress MLA conveniently forgot is that he himself is one of the state’s biggest individual electricity dues defaulters. At present, Sidhu has an outstanding electricity bill of ₹8,74,784 for his Amritsar residence. Also read: Sidhu’s power-packed jibe at Punjab CM: No need for cuts“In March 2021, Sidhu owed the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) ₹17,62,742. At that time, the PSPCL launched a drive against defaulters and Sidhu paid ₹10 lakh. A sum of ₹8.74 lakh is still pending,” said GS Khaira, the superintending engineer of PSPCL, Amritsar. “Sidhu has applied for one-time settlement of the bill, raising doubts on surcharges which is under consideration,” he said. Power connection and political clout A senior PSPCL official at its Patiala-based headquarters said: “Before giving advice and suggestion to others, Sidhu should clear his dues. Many consumers with a lower outstanding amount faced disconnections, but due to Sidhu’s political clout, the department didn’t take action.” PSPCL officials said that the last date to pay the bill was July 2, and if Sidhu failed to clear his dues, action would be initiated against him. Opposition posts bill on social media Making the most of the situation, opposition parties in Punjab have been sharing the outstanding bill of Sidhu on social media. Despite repeated attempts, Sidhu’s phone was switched off and he was not available for comment. Incidentally, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had allotted the power portfolio to Sidhu instead of local bodies when he resigned in 2019, claiming that his services had been downgraded. For the past year and a half, Sidhu has been criticising his own party’s government over power purchase agreements and costly electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chargedup-sidhu-among-biggest-power-dues-defaulters-in-punjab-101625225388687.html
02-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP MLA booked on rape charges by party worker||A case of rape has been lodged against Suresh Rathore, BJP legislator from Jwalapur at Bahadrabad, around 15 kilometres from Haridwar city, police officials said.“A case has been lodged against Suresh Rathore under section 376 IPC at Bahadrabad police station. We are further investigating the matter,” said sub-inspector Bahadrabad police station Mahendra Pundir.According to the officials, the case was registered on Friday at Bahadrabad police station against the BJP legislator on the complaint of a female party worker who hails from Begumpura village.The complainant alleged Suresh Rathore of raping her a few months back. She said she couldn’t disclose the matter at that time as she was warned of dire consequences by the legislator.Rathore said he is a public representative and law-abiding citizen so would cooperate with the court and police in the investigation process. “I am being wrongly framed by anti-social elements who earlier tried to blackmail me but instead got caught. There is a threat to my life, so I request police protection. All these charges levelled against me are baseless,” he said.On May 26, Rathore lodged a complaint against the complainant, her husband and three others who allegedly posed as media and demanded ₹30 lakh from him. Rathore, in his complaint, alleged that the woman and others with her threatened to circulate a video, in which she was levelling rape allegations against him, in exchange for the sum asked.Police then set a trap with Rathore calling the female and her accomplices, to personally collect the said amount from him.As the five accused arrived, the police nabbed them and lodged a case of blackmailing against them. Later, the female moved the court alleging being raped by Rathore. She accused Rathore of misleading the police and said he is roaming freely owing to his approach and clout as a legislator.A female party district leader, on condition of anonymity, said that the complainant was working closely with Rathore in party related programs till a few months back and was a prominent attendee in political programs, rallies, meetings of the Jwalapur MLA.BJP district president Jay Pal Singh Chauhan said he has not much information about the case. He said it’s a legal matter and refused to comment.Congress, meanwhile, has sought resignation from Rathore.Pradesh Congress Committee vice president Dhirendra Pratap said that when legislators are involved in such heinous crimes, one can assess the law and order situation in the state as well as the morality among BJP leaders.The legislator is regarded as Ravidasacharya pontiff among Sant Ravi Das sect followers and also holds religious sermons. He also took a religious procession of scheduled castes during the Mahakumbh fair.Rathore was also announced to become Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Panchayati Niranjani Akhada during the Mahakumbh fair but Akhada retreated owing to stiff opposition against Rathore as he is married and has a family, while only those can become Mahamandaleshwar who renounce family and materialistic life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-mla-booked-on-rape-charges-by-party-worker-101625224368569.html

Rutumati, 40, the wife of the farmer Balakrushna Kanhar who was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday, died of cardiac arrest a day later.Kanhar sought help to carry his wife’s body, but hospital authorities allegedly ignored his request. “As no medical staffer came to help him, Balakrushna carried the corpse from the second floor of the hospital on his own to a vehicle waiting outside,” said Basant Kumar Padhi, a local Congress leader.Kanhar dragged his wife’s body on an iron stretcher to the hearse van as no one came to his help.Also Read | Odisha halts Covid vaccination amid dose shortageAfter the video went viral, chief district medical officer Rajashri Patnaik sought an explanation from the staff nurse and the help desk attendant at the hospital. The two were later suspended while another employee was dismissed.Arup Jena, President of Kandhamal Citizen Forum, said, “The medical staff apparently listened to music on their mobile phones while Kanhar asked for help. No one even came forward to hold his two-year-old daughter when he and his father put the body in the hearse van. The child was lying on the ground. I am simply appalled at the lack of empathy.”In August 2016, tribal farmer Dana Majhi was forced to carry the corpse of his wife on his back for 10 km from the district headquarters hospital in Bhawanipatna town of Kalahandi district as no hospital staff came to help him. Following an outrage, the state government started a free hearse van scheme the same month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-man-forced-to-carry-wife-s-body-on-his-back-101625223768484.html
02-07-2021||Lucknow||'Group of opportunists and power greedy people': BSP's latest tirade against SP||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) spokesperson Sudhindra Bhadoria on Friday lashed out at Samajwadi Party (SP), a day after its chief Akhilesh Yadav said it will go to the Uttar Pradesh assembly election in alliance with smaller parties. Reacting to this, Bhadoria, the SP lacks policy and has "no principles, no programmes," news agency ANI reported quoting the leader.Bhadoria added, "The SP is only a group of opportunists and power greedy people. Since the formation of this party, the anti-Dalit mentality has been seen in the country and especially in Uttar Pradesh.”Continuing his tirade against the SP, the BSP spokesperson called the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the SP the two sides of the same coin. "They both represent feudalist and capitalist forces and the BSP’s struggle is against both of them," he also said.Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to go to the polls to elect a new government to the legislative assembly in 2022. With less than a year left until the polls, leaders of all major political parties have ramped up their attacks against each other.Earlier on Thursday, Akhilesh Yadav, who is also a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said that the BJP doesn't want to hold a debate on real matters like unemployment, inflation. He had also asserted that the 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh will usher in "a democratic revolution" against the current "disruptive" and "negative" politics.Meanwhile, Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) president Omprakash Rajbhar suggested a new ‘formula’ to govern the state if his 10-party alliance comes to power. Rajbhar said there will be a new chief minister every year. "If we form the government in 2022, we are clear that there will be five chief ministers in five years. One will be Muslim, one Rajbhar, one Chauhan, one Kushwaha and one Patel. We will also have four deputy CMs in a year and 20 in five years. We are clear that everyone will be treated equally in the coalition," said Rajhbhar on Thursday.On Sunday, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi announced that his party will contest 100 of the total 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh. It will fight the elections in alliance with the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha", a coalition of small parties including the AIMIM and Omprakash Rajbhar’s SBSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/group-of-opportunists-and-power-greedy-people-bsp-s-latest-tirade-against-sp-101625223263086.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Sanjay Raut says Centre using CBI, ED for targeting opposition||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday asked investigating agencies to not involve themselves in toppling elected governments. He said that if investigating agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are used to target ministers of the opposition parties it is akin to “attacking from behind”.“Threats were issued that more such actions will be seen. This kind of politics is not good. Lakhs of livelihood are dependent on sugar mills. Use of ED and CBI are akin to attacks from behind. One has to fight face-to-face. ED and CBI should not involve themselves in toppling of governments,” Sanjay Raut was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Shiv Sena leader also said that the people who were intrinsic to the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra are being targeted. Raut was speaking in response to the ED’s action of attaching a sugar mill in Maharashtra which was allegedly linked to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sakhar Karkhana, located at Chimangaon-Koregaon in Satara district was attached by the ED in connection with the alleged Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) scam.The Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP expressed confidence that the MVA will win the election to the state legislative assembly Speaker's post. He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cannot weaken the government in Maharashtra despite their efforts to cause a body blow. Raut stressed that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray enjoys a cordial relationship with Congress president Sonia Gandhi.“There is no threat to the MVA even if the BJP works hard to weaken it. The BJP will do a favour to Maharashtra by allowing a unanimous election. There is no point in creating suspicion and uncertainty over the fate of the MVA government. The speaker's post will go to Congress. The candidate will be decided by the Congress leadership,” Raut said.State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat earlier said that the Speaker will be elected during the two-day monsoon session, scheduled to be held on July 5 and 6. The post became vacant after Congress leader Nana Patole was chosen to lead Maharashtra Congress earlier this year.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, however, remained non-committal regarding the election for the Speaker’s post during the session, the chief minister said in his letter to governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sanjay-raut-says-centre-using-cbi-ed-for-targeting-opposition-101625221902811.html
02-07-2021||Other||Global Village Idiot: Long, short and instant hooks to get tele-spammers off the line||I love tele-callers. Just love them. They are artistes of a different hue, scientists of a different science, peddlers of the ultimate kind. Just love them.I can always tell by the number when a spammer calls. You know how? I just can- it’s a gift. But, I still pick the call. Every day. Why? Just.There all kinds and types of Tele-Spammers. Long, Short, and Instant. The Instant Pitch ones launch into it the moment you pick up. The Short Pitch callers are like the 100-metre dash specialists - they run out of ideas after three questions or 60 seconds, whichever comes first. The Long Pitchers are artistes - they use a meaningful headline, construct a conversation, have loads of information.Then there is the classification by Personality Type: Hesitant, King of Cool, Star, Hostage, and Professional callers. I have sympathy for the Hesitant ones - they are never sure of themselves, or their pitch, or their answers. The Professionals are efficient, smart, articulate and shrug off all outcomes. The Hostage are the ones who don’t want to be calling you, but they have to: “It’s a job, no sir?” “My boss forced me to call you.” “I have to meet my targets sir.” My favourite are the Stars - they always sound like they are doing you a favour. “So? I am going to sell you this car insurance - You know why? Because you are lucky I am calling you.”Then there are the Consultants. These are the ones who call because they want what’s best for you, not to sell you anything, but to give you free information, advise, and tips just because you are such a wonderful and loyal existing customer (or because they want you for one)... these get stuck after all their pitching is over because then they have to sell and they can’t, because their opening gambit was not to sell, but to give free advice. Obviously, I get a lot of calls. And earlier, I used to get mighty upset and rant/rave/hang-up. Then one day, I got a call when I was idle and in a good mood. And this is how the conversation went:“Hello sir, I am calling from Blah Blah Financial Advisors. Who are you?”“You don’t know who you are calling?” I was already smiling.“Yes sir I know. Mr Mukherjee, no?”“Yes - how may I help you?”“No, I want to help you. We have very good financial products to make money quickly.”“Really?”“Yes, yes. We give 30-40% returns. Our investment experts are very experienced and they know how to invest money.”“Excellent, excellent,” I said. Then asked, “Do you also have loan products?”“Yes yes. We give very cheap loans. No documentation.”“Interest rate?”“16%”.“That is too expensive. Banks are offering 15%.”“How much do you want?”“How much will you give?”“We can give up to Rs10 lakh sir.”“Excellent, excellent.”“What about investment sir?”“Yes, why not? Since you are giving me money, I might as well invest. But you guarantee 40% return?”“Yes.”“Okay but I want that in writing.”“Can’t give 40% commitment in writing, company policy.”“Really? Then I can’t invest. Call me back when you can give it in writing. Have a good day.”Click. Now this one works very well for cold callers if you have time and are willing to draw out the caller into a long, engaged conversation. They usually don’t know what happened and when they do, they never call back because they know you are not going to buy and that you will suck up a lot of time without any result.Another strategy goes like this:“Hello is this Mukherjee?”“Hi! You are from the insurance company?”“Yes sir.”“Excellent. Do you have my claim money?”“What? No. I am...”“What? No money? You insured me and now no claim settlement?”“But sir ..”Rant a little and they hang up on their own.A more indirect strategy is: Ring, ring.“Hello?” Sounding busy.“I am calling from ...”“Umm, am in a meeting. Could you call me at 4 pm? Thank you.” Click.I make a note of the number and don’t take further calls for a week. Then, I pick one and tell them I already bought what they are selling from a competitor, why didn’t they call earlier? Now in a way this is mean of me. I mean, they are really just doing their jobs. But the way most of them go about it, isn’t ethical, or professional, nor decorous. For instance, where do they get my number from? These are unsolicited calls and the sales pitches are mostly for products and services that are dubious at best. But there are also good (even great) tele-callers. These are gems. Conversations go like this:“Hello sir, would you be interested in a new product from our company?”“No, I have a product and am not looking for anything new.”“I apologise for disturbing you then. May I call back later in the year to check if you may require our services?”The answer to that one is yes, because that is a professional and respectful approach. Sign me up for two of those… er... make it three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/global-village-idiot-long-short-and-instant-hooks-to-get-tele-spammers-off-the-line-101625222628817.html

Police said he lived outside the campus and that they found an 11-page note from his home on Friday, saying he was unable to cope with his daily work and did not want to trouble his parents.An investigator, who did not want to be named, said the man wrote if he is unable to fulfil daily tasks, he may not be able to rise to get bigger work.Police have registered a case of suspicious death under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 174. “The body has been sent to the Royapettah Government Hospital.

02-07-2021||Bangalore||Loud sound rattles many areas of Bengaluru, Twitter users compare it to last year's sonic boom||Bengaluru residents across the city heard loud sounds around 12:15pm on Friday as several people took to Twitter to describe it as a "boom" or a "thud". According to reports, the loud noise was heard in ISRO Layout, HSR Layout, Benson Town, Sarjapur, Ulsoor, south Bengaluru, east Bengaluru and JP Nagar areas of the city.Calling it "an annual ritual" many netizens compared Friday's sound to a similar boom they heard last year. Citizens said the sound was loud enough to make windows rattle. “Windows rattled after a huge sound...what was it, one more Sonic Boom?” asked one user.There was speculation online that the sound might have been caused by a trainee fighter jet flying over the city from the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport.However, HAL refused to comment on Friday's incident. "Regular sorties of fighters and trainee aircraft take place from HAL airport. Today was no different. HAL can't comment on the loud sound reportedly heard today in Bengaluru," HAL's spokesperson told ANI.In May of last year, a similar "sonic boom" was heard in areas like HSR Layout, Ulsoor, Old Madras Road, Kundanahalli, Kammanahalli, CV Raman Nagar, Whitefield, Ramamurthy Nagar, Cooke Town, Hosur Road, and Vivek Nagar. The ministry of defence tweeted that it was caused by a routine IAF test flight outside of city limits when the aircraft was decelerating from a "supersonic to a subsonic speed" at an altitude of 36,000 to 40,000 feet above sea level.“It was a routine IAF Test Flight involving a supersonic profile which took off from Bluru Airport and flew in the allotted airspace well outside City limits.

In the wake of the new variant Delta Plus being reported from the state, the state government has brought back some restrictions in the state. After the second wave of the pandemic, Mumbai local services were never completely opened for the public. Only essential and emergency workers with valid ID proof can now travel by Mumbai locals. In the first week of June, the Maharashtra government announced a five-level unlock plan which has now been reduced to three, but nothing was announced about Mumbai local services.What is a Universal travel pass?Apart from the local trains, this pass will be valid for Mumbai Metro and monorail. While the pass is aimed at eliminating people travelling using fake cards, this pass will also have degrees depending on which the individual will be allowed to travel.Here is how it will workIn accordance with Maharashtra's five-level unlocking, there will be several degrees of the pass. As level 5 of restrictions means effectively no restriction, those with Degree 5 card will be allowed to travel always. Rest will depend on what level of restriction Mumbai is in. For example, Mumbai at present is in level 3 restriction. A person with a Degree 3 pass will only be allowed to travel if the restrictions in effect are of levels 1, 2, or 3. If a commuter has a Degree 2 pass, he/she will be able to travel if the limitation level is 1 or 2, reports said.How to registerOnly establishments can register for this pass on the website of the Disaster Management and Relief Fund Rehabilitation department of Maharashtra-- msdmacov19.mahait.org.Click on Universal travel passClick on 'register your establishement'The establishment authority will have to provide details like address, registration number, co-ordinator contact number, the number of staff who need the pass etc.This application will be manually reviewed by the district disaster management authority and on approval, the coordinator will be able to log in using the mobile phone number and upload individual details of the staff who would be requiring the travel pass.Staff name, ID, mobile number, gender, age, department, the designation will have to be provided.Staff members will get SMS once the information is uploaded.Then they can log in using their mobile number and uploading a photo, they can download their individual travel pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-how-to-get-qr-code-based-travel-pass-for-train-travel-amid-curbs-101625211866879.html
02-07-2021||Dehradun||Case filed against Dehradun school for seeking halal meat supply||The manager, principal, and vice-principal of a prominent boarding school in Dehradun have been booked for allegedly promoting enmity among communities over a tender floated by them for the supply of halal meat for the institute’s mess on Thursday.The case was registered on the complaint lodged by Bajrang Dal members against the school management. Only designations of the accused have been cited and no one has been named in the First Information Report (FIR). HT has seen a copy of the FIR.Sub-inspector Mahavir Singh, who is probing the case, said the case was registered under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 505(2) for “publishing a statement that promoted enmity among communities”.Also Read | In Uttarakhand, Covid and lack of jobs top BJP’s worries“The case was registered after receiving a complaint from Bajrang Dal leader Vikas Verma. However, we are yet to question the representatives of the school management mentioned in the FIR. Action would be taken after a proper probe,” said Singh.Verma welcomed the police action but said more stringent sections should have been invoked.“What they were doing is completely unpardonable. They were inviting just halal meat supply to serve to the students of Hindu community also which is not permissible in the Hindu religion. We asked them to show documents of any old tender for jhatka meat which is permissible in the Hindu religion, but they failed to show any. It just shows that the school management was doing that for long,” said Verma.Verma demanded an apology from management for their “misdeed”. “We would soon visit other prominent schools in Dehradun and Mussoorie which too are reportedly serving only halal meat and poultry items to students of all the communities.”The representatives of the school could not be contacted for a reaction. The copy will be updated once they react.Halal meat is slaughtered according to Islamic norms and involves the draining of blood from an animal’s body while jhatka is the meat from an animal killed instantaneously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/case-filed-against-dehradun-school-for-seeking-halal-meat-supply-101625212967599.html

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu’s power-packed jibe at Punjab CM: No need for cuts||Amid protests by opposition parties, farmers and other consumers against the power cuts in Punjab, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu hit out at his own Congress government in the state on Friday, raising questions over its handling of the electricity supply situation. In nine tweets, the Congress MLA said that there is no need for power cuts in the state or for the chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh) to regulate office timings or AC use of the common people if the government acts in the right direction. Also read: ‘CM, Sidhu will have a working arrangement’: Harish RawatThe state government had on Thursday announced measures such as the curtailment of timings of government offices from 8am to 2pm and two-day weekly offs for industrial consumers besides appealing for limited use of ACs. Sidhu, who has been critical of Capt Amarinder Singh and his own party’s government in recent weeks, said that he is sharing the truth of power costs, cuts, power purchase agreements and how to give free and 24-hour power to the people of the state. Capt Amarinder Singh holds the power portfolio. Had quit cabinet when given power portfolio Sidhu’s latest attack comes two days after he had one-on-one meetings with former party president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who are said to be keen on giving an important role in the state Congress to him. Ironically, the Amritsar East MLA had quit the cabinet in 2019 after his portfolio was changed from local bodies to power and new and renewable energy. He had refused to take charge of the departments. Blames over-dependence on three private thermal plants Questioning the high power purchase cost in his tweets, Sidhu said that Punjab is buying power at average cost of ₹4.54 per unit, whereas the national average is ₹3.85 per unit and Chandigarh is paying ₹3.44 per unit. He blamed over-dependence on three private thermal plants at ₹5 to 8 per unit for this. “The (previous) Badal Govt signed PPAs with 3 private thermal power plants in Punjab. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid ₹5,400 crore due to faulty clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay ₹65,000 crore. People’s money just as fixed charges,” he tweeted. Says amend law to cap power purchase costs Advising the state to purchase power from the national grid at much cheaper rates, he said the PPAs (with independent power producers) are acting against Punjab’s public interest. “Punjab may not be able to re-negotiate these PPAs due to them having legal protection from the courts. But there is a way forward. Punjab Vidhan Sabha can bring in new legislation with retrospective effect to cap power purchase costs to prices available on the National Power Exchange at any given time. Thus, by amending the law, these agreements will become null & void (sic),” he wrote. The MLA said that Punjab’s revenue per unit of consumption is one of the lowest in India, due to gross mismanagement of the complete power purchase and supply system. “The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited pays ₹0.18 per unit extra on every unit supplied, even after receiving over ₹9,000 crore in subsidy from the state,” he tweeted, advising the state to harness renewable energy which is becoming cheaper and also environment-friendly. Takes on Kejriwal, says state needs original Punjab model Commenting on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s promise to replicate the Delhi model of power supply in Punjab, Sidhu advocated an original Punjab model to tackle the state’s power problem. “Punjab already gives ₹9,000 crore power subsidy but Delhi gives only ₹1,699 crore. If Punjab copies the Delhi model, we will get merely ₹1,600-2,000 crore as subsidy… Punjab needs an original Punjab model, Not a copied model (sic),” he posted. He said money spent on giving unreasonable profits to private thermal plants should be used for the welfare of people, giving power subsidy for free power up to 300 units for domestic use, round-the-clock supply and to invest in education and healthcare. On Tuesday, Kejriwal had also promised 300 units of free electricity for each household in the state, waiver of pending power bills and round-the-clock supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhus-power-packed-jibe-at-punjab-cm-no-need-for-cuts-101625211887640.html

02-07-2021||Bangalore||Vistadome coach for Mangaluru-Bengaluru train from July 7||A train from Mangaluru to Bengaluru, which passes through the picturesque Western Ghats for more than 45 kilometres, will now have an additional feature. The Indian Railways will attach a Vistadome coach from July 7 to the day train number 06211/06212 between Karwar-Yesvantpur at Mangaluru Central station, according to a report in Udayavani on Friday.The Kannada language newspaper reported citing people familiar with the development that the coach will have 40 reclining seats that revolve 360 degrees. Bookings for this bogie will begin on July 3. The Vistadome coach will also be attached to the tri-weekly Mangaluru-Yesvantpur train (06575/06576) from July 11, the people cited above by the newspaper also said.The Mangaluru-Bengaluru railway line is very scenic but people were not able to soak in the beauty of nature in the conventional railway coaches so far. The Shirady Ghat stretch begins at Nettana in Sullia taluk and ends at Sakleshpur in Hassan district, a stretch of 45km. Siribagilu, a station at the top of the Brahmagiri range, gives a 180-degree panoramic view of the Western Ghats.The train will stop at Siribagilu for 10 minutes just to allow the passengers to view this scenery.

02-07-2021||Bangalore||Colocasia leaf rolls enlisted in AYUSH ministry's 'traditional food recipes'||The Karnataka coast and the Konkan region on the western coast of India have added a new feather in their cap. Pathrode or a roll made out of colocasia leaves has been enlisted in the ‘traditional foods recipes’ published by the central government’s AYUSH ministry. Colocasia leaf rolls are among the 26 dishes which have been chosen because of their nutritional value.The traditional recipes compiled in the form of e-book guides list the ingredients and recipes of these 26 native delicacies, besides elaborating their health benefits and contraindications. Niger seed laddus, apoopam and peya are among other dishes included in this compilation from AYUSH Systems of Medicine.Pathrode is composed of two words--patra meaning large leaf and vade which is a popular dish of south India. Even today certain sections of the Brahmin households call it Patra Vade. This ubiquitous leafy overgrowth called ‘Kesu’ is found almost everywhere along the coasts of Karnataka and the Konkan region during monsoons.The iron-rich colocasia leaves not only improve haemoglobin but the phenols, tannin iron, flavonoids and glycosides present in them also help in reducing inflammation. Besides these, Vitamin C and Beta Carotene are other nutrients are also present in these leaves.The easily digestible colocasia rolls can be either eaten in healthier steamed form or roasted with coconut oil and mustard seeds for enhanced flavour. Pathrode is relished throughout monsoons by most families living in the coastal areas. Coastal communities are also fond of growing Kesu in their backyards during the monsoons.The leaf which grows naturally well during monsoons is nowadays being grown in a cultured environment. Some parts of Kasargod in Kerala and the Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka have started growing them for exporting to areas that do not have natural habitat for their growth. Farmers in Karnataka’s Udupi have grown it in abundance and exported it to places in the middle east and the Gulf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/colocasia-leaf-rolls-enlisted-in-ayush-ministry-s-traditional-food-recipes-101625201054643.html

The gang had laid low in 2020 amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Police suspect that members of the gang, who had been personating police officials, had stolen jewellery from a man delivering the items to a store near the municipal corporation building here on Wednesday. The gang is known to have committed similar robberies in the past. Of the 41 people known to be associated with the gang, four were spotted in Ludhiana. Police on Thursday conducted a foot patrol of markets in the Old City area on Tuesday and circulated pictures of the suspects among traders. They also raided inns and hotels to trace the suspects. The victim, Mukesh Kumar of Chandigarh, had said that he had come to Ludhiana to deliver jewellery to a shop in Sarafa Bazaar. He had parked his vehicle in a multi-level parking of the municipal corporation and had started walking towards the market when a man claiming to be a cop stopped him. The imposter led him to a corner on the pretext of frisking, where three of his accomplices were already present. The accused was let go after frisking. When Mukesh opened his bag after reaching Sarafa Bazaar he was shocked to find two boxes of jewelry were missing. He immediately lodged an FIR against the accused at the Division 1 police station. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal asked the public to be ware as they personate police personnel and rob traders on the pretext of frisking them. The kingpin of the gang Lallu Khani Irani, also known as Bulldozer, Siyaz, has been arrested by the Ludhiana police. He is facing trial in at least 44 cases. “Members of the Irani Gang had migrated to India from Balochistan over a century ago. Most members of the community are involved in robberies, snatchings and burglaries. They reside in small slum areas in Boriwali, Malad, Thane of Mumbai and in Bhopal of Madhya Pradesh and follow their own rules and rituals.” In 2019, after executing crime in the city, the gang had gone to Patiala, Ambala, Panipat, Delhi and then returned to Mumbai. The gang had also executed snatchings in Bengaluru and Chennai, besides parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. A hunt is on for their arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/notorious-irani-gang-strikes-again-in-ludhiana-101625193944429.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Now, agriculture secy Anirudh Tiwari interim in-charge of PAU||Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was buzzing with activity, a day after its vice-chancellor professor Baldev Singh Dhillon, declined the board of management’s offer to extend his tenure, citing “personal reasons”. It has been learnt that agriculture secretary Anirudh Tiwari will be in-charge of the agricultural university till a new vice-chancellor can be appointed. Dhillon, who will be remembered as the longest serving vice-chancellor, had been first appointed to the post in 2011 for four years. His term was extended for four years in 2015 and for two more years thereafter in 2019. He has served as the head of the Ludhiana-based institution for 10 years. His predecessor, Sukhdev Singh, had served as the university’s vice-chancellor from 1981 to 1989. PAU Teachers Association (PAUTA) president Dr HS Kingra says it was Dhillon’s long career, which had been the source of contention between the teachers’ union and the V-C. “Transition is the way of life. However, in Dhillon’s case, the post of vice-chancellor had become permanent. Ideally, he should have retired after completing his second term in office. In the meantime, he could have taken a prospective candidate for the post under his wing. Everybody was under tremendous pressure because of his continuing tenure from the top to the lower rungs.” The highlight of Dhillon’s stint on the top post was that he refused to bow down to political pressure and did not allow any political interference in the working of the university. The academic is an internationally acclaimed scientist in the field of plant breeding and genetic resources. He has served in PAU as director of research, director (seeds) and maize breeder; at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) as assistant director general, and director, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi; and at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, as director of research.Before he took reins of the agricultural university, he was working with the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany. He was also associate scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, (CIMMYT), Mexico.At the university, Dhillon laid special emphasis on overall development in research, teaching and extension programmes. Several varieties of paddy and wheat were developed during his tenure.Dhillon led the Joint Inter-State Campaign (Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan) that had successfully managed white fly in cotton, resulting in a bumper crop with record productivity of 756 and 750kg/hectare of lint as compared to 197 kg/hectare in 2015. He had led a vigorous campaign against paddy straw burning in 2018. He had also vocally opposed the farm laws and suggested measures to increase farm income. Dhillon has published 400 research and policy papers.

The cops recovered ₹14.5 hawala money, 22 desktop computers, nine laptops, and 31 mobiles, along with accessories including LAN servers, Wi-fi routers, and Wi-fi switches, from their possession. The accused were operating the fake call centre from Chandan Towers at Pakhowal Road. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal informed that the fake call center was being operated by Lakhan Abrol, Yatin, Cain Masih, and Titus in the tower owned by Somal Sood. All of them, along with their 22 employees, including four African nationals, have been arrested. Accused bought victims’ data at ₹1 each The gang has employed the African nationals as they were fluent in English and could converse in UK and US accents. They used to converse with their targets over the phone, while the rest of the accused used to help them. Agrawal said that the fraudster bought the database illegally through the internet at ₹1 per person. The data included the name, mobile number, and other identification details of the victims. Revealing their modus operandi, Agrawal said, that callers approached the UK and USA-based citizens through an internet-based calling application (VoIP) known as VICI Dial App phone service. While calling the UK nationals, they used to pose as officials of the UK government, and while calling the US victims, they posed as Amazon employees,” he added. “The fraudsters used to tell the UK victims that their identity had been used to carry out revenue fraud in their country and a criminal case would be filed against them. When the victims asked them for a remedy, the callers, posing as executive representatives of the department, would transfer the call to a senior ‘handler’,” said the commissioner of police. The handler would then guide the target to transfer the amount temporarily to the accounts of their aides residing in the UK. The targets were told that by doing this they could skip the tax penalty. Agrawal said that half of the transferred amount was kept by the UK and USA facilitators, while the remaining was received by the accused through hawala transactions. The police have also found incriminating evidence of foreign payment gateways, fraud bank accounts, and data of lakhs of UK income taxpayers. He said that further investigations are on to ascertain the total amount of the fraud done by the accused and to trace their accomplices, including those running their operations from the UK and US. An FIR under Sections 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offense, in order to commit extortion), 467 (Forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 66C, 66D and 75 of the IT Act, has been registered at Division Number 5 police station against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fake-call-centre-busted-27-held-for-duping-uk-us-residents-101625193524188.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Power outages in Ludhiana render scorching summer hotter||Ludhiana A subdued monsoon has caused a heatwave to sweep across the district, with temperatures hovering around 40°C. Amid the sweltering temperatures, prolonged power outages across the industrial hub of the state over the last two days have added to residents’ woes.According to the India meteorological department (IMD), in the plains, heatwave is declared if maximum temperature is more than 40°C and at least 4.5°C above normal, or if it crosses 45°C. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 39.8°C, which was 4.3°C higher than the normal, while the minimum temperature was 29°C, 2.8°C higher than normal.As the heat continued to bake the region, the power load on the grid soared, causing unscheduled power outages, which lasted for up to 14 hours on June 30 and July 1. In some places, faulty power cables were to blame for the power cuts. Even posh localities had to deal with blackouts. The whole city was plunged into darkness from 8.30pm to 9.30pm on June 30.Officials of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) say a prolonged dry spell, caused due to a delayed monsoon, paddy transplantation and the failure of a unit in the Talwandi Sabo thermal power plant in Bathinda had amplified the problem.Helpline numbers no help, say residentsDespite the power departments’ phone ringing off the hook as residents were hassled due to the unscheduled power cuts, there was no respite in sight. Instead, the PSPCL appealed government and public sector officers to turn off their air conditioners for the next three days.A PSPCL spokesperson said, “We are facing trouble meeting the power demand, which is over 14,500 MW. The PSPCL has appealed to government departments, boards and corporations to use electricity judiciously by switching off lights, devices and high power-consuming appliances such as air conditioners for the next three days. Further, wherever possible, employees are advised to avoid using multiple AC units within the office, which will decrease the power load on the system as well as the electricity bill.” Residents of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, one of the posh localities of the city, had no power for at least 14 hours. Avtar Singh, a local, said, “The first power cut took place around 8.30pm on Wednesday. The power supply was resumed after an hour but was again disrupted within five minutes. Numerous complaints and phone calls later, supply was resumed in one phase around 2am.”Similarly, Rajguru Nagar, Threeke village, and Jagjit Nagar had to contend with a 16-hour power outage. Advocate Nalin Kaushik, who had registered 15 complaints, said, “They (power department officials) kept telling me that they would send over a team to check the issue, but nobody came. With the temperatures touching 45°C, it was impossible to sleep without a fan or air conditioner.”Ansar Colony, behind Sector 32, Chandigarh Road, said they have been facing the issue for eight days. Kavita Rani, who lives in the colony, said. “Each night, the power supply is interrupted around 11.30pm and resumes after 5 hours.”Those residing in New Nanda Colony, Kakowal, are not faring any better. Sunny Singh, a resident of Nanda Colony, said power supply to the area was disrupted around 2am. When they did not get relief from the helpline number, they approached the PSPCL office at Kakowal road, but no official was present there. Power was resumed in the area after 9 hours.”Durgapuri of Haibowal Kalan had to suffer the double whammy of interrupted power and water supply. Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Durgapuri, said water supply was affected due to the electricity outage. “Power supply was disrupted around 1am and resumed around 3.30pm.” Similar, outages were seen in Model Town, Civil Lines, Dugri, Pakhowal Road, Salem Tabri, Focal Point and Jamalpur areas.Heatwave to continue till July 10Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) department of climate change and agriculture meteorology officials say monsoon had arrived 16 days in advance on June 14, which had weakened the weather systems in the region. Head of the department Prabhjyot Kaur said, “Due to a break in the monsoon pattern, the heatwave will continue till July 10.”Meanwhile, civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia had sounded a heat wave alert across the district. Apart from advising people to protect themselves from the severe heat, the civil surgeon has asked all government hospitals and community health centres in the district, including dispensaries, to share details of heatstroke patients.“Heatstroke is caused due to prolonged exposure or physical exertion in the heat. It can cause an altered mental state or behavioural changes, confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and even coma, said Dr Rajesh Mahajan, professor of medicine at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H).An untreated heatstroke can damage the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can also result in serious health complications or death, said Dr Mahajan.There has been a significant shift in weather cycles: Expert Experts have expressed growing concern over the shifting weather patterns over the last few years. They say shifts that may appear minor now may eventually have a devastating impact. The average maximum temperature in June was 36.2°C, nearly 2°C below normal, officials of the meteorological department said. However, at a mean of 25.4°C, the minimum temperature remained normal.“The district received 84.8mm rainfall in June, which met the ideal quota for the month,” said Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) department of climate change and agriculture meteorology head Prabhjyot Kaur.“It may look that all is well on paper, but there has been a significant shift in weather cycles. Even in May, the average maximum temperature had remained two degrees below normal. In both the months, we saw a sudden rise and dip in temperature. Though, the downpour received in June was as expected, but it was short and sharp, which is not beneficial for groundwater recharge,” said Kaur.An erratic rainfall pattern has been observed over the past two decades, where the duration of monsoon has increased, but there has been inadequate rainfall in the region, she added.Beat the heatA heatstroke can be prevented by taking a few precautions: * Avoid strenuous activity in hot weather. Schedule exercise or activities that require physical exertion early in the morning or in the evening when it is cooler.* Drink plenty of fluids. Add salt or ORS to water or have lemonade to replenish salt balance in the body after sweating.*Avoid using alcoholic or sugary drinks to rehydrate. * Wear loose-fitting, light clothing to prevent sunburn||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-outages-in-ludhiana-render-scorching-summer-hotter-101625193224317.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His definition of the city||I’m resting—the thought has taken over Muhammed Saif. At this time of the afternoon, he would be hauling large amounts of construction material on the hand-pulled cart along this central Delhi bazaar. But here’s a surprise respite. His next assignment is after a few minutes, so he has taken advantage of the situation by lying on his bed. The ceiling fan is providing a needful breeze.“I’m letting my body rest,” he says. In his 30s, Mr Saif is in a check lungi and a T-shirt, his red flip-flops by his bed. His bed is a thin mattress on the floor. The room is dusty. One side is covered with piles of bricks that will have to be carried onto a construction site at some point. There’s a shovel too, which belongs to one of the many colleagues he shares this living space with. It is connected to an additional room whose entry is from another side.Having recently returned, following the lifting of the lockdown, from his village in Katihar, Bihar, Mr Saif’s talk naturally starts to hover around his family. “I’ll never want my children to live in the city.” To him, the city is strictly a place to earn paisa. “Otherwise there’s nothing much here,” he says while letting his arms flail around, suggesting that Delhi is pressing him on all sides. “The city gives paseena (sweat).”By the city, he explains, he doesn’t mean Delhi alone, but all the cities. Mr Saif has been in the Capital for a year. He spent the previous 10 years as a labourer in Chandigarh.He has no tender ideas about his village either. Some people there might have airy houses with courtyards, trees and milk-giving buffaloes, he concedes, but not him. “We don’t own any agricultural land… my house was earlier made of mud, and now the walls are of baas and the roof is of tin.”Gazing through the open door—the only source of fresh air since there are no windows in the room—he observes that “my home in the village and this room in Dilli are not very different… sukoon (relief) comes only when you earn a good amount of money.”He considers his sukoon to be idyllic if he makes ₹700 by the day’s end.Now Mr Saif lifts himself slightly, rests his head under his right hand and stays silent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-definition-of-the-city-101625179514095.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Over 1.3 million migrants left Delhi during 2nd wave of Covid-19, shows data||A little over 500,000 migrant workers (and their families) left Delhi for their homes during the second wave of the pandemic, and a consequent lockdown, starting mid-April, the Union labour ministry has said, taking the total number of migrants that left the Capital to a little over 1.3 million.In a report submitted to the parliamentary panel of home affairs on Monday, and using data sourced from the rail ministry, the ministry of labour and employment said that nearly 517,073 migrants left for their homes from Delhi using trains during the second wave. HT has reviewed a copy of the report.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Delhi government said last month that nearly 800,000 migrants used buses to leave the Capital between mid-April and mid-May.The report pointed out that unlike the migrant crisis seen in April and May last year, when many tried to reach home (with no transport being available) , this time, the exodus remained smooth, and attributed this to the partial nature of lockdowns.To be sure, there was no nationwide lockdown during the second wave, although most states did enforce lockdowns. But both trains and buses continued to run. For instance, according to the Delhi government, between April 19 and May 14, around 800,000 passengers took buses from three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi to go to other states. These buses were arranged by the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand specially for migrant workers in addition to the daily buses plying from the terminals.Delhi endured a punishing fourth wave of Covid-19 infections between April and May that left health infrastructure overrun, overwhelmed medical workers, and led to crematoriums running out of space.Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, while over 13,000 died of the infection in April and May alone. Cases in the city begin to peter out towards the middle of May on the back of a lockdown, which the state government imposed from April 19 onwards.Interestingly, the report added that, unlike the first wave, many states did not see an exodus. It said the ministry held at least eight meetings with state governments with prominent migrant worker populations in April and May to ensure that “food security, health safety and transport facilities were provided to the workers”.“It was observed that the initial apprehension of large exodus of migrant workers in the wake of the series of lockdowns announced by the state government was gradually dispelled. No extraordinary exodus was seen… due to non-disruption of industries, building and construction works and public transport… the movement this time was mainly due to harvest, marriage and holiday season,” the report said.Railway officials in Mumbai said nearly 600,000 people left Maharashtra in the month of April, during the peak of the state’s second wave and the statewide lockdown. Nearly 300,000 of them left from Mumbai, according to data provided by Central and Western Railway.In April, the two zonal railways operated 370 special trains to accommodate the increase in passenger numbers.To be sure, railway officials said that all passengers were not necessarily migrant workers, and that the increased demand is normal for the summer months. “A majority of the passengers had booked their travel before the lockdown was implemented in Maharashtra,” a railway spokesperson said. “There were hardly any unreserved passengers as they had booked well in advance.” Maharashtra imposed a “mini lockdown” on April 13, and upgraded the restrictions further on April 22.A majority of the special trains that operated in April from Mumbai and Pune were headed for north and north east India, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Odisha and West Bengal.Talking about the steps taken by the government to aid the labourers, the report said that as a part of relief measures, ₹ 1,034 crore has been disbursed by states to five million building and construction workers in the second wave of the pandemic as compared to ₹5,618 crore transferred to 18.3 million workers during the first wave.In addition to this, 20 control centres across the country were reactivated by the ministry to manage distress calls from migrant labourers, the report said. From April 21 to June 23, 1,311 complaints were received by the ministry, of which 861 pertained to the states and 450 to the centre. The calls were primarily about termination, medical assistance, travel assistance and ration. Of these, 830 grievances have already been resolved and 49 others are in the process of being addressed, the report added.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court cited the tribulations of migrant workers during the pandemic and said “the apathy and lackadaisical attitude by the ministry of labour and employment is unpardonable”. It asked the Union government to make the national portal for registration of unrecognised workers operational by July 31 so that benefits could reach migrant workers. It also ordered all states and Union territories to implement the “One Nation, One Ration card” scheme to help migrant workers avail subsidised food ration anywhere in the country.Anindita Adhikari from the Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN) said that the best possible estimate of the number of migrants who left would come from train data, but added that the numbers are likely to be an underrepresentation. “We all know that with mobility this time, as there were no restrictions of interstate travel, it is likely the figure is an under representation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-1-3-million-migrants-left-city-during-2nd-wave-shows-data-101625173931020.html

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir slams govt over erratic power supply, announces protest today||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday accused chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of practically reneging on the free power facility to farmers by refusing to provide eight-hour uninterrupted supply to them during the peak of the paddy sowing season. Announcing a protest by the party on Friday to demand restoration of power supply, the SAD leader said that after betraying farmers by refusing to implement a complete farm loan waiver, the CM has now effectively made the free power facility a farce in the state. “Instead of the committed eight-hour uninterrupted power, farmers are being given 3-4 hour supply, forcing them to spend thousands of rupees every day on diesel generators to save their paddy crop. All this is being done deliberately as part of a conspiracy to avoid paying subsidy to the power utility for free power given to farmers,” he claimed in a statement. Sukhbir further said that many farmers were being forced to plough their paddy fields and thousands had not completed sowing of paddy due to lack of power. He said the SAD would hold protests outside the offices of PSPCL on Friday to demand restoration of power supply for both the agricultural and domestic sector in the state. The SAD chief also demanded a bonus of ₹50 per quintal to farmers for the extra cost incurred by them in rearing their paddy crop. He condemned the Congress government for severe cuts imposed on the domestic sector, saying these could have been easily averted with well-planned power purchase agreements (PPAs).SAD demands financial relief for paddy growersAkali MLA Bikram Singh Majithia on Thursday demanded that the Congress government should announce an immediate financial package for paddy growers who were being forced to use diesel generators to rear their paddy crop.Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, he asked the government to reduce value added tax (VAT) on diesel by ₹10 per litre, saying the government was earning thousands of crores from the misery of farmers and the common man. He said if the government did not take these corrective measures, the SAD would gherao the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-slams-govt-over-erratic-power-supply-announces-protest-today-101625171621233.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Tarn Taran youth wanted for Red Fort violence gets interim bail||A Delhi court on Thursday granted interim bail to Jugraj Singh, a key accused wanted in the Red Fort violence that took place during the farmers’ tractor parade taken out on January 26 against the Centre’s three agriculture laws. The court has asked the 23-year-old to join the Delhi Police’s investigation. Jugraj, a resident of Wan Tara Singh village along the India-Pakistan border, was absconding since January 26. The Delhi Police had also announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for helping in arrest of Jugraj who is named in two FIRs registered at the Kotwali police station in the national capital.While hearing Jugraj’s anticipatory bail application, special tis hazari court judge Neelofer Abida Perveen passed the order staying his arrest till July 20.While taking part in the tractor parade, he also reached Red Fort along with hundreds of other agitators and climbed on a pole to hoist the Nishan Sahib (Sikh flag).Leaders of the Dal Khalsa, a Sikh radical organisation, are pursuing his case and had filed for his bail a month ago. “Advocate Parmjit Singh is appearing as legal counsel of Jugraj. The court has asked Jugraj to join the investigation on July 8, 11 and 15,” said advocate Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, convener of the Panjaab Lawyers.The court cited pandemic and nature of offences while granting him relief.It fixed July 20 as the next date of hearing in the case.After securing relief from the court, Jugraj along with the Dal Khalsa leaders paid obeisance at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. “Jugraj will join the investigation as per court orders,” said Dal Khalsa spokesman Kanwarpal Singh.Jugraj said, “I don’t have a link with any organisation. I went to Delhi to participate in the tractor parade on the call of farmer unions and reached Red Fort with other agitators. When I saw a protester making failed attempts to hoist the Nishan Sahib on a pole, I asked him to let me do so. It was not pre-planned.” Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) honorary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami felicitated the youth with a ‘siropa’ (robe of honour).

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Police remove SAD (A) morcha from Bargari, Mann arrested with supporters||Police on Thursday removed a ‘morcha’ from Bargari village in Faridkot district hours after it was started by the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) over the Punjab government’s alleged failure to arrest those responsible for the 2015 sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents. SAD (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann, who started the morcha at 1pm, was arrested along with 40 of his supporters three hours later. A case was registered against Mann and others under section 188 (disobeying orders promulgated by a public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of a dangerous disease) of the Indian Penal Code, section 51 of the Disaster Management Act and section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act at the Bajakhana police station.Later, they were released on bail. Earlier, Mann was stopped by the police in Faridkot city when he started a march to Bargari. Faridkot deputy commissioner Vimal Kumar Setia tried to persuade Mann, appealing him not to start the morcha but he refused. On June 1, marking the sixth anniversary of the sacrilege incident at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village, Mann and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) president Baljit Singh Daduwal had announced to start a morcha from July 1 if the Punjab government failed to arrest those responsible for the sacrilege and police firing incidents. “The state government has failed arrest people responsible for the sacrilege and police firing. This is unfortunate that even after six years, Sikhs are waiting for justice. The sacrilege was done at the behest of the Dera Sacha Sauda chief. The then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his deputy Sukhbir Badal and then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini were also involved,” said Mann. SAD (Amritsar) leader Jaskaran Singh Kahan Singh Wala said the ruling Congress is hand in the glove with the Akali Dal and that is the reason it are trying to save the Badals. The other Sikh outfits, which were part of the 2018 Bargari Morcha, did not participate in Thursday’s protest. The 2018 Bargari Insaaf Morcha had ended after 193 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-remove-sad-a-morcha-from-bargari-mann-arrested-with-supporters-101625171439060.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s GST up 124% year-on-year in first quarter amid second Covid wave||Punjab has posted 124% year-on-year growth in the goods and services tax (GST) revenue in the first quarter of the financial year 2021-22 despite the more devastating second Covid-19 wave. The state government has reported the GST collection, including state goods and services tax (SGST) and integrated goods and services tax (IGST), of ₹3,441.60 crore in the April-June quarter of 2021-22 as compared to ₹1,540 crore during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, according to data compiled by the taxation department. The year-on-year growth has come amid the second wave of coronavirus which was far more dangerous than the first one witnessed last year in terms of the number of infections and fatalities. “Like the first wave, strict lockdown restrictions were imposed to curb the spread of the more infectious variants of the virus, hitting consumer sentiments and demand. But, unlike the first wave, there was no blanket curfew across the state this time and people were also inured to restrictions,” said an industry watcher who runs his own manufacturing unit but refused to be identified. The GST mop-up stood at ₹1,087.67 crore in June 2021, up 25% from ₹870 crore in the corresponding month of the previous year, according to month-wise break-up. In May, the collection was ₹872 crore as compared to ₹514 crore during the same month of financial year 2020-21 when the collection was really sluggish, reporting a jump of 70%. With the second wave waning to a considerable effect, the state government has gradually eased restrictions and commercial activity is expected to look up further in the coming months, according to state officials. The number of active Covid cases had hit the peak of 79,963 on May 12 in the state before starting a descent and dropped to 3,134 on June 30. “Implementation of measures to ease the compliance burden of taxpayers, closer monitoring against bogus billing, rigorous enforcement, advanced data analytics using data from multiple sources and effective tax administration have also contributed to the steady increase in tax revenue, a taxation official said. Windfall from VAT Besides the GST, the value-added tax (VAT) collection has also soared in the April-June quarter, going up by 107% over the previous fiscal, as fuel prices have been on an upward trajectory in the past one year. With every hike, the state’s kitty swells. Against the VAT revenue of ₹993 crore in the first three months of 2020-21, ₹2,052.49 crore have been collected this year so far. Of the total value-added tax, 90% comes from diesel and petrol and the remaining 10% from three other petroleum products, including aviation turbine fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-gst-up-124-year-on-year-in-first-quarter-amid-second-covid-wave-101625170960046.html

Dhindsa urged the Punjab government to take immediate steps to resolve this issue and prevent Punjab from becoming a ‘poisonous desert’ in the future. “People of the Malwa region have been suffering for a long time due to the release of industrial toxic waste into rivers. People of this region have repeatedly approached both central and state governments, government departments and courts in this regard but the situation remained unchanged,” he said in a statement. Dhindsa further demanded that the state government should come up with a better plan to stop the discharge of toxic water released from the industrial areas into the rivers at the earliest. “Acidic water is not only dangerous for the health of people but also badly affects crops and animals,” he asserted, expressing concern over the rising incidence of cancer in the belts of Bathinda, Faridkot, Sri Muktsar Sahib, Fazilka and many other districts due to toxic water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dhindsa-urges-govt-to-stop-release-of-toxic-water-into-sutlej-beas-101625169999080.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||All is not well with Chandigarh’s roads, says new adviser||All is not well with the road network of City Beautiful and it needs major improvements, said UT adviser Dharam Pal after making a round of the city.While city residents have been complaining about the bumpy ride in many parts of the city and demanding improved road conditions for years now, the new UT adviser reached the same conclusion within a week of joining the administration on June 23.Stating that improvement in the city roads will be one of his focus areas, Pal said, “The road carpeting and maintenance work will be taken up on priority after monsoon. It is one of the things directly connected with people and also linked with the city’s image.”Pal has already taken review meetings of the municipal corporation (MC) and UT engineering department, and issued directions for improvement in road conditions.The upkeep and maintenance of the city’s road network is divided between the UT engineering department and MC. Majority of the city’s road network, measuring about 1,400 km, is with MC, while UT takes care of arterial roads like Madhya Marg. Notably, every year 20% roads in the city are to be carpeted on a rotational basis. However, the road work remained halted for a couple of years due to MC’s inability to pay the contractors. After the UT administration dedicated funds for carpeting of roads, MC finally resumed repair work last year. But its pace has been slow even in the current fiscal, with MC trying to complete the pending work of previous years. Road work worth ₹80 crore is to be carried. This includes pending works worth ₹40 crore. In the last couple of years, even the quality of the road repairs under UT’s jurisdiction has come under scanner. The condition of access roads to houses (the V-6 roads) is worse among all types of roads, complain residents. The roads in villages are no better, which MC officials have repeatedly blamed on fund paucity. “In conjunction with improving the roads, the upkeep and maintenance of parks and green areas will also be stepped up,” said Pal.Earlier, the official had directed MC and UT engineering department to ensure cleaning of road gullies and seasonal rivulets before monsoon revives, which is expected by July 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-is-not-well-with-chandigarh-s-roads-says-new-adviser-101625169759032.html

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Amid rumblings, Capt meets Punjab Cong’s urban leaders over lunch||A day after disgruntled former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu called on the Gandhis in Delhi, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh met more than 35 party leaders, mostly Hindus, from urban areas to calm frayed nerves in the party’s state unit. The chief minister met these leaders, including some ex-MLAs and present and former-chairpersons of boards and other government bodies, over lunch at his official residence, spending close to three hours hearing their grievances and suggestions relating to development works in urban areas across the state. The meeting was held amid voices of discontent from leaders from the community that they had been given the cold shoulder in the first four-and-a-half years of the present government. Several of them raised the issue and sought better representation in the Punjab Congress and in the upcoming elections, two people present at the meeting said. These voices assume significance in the backdrop of the revamp of the state unit due anytime now. While Sidhu is keen on becoming the state Congress president ahead of next year’s state assembly polls, Amarinder has publicly opposed this more than once and is in favour of a Hindu or Dalit face as the state unit chief. However, a senior minister said the ongoing rift and the change of state president were not discussed explicitly at the meeting, but several of them raised the issue of delay in development works in their areas and complained of the bureaucracy ignoring the party leaders on genuine matters of public interest and welfare. The chief minister assured them quick action on these matters. Cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, OP Soni, Vijay Inder Singla, Manpreet Singh Badal, Sunder Sham Arora and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Amritsar West MLA Raj Kumar Verka and former Rajya Sabha member Ashwani Kumar were among those who also attended the meeting. Lok Sabha MPs Manish Tewari, Gurjeet Singh Singh Aujla, and Jasbir Singh Dimpa also joined in later. “We had gone to the chief minister’s residence to meet him separately,” one of them said. However, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar was conspicuous by his absence. The state chief was close to the chief minister until recently, but his sharp criticism of the cabinet’s decision — a move that had the chief minister’s blessing — to give government jobs to the sons of Congress MLAs Fatehjung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey on “compassionate grounds” appears to have driven a wedge between the two. Former Batala MLA Ashwani Sekhri, who has been critical of the CM, also attended the meeting. He refused to talk about the meeting and left for Delhi. He was scheduled to join the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) three days ago but opted out at the last minute after the CM and other party leaders talked to him. The meeting touted as luncheon diplomacy by some is also seen as the chief minister’s attempt to dispel the impression of lack of accessibility about which a number of party MLAs and other leaders had complained to the central leadership last month. “This is not a one-off meeting. The chief minister will hold more such interactions with party leaders in the next few days,” one of the MPs said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-rumblings-capt-meets-punjab-cong-s-urban-leaders-over-lunch-101625169518829.html

Thirty-six-year-old Surinderpal Singh, who has cleared the ETT (elementary teacher training)- TET (teacher eligibility test) but continues to remain unemployed, had started a fast unto death on June 22. He has been protesting atop a 260-foot mobile tower, where he has stayed put for the past 103 days. As the fast entered the 10th day on Thursday, the administration issued a release, stating that officials had succeeded in getting the consent of ETT union leaders to end the hunger strike. A meeting between administration officials, including deputy commissioner (DC) Kumar Amit, senior superintendent of police Dr Sandeep Garg, superintendent of police (city) Varun Sharma, Patiala sub-divisional magistrate Charanjit Singh, and representatives of ETT Union, including its president Deepak Kamboj, is said to have taken place on late Wednesday evening. “It was decided to persuade the agitating teacher to end his hunger strike by offering him liquid and food items,” the release stated. DC Kumar Amit said, “School education minister Vijay Inder Singla had also met the union a week ago and it ended on a positive note. I am hopeful the union will convey the message to Surinderpal and request him to climb down the tower and end his fast in the best interests of his health and family.” On the other hand, the ETT-TET union chief Kamboj said, “There was no consensus on ending the protest or bringing down our colleague from the mobile tower. We told authorities that efforts will be made to persuade Surinderpal to come down, but he has refused saying that the government should first issue notification and give written assurance about fulfilment of our demands.” He added that a meeting was also held with Sandeep Sandhu, officer on special duty to the chief minister, in which it is decided that another meeting will be held with senior authorities on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-unemployed-teacher-refuses-to-end-fast-until-govt-gives-written-assurance-of-job-101625169458966.html

The surgery was performed by a team led by Dr Vivek Bhadoo, head of surgery department, Civil Hospital, Panchkula.Dr Bhadoo said that the condition is called trichobezoar, which means mass of undigested hair within the gastrointestinal tract. He added that the girl’s parents visited him a week ago after the child complained of swelling and pain in the stomach and loss of appetite. “As per her family, she had been eating hair for the last two and a half years. They tried to stop her and even cut her hair as well, but then she started eating the hair of other people,” the doctor said.“This condition is mainly associated with people suffering from psychiatric disorder or those dealing with severe stress. However, it is very rare among children. I have been working here for 20 years and this seems to be the first such case among children in the entire tricity. Worldwide, its prevalence is 0.3%,” Dr Bhadoo added.He added: “Hair does not dissolve, so it remains in the digestive system and if one keeps on eating it, then it becomes a ball or mass, which keeps on increasing. Her stomach got full with the hair mass, hence she stopped eating anything, leading to malnourishment, swelling and stomach ache.”The doctor said that the parents have been advised to keep a close watch on the child, cut her hair for a few years. The child is still under observation.Dr Rajesh Gupta, head of surgical gastroenterology, PGIMER, “It is very uncommon among children. Such cases are rare and are seen among adults, that too with psychiatric disorders, wherein they pull their hair and swallow it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/15kg-hair-mass-removed-from-5-year-old-chandigarh-girl-s-stomach-101625169219917.html

Upliftment of the poor and neglected sections, good governance through public participation, quick redressal of grievances, women empowerment, transparent and sensitive administration with equitable and balanced development have been the priority of the HP government. The resolution also highlighted various schemes launched by the current regime which it said were driven by the spirit of ‘Antyodaya’.The party described the Atal Tunnel as an invaluable gift by the Centre to HP. The state working committee said before Covid outbreak, there were around 1,000 oxygenated beds in Himachal, which have been increased up to 4,800. Similarly, against one, the state now has seven oxygen plants while approval has been granted for 13 more units.The party alleges that opposition leaders misled the people of the country by opposing the corona vaccine. “They committed a heinous act of demoralising the scientists of the country, for which the people of the country will never forgive them,” it said.The working committee also highlighted the work done by the party workers to provide relief to the people during the pandemic. It also accused the Himachal Congress of playing petty politics during the pandemic.Gear up for polls, workers toldThe party also exhorted the party workers to gear up for the upcoming byelections and 2022 assembly polls. The BJP aims to achieve its goal of making every citizen of Himachal healthy, educated and self-reliant, it said.The working committee that met here on Wednesday evening called upon the workers to take these achievements of the present government to the people and play an active role in ensuring their candidates’ victory in the upcoming Fatehpur and Jubbal Kotkhai Vidhan Sabha and Mandi Lok Sabha byelections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-pats-jai-ram-govt-s-back-for-splendid-achievements-101625169218832.html
02-07-2021||Other||SAD changing tack, to appoint panels on all polling booths in 2022||Chandigarh To boost its electoral prospects in next year’s assembly polls in Punjab, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), for the first time, has set up committees on all 22,615 polling booths in the state. Each member of the booth-level committee has been given charge of a set of 8-10 houses falling in their jurisdiction. The party’s top decision-making body, the Core Committee, had decided on this course correction a few months ago. There were nearly 2 crore voters in Punjab, according to the updated electoral rolls prepared for 2019 general elections. The SAD’s move is a step ahead of the system of ‘Panna Pramukh’ (electoral roll in-charge) that the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), its former ally, participated. The SAD had registered a below-par performance in 2017 assembly polls, winning only 15 seats in the House of 117. With this new system, it hopes for more party workers contributing to its day-to-day functioning. Over the past two-three months, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has met halqa in-charges to ensure that the relevant system gets in place. Every booth will have 6-15 workers, with their contact details recorded at the party office. The party has entered into a new pre-poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), with the farm stir proving to be a breaking-point with the BJP. “We have completed the formation of booth level committees in almost all 117 constituencies. The process for allotting houses and the voters in these houses to booth workers has also started,” said a senior party leader, adding they aimed at keeping track of every single voter. “In the previous system, party leaders and workers were in-charge of booths. They were, however, not made accountable for every house and voters registered at a particular booth,” said party’s general secretary and Adampur MLA Pawan Tinu, adding, “There is clarity now on each and every single booth, party workers and the set of voters he has to target.”AGE-OLD CIRCLE SYSTEM TWEAKED The SAD has changed its time-tested system of demarcating circles based on the jurisdiction of police stations in the state. “With this criteria, there was no uniformity in geographical area or the number of voters. We have fixed rhe number of voters to 25,000 in a circle,” said party spokesperson Charanjeet Singh Brar, who is also political secretary to Sukhbir. There are 382 police stations in the state and previously there were these many circle in-charges. “As per the new system, there are at least 800 circles and same number of workers has been adjusted as heads of these circles. MLAs or halqa in-charges, who previously were supported by 2-3 circle heads, will now have a team of at least eight persons to assist them,” Brar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sad-changing-tack-to-appoint-panels-on-all-polling-booths-in-2022-101625169160399.html

Lone, who recently attended the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s all-party meeting, said that election boycott has not yielded any result. “There is a need to understand that boycotting elections has yielded no results. We should look at the other side as well as keeping away the opponents could be a trap. We have boycotted elections for 15-20 years... what if it is a trap to scare away all the good people and bring in their proxies?,” Lone asked during a press conference.“I will not say that I will boycott the elections and the party will contest. We are all equal. If something is haram for me, it is haram for them too,” he said, hinting towards Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti who recently said that they won’t contest polls till statehood and Article 370 is restored. On PM’s all-party meet, Lone said, “Given this engagement is an ongoing process and the propriety demands that we don’t totally divulge in detail of what we said. But all we can say is that we welcome the meeting. It was held after more than two years of upheaval. The leadership demands we look towards a bright future rather than something in the recent past which we don’t agree with. We hope it starts a phase of reconciliation between Delhi and Srinagar.” “I, as a Kashmiri and not as a political leader, felt proud that all leaders spoke for the people of Kashmir and reflected their pain in a befitting manner in the meeting,” he added. Lone said that as of now, there are no winners and losers. “It is a long process. And we have to make an enabling environment for facilitating delivery. And that cannot be done by rhetoric. Let us not by our rhetoric create hurdles. And if delivery becomes difficult, there is only one loser which are the people of Kashmir. We must understand that by through rousing and rhetorical statements maybe we are able to address our constituents, but then that may make delivery difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/election-boycott-has-not-yielded-any-result-sajjad-lone-101625169159406.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Political parties in a quandary over meeting delimitation panel||With the delimitation commission set to visit J&K next week, political parties have begun consultations whether to meet them or not, though they haven’t got any invitation from the commission yet.The commission will be visiting J&K from July 6 to July 9 and meeting members of all prominent political parties which had representation in J&K, either in parliament, DDC and BDC, besides top government functionaries. Earlier, three MPs of the National Conference – Farooq Abdullah, Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi – had refused to attend the delimitation meeting. However, the NC seems to have changed its mind after it authorised party president Farooq Abdullah to take the call whether to participate in future meetings or not. NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar said the party will decide as and when invitation for the participation in the delimitation meeting will be received. “So far, there isn’t any invitation,” he said. The Peoples Democratic Party also expressed similar opinion about its participation in the meeting. “When such an invitation comes, the party will discuss and then take a call. Rest, our stand on the issue of delimitation is known as has been put on record many times,” PDP chief spokesperson Suhail Bukhari said.The Congress that had discussed the issue of delimitation in the all-party meeting is also contemplating to participate only if they get an invite. “It was the Congress which raised the issue of delimitation in the all-party meeting. Once PM and home minister assured that process will be on merit, the party agreed to its time-bound implementation,” J&K Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said. People’s Conference chairperson Sajjad Lone said they wanted statehood of J&K back, but won’t make it a condition for participation in the polls, which could be a hint that the party will have no objection to the process.Party spokesperson Adnan Ashraf said the leadership will discuss the issue once they get an invite. Recently, Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari had said that they have been conveyed that commission will be meeting all parties that have representation in different forums. “Our party will definitely participate in the meetings,” he added. The decision on the visit to J&K was taken during a recent meeting of the delimitation commission chaired by its chairperson Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai (retd) and chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra. This visit is being undertaken shortly after leaders of J&K mainstream political parties attended an all-party meet that was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BJP has already made it clear that leaders of the parties from the region will be meeting the commission and highlighting their issues, party’s state spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-parties-in-a-quandary-over-meeting-delimitation-panel-101625169158221.html

Speaking about the spiking day temperature, Shivinder Singh, scientist at IMD, Chandigarh, said, “The north-westerly winds coming from Pakistan have warmed up the region and absence of cloud cover is exacerbating the heat.”IMD recommends that during a heatwave, people must avoid exposure to heat, wear light-weight and light-coloured clothes, and cover the head with a cloth, hat or umbrella. It is also recommended to drink sufficient water even if not thirsty.Some rain relief is on the cards on Friday and Saturday. But it may not affect the temperature much and will allow the sweltering weather to continue, said Singh. “Easterly winds are needed to strengthen the currently subdued monsoon system, but are unlikely to blow in the region for at least a week. But western disturbances and moisture from the monsoon system are likely to bring light to moderate rain up to 30mm from Friday onwards,” he added.Meanwhile, the minimum temperature decreased slightly from 28.8°C on Wednesday to 28.4°C, but was still four notches above normal. The maximum temperature is expected to remain between 39°C and 40°C over the next three days, while the minimum temperature will hover around 28°C.Power pangs continuePower outages also continued in Chandigarh and Mohali for the second consecutive day, worsening residents’ troubles in the scorching weather.Chairman of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) Hitesh Puri said, “We had spoken to the UT electricity department officials on Wednesday but the power cuts persisted on Thursday. We will meet UT chief engineer CB Ojha on Thursday as anticipatory measures must be adopted by the electricity department for when the power demand rises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-40-8-c-chandigarh-records-hottest-july-day-in-nine-years-101625169100678.html

On Sunday, two drones had attacked the IAF station in Jammu that left two personnel injured. Thereafter, for four consecutive days, drones were sighted over military stations in Kaluchak, Ratnuchak, Kunjwani and Sunjuwan that kept security forces at tenterhooks. “Investigation is in full swing. Police, NIA and NSG are working in close coordination to work out the case,” he told mediapersons. Though superintendent-rank NIA officers have been probing the case since Sunday, senior officers from Delhi to the rank of IG and DIG reached Jammu on Thursday. Director general of National Security Guard (NSG) MA Ganapathy, along with CISF DG Sudhir Kumar Saxena, on Wednesday visited the technical area of IAF station to take stock of the ongoing investigations. DG NIA is also expected to visit shortly. Contractors asked to vacate stationMeanwhile, it has been reliably learnt that the IAF authorities on Thursday asked contractors engaged inside the station for various construction works to vacate the tenement raised for housing the labourers. “They were asked to come daily in the morning for work and leave in the evening. The decision has been taken in view of the drone attacks and to further strengthen the security grid of the IAF station,” said official sources. Jammu administration has also started verification of photographers and videographers having drones with them. “On Wednesday, administration asked us to furnish a list of members registered with Jammu Photographers’ Association having drones. On DGCA website, we get ourselves registered before we are granted permission to operate drones in weddings and other functions. There are seven steps to get registered with the DGCA. They seek details like Aadhaar cards, drone type, its picture and technical specifications. We have submitted all these details. The drones operated by us cannot ferry payloads and moreover, we can’t fly them in no-flying zones. There are 39 members registered with the association,” said Kapil Kumar, president of the body. NIA court rejects bail in narco-terror case NIA special judge Suneet Gupta on Thursday rejected the bail application of one Mudasir Ahmad Dar in a narco-terror case. According to the NIA, there is a nexus between drug traffickers, organised criminal networks and terrorists who have created a force powerful enough to cause instability in the country. It has been submitted that the money generated through drug trade has been used to fund various insurgent and terrorist movements. In this case, Handwara police had last year recovered a large amount of cash and six packets of heroin-like substance from a naka on Kairo bridge in Langate from a Hyundai Creta without registration number which was being driven by one Abdul Momin Peer. A case was registered under sections 6(5) and 8 of the NIA Act and investigations were launched. Accordingly, NIA re-registered the case on June 23 last year at its police station in Jammu. During the course of initial investigation, at least six accused, including Abdul Momin Peer, were arrested by NIA and a recovery of ₹1.35 crore and 21kg of heroin-like substance was made. The judge, after hearing counsels from both the sides, observed that accused was well-connected with the commission of offence of smuggling of the narcotics drugs and for creating a terror fund for terrorists’ activities. “Therefore, prima facie the offences under section 18/19/39 UA(P) Act are made out against the accused. Once the accused is prima facie found to be guilty for the offences falling under UA(P) Act , he is not entitled for bail as per the provision,” the judge said before rejecting the bail application of accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/iaf-station-attack-nia-nsg-police-working-in-close-coordination-says-j-k-dgp-101625169040100.html
02-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC rules against jail inmates’ solitary confinement for long hours||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled against long hours of solitary confinement imposed upon some gangsters by Punjab Police in Bathinda jail. Dealing with a bunch of petitions filed by gangsters lodged in the above-mentioned jail, the high court bench of justice Sudhir Mittal termed it “quasi-solitary confinement” and held that it is illegal and violative of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, which deals with right to life and personal liberty. “The action of confinement of individual prisoners in individual cells for the most part of the day and for limitless periods is impermissible and has been held so (illegal). However, the result of such a direction would be the immediate release of notorious/hardened/dangerous criminals into ordinary prison life which may be a recipe for disaster,” the court said adding that the threat held out by the actions of such desperate persons is also real and cannot be ignored and said that the prison administration can come up with suggestions which would make the custody conform to the law of the land while meeting the security concerns. “For example, the identified prisoners could be housed in separate barracks instead of cells. Members of rival gangs could be confined in different barracks and the system of staggered lockouts could be retained. Confinement to cells be restricted from sunset to sunrise and period of lockouts be increased, however, within the confines of high security zones,” the court said leaving it to the prison administration to impose restrictions. The petitioners had claimed that they fear for their lives and further alleged that various amenities available to ordinary prisoners are not being provided to them and they are being confined in a cell for 22 hours in a day. The high court observed that on one hand, lies the danger of continuing crime and jail violence and on the other hand, lies the demand for human rights and constitutional rights. “They may not enjoy all rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of India, yet, basic rights and liberties are available to them which are the rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Court process restricts the liberty of prisoners but the same courts also have the duty to monitor that the liberty is not restricted beyond the bounds of the law,” it added further adding that restrictions imposed would be open to judicial scrutiny. The court held that the state has a right to classify the prisoners in different categories and deny some facilities accordingly, keeping in view the safety and security aspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-rules-against-jail-inmates-solitary-confinement-for-long-hours-101625169038826.html

In a communication to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), the agriculture department has reiterated its demand for 8-hour uninterrupted power supply for agriculture feeders. To date, paddy has been sown on 17 lakh hectare and at least 45% (13 lakh hectare) of total 30.2 lakh hectare is to be sown. The demand for power is expected to rise further when basmati sowing begins from second week of July. Officials in the department said farmers are already in a fix over erratic power supply. “Paddy sowing, including premium variety basmati, will continue till July-end. The crop needs irrigation, which continues till September, so during the entire season agriculture feeder needs 8-hour supply,” said agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu. “Every year, ahead of paddy sowing season the state government issues a notification asking the PSPCL to give uninterrupted 8-hour supply,” added Sidhu. BLEAK MONSOON PREDICTION ADD TO WORRYThe meteorological department has predicted a bleak monsoon for the state. Department director Surendra Paul said no rain was predicted before July 10. There may be scattered cases of thunderstorms in some parts of the state, but rain was likely in the second week of July. The communiqué added that with the monsoon a few days away, farmers’ dependence is largely on ground water which is extracted with the help of tubewells using electricity. There are 14 lakh agriculture tubewells in the state, and at least 73% of the state agriculture is dependent on groundwater. The southwest of the state that is Abohar, Muktsar, Faridkot and Ferozpur districts are dependent on the canal water for irrigation. Sirhind feeder, Ferozpur feeder and Bathinda branch supplies water for irrigation.DIESEL WORTH RS 1,800 NEEDED FOR PUDDLING AN ACRE Agriculture department officials said that in the absence of regular power supply, farmers are depending on diesel operated motors to run tubewells for irrigation. “A 25 horsepower motor (the most common in the state) installed on tubewells to extract water consumes six litres diesel to run for one hour and one acre requires tubewell to operate for at least three hours. Total diesel consumption is 18 litres for puddling in one acre,” said an officer of agriculture department, adding that going by cost of diesel, farmers who are not getting regular power supply had to spend ₹1,800 on diesel for sowing one acre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/45-paddy-still-to-be-sown-erratic-power-supply-hurting-farmers-101625168858924.html

With Thursday’s order, Large Scale (LS) industry had to shut operations immediately.Industrialists said such a major announcement was made, with only three hours being given for its implementation. “Even Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) were caught unawares till 2pm,” claimed an industrialist. Industry representatives added that thousands of units will be affected with the decision and losses would run into crores, as both production schedules and payment cycles will go for a toss. They have also called for a roll back of the decision. President of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) Gurmeet Kular said that the industry will be forced to hand over keys of their units to Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, as the industry is already struggling to make ends meet. President of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Associations Badish Jindal, said, “Around 80% of power supplied to the industrial sector is consumed by large scale industry with power connection of over 100 KW. In all, 8,887 units in the state will be hit by the government’s decision.” He added, “The government has allowed small and medium load industries to operate, but they will not be able to function as they do labour jobs or supply parts to large industries, which cannot work with these restrictions.”Industrialists claimed that separate circulars issued for imposing two-day weekly off for LS consumers falling under Category 2 and 3 and Category 1 created confusion. The 48-hour weekly for Category 2 and 3 started from 2pm on Thursday; it starts for Category 1 consumers from 8am on Friday. United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association president DS Chawla said, “The first circular said that the weekly-off started from 4pm; soon, another circular was issued, starting the weekly-off from 2pm only, just three hours after the announcement was made. This will lead to disputes as the PSPCL will charge hefty penalties for violation of the order. No penalties should not be imposed for the period.” Industrialists rued that the LS industry has been only allowed to use restricted load of around 50KW only. President, Furnace Alliance, Mahesh Gupta, said, “It is double whammy for the industry as the government has increased the power tariff, but it is still not able to provide uninterrupted power supply to the industry.”The Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) also condemned the imposition of restrictions, adding that operations will be hit for four days, Thursday to Sunday, in one way or the other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/roll-back-two-weekly-offs-or-we-will-hand-over-keys-to-cm-industry-101625168618943.html

In its previous auction of leasehold properties in 2019, not a single one could be sold. The highest bid for a residential property was one HIG flat in Sector 39 for ₹1.06 crore, while the highest bid for a commercial unit in Manimajra was ₹81.51 lakh.The last date for submission of e-bids was June 30 and 16 e-bids were received for commercial units and six for dwelling units.The total reserve price of the two dwelling units was Rs. 1.70 crores while the total highest bids received against them is Rs. 1.75 crores. For the 12 commercial units, the total reserve price was Rs. 5.65 crore and the total highest bids received against them is Rs. 6.55 crores. CHB received around 13% above the reserve price of these units.“That there was total secrecy about number of bids and the bid amount so the CHB could get better competitive prices. For many of the dwelling units, though a single bid was received, it was considerably higher than the reserve price. Hence, e-tender resulted in better revenue,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB.Since the financial bids were opened on Thursday, the highest bidder is required to make the payment within five working days, that is, by July 8 to avoid forfeiture of EMD and blacklisting from future tendering processes of CHB.A different e-tender for 55 residential freehold units is going on and the last date for submission of e-bid is by 6pm on July 5.

MC officials on Wednesday assured of a clarification from the contractor. The workers were seen struggling to clean the sewer with bamboo sticks and one of them even got a foot injury due to a broken glass. A worker said, “Sometimes we have to clean deep drains despite the foul smell. We have to earn a living, what else we can do?” As per sources, the contract is awarded for three months before the monsoon every year to clean Ghel Road drain, INCO drain, Police Line drain and this drain behind Pooja Sarees Complex. Workers have to get down into these drains to clean them. Chaman Lal, district president of the Nagar Palika Karamchari Sangh, said, “The union doesn’t mandate sanitation workers on-roll with the corporation to engage in manual scavenging. We got to know that these were workers hired by a contractor, who made them work without any gloves, gumshoes or other safety equipment.” This open drain passing through Jaggi Colony, Vita Enclave, Transport Nagar and beyond to the highway, and residents, have time and again complained of foul smell throughout the year. Chief sanitary inspector Madan Lal, who assured of sharing details about the contractor, couldn’t be contacted later. Municipal commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata said that the tender was allotted before he joined in the second week of this month. “These are stormwater drains, but as they pass through residential areas, sewage waste gets added. I will ensure that safety gear is worn by the employees and will get an explanation from the agency concerned for this lapse,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-fails-to-stop-manual-scavenging-101625168378742.html

Leading the protesters, Amarjeet Arya of Shivpuri Colony, a home appliances repair worker, claimed that instead of providing relief, the board had created problems for them.“Due to shortage of staff, if there is a fuse failure, one has to wait for at least four hours for the repair. Functioning of the local complainant centre should be improved,” he said. A 60-year-old homemaker, Santosh, said that it was almost impossible for them to cook food without electricity and they had to spend sleepless nights without even a fan.As reported earlier, uneven power cuts have largely affected students studying online and employees working from home.Farmers in rural belt also sufferingDue to late monsoon and low voltage, farmers in the rural belt are facing difficulties during the ongoing paddy season. One Dimple of Bhanokheri said that farmers like him were worried that if there would be no water supply, planting of paddy would be difficult. “Even if it rains later or water is made available through other sources, it will be useless for the crop,” he said.On being asked about the shortage of staff at the complaint centre, Sukhbir, the executive engineer, said that instead of two existing employees for six public lines, there will be four more to speak to the complainants.Superintendent engineer (SE) Vinay Burnwal said, “Due to rising temperatures and increasing load, undoubtedly there are power cuts or voltage issues. Consumers are also not disclosing their actual load. To meet the expected demand, we’ve already added or transferred loads of at least 100 transformers in the district. The situation is expected to improve in a week.”DC Vikram said that he had instructed the SE to increase the manpower wherever required and split the load of feeders with highest consumers or fluctuations.“The employees of the department are unsung heroes who worked tirelessly even during the pandemic.

The police action comes a day after Sukhbir and his supporters conducted a ‘raid’ at the mining site, claiming that it was illegal. M/s Friends and Company, which has the contract for sand mining, along the Beas River is the complainant. In its complaint to Amritsar (rural) SSP Gulneet Singh Khurana on Wednesday, it had alleged that Sukhbir, along with Valtoha and Ajnala, and other SAD members had threatened their employees and staff, besides obstructing and interfering in its legal mining operations at its de-silting site in Wazir Bhullar village of Baba Bakala sub-division. “They terrorised our staff and obstructed our operations by misleading locals. They tried to benefit by maligning the image of the company,” the complaint says, adding, “It is necessary to investigate the act and conduct of Sukhbir, Bony and Valtoha, and the other party members to verify at whose behest they had stopped a legal mining operation.”SSP Khurana said a case had been registered under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act,1897. SAD spokesperson Valtoha said, “It is shameful that the government has acted under the pressure of a mining mafia. It wants to suppress voices against illegal mining.” He added, “We challenge the government to prove that it was legal mining; we are ready to prove that it was illegal. Rules are being floated recklessly with police and mining mafia in collusion. They did not even have permission from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to de-silt the river. We will approach the NGT with facts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sukhbir-valtoha-booked-for-criminal-intimidation-spreading-covid-19-infection-101625167778701.html

In some circumstances, there may also be a risk of developing lung, heart and kidney disease. Due to rusting of metal inside the body, ‘nickel’ also starts coming out along with various elements. Its dissolving capacity can be as high as 20 milligrams per kilogram, which is very dangerous. Keeping all these things in mind, it became necessary to invent a cheap and effective metal in which nickel is negligible and it does not have any side effects in the body, said Dr Girija Shankar Mahobia, associate professor, metallurgical engineering.

The PIL moved by senior journalist Nikhil Wagle has termed the new IT Rules as arbitrary, illegal and contrary to the fundamental rights under Articles 14 (equality before law), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution of India and ultra vires the IT Act. The PIL is expected to come up for hearing in due course. The PIL filed through advocate Abhay Nevagi has stated that the new rules grant excessive powers to the enforcing agencies and put intermediaries under an obligation to provide details of all originators of messages across social media and networking platforms, which is against the fundamental right of privacy of users. The petition has also stated that the rules contradict the principle of net network neutrality which is an accepted principle by all nations, including India. Another contention in the petition is that the rules are contrary to the IT Act as the rules authorise authorities to take action against the intermediary or service provider for not disclosing the name of the originator in cases of defamation or hurting religious sentiments by booking the intermediary under any of the stringent laws which are in force at the time. The petition stated that such powers vested with the enforcing agency are excessively arbitrary and give them powers which are over and above what has been provided by the IT Act. “It gives the compliance officers quasi-judicial powers of deciding what is or is not defamatory,” the petition stated. In light of these contentions, the petition has sought a declaration that the Information Technology Rules, 2021 is illegal, arbitrary and violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution and that the rules are ultra vires the provisions of the IT Act, 2000. The petition has also sought a stay on the effect, operation and enforcement of the rules till the matter is decided by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pil-in-bombay-hc-challenges-new-it-rules-for-intermediaries-101625166097967.html

The demand for probe is also seen as an attempt by Patole to target energy minister and his party colleague Nitin Raut. Patole in his June 27 letter to CM had stated that the MSMC has allotted a tender to a private company for washing of coal extracted from mines in Vidarbha. He said that the company has no past experience, net worth or clearance required for such work. The letter has stated that a firm with which the company has the joint venture has been blacklisted by the National Company Law Tribunal.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has supported the demand, but has claimed that Patole is eyeing the energy department.The letter by Patole, also addressed to state mining minister Subhash Desai, is considered to have come up out of the internal rivalry between two Congress leaders. According to Congress insiders, Patole is keen on a ministerial berth and has requested the party high command to appoint Raut as Assembly Speaker. He believes that he would get the energy portfolio, in case Raut is made the Speaker. Though MSMC is not related to the energy department, the coal washeries are directly related to the power generation. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “It is apparent that Patole is eying the portfolio that Raut currently heads. We also are of the opinion that there should be probe into corruption and we will support it if the issue is raised by Patole at appropriate forums.”Patole has, however, rubbished the claims and said that the complaint is against an allotment by the mining department. “It has nothing to do with the energy department or Raut. There are no differences between us and there’s no question of me eyeing the portfolio. The letter is for the probe of irregularities in the mining department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-tender-by-mining-corporation-patole-tells-maharashtra-cm-101625166038015.html

At the NGO’s Elephant Conservation & Care Centre in Mathura, all resident pachyderms have access to their very own jumbo swimming pools as well as water sprinklers that create cool zones inside their free-ranging enclosures. The older elephants prefer spending hours simply relaxing in the cool refreshing water while some of the younger ones like Peanut, Coconut, Laxmi and Chanchal happily splashed water and played with rubber tyres placed inside the pools which are 400-square-feet long and 6-feet-deep. Dr Ilayaraja, deputy director of veterinary services at Wildlife SOS said, “Apart from the jumbo pools, the elephants have been placed on a summer diet consisting of seasonal fruits like watermelons, musk melons and cucumbers which helps keep them hydrated. We are also giving glucose water, electrolyte solution and herbal medication to prevent heat strokes and dehydration.” To provide easy access to the elephants, there is an inclined ramp leading into each pool. Wildlife SOS is also home to India’s first jumbo hydrotherapy pool for elephants at the elephant hospital in Mathura. Hydrotherapy is a form of physical therapy that uses the therapeutic benefits of water to perform physical rehabilitation in animals, officials said. Exerting hydrostatic pressure that compresses muscle and joints, hydrotherapy helps in relieving chronic muscle aches as well as rebuild muscle memory with its natural resistance, officials said. The hydrotherapy pool is 11-foot-deep and has 21 high pressure jet sprays that create water pressure that massage the elephants’ feet and body and help in increasing blood circulation. Baiju Raj MV, director, conservation projects, Wildlife SOS said, “We also take these animals to the Yamuna river where they thoroughly enjoy.” Geeta Seshamani, co-founder & secretary Wildlife SOS said, “Our dedicated team of veterinarians and trained elephant care staff work round the clock to cater to the needs of rehabilitated elephants. Wildlife SOS aims to provide these animals a high degree of veterinary care, enrichment and a high quality of life.” The elephants at Wildlife SOS have been rescued from extremely stressful conditions such as performing in circuses, giving tourist rides, begging on the streets and being used in wedding processions etc. They were often made to navigate environments that their body was not built for or were chained for hours on concrete that led to an early on-set of arthritis, officials said. Lack of nutrition and improper foot care also resulted in overgrown toenails and cuticles making them vulnerable to cracking. This made walking or even standing highly painful for these pachyderms. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder & CEO Wildlife SOS said, “Captivity denies elephants the very basic necessities essential to their survival and well-being. It is reassuring to see that our efforts have made a positive difference to their lives and we will continue to help more such elephants in distress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jumbo-care-freed-from-captivity-pachyderms-relax-in-personal-pools-101625165977959.html

Maharashtra is keen to work with its global counterparts and share the critical insights we all have observed through our interventions,” Maharashtra’s environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said in a statement on Thursday. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between Maharashtra and the Under2 Coalition, however, is not legally binding, and does not place any financial obligations on the state. “What we essentially do is facilitate the transfer of knowledge between member states who are committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the lead up to COP26, Maharashtra was keen to showcase its actions at a global level and learn from our members in the several global convenings we organise,” said Rana Pujari, manager, South Asia government relations, Under2 Coalition. The Under2 Coalition has previously supported West Bengal in the revamping of its state climate action plan by allocating money from its Future Fund for a feasibility study on e-ferries in the city of Kolkata, as well as Chhattisgarh, where it organised capacity-building workshops for officials concerned on how to track greenhouse gas emissions and build emissions inventories that comply with international standards. “We do not have any concrete action as such planned in Maharashtra, but may get involved at a later date once their State Climate Action Plan is ready,” Pujari added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-joins-under2-coalition-of-states-to-fight-climate-change-101625165918051.html

02-07-2021||Other||Use of Ganga water for Covid treatment: Allahabad HC notice to Centre, ICMR||The Allahabad high court has issued notices to the central government and director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), on a PIL seeking lab test to ascertain the properties of bacteriophages (a virus that destroys harmful bacteria) found in Ganga water, which as claimed in the PIL, can treat Covid-19. Ernest Hackins, a British bacteriologist in 1896, had found the presence of bacteriophages in Ganga and in studies discovered that its presence does not putrefy or deteriorate the quality of water and rather kills pathogens and bacteria. The bench comprising acting chief justice MN Bhandari and justice Rajendra Kumar passed the above order on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Arun Kumar Gupta, a senior advocate of Allahabad high court on June 30. According to the petitioner, he was studying curative properties of Ganga since long and after the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, he started searching on the internet for the effect of Ganga water on Covid patients. After research, the petitioner prepared a paper titled, ‘Treatment of Covid-19 by Ganga Jal’ and sent the same through e-mail to the President of India on April 26, 2020 and the National Mission for Clean Ganga. The mission forwarded it to the Ayush Ministry and the director general, ICMR, but his paper was not considered due to lack of scientific studies. As the petitioner was an advocate and clinical study had to be done by a recognised medical institute, Gupta approached doctors of Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS, BHU, Varanasi) and Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, professor in department of Neurology, BHU for further scientific research and clinical study on the subject. In the petition, it was stated that a nasal spray was also prepared by a team of BHU doctors for treatment of coronavirus, but permission for its clinical trials was pending before the ethics committee, IMS, BHU for the last 7 months. The case will be listed for hearing on expiry of 6 weeks from the date of the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/use-of-ganga-water-for-covid-treatment-allahabad-hc-notice-to-centre-icmr-101625165857952.html

Two accused stayed on the lookout, while three others on the bike entered Om Sairaj jewellery shop and threatened the owner, Shailendra Pandey, who was alone at the time. The men then shot him point blank and fled the spot after filling gold worth ₹10 lakh in two duffle bags, the police said. Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order), said that after the case was registered, they had prepared 10 teams. Police officers had a CCTV recording of the three accused who were on the bike, based on which they began investigation.“We had nakabandis on all the exit points of the city.

02-07-2021||Other||Ex-Maharashtra min Anil Deshmukh played role in cops’ transfers, postings: Secretary to ED||Former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande has in his statement to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said that the politician had a role in the transfers and postings of police officers, especially those of the Indian Police Service (IPS) rank, during his tenure. Appealing for the further custody of Palande and Deshmukh’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde on this ground, ED in the remand application said on Thursday that it wants to interrogate the duo in the alleged money laundering case linked to the purported bribe racket that the former home minister used to carry out with the help of dismissed cop Sachin Vaze. Following this, a special Prevention of Money Laundering Court (PMLA) court remanded the two accused to ED’s custody till July 6. Palande and Shinde were arrested by the agency on June 26. ED has also stated that Palande has admitted that a meeting was held on March 4 with police officers in which a discussion over imposing Covid-19 restrictions on bars had taken place. Special public prosecutor for ED, Sunil Gonsalves, while seeking the accused’s further custody, submitted before the court that during the meetings on transfer of police officers, an ‘unofficial list’ used to be prepared and the agency needs to question the duo on it. He further submitted that, during the investigation, names of the some ministers and other persons have been revealed, who had played a role in the transfer of police officers, and therefore, a detailed interrogation of the accused is necessary as they either attended those meetings or have knowledge on the same. In the various petitions filed against Deshmukh in the Bombay high court, several allegations were made over his involvement in the cash-for-transfer racket. The Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) is also investigating on it and has filed a case against Deshmukh. On Thursday, Gonsalves submitted that the ‘bribery scam’ is worth ₹100 crore. As the transactions were made in cash, it is therefore necessary to find the money trail as well as whether the said proceeds of crime were used for acquisition of property by way of money laundering, ED said. However, Palande’s lawyer submitted that March 4, a sessions of the Assembly was on, and as the home minister, Deshmukh had to attend and discuss with all the officers concerned to reply to questions in the legislature. Therefore, the said meetings cannot be connected with the alleged allegation of transfer of IPS officers, he said. He further submitted that the prosecution is placing wrong facts before the court as it is the chief minister and not the home minister who has the power to transfer officers of IPS cadre. On the cash transfers, the defence argued that there is no material evidence on the accused’s involvement. The lawyer further submitted that investigation agencies are placing contradictory facts and are trying to implicate the accused on the basis of hearsay. Shinde’s lawyer submitted that none of the arguments placed before the court is true but is a “concocted story”. He submitted that Palande is an additional collector appointed as a personal secretary of the home minister by the government and was only performing the duties assigned by the administration department of the state government. ED informed the court that the two accused are the key personnel, deeply and directly involved, and in-charge of the affairs of Deshmukh and others. During their custodial interrogation, they have failed to provide satisfactory answers regarding utilisation, concealment and trail of proceeds of crime. “They have been giving evasive replies in their statements and are trying to delay the course of investigation. At the same time, [them] delaying the appearance of suspected persons before the investigating officer appears to be with malicious intentions to hamper the investigation,” ED stated. “The accused have played a very crucial role in the offence of money laundering and both are influential persons having connections with highly-placed political persons, and if their further custody is not granted to the applicant, they may tamper the evidences and consequently hamper the PMLA investigation being conducted by the applicant,” ED informed the court while seeking further custody of the accused. ED has issued summons to various suspects/witnesses connected to both the accused to appear before the investigating officer during the duo’s custody. They are expected to join the investigation. ED wishes to confront the two accused with various suspects/witnesses to establish the money trail and unearth the proceeds of crime. The agency said that during the duo’s custody, their homes were searched again and some incriminating documents and electronic gadgets were seized. The central agency is also seeking call records and electronic evidence available with other law enforcing agencies to confront the accused with it. ED has previously claimed to have found that Vaze had collected ₹4.7 crore from various owners in Mumbai for “the smooth functioning of the bars”. Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two brothers in Delhi, who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that the brothers, at behest of Deshmukh’s kin, diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the ex-minister’s family. The defence argued that Shinde has no power in the management of the trust and that the ₹4.7 crore mentioned by ED is actually the amount of an unsecured loan obtained by the trust. The defence claimed that these facts are being suppressed by the investigating agency. ED said that while collecting money from the bar owners, Vaze told them that part of the money was to go to “No 1’, crime branch and the social service branch of Mumbai Police. It has also said that when they recorded the statement of Vaze – currently in Taloja jail in connection with his alleged role in the Antilia explosives and Mansukh Hiran murder cases – he told investigators that Deshmukh had called him to his official residence and instructed him to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishments. ED has also identified 24 private entities that are directly and indirectly controlled by the Deshmukhs and found that huge sums of money had been transferred. “From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers and it can thus be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated. The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered based on a first information report (FIR) by CBI against him on April 21. CBI had started the probe after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh ran an “extortion racket” in the city and had instructed some officers to collect ₹100 crore for him every month from various establishments. Deshmukh had called the allegations false and claimed that Singh levelled the accusations only after being shunted out from Mumbai Police chief’s post for his poor handling of the Antilia explosives scare and Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exmaharashtra-min-anil-deshmukh-played-role-in-cops-transfers-postings-secretary-to-ed-101625165557966.html
02-07-2021||Other||Maharashtra bank fraud: ₹65.75-cr assets linked to Ajit Pawar attached||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday said that it has attached properties worth ₹65.75 crore (as per the purchase price in 2010) belonging to Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sakhar Karkhana (SSK), situated at Chimangaon in Satara district, in connection with the Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank money laundering probe. These assets are said to be leased to a company related to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra. Despite repeated attempts, Pawar did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. The assets have been attached under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and are currently in the name of Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd and leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd. A majority of shares of the sugar mills is held by Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd, linked to Pawar and Sunetra. ED’s money laundering case is based on the August 2019 FIR (first information report) of Mumbai Police’s Economic Offence Wing (EOW), which had registered a cheating, forgery and corruption case after Bombay high court’s (HC) direction. As per the allegations in the FIR, the then officials and directors of MSC Bank had fraudulently sold the cooperative sugar mills at throwaway prices to their relatives/private persons without following the due procedure prescribed under SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest) Act. However, EOW later closed the case claiming it to be a civil matter. Then the complainant in the case filed a petition in HC, alleging that the closure report filed by EOW, giving a clean chit to Pawar – the then finance minister – and 75 directors of district banks was questionable, as it was based on the statement of an accused, Ajit Deshmukh. ED’s investigation revealed that MSC Bank conducted an auction of Jarandeshwar SSK in 2010 at an undervalued price, without following due procedure. Pawar was one of the influential members on the bank’s board of directors at the time. SSK was purchased by Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd (a dummy company) and was leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd, which is now operating Jarandeshwar SSK. “A major part of the funds utilised to purchase the said cooperative [Jarandeshwar SSK] was received from Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd, which received the same from Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd, a company related to Pawar and his wife,” ED stated in a statement. ED agency further said that Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd was used to acquire SSK. The sugar mill was actually controlled and run by Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd. According to ED, the cooperative sugar mill has been used as a vehicle by Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills for obtaining loans to the tune of ₹700 crore from Pune District Central Co-operative Bank and others. Thus, Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd’s assets, being proceeds of crime, have been provisionally attached, ED said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-bank-fraud-65-75-cr-assets-linked-to-ajit-pawar-attached-101625165378736.html
02-07-2021||Other||Madras HC rejects plea seeking ban on online games||Chennai: The Madras High Court on Thursday said that elected governments were the appropriate authority to take a policy decision over concerns raised in a public interest litigation (PIL) on the addiction of children and young adults to online games and declined to entertain the plea.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, however, gave liberty to the petitioner, E Martin Jayakumar, to approach the union government and the state government on the issue within four weeks. The authorities have been asked to indicate the relevant government’s stance on the issue within eight weeks of receipt of the petitioner’s representation.The bench stated that courts would intervene if there is some illegal action or if something is detrimental to the larger public interest but given the present situation of the matter they didn’t want to issue a diktat but that they would leave it to the wisdom of the people’s elected representatives.“...even constitutional courts should be slow in entering into such areas and dealing with such matters on the personal sense of morality of the individual complainant or of the Judge or Judges concerned,” the court said in its orders. “It is only upon the failure of the executive to act and, thereupon, the Court perceiving the matter to be a danger to society, that the Court ought to step in. At least at the initial stage, the duty of the Court is to direct the complainants to the executive for a more wholesome and studied policy decision to be taken by the executive than what may be possible before any Court.”The PIL had sought a ban on all the online and offline video games and to bring appropriate mechanism to track computers, laptops, mobile phones and other devices used for playing games. The petitioner further stated that children are being lured by unscrupulous business enterprises particularly during the lockdown since educational institutions are closed. He perceived the addiction to be devastating and life-threatening in the sense that it destroys the career-building phase of a young adult and may even lead to suicidal tendencies and extreme anger against parents and elders seeking to check the habit. The court noted the submissions and clarified that this order would not prevent any similar complaints in the future if executive action isn’t forthcoming. “There is no doubt that children and young adults these days are addicted to their phones and their worlds appear to revolve around their mobile phones,” the court said. “Oftentimes, a family could be together and sitting at a table but each member using the phone, even if to describe the dish that he may be having or the quality of food at the moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madras-hc-rejects-plea-seeking-ban-on-online-games-101625165378021.html

The reptile was spotted roaming on the street before it was captured by forest officials who released it to the river. A video shot by a local resident of the reptile roaming around, went viral on social media.According to forests officials, the crocodile could have entered the village from Kali river located near the village.Ramu Gouda, Deputy Range Forest Officer (RFO), Dandeli said that Kali river has a large population of crocodiles. “There have been some instances where they have come up from the river into the villages, but it is very rare,” he said.According to the officer, as per the information given by the villagers, the crocodile entered the village around 7.30 am on Thursday. One of the residents, spotted the reptile and raised an alarm. In the video that has been doing rounds, the crocodile was seen walking the narrow lanes of the villages, with residents crowding around it.Residents in the area told the media that they had not seen crocodiles before in the village and no one harmed the reptile.RFO Gouda said that while sighting a crocodile is rare, in the last six months there were two instances. “In the first case it had attacked a goat near the banks and in the second case, it had come up to a forest department check post,” he said.He added that the reason for the crocodile coming to the shores could be several. “It attacks cattle only if it is near the banks. In other cases, they could come for sun bathing since they are cold-blooded,” Gouda added.According to the officer, officials didn’t have to capture the crocodile per se, but only guided it back to the river. “We wanted to ensure that no one harmed it because it would result in retaliation. We were able to reach the location within 45 minutes. In this case, since the river was nearby, we made way for it to go back to the river,” he said.On December 3, 2020, a 10-year-old boy, who was herding cattle at a remote village was killed and eaten by a crocodile in north Karnataka’s Raichur district. The boy identified as Mallikarjun was herding cattle along with six others at D Rampura village near Krishna river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/panic-after-crocodile-found-roaming-in-karnataka-s-kogilabanna-village-101625165137914.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Gulshan Kumar murder: Bombay HC upholds life term for killer||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday upheld the life imprisonment handed down to Abdul Rauf Dawood Merchant, a henchman of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, and also convicted and sentenced his brother Abdul Rashid to life imprisonment for their direct involvement in the August 1997 murder of T-Series music label founder and Hindi film producer Gulshan Kumar Dua. Kumar was brutally killed on August 19, 1997 outside Shiva temple at Jeet Nagar in Andheri East. He visited the temple at 10am, prayed for about 15 minutes and was about to enter his car to return home, when an assailant shot at him in the back. As he was falling down, another assailant came forward and started firing at him. In an attempt to save himself, the deceased got up and walked a few steps, when the third assailant fired several rounds, killing him on the spot. Kumar was immediately rushed to Cooper Hospital where he was declared brought dead and later 18 bullets were retrieved from the body. Nineteen persons, including the father and brother of the Merchant brothers, were arrested in connection with the murder and the prosecution examined 45 witnesses to bring home their guilt. On April 29, 2002, Mumbai sessions court acquitted all accused, but Abdul Rauf and sentenced him to life imprisonment.A division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NR Borkar directed Abdul Rashid to forthwith surrender either before the trial court or before the DN Nagar police station, where the first information report (FIR) was registered in connection with the high-profile murder. He has also been directed to surrender his passport to the police. The HC has directed the trial court to issue a non-bailable warrant and secure Abdul Rashid’s presence for serving the life term, if he fails to turn up within a week.The bench took serious note of Abdul Rauf’s conduct, especially that he was absconding for a considerable period of time before and even after his conviction, and declared that he will not be entitled to any remission. The HC has, however, upheld acquittal of Gulshan Kumar’s business rival, Ramesh Taurani of Tips Industries. Taurani, too, was prosecuted for being part of the conspiracy to kill Kumar, but was acquitted by the trial court. Abdul Rauf was absconding for a long time after the murder and was arrested only in January 2001. In March 2009 he again jumped parole and had fled to Bangladesh, where he was arrested at the behest of Indian authorities and eventually brought back to India in November 2016. Abdul Rauf had challenged his conviction by filing an appeal before HC on several grounds, whereas the state government had challenged acquittal of his brother Abdul Rashid and Taurani. HC on Thursday dismissed Abdul Rauf’s appeal and also convicted Abdul Rashid after noticing that at least five eye witnesses had identified the brothers - as two of the three assailants who shot dead Gulshan Kumar.Two of them – a temple trustee and the driver of the deceased – were accompanying the victim at the time of the incident. The driver also received a gunshot wound on his thigh, when he tried to save his employer. Other two witnesses were local residents, who tried to chase the three assailants. One of them had driven the car when Gulshan Kumar’s driver put him in back seat of the car. The fifth important witness was the taxi driver who was thrown out of his vehicle by Abdul Rauf and his car was taken away by the assailants. “This is not a case of a sole eyewitness. There were five eyewitnesses. Each one had emphasised the role of Accused Nos. 16 (Abdul Rashid) and 19 (Abdul Rauf) at different stages,” said the bench. “The attack mounted upon the deceased was so graphically explained by them, that unless they had seen the incident, they could not have been consistent in the cross-examination also,” said the bench while sealing fate of the Merchant brothers.As regards Taurani, the HC found serious lapses in the police investigation. “In the present case, there are serious lapses in the investigation and there is no cogent and convincing evidence to hold that Respondent No. 1 (Taurani) had spoken to Abu Salem in Dubai,” said the bench. It noted that one witness, Arif Lakdawala, an acquaintance of Abu Salem, had said that he was present when Nadeem and Taurani handed over contract money and was also present when Taurani had contacted Abu Salem, but there was no probe as regards to the Dubai phone number. “There is no investigation to verify as to whether that phone number was used by Abu Salem at that time,” the HC said in this regard. The bench concluded there was no need to interfere with Taurani’s acquittal, especially when an application was made to arraign Lakdawala as an accused in the case, but it was rejected by the trial court and the rejection has attained finality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gulshan-kumar-murder-bombay-hc-upholds-life-term-for-killer-101625165017923.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra speaker poll: MVA ministers plan strategy; BJP quiet on plan||While the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition prepares for the election of Assembly speaker which is likely to be held on July 6, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may take the opportunity to destabilise or weaken the coalition government. MVA leaders are confident about winning the election easily, but it would be a herculean task for the coalition to maintain the support they had garnered while forming the government. The ruling parties have chalked out a strategy to ensure they get the votes they registered during the confidence motion. The Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress have arrived at the consensus to hold the election for the post of speaker on July 6, the second day of the two-day monsoon session. Senior ministers from three parties held meetings over the past two days to decide on the strategy for the poll. NCP chief Sharad Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also discussed the issue in a meeting on Tuesday. Since the poll to the post is likely to be held by secret ballot, the ruling parties and opposition are busy garnering support of independents and smaller allies. During the confidence motion in November 2019, MVA had polled 169 votes in the 288-member lower house. The three ruling parties had garnered the support of 16 independents and MLAs from smaller parties in addition to their own MLAs — 56 from Sena, 54 from NCP (including the protem speaker) and 44 from Congress. The BJP’s collective strength stood at 114, of which 105 were from the party. Currently, tally of BJP MLAs has reached 106 after they won Pandharpur bypolls, while Congress’s tally reduced to 43 after its MLA from Degalapur, Raosaheb Antapurkar, died recently. A Congress minister said the ruling parties have started chalking out strategy for the election. “Of the six independent MLAs who had supported the BJP in 2019, few may change sides to support the government. Geeta Jain from Mira -Bhayander has already joined the Sena after initially supporting the BJP. Few other independent MLAs and smaller parties may come to us. Generally, independent MLAs are inclined towards ruling parties for various reasons, including allocation of funds to their constituencies,” he said.“According to state legislature rules, the election for the post is held by secret ballot. Even the Supreme Court verdict mandate for secret ballot, but it is the up to the presiding officer to decide the form of election,” said an official from state legislature. NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday said the speaker’s post is with the Congress as per the sharing of portfolios and Constitutional posts between the three ruling parties. “The Congress will have to decide on the candidate for the post, to which all ruling parties will take a decision with consensus,” he said.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “Let MVA make their decision on the election. We will disclose our strategy after the election is announced.”BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said his party was not worried about cross-voting and hence demanded the election. “It was our demand that the Governor ask the state government to hold the elections. Had we had any apprehension on cross-voting, we would not have demanded it. On the other hand, the state government has been dilly-dallying on the elections because of fear of losing votes,” he said.According to BJP leaders, the party would not press for the election if it realised that it could not get desired numbers. “Also, we have a tradition of unopposed election to the Constitutional post and we may withdraw the candidate,” he said.Minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, “We are sure about winning the election with more votes than we received last time. The only question will be about the attendance of members, as many of the ruling members have contracted Covid-19.” NCP and Sena were initially not very keen on the election after the Congress appointed the then Assembly speaker Nana Patole as its state unit chief. The two ruling parties claimed they were not taken into confidence by the Congress while removing the speaker as the election to the post could lead to embarrassment to the ruling parties.Political analyst Hemant Desai said though there are major differences within the MVA parties, retaining the number of MLAs would not be a problem. “It would be difficult even for the BJP to keep its number intact, especially when it is in the opposition. The BJP will review its support base before going for the election as it would be embarrassing if its number dwindled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-speaker-poll-mva-ministers-plan-strategy-bjp-quiet-on-plan-101625164537935.html

The deceased — Joaquim Chettiar, 36; his wife Luiza, 35; and their son Jazial — were returning home to Naigaon near Vasai from Pune after an event when the accident took place, said police. “Around 5.10pm, the Chettiars were crossing Borghat area in their car when a trailer driver heading towards Mumbai lost control of his vehicle and hit a truck moving ahead of it. The truck then went ahead and rammed into Chettiar’s car,” said an officer from Khopoli police station. “The car then toppled on the road and caught fire within a few seconds. All three members of the family died on the spot. The trailer driver, Ramesh Nikam, also suffered injuries in the accident and was taken to MGM Hospital in Kamothe. He is under observation there,” he said. The police booked Nikam under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Motor Vehicles Act. “The Pune-Mumbai lane of the expressway saw traffic jam following that accident. We later removed the three vehicles from the road using a crane, and the traffic flow was normal after that,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/three-of-a-family-killed-in-accident-on-mumbai-pune-expressway-101625164358429.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees rise in property registrations in June at 7,857||The real estate sector in Mumbai recorded 7,857 property registrations in June, marking an increase as compared to May when the city recorded 5,360 registrations. However, the number was less compared to other months of the year as property registrations in February stood at 10,712, in March 17,449 and 10,136 in April.In June last year, only 1,839 units were registered.Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm, said it was better compared to June last year. “Despite the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic being severe than the first wave and lockdown duration as well as intensity being similar, there is a a stronger growth in property registrations post easing of lockdown restrictions compared to last year,” said Baijal. He said he was hopeful that things will improve in the coming days.The Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI), an association of builders, said the numbers were less due to twin factors. “During the second wave, people saw deaths among close relatives and near and dear ones, which dissuaded many homebuyers from purchasing properties,” said Deepak Goradia, president of MCHI-CREDAI. “Homebuyers are also facing issues due to the slowdown in economy,” he said, adding, “The Government needs to reintroduce stamp duty waivers to boost sales.”The real estate sector has been facing a slowdown since several years and the Covid-19 pandemic and resultant lockdowns have only made matters worse.The government had, in August last year, announced its decision to reduce stamp duty levied on sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 till December 31, 2020, and then hike it to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The move had played a huge role in boosting sales in both primary and secondary markets. The state, however, refused to extend the provision further despite several requests.Shweta Thakker, chief sales and marketing officer at AhujaHIVE, a real estate firm of Ahuja Constructions, said the real estate sector will witness improvement in the coming months. “Many builders are giving discounts with added incentives such as booking amount refunds, statutory fees waivers, cashback schemes, easy payment structuring and assorted freebies. We are hopeful that the momentum will improve on basis of economic recovery and mass vaccination drive efforts,” said Thakker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-rise-in-property-registrations-in-june-at-7857-101625164357782.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra may not table farm bill for approval in this monsoon session||The Maharashtra government may not table its proposed farm bill in the monsoon session of the state legislature for approval. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday hinted that the state’s proposed bill, intended to safeguard the interest of farmers, may not come up during the upcoming monsoon session. He said it should be brought up after deliberations with all stakeholders and making desired changes to protect farmers’ interest.The statement assumes significance as many farmer outfits in the state have urged the government to bring the bill only after having consultations with them. Meanwhile, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said the state will not go against farmers’ interest.Following stern opposition to the three contentious farm laws passed by the Central government and ongoing protests by the agrarian community against their implementation, Maharashtra has prepared a draft for its own legislation and was supposed to table the same in the monsoon session.However, farmer organisations requested the three-party ruling coalition to have a discussion on the proposed provisions before tabling it before the legislature. On Tuesday, a delegation led by former MP and farmer leader Raju Shetti met the Pawar, Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar and put forth their request for consultations on proposed provisions. They feared that the state’s own version of the farm bill has provisions which may go against their interest, such as allowing farm lands to be leased to private companies. They also demanded to bring a resolution opposing the three controversial farm laws of the Centre.“I am not sure if the farm bill can be brought in the two-day session. It is unlikely to come. It would be better if it is brought with desired changes after holding deliberations with all stakeholders,” Pawar told reporters.The former Union agriculture minister was interacting with media persons after virtually inaugurating DY Patil Agriculture and Technical University, Talsande, at an event held in Mumbai on Thursday. The event was presided over by Dr DY Patil, former governor of Bihar, Tripura and West Bengal.The NCP chief said the state has formed a group of ministers to take a decision on this issue and the group has started a dialogue with all stakeholders over the provisions. Recently, revenue minister Balsaheb Thorat and agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse held a discussion with him on the issue. “They (ministers) were of the view that there are complaints from farmers over certain provisions of the three farm laws, hence before approving the Centre’s legislations in the state, we should keep aside the objectionable provisions and rectify them by holding deliberations with all people concerned,” he said.There is also a view that if the state is making changes in the three farm legislations then there is no need to pass a resolution against the Central farm laws, the veteran leader further said.“Let the Centre do whatever they want to, but the state government will not do anything which is against the interest of the farmers,” CM Thackeray said while addressing an event in the backdrop of Maharashtra Agriculture Day on July 1.“We are of the opinion that if not minimum support price (MSP), farmers in Maharashtra should get special price for their produce,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-may-not-table-farm-bill-for-approval-in-this-monsoon-session-101625164298479.html
02-07-2021||Mumbai||12-year-old from Alibag teaches kids via YouTube||Suhaima Bangara, a 12-year-old Class 7 student from Alibag, is busy with classes. Not as a student, but as a teacher. Bangara loves teaching and used to teach younger children in her society before the pandemic struck. She now teaches them through her YouTube channel, with each video on a chapter from the state board syllabus, and the lectures are free.A student of St Mary’s Convent School in Alibag, Bangara’s family hails from Kasargod in Kerala and settled down in Alibag. Her father Saleem, 43, runs a bakery while her mother Ruksana, 36, is a homemaker. “Teaching is my hobby and I started teaching children before the pandemic. After the pandemic, they stopped coming and I missed teaching. That’s when the thought of a YouTube channel for teaching the children came to my mind and I asked my parents about it. They too were excited,” she said.Bangara and her three siblings started a channel – Cappuccino BroSis – during the lockdown and it was mostly about them, small challenges they would take up and her elder brother Razeen, 16, would edit the videos. From there, she learnt the skills of video editing.“Small children usually get bored of online classes, hence I felt if a student taught them, it might interest them. Even if one child watches my videos and learns from them, I would be very happy,” she said.Her typical day is spending time with her siblings — three-year-old sister Swiyyah, nine-year-old Rehana and Razeen, making videos and studying.“I try to make a video every day and cover one chapter. On Saturdays and Sundays, I don’t make videos. On other days too, I do my studies first and then make the videos,” she said. Her sister Rehana, who studies in Class 4, sometimes helps her with the camera for shooting while she edits and uploads the videos herself. She uses an app to refer to the textbooks and till now, she has covered six chapters of English and three from Maths.Her parents are proud of her. “She is very fond of children and loves teaching them. We also motivate her to make videos. In a way, she is also brushing up her knowledge,” Ruksana said.Even as she aspires to be a paediatric doctor, she believes that she might always try to keep up with her teaching hobby somehow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/12yearold-from-alibag-teaches-kids-via-youtube-101625164238346.html

You might have noticed that closure we live to nature, greater is our ability to fight diseases,” he said after planting a sapling at a function during the day.“In all 75% to 90% of the saplings planted in the past 4 years have survived,” the CM said. The state has planned plantation of 30 crore saplings in Uttar Pradesh.“The Maharishi Valmiki Ramayana mentions about 88 species of trees on way from Ayodhya to Chitrakoot. We have chosen 30 of them keeping in view the climatic conditions in the state and shall be planed as part of the mega-plantation drive in the state particularly in Ayodhya, Prayagraj and Chitrakoot,” said chief conservator of forest, in a press statement.Trees that have been selected include Saal (Shorea Robusta), Mango (Mangifera Indica), Ashok (Saraca Indica), Kalpvriksh (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), Mahua ((Madhuca Indica), Kathhal (Artocarpus heterophyllus), Asan (Terminalia tomentosa).The forest department has identified 35-hectare land in different places particularly to plant sapling of trees from the Ramayan era.“Work is going on to make pits and put up other necessary arrangements,” said the forest official.“Plantation will boost tourism on the way that was taken by Lord Ram after he left Ayodhya,” said the official.Under its mission for planting 30 crore saplings this year, the state will plant 25 crore of them on July 4, and within a week the target of 30 crore will be achieved, said a press statement from the state government.To achieve the target, different departments have been assigned the responsibility and chiefly forest department will plant 10.80crore saplings, rural development department 10.56 crore saplings, agriculture department 2.01 crore, horticulture department 1.33crore, Panchayati Raj 1.20 crore, revenue department 1.20 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-suggests-memorial-gardens-across-up-in-honour-of-covid-martyrs-101625161838514.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||‘Technical glitches’ on Delhi Metro's yellow, blue lines lead to delayed trains||“Technical glitches” delayed Delhi Metro services on the Yellow Line, connecting Huda City Centre and Samaypur Badli, and the Blue Line, running between Dwarka sector-21 and Noida Electronic City, adding on to the long lines outside stations along both stretches.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday said train services were not available on the Yellow Line stretch between Sikanderpur and Huda City Centre from 2.30pm to 3.30pm due to an “intermittent signalling issue”, while the Blue line services were running slow due to cable theft at Dwarka Sector 9.“The rest of the Yellow Line was running normal throughout this period and services were also restored on the affected section from 3.30pm onwards,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC.While metro services remained suspended for an hour on the Yellow line stretch, commuters posted pictures of long queues and crowds swelling outside stations.“We have been waiting to get inside the station for the last 30 minutes. After the reopening, the wait outside stations has anyway increased and now these technical glitches are only adding to commuter woes,” said Pradip Kumar, a commuter at Huda City Centre.Blue line services were affected between Dwarka Sector 9 and Dwarka Sector 21 station. “Due to a cable theft issue at Dwarka sector-9, trains were running slow between Dwarka sector-9 and Dwarka sector-21,” a Metro spokesperson said on Thursday.The cascading effect of the delays was also seen outside stations such as Dwarka, Dwarka Mor, Nawada, Janakpuri (east and west), Uttam Nagar (east and west), Rajouri Garden and Tilak Nagar.Meanwhile, DMRC on Thursday said that after resuming services from June 7, following the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi Metro has been running “almost empty trains” as they are only allowed to carry 10-15% of its passenger capacity.Blaming the restrictions for causing inevitable crowding outside stations, Metro said that the passenger load on the network too has increased since resumption of most economic activities in the city.“DMRC regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers due to these restrictions. While appreciating the patience and cooperation exhibited by the passengers in such scenario, DMRC hopes that the situation will improve once the restrictions are relaxed by authorities,” said Dayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/technical-glitches-on-yellow-and-blue-lines-lead-to-delayed-trains-crowding-101625161178689.html
02-07-2021||Other||2 month excise fee waiver for bars, clubs that were shut during lockdown 2021||The Delhi government has issued an order for a two-month waiver of the excise license fee for bars in restaurants, hotels and clubs which were closed because of the lockdown that was imposed in the city in April in the light of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases that left the health infrastructure overwhelmed.“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a lockdown in the NCT of Delhi and as per orders issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), all the bars in restaurants, hotels and clubs were closed w.e.f (from) April 16 to June 20,” said an order issued by the excise department of the Delhi government on Wednesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe order, a copy of which HT has seen, further said, “Considering the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown on hotels and restaurants in Delhi, the competent authority (excise department), in view of the provisions of Rule 49 of the Delhi Excise Rules, has decided that the lockdown period (i.e 16.04.2021 to 20.06.2021) may be treated as deemed cancellation of licenses and accordingly the license fees paid by the licensees for the first quarter of 2021-22 (April 1 to June 30) may accordingly be adjusted towards license fees of the second quarter (July 1 to September 30).”Last month, the excise department directed the licensees to pay the fee for extension of their licence from July 1 to September 30.“For license holders who have paid full fees for the second quarter, the amount will be adjusted in the subsequent quarter (third),” said a senior official in the excise department.Restaurants, hotels and clubs which have bars have to pay in advance the excise license fees each quarter. The fees, under the current system, has a complicated structure which depends largely on slabs set on the basis of seating capacity. Delhi has around 840 restaurants, hotels and clubs which have licenses for a bar.In its Wednesday’s order, the excise department also extended the last date of payment of the licence fee for the second quarter from June 30 to July 31. The order will benefit licence holders of L-15/L-15 F, L-16/L-16F, L-17/L-17F, L-18/L-18F, L-19/L-19F, L-20/L-20F, L-28/L-28F, L-29/L-29, the order said.The department further directed them to pay the remaining amount of the licence fee of the second quarter (after adjustment) by July 31, failing which they will be charged double the quarterly fee.The move is expected to bring relief to hotels, restaurants and clubs which have faced losses in the light of the lockdown.“It is a welcome move. However, the government should have issued this order at least a few days ago because a large number of licensees have already paid full fees for the third quarter. We understand that the amount will be adjusted but in such times, any amount of locked working capital adversely affects business. We also hope that the government implements more measures aimed at boosting business of restaurants in the coming days,” said Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI).Liquor traders move HCThe Delhi Liquor Traders’ Association on Thursday moved the Delhi high court against the city administration’s move to float tenders to appoint new liquor retailers.Naresh Goyal, the president of the association, said, “Our main objection is that the Delhi government floated tenders to appoint new retailers without releasing the final approved version of the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021. The document has still not been made public. Only the Delhi Excise (Amendment) Rules, 2021, has been made public through a notification which was issued on May 3. But the details of Delhi’s new excise system is only in the policy document which has not been shared with the public or the stakeholders.”Goyal said the court will hear the matter on Friday.HT on Tuesday reported that the Delhi government has floated tenders for new liquor retail licensees, paving the way for a range of sweeping reforms to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia, and improve customer experience. The new policy also reduces the legal drinking age from 25 to 21, although this can be implemented only after it is passed in the Delhi assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/twomonth-excise-fee-waiver-for-bars-and-clubs-that-were-shut-during-this-year-s-lockdown-101625161178145.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||20-year-old man stabbed to death in front of father, brother||A 20-year-old man was stabbed to death by six men in front of his 55-year-old father and brother in Kewal Park area near Azadpur in north-west Delhi late on Wednesday night, the police said on Thursday.The police said the incident took place after Jai Pal Singh’s bike brushed past a truck near Kewal Park, leading to an argument with the driver of the truck. While Singh was talking to the mini-truck driver, six people who live near the crime scene, joined in. Though the truck driver left, the group got into an altercation with Singh over the incident.Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani said it was not a case of road rage. “Neither did the issue concern them, nor did they know the driver of the tempo,” said Rangnani.An investigator said that when the six suspects started slapping and pushing Singh, he called his two sons — Pant Priya Sagar (22), and Dev Priya Sagar (20). The brawl intensified when the two reached the spot, said officers.While three suspects overpowered Singh and Pant, the other three caught Dev and stabbed him at least four times. As Dev collapsed, the attackers fled the spot. “Dev was taken to a nearby private hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The doctors said he was stabbed in his heart. A murder case was registered and investigation was taken up,” said the investigatorSince the attackers lived close to the crime scene, the police soon tracked them down and arrested them on Thursday morning. Two knives used in the crime were recovered, the officer said. Police identified the suspects as Sahil (25), Annu Kumar (21), Devender (18), Satyaveer Sharma (18), Akash Puniya (18), and Anurag (19).Another investigator said the six suspects were celebrating Annu Kumar’s birthday in a nearby park when they got involved in the argument between Singh and the mini-truck driver.Police said Singh, who lives with his family in Burari, was going towards Adarsh Nagar to meet his friends when his bike brushed past the mini-truck.Pant, who works with a private company dealing in used cars, said Dev graduated recently and was unemployed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/20yearold-man-stabbed-to-death-in-front-of-father-brother-101625161060011.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Residents of Delhi have the right to feed stray dogs, high court rules||In a landmark judgment that could end ongoing fights between dog lovers and others in almost every neighbourhood of the Capital, and which could define how community dogs (the correct term for strays) are treated across the country, the Delhi High Court has ruled strongly in favour of humans’ best friends.In a June 24 judgment that was uploaded on its website on Thursday, a single judge bench of Justice JR Midha has addressed many of the contentious issues.One, the judgment says community dogs can be fed, and that animal lovers have the right to feed them, either in their independent driveways or porches, or in designated areas that they will have to work out with the local officials or the resident welfare associations -- with the caveat that these designated areas should be within the territory of the dogs.Two, it says vaccinated and sterilised dogs cannot be removed by the municipal corporation.Three, it places the onus on vaccinating and sterilising the animals on the municipal corporation, the resident welfare association, and local dog groups (almost every neighbourhood has a group of volunteers that feed dogs, vaccinate and sterilise them, usually at their own cost, and look after injured or ill ones). The order adds that sterilisation of such animals is a must to check over-population.Four, it asks the Animal Welfare Board of India to work with resident welfare associations to ensure that these are followed, and other provisions of the prevention of cruelty to animals law complied with.Five, it asks the local police and resident welfare associations to get involved in maintaining peace in the area between dog-lovers and other residents.The judgment comes on a property dispute between Maya D Chablani and Radha Mittal where an application was filed by the plaintiff to restrain the defendant from feeding community dogs near the entrance or exit of the suit property.However, Chablani, represented by advocate Abhishek Gusain, Mittal represented by advocate DK Pandey later resolved the dispute amicably with the help of amicus curiae advocate Pragyan Sharma and advocate Manisha T. Karia, for Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI).“The settlement between the parties on this issue has been recorded in the order dated May 5 according to which, defendant No 1 (Mittal) agreed to feed the stray dogs at point A at fixed times,” the court recorded in its judgment.Raunak Bhakkar, 30-year-old finance manager, said dogs are loyal animals and that they should be kept along in the colonies, and added that proper care should be taken of the canines which also guard our societies.Rima Barua, a communications manager in north Delhi said dogs in her society once chased her while she was returning late night after work. “ I think the authorities should revisit their guidelines so that other individuals do not have to pay the price for the same,” she said.“Community dogs (stray or street dogs) have the right to food, and citizens have the right to feed community dogs, but in exercising this right, care and caution should be taken to ensure it does not impinge upon the rights of others, or cause any harm, hindrance, harassment and nuisance to other individuals or members of society,” the judgment said.Holding that “animals have a right under law to be treated with compassion, respect and dignity”, the court said that community dogs are “territorial beings” having “right to food”.“We have to show compassion towards all living creatures. Animals may be mute but we as a society have to speak on their behalf. No pain or agony should be caused to the animals. Cruelty to animals causes psychological pain to them. Animals breathe like us and have emotions. The animals require food, water, shelter, normal behaviour, medical care, self-determination,” the judgment said.Highlighting the importance of the street dogs, Justice Midha said that they perform the role of community scavengers and also control rodent population in the area, thus preventing spread of diseases like Leptospirosis. Indeed, one of the reasons ascribed to the plague that struck Surat (which hasn’t been scientifically established) is that an aggressive community dog extermination drive could have contributed to the spread of the disease. The court also said that community dogs also play the “role of guards by protecting the community from the entry of outsiders or unknown people”.Atul Goyal, president of United Residents Joint Action (URJA), an apex body of RWAs, said a complete review of the present guidelines is required and a monitoring authority should be appointed to check the implementation of the policy that should be brought in force. It is a civil issue and should be solved amicably at the ground level among the civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-of-delhi-have-the-right-to-feed-stray-dogs-high-court-rules-101625160938670.html

It exceeded the previous high of 6,921MW for this year recorded on Wednesday.Last year, Delhi’s peak power demand was recorded at 6,314 MW on June 29. It was lower than the all-time high of 7,409 MW on July 2, 2019. In 2018, the peak demand was 7,016MW recorded on July 10.“Delhi’s peak power demand recorded last year (6314 MW) was lower because of the nationwide lockdown. Moreover, in June 2020, Delhi’s peak power demand crossed 6,000 MW only on one day that month. This year, however, Delhi’s peak power demand is expected to be in the range of 7,000 MW to 7,400 MW, though the estimates were around 7,900 MW,” said a power department official.The BSES discoms -- BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) -- said they successfully met the peak power demand of 2933 MW and 1598 MW, respectively, in their areas.Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited successfully met the peak power demand of 2039 MW, the highest so far this season, on Thursday afternoon without any network constraint and power outage, a TPDDL spokesperson said.The company has adequately prepared for the summer season by strengthening its power network and conducting preventive maintenance and condition based maintenance of all critical electrical installations, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-power-demand-crosses-7-000mw-mark-highest-since-2019-101625160938082.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police questions Sidhana over Republic Day violence at Red Fort||Delhi Police crime branch team probing the violence at the Red Fort during farmers tractor rally on Republic Day questioned Punjabi gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana on Thursday.A police officer, who asked not to be named, said Sidhana was questioned at the crime branch office for at least two hours in the afternoon. Police said he will be questioned again on Friday.“His lawyer contacted us and said he wanted to join the investigation. He came and we asked him some questions related to the investigation. He cannot be arrested because he has been granted interim protection for two weeks,” said the officer.This was the first time that police questioned Sidhana after the incident.A Delhi court had on Tuesday granted Sidhana protection from arrest until July 3 in connection with the Republic Day violence case. Sidhana was also granted interim protection from arrest till July 19 in another case of alleged violence during the tractor rally at Samaypur Badli.Delhi Police has accused Sidhana of being one of the main conspirators who instigated people to indulge in violence after storming the Red Fort on January 21. Many other alleged co-conspirators, such as Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu and Iqbal Singh, were arrested and are out on bail. Delhi Police had earlier announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information leading to his arrest.Meanwhile, the crime branch on Wednesday arrested Buta Singh (25) who allegedly delivered inflammatory speeches, climbed the ramparts of the Red Fort and helped one of the accused persons, Jugraj Singh, hoist the religious and the farmers union flag during the Republic Day incident. Police said they were both friends and had reached Delhi together.Jugraj, who carries a reward of ₹1 lakh, is yet to be arrested till date.At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured during the tractor rally on Republic Day when protesting farmers deviated from the pre-approved route of the rally and clashed with police personnel when police stopped farmers from entering parts of Central and New Delhi. Many protesters also entered Red Fort and hoisted two flags -- a religious one and that of the farmers’ union at the ASI protected structure. While police have alleged that the violence on Republic Day was a well-planned conspiracy to defame the government, the farmer union leaders have rejected police’s allegations and said that some protesters, mainly youngsters, got carried away and went to the Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-questions-sidhana-over-republic-day-violence-at-red-fort-101625160879613.html
02-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC tells cops to ensure woman who converted to Islam is safe||The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the city police to ensure the safety of a 29-year-old woman from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, who alleged harassment from the UP police, media and vigilante groups after her wilful conversion to Islam.“…given the fact that she is a young girl, I deem it appropriate to issue a limited direction to adequately ensure to protect the life and safety of the petitioner,” Justice C Hari Shankar said.“This is a matter which appropriately should be taken by the regular bench as per the roster, given the nature of the averments in the petition. It is made clear that this vacation bench is not expressing any opinion one way or the other regarding the correctness of the said averments,” the court added.Appearing for the commissioner of police and SHO of Jamia Nagar, advocate Sameer Vashist told the court the woman gave them an incorrect address and phone number, so she could not be contacted.Advocate Tanya Aggarwal, appearing for the woman, told the court that her client is continuously changing her address as she is receiving threats from various fronts, including the media. She assured the court that her client’s current address and phone number would be provided to authorities for better assistance.The woman had approached the high court on June 29 seeking protection for herself and her family, claiming that they are facing life threats and alleged a witch hunt by the UP police, media and vigilante groups after her wilful conversion from Hinduism to Islam.The woman, who is working in Delhi, had said that because of her conversion, she and her family were being targeted and sought the court's directions to stop malicious content from being published in the media.“The petitioner (woman) is an adult and she is protected by the Constitution to choose her own faith and she cannot be targeted and harassed for the choice she makes with regard to the religion she follows,” said the petition, filed through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra.The plea said that Renu Gangwar, alias Ayesha Alvi, converted to Islam on May 27 in Delhi and since June 23, when she was in Shahjahanpur, she started getting calls from media persons requesting for a meeting.While she refused such requests, the plea claimed that media persons came to her place without her permission and took her photographs and videos, following which she started getting threat calls demanding money if she did not want news about her conversion, which they claimed would get her arrested, published in the media.The plea claimed one of them forcibly took ₹20,000 even as others too tried to extort money from her and her family. The plea further alleged that absurd and imaginary details are being reported in media regarding her conversion.The woman, in her plea, said she gave a complaint to the Delhi Police commissioner on June 24, seeking immediate intervention for her protection, but no action has been taken on her complaint yet.It sought direction to the authorities to ensure that the woman is not taken away from Delhi by force or coercion by any government agency or person, and sought protection for her and her family.The plea further sought direction to the media not to publish or broadcast any malicious content regarding her and not to divulge her personal details and also remove the contents already shown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-tells-cops-to-ensure-woman-who-converted-to-islam-is-safe-101625160878093.html

They said that a proposal has been made in this regard, and it will be sent to the Haryana government within two weeks.Rajeev Tejyan, divisional forest officer for Gurugram, said, “We have made a proposal for developing a green forest in the district, which will be spread across mainly three villages — Sakatpur, Gairatpur Bas and Naurangpur — that are part of the Aravallis. We are focusing on developing native plant species here, so that the native flora and fauna can flourish here once again.”The forest department is planning to fence the entire forest, along with boundary walls, so that the forest area is not encroached upon, Tejyan added. “At present, Aravallis in this region mostly have alien and invasive species which affects the wildlife. The invasive species has blocked the movement of black buck, which was earlier found in this region. Once we plant native species like Ronjh, Kair, and Jaal in the forest, the original ecosystem of Aravallis can be developed. Also, fencing will help us in controlling biotic pressures, and will increase the survival rate of the plants... Biotic pressures such as grazing by cattle, illegal encroachments, and pathways through forest that lead to fragmentation, can be controlled.”Meanwhile, the forest department and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), along with three private firms, are working together to develop a nagar van (urban forest) in Chakkarpur area, officials said on Thursday. This will be an extension of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, covering over 200 acres, in the city.According to the project description, the urban forest will be developed at Sikanderpur/Chakkarpur Aravallis as per the guidelines of Nagar Van Yojana of Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India. It will act as a place for providing a wholesome healthy living environment for the residents of Gurugram, and thus contributing to the growth of a green, clean, healthy and sustainable city||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/urban-forest-over-400-acres-to-come-up-in-aravallis-101625160098307.html
02-07-2021||Pune||Pune civic body allows 135 hsg societies to organise vaccination camps||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has okayed around 135 housing societies to hold vaccination camps on the society premises. According to the civic body officials, the step to initiate vaccination at housing societies was taken to inoculate more beneficiaries in less time. As vaccination for 18 to 44 years started, many beneficiaries were facing issues to get themselves inoculated. Dr Vaishali Jadhav, PMC assistant medical officer (health), said that 135 housing societies had applied for private vaccination inside their premises. “We have given permission to all 135 societies so far. Societies which can afford immunisation are going ahead. We have kept no application pending as we are encouraging more vaccination,” said Dr Jadhav. Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC chief of health department, said that housing societies can sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with private hospitals and set up vaccine camps. “Since there are many societies which can afford vaccination on their premises, we have given approval to all,” said Dr Bharti. Bharti said the “Vaccination on Wheels” drive is covering super spreaders and reaching areas where inoculation is low. “The intention is to give jabs to maximum number of people. Now that the vaccine supply is streamlined more vaccination is happening in the city,” said Dr Bharti. Abrarali Dalal, CEO, Sahyadri Hospitals, said that they recently did their first vaccination drive at a housing society. “The drive was in one of the societies at Rahatani, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) area and the charges are ₹780. As of now, six societies have approached us and we have signed MoU with two,” said Dalal. Till June 30, Pune has inoculated 4,573,053 beneficiaries. On Wednesday, Pune inoculated 57,629 beneficiaries. Of these, 31,798 beneficiaries with first dose between the age group of 18 to 44 years. And 1,061 beneficiaries with second dose in the same age group. Last week, over 50,000 beneficiaries were inoculated each day in Pune district. In PMC limits, on an average over 35,000 beneficiaries daily were inoculated in the past few days. To step up vaccination for those who are not getting slots booked, PMC has started vaccination drive at slum areas. They aim to reach 390 spots to encourage Covid vaccination in slum areas across the city. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health, Pune circle, said that Pune district received 125,000 doses of Covishield on Thursday. “Along with this, 35,000 doses of Covaxin were also given to Pune district. These doses are going to be sufficient for the next few days. The new stock may come by July 5,” said Dr Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmcallows-130-hsg-societies-to-hold-vax-camps-101625157097803.html
02-07-2021||Pune||Merger of 23 villages in PMC: Demand rises for additional water allocation||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has demanded increase in water allocation for the Pune city post merger of 23 villages within the municipal limits. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “It was expected that while handing over the 23 villages, the state government would allot funds and increase water supply quota to the city. However, there was no mention of it after the final merger notification was released. Our previous demand for water was 18.96 TMC (thousand million cubic feet), but now we would need more water.” The allocated annual water quota for Pune is 14.5 TMC, but the city’s existing need is more than 18 TMC per annum. PMC water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “It is natural that after merging the new villages, the city’s water demand will increase. Even today, it is getting tough to provide water for the previously merged 11 villages. After merging 11 villages, PMC demanded 18.96 TMC water and the city would need more supply and we would officially submit a proposal to the irrigation department.” One of the officials from the water department said on anonymity, “Though the population in the merged 23 villages is looking less, post notification these new areas will soon become crowded in a few years. With development, construction activity would increase in these villages and so would the requirement of water.” Rasne said, “I have instructed the water department to prepare an estimate of water stock requirement and will follow it up with the state government. We welcome the merger move though it is politically motivated. Now, we appeal to the state and opposition parties to join hands with PMC to grant more water allocation for the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/merger-of-23-villages-demand-rises-for-additional-water-allocation-101625156018948.html
02-07-2021||Pune||PMC seeks Rs9,000 cr from state govt for development of new 23 merged villages||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has officially sought Rs9,000 crore financial assistance from the state government for the development of the new 23 villages merged within the civic limits. The civic administration will require the funds for the development of water supply network, sewage lines, streetlights, road development, hospitals, gardens and creating other civic amenities in these areas. PMC city engineer Prashant Waghmare said, “We have demanded the state government to give additional funds for the development of the merged areas. Even during the meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the PMC administration had put forth the facts and demanded state’s help post merger of these villages.” The civic administration has carried out surveys of the merged areas by various departments and tabled the work that needs to be carried out in these villages. As the merged areas are scattered, PMC would need to spend more on infrastructure creation, according to the civic body authorities. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The merger plan was initiated in 1995, but the Congress and the NCP opposed it at that time. If these villages were merged at that time, the areas would have been developed. Now, its our responsibility to create amenities in these areas. When the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis took the decision to merge 11 villages in 2017, PMC demanded help from the state government. Now, we are making the same demand to provide Rs10,000 crore for development of these areas.” PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “PMC budget is Rs8,370 crore. Revenue has dipped because of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Hence, it is difficult to create infrastructure in the existing areas and elected members are demanding financial assistance under development funds. Besides, the municipal commissioner is seeking cuts in development projects to meet the civic needs. Hence, under these financial constraints, it is the responsibility of the state government to provide funds to the civic body. Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) should also release the funds that it collected from these villages to the municipal corporation.” One of the officials said on anonymity, “Major issues faced by merged villages is rampant development and illegal constructions. Many roads are narrow. PMC would need to give priority for road widening and check on illegal constructions. The civic body would need to reserve lands first for creating public amenities like roads, gardens, schools and hospitals as there is open space available in these areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-seeks-rs9-000-cr-from-state-govt-for-development-of-new-23-merged-villages-101625154877041.html

A total of 150 organisations participated in this survey from Pune district. While there is an uptick in production levels from April and May, industries have yet to reach the recovery peak of 85 per cent in February-March of this calendar year, according to Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCIA. “There is some recovery seen this month as compared to April and May. “There is still a long way to go before we reach the peak recovery levels as seen in February-March 2021, and then further growth. In the next few weeks, we look forward to an accelerated vaccination drive to help reduce fear and uncertainty, leading to an increase in economic activity and thereby increasing demand in the economy. “Having resolved most supply-side issues in the unlocking process, MSMEs are now awaiting a boost in demand to increase their production levels,” said Girbane. On an average, the companies surveyed said that the number of employees working has increased from 70 per cent in May to 77 per cent in June 2021, as unlocking allowed some services industries to resume activities to a certain extent. The peak of recovery for employees deployed was at 86 per cent in February-March this calendar year. The surveyed companies were also asked about when their production levels were expected to be the same as they were pre-pandemic. As many as 23 per cent of the companies said their production was already at pre-Covid levels, while 53 per cent of the respondents said that they expect their production levels to go back to the pre-Covid levels in up to six months. A total of 24 per cent said it would take more than six months. Organisations surveyed were micro, small, medium and large-scale, at 20 per cent, 26 per cent, 23 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively. A total of 66 per cent of the organisations surveyed were from the manufacturing sector, 17 per cent from the services sector, involved in both manufacturing and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/june-sees-slight-recovery-in-production-levels-of-pune-firms-101625150916679.html

The US State Department said that Turkey was providing “tangible support” to the Sultan Murad division, a faction of Syrian opposition which Ankara has long supported, which the US said had recruited and used child soldiers.The TIP report also showed that governments placed under the list could be subject to restrictions on certain security assistance and commercial licensing of military equipment. “Beginning October 1, 2021, and effective throughout Fiscal Year 2022, these restrictions will apply to the listed countries, absent a presidential waiver, applicable exception, or reinstatement of assistance pursuant to the terms of the CSPA,” the report showed.Also read | US donates 2.5 million doses of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine to PakistanOther countries in the CSPA ListAlongside Turkey, Afghanistan, Burma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.Relations with TurkeyTurkey, a key NATO ally and critical regional partner to the US, is currently in negotiations for running the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, after the withdrawal of US and NATO troops.However, officials have hinted that Turkey’s name in the list wouldn’t affect those negotiations.“When it comes to trafficking in persons, I would not want to link the report today with the constructive discussions we are engaging in with Turkey, in the context of Afghanistan or any other area of shared interest,” Reuters quoted State Department spokesperson Ned Price as saying.Also read | Grave violations against children remained ‘alarmingly’ high in 2020: UN reportHow US defines ‘child soldiers’In the report, the US defined child soldiers as anyone below the age of 18 who takes part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces, police or other security forces.

02-07-2021||World||Canadian PM takes second dose of Covid-19 vaccine||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opted for the Moderna vaccine for his second dose after having received the AstraZeneca jab for the first. Trudeau was inoculated on Friday morning at a pharmacy in Ottawa. He told the pharmacist he was “very excited” to complete the vaccine series. His wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received her second dose on Thursday and Trudeau said he expected the common side-effects.The choice of the mRNA vaccine manufactured by the American firm came after Canadian health authorities updated guidance allowing for vaccine interchangeability. On June 17, National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI) announced that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines were deemed the “preferred” jabs for both the first and second dose even if the first was administered using AZ, which is manufactured in India under the Covishield brand name.In its recommendations, NACI said the mRNA vaccines should be preferred unless “is inaccessible or there is a contraindication, for example, an allergy to an mRNA vaccine or its components”. Only in the latter circumstances should a viral vector vaccine, like AZ, be offered.It also endorsed vaccine interchangeability, basically that doses can now be mixed with those receiving the first dose of AZ now being given the second dose as an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.NACI said that “emerging evidence” from studies in Germany have suggested a “potentially better immune response, including against variants of concern, when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is followed by a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, compared to two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.” Similarly, it said, evidence suggested that such mixing “has a good safety profile”.The Trudeaus received their first injection at a pharmacy in Ottawa, and just before getting the jab, the Prime Minister said he was “very excited” to get it.While there have been concerns about adverse reactions to the AZ vaccine, Canadian health authorities have maintained that the “benefits of vaccines authorised in Canada continue to outweigh the risks”.In its latest data on adverse events linked to vaccines, the Public Health Agency of Canada had noted that of the 31,400,466 doses administered till June 18, just 1,719 or 0.005% had caused serious reactions. These include anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine, cases of blood clotting, a rare syndrome associated following vaccination with AZ/Covishield vaccine. Health authorities are also monitoring other reactions like capillary leak and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, linked to the AZ jab. The former causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels while the latter is an immune disorder. Health Canada has also recently introduced labelling for the mRNA vaccines, warning of the possibility of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-takes-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101625241590225.html

The suicide watch programme involves monitoring an inmate’s mental health for weeks, months, or even years.

Along with the monarchs, the statue of British explorer Captain James Cook was also toppled by the protesters.The incident took place on Canada Day (July 1), when the country celebrates its national day every year. The protests were led by the orange-clad members of a group named ‘Idle No More’ according to the online news website Daily Mail.According to the report, ropes were tied to the statues before they were brought to the ground alongside chants of “no pride in genocide.” The protests came as many citizens had also called for the cancellation of Canada Day celebrations this year due to the country’s colonial past.Also read | Canada Day eclipsed by graves found at indigenous schoolThe statue of Queen Victoria was toppled outside the Manitoba provincial legislature to the cheer of many protesters and both the statue and pedestal were defaced with red paint hand marks. Meanwhile, the statue of Queen Elizabeth II, which was nearby, was also pulled down by the crowd.Indigenous schoolsBehind the anger of the protesters is the discovery of many unmarked graves of children in the indigenous schools of Canada.Nearly 1,000 such graves have been found at the locations of former residential schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan in Canada, according to news reports. These schools were run by the Catholic Church and funded by the government, according to a Reuters report.Earlier on June 23, hundreds of such graves were discovered at the site of the former Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan that operated between 1899 and 1997 before it was replaced by a day school.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier on July 1 said that the discoveries of the remains of the children at former schools "have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures," during his Canada Day address.Also, a spokesperson for British PM Boris Johnson said that their government condemned any incident of defacing the statues of the queen. “Our thoughts are with Canada's indigenous community following these tragic discoveries, and we follow these issues closely and continue to engage with the Government of Canada on indigenous matters,” Reuters quoted the spokesperson as saying, earlier on Friday.(With inputs from Daily Mail online, agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-victoria-queen-elizabeth-ii-statues-torn-down-defaced-in-canada-by-protesters-against-colonial-past-101625235893135.html

It continues to host mass events, including Euro 2020 football fixtures in Saint Petersburg.The surge in infections prompted President Vladimir Putin this week to once again urge Russians to get vaccinated in an annual televised phone-in session with the nation.The Kremlin stressed Friday that a new lockdown was off the table."Nobody wants any lockdowns, and yes, it is not up for debate," said Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. "It is not being discussed."Saint Petersburg, Russia's second city, on Friday recorded 101 deaths, just shy of its record from earlier in the week of 119.Organisers have said the Euro 2020 Spain vs. Switzerland quarter-final later Friday will go ahead despite the high infection rates, in front of thousands of spectators.Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said the Delta variant now accounts for 90 percent of new cases in the city.Sobyanin has ordered offices to send home a third of their workforces, except employees who had been vaccinated, and said 60 percent of people working in the service industry must be fully inoculated by mid-August.'I want to feel safe'Moscow's restaurants have been told to only allow indoors patrons who have been vaccinated or infected in the past six months.Vaccine hesitancy has been a huge challenge for the Russian authorities but the new restrictions appear to be working.On Friday, AFP journalists saw hundreds of people waiting at vaccination points across the city of more than 12 million."I've been queueing for about two hours already," student Svetlana Stepereva said in Sokolniki park in northeast Moscow.The 21-year-old said it was time to get vaccinated, pointing to the ever-tightening restrictions."I want to get a jab and feel safe."Mikhail Shutov, the head of a Moscow clinic, told AFP at the park that there was a clear increase in the number of people who wanted to be inoculated."There are definitely more people who want to get vaccinated for the first time," he said.The Kremlin had set a goal of fully inoculating 60 percent of Russia's population by September, but conceded this week it would not be able to meet that target, even though free jabs have been available since early December.Sobyanin this week urged Muscovites inoculated more than six months ago to get a booster jab with the country's homegrown Sputnik V vaccine or the one-dose Sputnik Light.Russia, with 136,565 deaths from the virus, has the highest official toll from Covid-19 in Europe even as authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the country's outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-rejects-lockdown-despite-record-rise-in-daily-covid-19-deaths-for-4th-straight-day-101625231474010.html

One of the main impacts of Brexit was the end of freedom of movement, whereby anyone in any EU state can live and work anywhere else within the bloc, which numbers 27 countries after the UK's departure.Under the scheme, EU citizens in the country will be guaranteed their rights, including access to benefits and healthcare, in the UK Any EU citizen who hasn't applied could now potentially lose their rights or even be subject to deportation.Similar schemes have been in place in the EU with regard to the 1 million or so British citizens who live within the bloc. Those applying for post-Brexit residency permits in France also faced a deadline on Wednesday.One key concern is that the immigration policy could leave a disastrous legacy similar to Britain’s “Windrush” scandal, when many people from the Caribbean who legally settled in the UK decades ago were wrongly caught up in tough new government rules to crack down on illegal immigration.Many in the “Windrush generation” — named after the ship that carried the first post-war migrants from the West Indies — lost their homes and jobs or were even deported simply because they couldn’t produce paperwork proving their residency rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-6-million-eu-citizens-seek-to-settle-in-post-brexit-uk-101625228927780.html

This is for the second time this year, and third since October 2020, when TikTok was banned in Pakistan only to subsequently see the ban lifted.Also Read: TikTok removes six million videos in Pakistan to tackle banThe high court had on June 28 directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the country's telecom regulator, to suspend TikTok for "immortality" and "obscenity," as alleged in the complaint by a citizen. During the hearing on Friday, the PTA informed the court it had already blocked the app, though it also requested the judiciary to allow it to restore the app's services.Accepting the regulator's request, the court directed it to expedite the process on the petitioner's request, and issue an order by July 5. The next hearing in the case will take place on Monday by when, the PTA said, it would share its decision on the petitioner's concern seeking the removal of "objectionable" content from TikTok, as well as to ensure no "indecent" content is uploaded on the app.In March, the Peshawar high court directed the PTA to ban TikTok across Pakistan, acting on a petition filed by several citizens. However, the ban was lifted in April after the court asked the regulator to ensure no "immoral" content is uploaded.Also Read: Pakistan lifts weekslong ban on TikTok over racy contentTikTok was first banned in Pakistan last October when the PTA took action against it "after several sections of the society expressed their grievances over immoral and indecent content" uploaded on the app. The ban was, however, lifted after just 10 days as TikTok assured the PTA it would operate according to local laws to ensure "no indecent content was uploaded."(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-sindh-high-court-withdraws-decision-to-ban-tiktok-101625230194613.html

An Associated Press reporter at the scene saw passengers wiping their stinging eyes and children frightened.Banging drums and tooting horns, a few hundred union activists blocked the terminal’s passport control area, causing hundreds of passengers to miss their flights. Riot police with helmets and shields fanned out, and passengers were re-routed to a neighboring terminal.Unions have been negotiating with Paris airport management over pay cuts linked to the collapse in air travel amid the pandemic. Management of the Paris airport network says revenue was down 80% in 2020 and that it is trying to avoid layoffs by trimming pay instead.Unions announced strikes and protests through Monday, just as many French families leave on summer holidays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-airport-workers-protest-against-pay-cuts-block-terminal-flights-delayed-101625219891444.html

The VT-4 battle tanks have been produced by Chinese state-owned armoured vehicle manufacturer, Norinco, and the delivery of these started in April last year. With the latest induction, Pakistan is the third country to have procured these tanks from China after Thailand and Nigeria procured got them from Beijing.Lieutenant general Shaheen Mehmood, the commander of the Mangla Corps, on Wednesday visited the armoured division and inspected the first batch of VT-4 tanks, the army’s media affairs wing said in a statement. Major General Rashid Mahmood briefed the commander about ongoing post-shipment inspections of the first batch of tanks, the statement said. General Mehmood also witnessed the mobility and manoeuvrability test of the tanks, reported PTI.Pakistan army said, after their on-field tests in September last year, that the VT-4 tanks would be employed in an offensive role by strike formations after induction. “The VT-4 is compatible with any modern tank in the world integrating advanced armour protection, manoeuvrability, firepower capabilities and state-of-the-art technology,” the army said.Pakistan has heavily relied on China to buy defence weapons and procured several such artillery to boost its capability along the border with India.In 2018, Pakistan was learnt to have around 17 units of Chinese origin T-59 and T69 tanks, which comprise 30 per cent of its total tank strength, people familiar with the matter said. It also has 12 regiments of Al-Zarar tanks, which makes 20 per cent of the tank fleet while Ukrain origin T-80-UD and T-85 UD, as well as an upgraded version of T-59 tanks, comprise the rest of the 50 per cent tank fleet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-inducts-china-made-vt-4-battle-tanks-for-offensive-role-101625209770342.html

Dr Fauci's assertion comes as the threat of another wave of the pandemic on the back of this fast-spreading variant is looming large across the world."...From Public Health England, from June 14, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 96 per cent effective against hospitalization from the Delta variant after two doses, and the AZ (AstraZeneca) was 92 per cent effective against hospitalisation after two doses," Dr Fauci said.As AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson are based on very similar platforms like that of Pfizer, it can be assumed that the results against the Delta variant will be similar, he said."Since these vaccines -- the AZ and the J&J (Johnson & Johnson) are based on very similar platforms, one could anticipate and make a reasonable assumption that the results against the Delta variant would be at least similar, perhaps even better. We are now looking at neutralization data, and soon we will have more firm data which we will make available to you as soon as it occurs," he said.Johnson and Johnson has claimed that its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine is effective against the Delta variant, with an immune response lasting at least eight months. The company conducted two studies to find out the efficacy of the vaccine against the Delta variant - one on eight people vaccinated with the J&J jab and the second with 20 vaccinated patients at a Boston hospital.The World Health Organization has said Delta will become the predominant variant in the coming months as at present 96 countries have reported this variant.Dr Fauci too has expressed concern over the Delta variant as it is "more efficient" than the other variants. "The Delta variant has the capability of spreading much more efficiently from person to person. It also can cause more severe diseases. So there are two things about it that are troublesome," he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-us-authorised-covid-19-vaccines-effective-against-delta-fauci-explains-why-101625214716917.html
02-07-2021||World||Explained: What is Trump Organization and what tax fraud it committed||Donald Trump's company Trump Organization and its finance chief have been charged with "sweeping and audacious" tax fraud schemes. CFO Allen Weisselberg has been accused of collecting more than $1.7 million off the record, which included his apartment rent, car payments and school tuition fee. This is the first criminal case that has come out from the New York authorities' two-year investigation against the business dealing of the former US president.How is Donald Trump involved?Donald Trump has not been charged but the probe has found out that Trump signed some of the cheques of this alleged scheme. Before he became the president of the United States, he stepped down from all positions that he held in the Trump Organization. But he remained the sole owner of the businesses and has now recently returned to his old offices.What is Trump Organization?Trump Organization is a business entity that includes hundreds of firms and partnerships that own or manage office buildings, hotels, residential towers, golf clubs, branding rights, licensing deals and other assets around the world. Both Trump's sons are executive vice presidents of the company.What are the charges?According to the indictment, starting from 2005, the Trump Organization paid senior executives off the books in the form of fringe benefits to evade tax. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, the state and the city out of more than $1 million in unpaid taxes and tax refunds to which he was not entitled.How could the indictment hurt Trump's company?The indictment may make it harder for Trump's company to strike new deals, secure bank loans and push more money into the business. Associated Press quoted defence lawyer Daniel Horwitz as saying, "Companies that are being indicted, whether they are private or public, big or small, face serious collateral consequences." “Companies in the financial services industry are reluctant to do business with them. Their access to capital is limited or cut off as is their ability to place their liquid assets with banks and brokerages," Horwitz said.

02-07-2021||World||Australia further curbs new arrivals due to risks of Delta variant||Australia plans to halve commercial passenger arrivals due to virus risks as parts of the country emerged from lockdowns Friday.Australia will reduce its cap on arrivals from 6,000 passengers a week to 3,000 by July 14 to reduce pressure on hotel quarantine, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after a meeting with state and territory leaders.Australia already has some of the world’s tightest border restrictions aimed at keeping Covid-19 out of the country. The new restrictions add to obstacles faced by 34,000 Australian citizens and permanent residents stranded overseas and registered with the government as wanting to come home.The government will charter more airliners to repatriate Australians, but the reduced limit on commercial passenger arrivals could continue until next year.“If medical advice changes between now and then, if medical advice suggests that we can alter that, then, of course, the National Cabinet has always been receptive to that advice and we’ll continue to monitor that,” Morrison told reporters, referring to his decision-making meetings with the state and territory leaders.“We wouldn’t want to keep those caps in place any longer than we had to,” he added.Almost half the Australian population locked down since last week due to clusters mostly of the delta variant of the coronavirus that is thought to be more contagious.Several cities in Queensland state and the Northern Territory came out of lockdown on Friday. The Queensland capital Brisbane and the neighboring Moreton Bay area would remain in lockdown until Saturday after a mother and daughter tested positive in Brisbane.The biggest cluster is in Sydney where 31 new cases were reported on Friday, the largest daily tally of the current emergency. Sydney’s two-week lockdown is due to end on July 9.Australia has been relatively successful in containing clusters throughout the pandemic, registering fewer than 31,000 cases in a population of 26 million and 910 deaths total.The higher infection rate of the delta variant has exposed the vulnerability of the Australian population in which, according to government data, only 8% are fully vaccinated.Morrison said a vaccine would be made available to every Australian who wanted one by the end of the year.The government has proposed fewer restrictions for vaccinated people, such as allowing them to quarantine at home for a week after travelling overseas instead of two weeks in a hotel for the unvaccinated.“A lot of people say: ‘Well, why should I get vaccinated?’ They go: ‘There’s not much COVID around in Australia. I’ve got more chance of, I don’t know, getting run over by a car than catching COVID,’” Morrison said.“We’re prisoners of our own success in this. If you get vaccinated, you get to change how we live as a country. You get to change how you live in Australia. And I think this is a very powerful message,” he added.Australia introduced extraordinarily tough border restrictions in March 2020 that prevent Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving the country as well as foreigners from arriving except under limited circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-further-curbs-new-arrivals-due-to-risks-of-delta-variant-101625203789968.html

More than half of those were caused by lightning strikes that ignited trees and woods that were left dry due to the historic temperatures recorded in the province over the past week.Trudeau will chair a meeting of the Incident Response Group, a crisis and emergency management committee, on Friday “to discuss the extreme weather-related conditions in British Columbia and the wildfire situation throughout Western Canada”, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.Trudeau also spoke to British Columbia’s premier (equivalent of a chief minister) John Horgan on Thursday and assured him of the federal government’s support to those affected by the fires. The PM also informed him that defence minister Harjit Sajjan and public safety and emergency preparedness minister Bill Blair were “working with provincial ministers to ensure that all federal resources necessary are available to British Columbia”.“I cannot stress enough how extreme the fire risk is at this moment in every part of British Columbia,” Horgan said during the course of a media briefing. The fires raging in the province include nine of note which “are highly visible or which pose a potential threat to public safety,” according to the British Columbia Wildfire Service.Among the worst hit areas is the hamlet of Lytton and its vicinity. Over Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Lytton recorded new highs in temperatures in Canadian history, peaking at 49.6 degrees Celsius. It was ordered evacuated on Wednesday, with nearly 1,000 inhabitants in the area having to move to safety as local officials said nearly 90% of Lytton being decimated by a wildfire. Trudeau described the situation there as “catastrophic”. The British Columbia Wildfire Service classified it as “out of control” and estimated it was 6,400 hectares in size.Evacuation orders are in place across several communities in the wildfire-hit regions and over 500sq km of area has been impacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-calls-emergency-meeting-to-tackle-wildfires-in-british-columbia-101625204206048.html
02-07-2021||World||Canada Day eclipsed by graves found at indigenous school||Canada's national holiday Thursday was marked by a grim reckoning over its colonial history, after more than 1,000 unmarked graves were found near former boarding schools for indigenous children.Several cities across the country cancelled their traditional Canada Day celebrations, usually marked by fireworks and barbecues. The hashtag #CancelCanadaDay was trending on social media, and rallies in support of the indigenous community were held around the country.The 154th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation came one day after 182 unmarked graves were found near a former boarding school in British Columbia where indigenous children were forcibly assimilated.The discovery was the latest in a series that have outraged the country, with 751 similar graves found near a school in Marieval in western Saskatchewan province last week, and 215 found at the end of May at another school in Kamloops, British Columbia.Until the 1990s, some 150,000 indigenous, Inuit and Metis youngsters were forcibly enrolled in the 139 schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language.More than 4,000 died of disease and neglect in the schools, according to a commission of inquiry that concluded Canada had committed "cultural genocide.""The horrific findings... have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures, and the injustices that still exist for Indigenous peoples and many others in Canada," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement Thursday."We as Canadians must be honest with ourselves about our past," he said.'Happy denial day'Days after the Kamloops discovery the city council of Victoria, the capital of British Columbia, voted unanimously to cancel their planned virtual celebrations.In Toronto, demonstrators marched early Thursday wearing orange T-shirts in support of indigenous communities, many carrying signs with slogans such as "No pride in genocide."Thousands held a similar rally in Montreal with slogans like "Happy denial day.""I come here because I have small children and I think it's important to send the message that we don't want our children to be touched, to be mistreated," said an emotional Therese Dube, 56, an indigenous woman from the Akikamekw nation and a survivor of one of the residential schools in Quebec.April Courtney Kipling, a 29-year-old indigenous woman, came "to remember, to recognize all the children who will never go home."Others had a more pointed reason for showing up. "Canada Day is like celebrating genocide," said Olivia Lya, a 22-year-old Innu woman."Anyone celebrating Canada on July 1 is celebrating oppression," said Nakuset, co-organiser of the Montreal Native Women's Shelter, in a statement.Several indigenous people noted the presence of non-indigenous Canadians at the Montreal rally."It's hopeful, it shows that people are listening," said Nadine Bellerose Lavallee, a 50-year-old Metis woman.A statue of Queen Victoria, the 19th century ruler of the British empire, was covered in red paint and toppled in Winnipeg, in the central Canadian province of Manitoba, while at least ten churches suffered damage in Calgary, in the western province of Alberta, local media reported.The Canadian flag on the Peace Tower in Ottawa was flown at half-mast to honour indigenous children, as was the flag on the central tower of the Quebec National Assembly."This year, the tragic history of residential schools has overshadowed Canada Day celebrations," said Quebec premier Francois Legault.But opposition leader Erin O'Toole defended Canada Day. "The road to reconciliation does not start by tearing Canada down," the Conservative leader said, admitting that Canada is "not a perfect country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-day-eclipsed-by-graves-found-at-indigenous-school-101625197215666.html
02-07-2021||World||Canadian PM opts for Moderna vaccine for second dose||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has opted for the Moderna vaccine for his second dose of the Covid-19 jab after having received the AstraZeneca one for the first.Trudeau is scheduled to be inoculated on Friday in Ottawa.The choice of the mRNA vaccine manufactured by the American firm came after Canadian health authorities updated guidance allowing for vaccine interchangeability. On June 17, the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI) announced that mRNA Covid-19 vaccines were deemed the “preferred” jabs for both the first and second dose even if the first was administered using AZ, which is manufactured in India under the Covishield brand name.In its recommendations, NACI said the mRNA vaccines should be preferred unless “is inaccessible or there is a contraindication, for example, an allergy to an mRNA vaccine or its components”. Only in the latter circumstances should a viral vector vaccine, like AZ, be offered.It also endorsed vaccine interchangeability, basically that doses can now be mixed with those receiving the first dose of AZ now being given the second dose as an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.NACI said that “emerging evidence” from studies in Germany have suggested a “potentially better immune response, including against variants of concern, when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is followed by a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, compared to two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine”. Similarly, it said, evidence suggested that such mixing “has a good safety profile”.The Trudeaus received their first injection at a pharmacy in Ottawa, and just before getting the jab, the Prime Minister said he was “very excited” to get it. While there have been concerns about adverse reactions to the AZ vaccine, Canadian health authorities have maintained that the “benefits of vaccines authorised in Canada continue to outweigh the risks”.In its latest data on adverse events linked to vaccines, the Public Health Agency of Canada had noted that of the 31,400,466 doses administered till June 18, just 1,719 or 0.005% had caused serious reactions. These include anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine, cases of blood clotting, a rare syndrome associated following vaccination with AZ/Covishield vaccine. Health authorities are also monitoring other reactions like capillary leak and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, linked to the AZ jab. The former causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels while the latter is an immune disorder. Health Canada has also recently introduced labelling for the mRNA vaccines, warning of the possibility of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canadian-pm-opts-for-moderna-vaccine-for-second-dose-101625201507679.html

On Monday, the mercury soared to 47.9 degree and on Tuesday, it was 49.6 degree. On Wednesday, the temperature came down and settled below 39 degree, a wildfire tore down the town in 15 minutes before the authorities could issue an official evacuation order.The heatwave situation has been attributed to the phenomenon called heat dome in which hit air gets trapped by high-pressure fronts pushing it back to the ground. In such a situation, cloud formation is prevented which, in turn, leads to more heating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1000-people-evacuated-in-and-around-western-canadian-village-as-wildfire-rages-101625198385809.html
02-07-2021||World||Trump firm, top executive charged with criminal tax fraud||Former US president Donald Trump’s eponymous company together with a related entity and a long-time top finance executive have been charged with running a scheme to defraud the federal Internal Revenue Service and New York state and New York City tax authorities for 15 years starting 2005.The Trump Organization, Trump Payroll Corporation, an entity that process payments and compensations to employees of the company and chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were charged on Thursday with 15 felony counts including criminal tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records.Weisselberg is personally accused of evading taxes on $1.7 million in indirect income he received from the Trump Organization for a rented accommodation where he has lived for years, private school tuitions for members of his family, lease on two Mercedes Benz cars for himself and his wife.“To put it bluntly, this was a sweeping and audacious illegal payments scheme,” Carey Dunne, general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R Vance, Jr, said during an arraignment in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, according to a report in the New York Times.Weisselberg was marched to court in handcuffs. He was released but his lawyers were made to surrender his passport as prosecutors argued he is a flight risk given his resources.Former president Trump dismissed the charges as a “political witch hunt by the radical left Democrats” and said the New York prosecutors, who are both Democrats, “now taking over the assignment, continues”. And sought to portray it as something that “dividing our country like never before”!Though Trump was not personally charged nor any of his children who have been involved in the running of the organisation, he was clearly bothered by the indictment of the company which made him famous around the world and which he liked to tout as a huge success, which, he had vowed to replicate as president.“If the name of the company was something else, I don’t think these charges would have been brought,” said Alan Futerfas, a Trump Organization attorney.The White House did not comment directly on the indictment. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One President Joe Biden “has made clear that it’s long past due for the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share”.The Thursday indictment came after two years of investigation that started with the conviction of Micheal Cohen, Trump’s once-time lawyer and fixer for making hush-money payments to women who had claimed to have had relations with Trump. Cohen had also said in a congressional testimony that the Trump Organization inflated the value of its assets when seeking bank loans and undervalued them for taxation purposes.Manhattan attorney had tried to pressure Weisselberg, who is considered the most important figure in the Trump Organization outside the Trump family, to cooperate and flip on the former president. He withstood the pressure, but experts believe the threat of a long prison sentence can make him change his mind.Weisselberg has pleaded not guilty. “He will fight these charges in court,” his lawyers, Mary E Mulligan and Bryan C Skarlatos, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-firm-top-executive-charged-with-criminal-tax-fraud-101625199765422.html

Later, July 2 was officially declared as World UFO Day. It was also celebrated on June 24 because as per aviator Kenneth Arnold, nine unusual objects flew over Washington in the early 1990s on that day.Also read: Alien spacecrafts or earthlings? What Pentagon's UFO report says on sightingsJuly 2 is celebrated as World UFO Day to commemorate the supposed UFO crash incident in Roswell New Mexico in 1947. Thousands of researchers and paranormal enthusiasts gather for the UFO festival in Roswell every year.In the latest development, a day before the annual UFO day, the US federal government has decided to embark on a major overhaul of how documented encounters with unidentified flying crafts are tracked, organised and analysed. The examination is expected to be key investigations yielding conclusions that were lacking in the unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) study released last week, reported the Washington Times.The newly found legitimacy to the objects by government transparency and UAP investigations head by the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has made the event extra significant and prominent this year.In Roswell and other parts of the world, people have become more interested in knowing about UFOs. Researchers say that the next few months and years will be very crucial in determining if the shroud of secrecy has lifted, according to the Washington Times report.“Will this be carried through? Because this will not be done in a short amount of time. This is going to take years,” the Washington Times quoted Mark Rodeghier, scientific director at the Center for UFO Studies, as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-ufo-day-significance-and-developments-101625191933448.html

The US-based company said in a statement that recipients of its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine produced strong neutralising antibodies over the course of at least eight months against all variants including Delta, which was first seen in India and has been spreading around the world. The healthcare company added that its vaccine was 85 per cent effective and could also help prevent hospitalisation and death."Current data for the eight months studied so far shows that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time," Mathai Mammen, head of research & development at J&J's drugs business, said in the statement.Also read | UK approves single shot Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccineThe Delta variant contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases in India and also prompted the UK to delay its reopening by one month in June. The Delta variant is expected to become the dominant strain in the US in the coming weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The findings disclosed by J&J on Thursday were from two studies. The company has submitted data as a preprint to the website bioRxiv ahead of peer review. The company said that its Covid-19 vaccine shot neutralised the Delta variant within 29 days of a first dose and protection matured and improved over time. J&J evaluated the blood samples of eight participants in its late-stage clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccine to assess neutralising antibodies produced against the Delta variant.Also read | US looking at joint production of Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India“We’re extremely happy, actually, and confident there’s no need for the booster at the moment and we’re protected against different strains,” said Johan Van Hoof, J&J’s global head of infectious diseases and vaccines, in an interview, according to Bloomberg.Van Hoof said J&J doesn’t believe people given its Covid-19 vaccine should need a booster within a year of getting the jab. “And if a boost is needed we don’t think we’ll need to change the formulation,” he said.Scientists and some vaccine manufacturers have been creating updated versions of their Covid-19 vaccines to directly target the emerging variants, which have been seen as significantly more transmissible than the original coronavirus that first emerged in China's Wuhan in 2019.Other vaccine makers, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Inc, and AstraZeneca Plc, have previously said that their Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the fast-spreading Delta variant.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-neutralises-delta-variant-lasts-at-least-8-months-j-j-101625192855724.html

Imran Khan also said China's take on the Uighur issue was completely different from what was being reported in the Western media. "Because of our extreme proximity and relationship with China, we actually accept the Chinese version," Khan was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper on Thursday.Last month, Imran Khan when asked about his silence on the atrocities on Uighur Muslims in China and outspokenness about Islamophobia in Europe and the US, he said he is "more concerned about what is happening at the border of his country." Khan, in an interview with HBO Axios, also said he has been talking to Beijing "behind the closed doors" and he has been informed, "this is not the case, according to the Chinese people."Also read | Imran Khan on Uighur Muslims genocide: 'China one of the greatest friends’An estimated 1 million people or more -- most of them Uighurs -- have been confined in mass detention camps in the Xinjiang region in recent years, researchers have said. China has been accused of imposing forced labour, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents. China has time and time refuted these allegations of interning millions of Uighurs and said these are education camps to wean them away from religious extremism."It is hypocritical. There are much worse human rights violations taking place in other parts of the world... But Western media hardly comment on this," Imran Khan said, lashing out at Western media for highlighting the Uighurs' situation and Hong Kong.Also read | Amnesty calls Xinjiang a ‘dystopian hellscape’The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and several other countries have accused China of committing genocide against the Uighurs in resource-rich Xinjiang and called for an international probe by human rights groups.China accuses East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) of being responsible for several violent attacks in the province and outside, including one at the Forbidden City in Beijing in 2013, which have killed several people.Also read | US, Canada, UK call on China to end 'repression' in XinjiangBeijing has sharply criticised the US for delisting Xinjiang’s separatist militant outfit from its list of terrorist organisations last year, saying it reflected Washington’s "double standards" on fighting global terrorism.Imran Khan said China has always stood by Pakistan whenever his country has faced trouble, politically or internationally. He also Pakistan's relationship with China had nothing to do with India. "Our relationship is a bilateral relationship. It is extremely strong," Khan said underlining Pakistan's strong ties with China.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-again-ignores-china-s-treatment-of-uighurs-101625190434534.html

Nasa said the rover team will now be deeply engaged with planning navigation routes, drafting instructions to be beamed up, and will even use special 3D glasses to help map the course. However, it said, the rover will take charge of the drive-by itself, using a powerful auto-navigation system.The enhanced system is called AutoNav and makes 3D maps of the terrain ahead, identifies hazards, and plans a route around any obstacles without additional direction from controllers back on Earth.Also read: Scientists closer to solving methane mystery on Mars, says Nasa"We have a capability called ‘thinking while driving'. The rover is thinking about the autonomous drive while its wheels are turning,” said Vandi Verma, a senior engineer, rover planner, and driver at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.AutoNav is considered to be the key feature in helping the Perseverance rover in its first science campaign on the floor of Jezero Crater. The team members look forward to letting AutoNav “take the wheel" but will intervene when needed.The space agency said that the rover might hit a top speed of 393 feet or 120 metres per hour, more than its predecessor, Curiosity, which was equipped with an earlier version of AutoNav that covers about 66 feet or 20 metres per hour as it climbs Mount Sharp to the southeast.“We sped up AutoNav by four or five times,” said Michael McHenry, the mobility domain lead and part of JPL’s team of rover planners. “We’re driving a lot farther in a lot less time than Curiosity demonstrated.”When Mars was wetter than today, billions of years ago, this crater was a lake and the Perseverance’s destination is a dried-out river delta at the crater’s edge, the agency said. If life ever existed on the red planet, signs of it might be found there, as per the agency. The rover will gather samples over some 9 miles (15km), prep the samples for collection by a future mission that would take it back to Earth for analysis.The space agency said the delay in radio signal between Earth and Mars makes it difficult for the team as they need to scrutinize satellite images, sometimes donning those 3D glasses to view the Martian surface in the rover’s vicinity. When the team signs off, the instructions are beamed to Mars and the rover executes them the following day.Perseverance’s wheels were modified as well to help with just how swiftly those plans are executed. Along with being slightly greater in diameter and narrower than Curiosity’s wheels, they each feature 48 treads that look like slightly wavy lines, as opposed to Curiosity’s 24 chevron-pattern treads. The goals were to help with traction as well as durability, Nasa said in a statement.Perseverance can also employ one of its computers for navigation on the surface and its main computer can devote itself to the other tasks. This Vision Compute Element, or VCE, guided Perseverance to the Martian surface during its entry, descent, and landing in February and is now used full-time to map out the rover's journey.It also keeps track of its movements using a system called "visual odometry". The rover periodically captures images as it moves, comparing one position to the next to see if it moved the expected distance."Jezero is incredible. It’s a rover driver’s paradise. When you put on the 3D glasses, you see so much more undulation in the terrain. Some days I just stare at the images,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-rover-takes-the-wheel-in-search-of-signs-of-ancient-life-101625184780185.html

Bezos' company Blue Origin said in an announcement on Thursday Wally Funk will be aboard the July 20 launch from West Texas, flying in the capsule as an “honored guest.” She will join Jeff Bezos, his brother and the winner of a $28 million charity auction, as the first people to ride a New Shepard rocket. At 82, Funk will be the oldest person ever to travel into space, Blue Origin said in an announcement on Thursday.Wally Funk said she feels “fabulous” about finally getting the chance to go to space--after six decades of acing astronaut tests but barred because she was a woman. "I didn't think I would ever get to go up," Funk said in a video interview posted on the company's website.Also read | Bezos going into space on July 20, beating ‘space barons’ Musk, Branson to it “I’ll love every second of it. Whoooo! Ha-ha. I can hardly wait. Nothing has ever gotten in my way. They said, ‘Well, you’re a girl, you can’t do that.’ I said, 'Guess what, doesn’t matter what you are. You can still do it if you want to do it and I like to do things that nobody has ever done,” Funk said in an Instagram video posted by Bezos.'It's time'“No one has waited longer. It’s time. Welcome to the crew, Wally,” Bezos, who is stepping down as the chief executive of Amazon on July 5, said via Instagram.Wally Funk will beat the late John Glenn, who set a record at age 77 when flying aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998. Glenn dismissed the idea of women flying in space, shortly after he became the first American to orbit the world in 1962.Also read | Jeff Bezos says Blue Origin will take the first woman to moon’s surfaceFunk at 21 was the youngest of the 13 women who passed the same rigorous physical tests as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in Nasa's program that first sent Americans into space between 1961 and 1963. All of the women passed but they were denied the chance to become astronauts themselves because of their gender. The Russians went on to launch Valentina Tereshkova—the first woman into space—in 1963.Also read | Thousands sign petition to stop Bezos from returning to Earth after space trip“They told me that I had done better and completed the work faster than any of the guys. So I got hold of Nasa four times. I said I want to become an astronaut, but nobody would take me.

Responding to the reports, the United States said that the "dramatic build-up" of Beijing's nuclear arsenal was concerning and called for "practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races -- potentially destabilizing tensions".Also Read | For CCP, the era of seeking strengthThe Washington Post first carried the report with satellite images of around 119 construction sites which mirror China's existing arsenal of nuclear-tipped ballistic missile launch facilities. These photos, obtained and analysed by researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, showed that the construction of these missile silos is already underway at several sites in the desert spanning hundreds of square miles in China's Gansu province.Taking note of the reports, US state department spokesperson Ned Price said that Washington considers this buildup "concerning" and questioned the intent of the People's Republic of China (PRC). "These reports and other developments suggest that the PRC's nuclear arsenal will grow more quickly, and to a higher level than perhaps previously anticipated," Price said while addressing a regular news briefing.Highlighting that the US government is trying to engage other nuclear powers, including Russia, in an agreement prioritising strategic stability, he said that the same rationale also applies to China.Also Read | As CCP celebrates its centenary, Mao’s hydraulic legacy lives onBeijing, on the other hand, has insisted that its military or nuclear arsenal is insignificant compared to that of the United States or Russia and has called for bilateral dialogues on strategic security that respect "equality".Notably, the Pentagon had estimated last year that China's nuclear warhead stockpile was somewhere in "the low 200s" and could double in size with the country's recent push to develop fuel for a new generation of nuclear reactors. The US stockpile of nuclear weapons, in contrast, consisted of around 3,800 warheads, of which 1,357 have already been deployed, a factsheet issued by the US state department stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-show-china-building-over-100-nuclear-missile-silos-us-voices-concern-101625182765642.html

The reports cited the emirates' foreign ministry and the National Emergency, Crisis and Disaster Management Authority as saying that citizens need to comply with all precautionary and preventive measures related to Covid-19 with the start of the travel season.Thursday's order comes after the UAE in June extended the travel ban on passengers from 14 countries until July 21 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority said in a Notice Issued to Airmen (NOTAM) that flights from 14 countries--Liberia, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic Of Congo, Uganda, Zambia, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and South Africa--will remain suspended until 23:59pm of July 21, 2021. Cargo flights, as well as business and charter flights, would be exempted from the restrictions.The UAE also said its citizens must self-isolate in case they test positive for Covid-19 while travelling and follow all instructions, requirements and health protocols applied by their host countries. They will also have to notify the UAE's embassies in their host countries if they get Covid-19.Infected Emiratis will be allowed to return to the UAE after getting the necessary approvals from the relevant authorities in the host country as well as the competent health departments in the UAE and follow all the guidelines and health requirements needed to ensure their safe return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-bans-citizens-from-travelling-to-india-pakistan-other-countries-reports-101625183395351.html
02-07-2021||World||Covid-19 Delta variant: White House to send special teams to hotspots across US||The White House on Thursday said it would send out special teams to hot spots around the United States to combat the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant amid rising case counts in parts of the country where vaccination rates remain low.The speedy US vaccination campaign has dramatically reduced Covid-19 cases among residents. The peak seven-day-average of more than 250,000 cases per day in January fell to around 11,000 in mid-June.But daily cases have since leveled out and in the past week rose about 10% to about 12,500, driven by case increases in the Midwest and Southeast where vaccination rates are low and where the highly contagious Delta variant, first found in India earlier this year, is spreading.White House Covid-19 senior adviser Jeffrey Zients told reporters that "surge response" teams would be ready to speed additional testing supplies and therapeutics to communities that were experiencing increases in Covid-19 cases.More than 180 million people and more than 66% of adults in the United States have received shots, but around 1,000 counties still have vaccination rates below 30%, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said on a Tuesday news call."It is clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable," Walensky said.Nevada and Missouri now have the highest rates of Covid-19 infection, and there have been recent outbreaks in states including Utah, Wyoming and Nebraska, Michael Newshel, a healthcare analyst for Evercore ISI, wrote in a Tuesday analyst note.The more easily transmitted Delta variant is thought to have become the second most prevalent coronavirus variant in the United States, Walensky added.The Delta variant previously contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases in India that resulted in the highest daily deaths in the world. It also prompted the United Kingdom to delay its reopening by one month in June.Recent studies suggest that existing vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant. The protection is strongest in those who received both doses of two-dose shot regimens, such as those made by Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc .Both shots, which have been the mainstays of the United States vaccination campaign, have been shown to be highly effective against the original variant Covid-19 and several newer variants.Zients said the White House is mobilizing federal personnel to assist communities with public health staffing and the CDC will provide assistance in containing potential outbreaks.Zients said that the White House will have exported around 40 million shots by the end of the week to countries including Bangladesh, Ecuador and Taiwan.The Biden administration is planning a 1,000-person Fourth of July celebration on the White House lawn with essential workers and military personnel, partly to celebrate the United States' success in driving down Covid-19 cases."Right now it's an appropriate time to step back and celebrate the progress we've made; at the same time, we've got a lot more work to do," Zients said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-white-house-to-send-special-teams-to-hotspots-across-us-101625170338693.html
02-07-2021||World||US govt warns of dangers of systemic racism in human trafficking report||An annual US State Department report released on Thursday said discriminatory policies perpetuated human trafficking, drawing a link with systemic racism in the United States and abroad for the first time.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in the Trafficking in Persons report that inequities undercut Washington's battle against human trafficking."If we're serious about ending trafficking in persons, we must also work to combat systemic racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination," Blinken said.A State Department official said it was the first time the report drew a connection to systemic racism."We know that talking about these issues in the report is just the beginning and are committed to working with our partners to create and implement plans for how to ground our anti-trafficking response in equity going forward," a senior State Department official said.The United States has been re-examining its treatment of African Americans since nationwide protests last year sparked by the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer.US authorities have also warned of increased threats from white supremacist groups.The report also cited the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on human trafficking, as traffickers capitalized on the pandemic and governments diverted resources to fight the health crisis.The report looked at countries and territories and ranked them into four tiers, downgrading countries such as Ethiopia but upgrading others.ETHIOPIAThe United States faulted Ethiopia for not demonstrating increased efforts to eliminate trafficking.The report highlighted the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region that has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 2 million people and pushed hundreds of thousands to the brink of famine.The report said that since the conflict began in November, international organizations increasingly reported armed actors were responsible for committing human rights abuses and gender-based violence, including potential trafficking crimes.Ethiopians seeking asylum in Sudan were increasingly vulnerable to trafficking and unaccompanied children in the conflict areas may be vulnerable to recruitment by non-state armed groups, the report also warned.BELARUSBelarus was cited for "key achievements" even if, as the report said, resident Alexander Lukashenko’s government did not "fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking."The report made no mention of Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on ongoing protests over his claim of victory in a 2020 presidential election widely seen as being rigged.SAUDI ARABIASaudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, was cited for "making significant efforts" toward eliminating human trafficking, the report said.However, the government failed to meet minimum standards in a number of areas, including fining, jailing and deporting foreign workers for prostitution or immigration violations even though many may have been trafficking victims, the report said.ISRAELThe report said Israel, Washington’s closest Middle Eastern ally, had worked to eliminate human trafficking, but its efforts “were not serious and sustained” compared to the previous reporting period even accounting for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Victim identification policies “sometimes re-traumatized” victims and delayed their access to necessary care, sometimes for years, while the government reduced its overall efforts to investigate, prosecute and convict traffickers, it said.CHINAThe report repeated past charges that China has "a government policy or pattern of widespread forced labor," including through the continued mass arbitrary detention of more than one million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang, where the United States has accused Beijing of committing genocide against the minorities.TURKEYThe United States added Turkey to the list of countries implicated in the use of child soldiers over the past year, placing a NATO ally for the first time in such a list, in a move likely to further complicate fraught ties between Ankara and Washington.MALAYSIAThe State Department downgraded Malaysia to the worst ranking after a string of complaints by rights groups and US authorities over the alleged exploitation of migrant workers in plantations and factories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-warns-of-dangers-of-systemic-racism-in-human-trafficking-report-101625168415435.html

02-07-2021||India||Covid-19: Centre rushes teams to 6 states with 36% cases||The Union government has rushed expert teams to six states showing an increase in Covid-19 cases of late, the health ministry said on Friday, and top officials reiterated warnings that the second wave has not receded fully and that states must bring back restrictions if infection or hospitalisation trends cross certain thresholds.The warnings come at a time when cities have recorded increased rush at markets and places of business as lockdowns are lifted. Friday’s announcements identified six states where “localised” pockets are causing concern: Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe six states together accounted for, on average, 36% of the daily cases seen across the country over the seven days to Thursday, with Kerala alone accounting for 26%, or 11,815 new infections a day. The seven-day daily case numbers of the other five states are: Arunachal (279 cases a day), Tripura (389), Odisha (3,184), Chhattisgarh (357), and Manipur (590). As of Thursday night, these six states also accounted for 29% of the 516,378 active cases in the country.“There are 71 districts that are showing a test positivity rate of over 10%... The second wave is still not over,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, at the government’s press briefing on Covid-19 on Friday.The official added that states have been asked to identify locations where the test positivity rate is above 10% or hospital occupancy is higher than 60%, and implement strict restrictions which should be in place for at least two weeks.Aggarwal’s caution was echoed by Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul, who said that outbreaks must now be nipped as soon as possible. “There still are certain problematic districts that are being closely monitored. Expert teams of the health ministry have been deployed in some of these states such as Kerala, Odisha, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, etc. The pockets of outbreak that are currently visible, those need to be nipped right there as these are in localised pockets at the moment. We do not allow it to spread further,” he said.The teams sent to each state comprise two members – a clinician and a public health expert. They will assess the overall management of Covid-19, particularly testing, surveillance and containment operations, and monitor the enforcement of Covid-safe behaviour among the public.The teams will also take stock of availability of hospital beds, and of logistics such as ambulances, ventilators, and medical oxygen. They will assess the Covid-19 vaccination speed and as a whole, suggest remedial actions, the health ministry said in a statement.An analysis of case numbers from the six states identified by the government suggest that as a whole, most of these regions are not particularly logging a resurgence, but that the problem may be in particular districts.According to the University of Michigan-led COV-IND-19 Study Group, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland (not identified as one of the six states), have an effective reproduction number (R) of more than 1 – which suggests the outbreak in these regions is growing.No other state reported an R number above 1. Kerala and Maharashtra have an effective R number of 0.97 and 0.96, but the latter has recorded a consistently high test positivity rate of around 10% -- this proportion should be below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control.Officials said that of particular concern were some pockets in the northeastern states. “Certain north-eastern states are showing increase in case load and containment is important in these states as there are many hard to reach areas in these states where health care delivery system is not as strong. Therefore, it is important to stop the spread before it grows beyond control,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named.Paul said close monitoring is crucial at this stage and the country “cannot lower its guard”. “As we are seeing in Europe right now, the disease transmission has started growing again, with cases having dropped to 50 per million at one point, which is now almost double,” he said.“It is in our control to ensure India doesn’t see the third wave. Even though we are fully prepared for the third wave— in rural areas, for children, overall facilities such as beds, ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, medicines, containment strategies, testing, all these preparations are in place -- our disciplined behavior will eventually decide whether a third wave will come or not,” said Paul.Experts said that along with vaccination, the behavior of people will be the key to stop the virus in its tracks. “Covid appropriate behavioural changes are required to be made in a big way; it will be crucial. Vaccination is important but since vaccinating everyone will take a lot of time, people will need to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behavior to stop the outbreak,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-centre-rushes-teams-to-6-states-with-36-cases-101625250135419.html

Tharoor has consistently denied all charges, calling them “preposterous and motivated”.On May 14, 2018, Tharoor had tweeted: “I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet & intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part... If this is conclusion arrived at after 4+ yrs of investigation it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police.”Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, had argued that no case of abetment to suicide is made out against his client. Pahwa had told the court that doctors have not been able to ascertain the cause of death or establish whether Pushkar had indeed died by suicide and, hence, the case of abetment to suicide against Tharoor was nothing but “a figment of imagination of the police”.He had earlier said the post-mortem examination and other medical reports have allegedly established that it was neither a suicide nor homicide. He had also said that during the course of the investigation, there have been many reports by experts before the investigating officer (IO), but there was “no definite opinion on the cause of death” in any of them.Tharoor, a former union minister who is currently on bail in the case, was chargesheeted by Delhi Police under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava claimed that Pushkar has undergone mental cruelty which led to her bad health. He also argued that it was not an accidental death and relied on the post-mortem report which suggests that the cause of death is poisoning which could be oral or injected.The prosecutor further added that Pushkar was not facing any health issue earlier but problems began due to “stress and betrayal”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunanda-pushkar-death-court-defers-framing-of-charges-against-tharoor-for-third-time-101625249150382.html

Meanwhile, police were trying to ascertain the identities of the deceased.This is the second reported accident in the district over the past one week. On June 30, four people, including a child and two women, were killed and four others were injured when a vehicle carrying labourers from Chhattisgarh to Srinagar from Jammu plunged into a gorge near Khooni Nallah.Police said the labourers were going to Srinagar to work in brick kilns.In May last, three separate mishaps killed at least three persons and four others were injured in the Ramban district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-condoles-death-of-five-people-in-road-accident-in-j-k-s-ramban-101625246590667.html

Last week’s WMCC meeting saw a “frank exchange of views” on the situation along the LAC in the western sector.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing that the two countries had agreed at the 22nd meeting of WMCC to “maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military mechanisms to reach a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points” in the Ladakh sector.Complete disengagement alone will “enable full restoration of peace and tranquillity” and progress in bilateral relations, he added.“The two sides also agreed to hold the 12th round of senior commanders meeting at an early date. I don’t have any update on the date for this meeting, which is yet to be fixed,” Bagchi said.India and China also agreed during the last WMCC meeting that the two sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and prevent any untoward incident, he said.Following a drawdown of troops and armoured units from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, India and China haven’t made any headway on disengagement and de-escalation at other friction points such as Depsang, Gogra and Hot Springs.The two sides also recently engaged in a war of words, blaming each other for the year-long standoff on the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/date-yet-to-be-fixed-for-next-india-china-military-commanders-meeting-101625245972807.html
02-07-2021||India||Tirath Singh Rawat’s missing request to EC on bypoll fuels buzz in Uttarakhand||New Delhi: Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat or the state government have not petitioned the election commission to hold by-elections to allow the chief minister who is not a member of the state legislature to become a member of the house, said people aware of the developments.A chief minister who is not a member of the legislative assembly or the legislative council has to be elected to either House within six months of assuming office. Since Uttarakhand does not have a legislative council, Rawat who was appointed in March, has till September to get elected to the assembly.Since the term of the assembly ends in March 2022, a person familiar with the election commission’s working said the poll panel may not ordinarily hold by-elections unless there is a special request.“The election commission can hold by-elections even if general elections are less than a year away. There is no rule barring it. But in case there is a situation like in Uttarakhand where the CM’s continuation in office depends on the bypoll, they have to petition the EC, which will then take a call when to hold elections,” said a person aware of the details.A second person said this request can be made by either the state government or the chief minister on the grounds that it is necessary for them to meet the constitutional requirements.No such petition has been received so far, the person cited above said.The EC will need a month’s time to notify and conduct the elections, said the person.A similar situation had arisen in 2020 when Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had to be elected to either the assembly or the legislative council. Since elections were put on hold owing to the coronavirus pandemic, there was pressure from the state government to relax the restrictions to allow the elections.Thackeray who was eventually elected unopposed even called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek his intervention. Earlier, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari had not acted on the state cabinet’s recommendation that Thackeray be nominated to the legislative council.BJP functionaries did not respond to requests for their response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirath-singh-rawat-s-missing-request-to-ec-on-bypoll-fuels-buzz-in-uttarakhand-101625245790727.html
02-07-2021||India||Maldives says false news reports could affect ties with India||The Maldives on Friday said articles in the local media levelling false accusations against the Indian mission and its staff could affect long-standing friendly relations between the two sides, and that it is responsible for providing security to all foreign diplomats.The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) too expressed deep concern over what it described as “disparaging and ill-founded remarks about Indian diplomats” in recent reports by Dhiyares, an online news outlet. The reaction from the ruling party and the foreign ministry followed the Indian high commission sending a letter to the Maldivian foreign ministry last Thursday to complain about malicious local media reports targeting the mission and its personnel. The Indian side sought an investigation into the media reports and additional protection for diplomats and the high commission.Asked about the matter at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi noted that both the Maldivian foreign ministry and the ruling party had issued statements on the issue.Without naming India, the Maldivian foreign ministry said in a statement in Dhivehi that it had taken note of articles “published repeatedly on local media, levelling false accusations at foreign ambassadors, missions and diplomats in the Maldives”. “These actions affect the decades-long friendly relations the Maldives has maintained with friendly nations, and create hatred among the local population towards these friendly nations. This also puts the diplomats’ lives in danger and hinders their diplomatic work,” the statement said. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 stipulates immunities and privileges bestowed on diplomats, and the Maldives government is responsible for providing security to diplomats, their residences and missions. The foreign ministry asked the local media to respect international conventions and to “report in a manner that does not affect the relations between the Maldives and other countries”.The MDP was more direct in its criticism of recent reports in Dhiyares, and urged the website and its co-founder Ahmed Azaan to “refrain from dragging in the Maldives’ diplomatic partners and allies into their own political petty vendettas”. The website’s “continuous barrage of anti-India vitriol appears to be a well-funded, well-orchestrated and premeditated political campaign with the express purpose of whipping up hatred against the Maldives’ closest ally, India”, MDP said in a statement.“Such campaigns of hatred carry real security concerns for the safety and security of diplomats in our country,” MDP added.The Maldives’ Speaker Mohamed Nasheed on Friday called for an end to the spreading of hostility against India by those opposed to the government and MDP. He tweeted that “hostile” and “disrespectful” rhetoric was being spread against India in the Maldives.Dhiyares and its sister news outlet, The Maldives Journal, have carried articles with unsubstantiated allegations against Indian diplomats in recent days. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there had been a concerted anti-India campaign in the Indian Ocean archipelago since the two sides signed an agreement in February to develop, support and maintain the Coast Guard harbour in Uthuru Thila Falhu, a key naval facility.The Maldives doesn’t have a navy and the Coast Guard functions as the armed maritime component of the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF). There is strong maritime cooperation between the two countries, and in the past, New Delhi has provided patrol vessels and surveillance aircraft to the MNDF. India will support the development of the harbour, dockyard, other infrastructure, communications resources and radar services at Uthuru Thila Falhu and train Maldivian personnel. However, MNDF officials have made it clear that no foreign military personnel would be stationed at the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maldives-says-false-news-reports-could-affect-ties-with-india-101625243992757.html

02-07-2021||India||‘False, mischievous': India on reports claiming Jaishankar met Taliban leaders||The Indian government on Friday denied the claims that suggested Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar met Taliban leaders during his stopover in Doha. In a weekly briefing, external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said such reports are "false and mischievous.""We categorically deny reports based on tweets by some journalists that EAM has met any Taliban leader," Bagchi also said.Earlier this month, the foreign minister travelled to Kenya. During the trip, Jaishankar made a surprise stopover in Doha, where he met some officials, including the Qatari National Security Adviser.The meeting was held in the backdrop of the US pulling out its troops from Afghanistan amid the peace deal between the south Asian country's government and the Taliban insurgents.There was no prior announcement about the foreign minister’s transit halt in Qatar, which has played a crucial role in US-Taliban negotiations in recent years, and no official word from both countries on the meeting between Jaishankar and Qatari NSA Mohamed Bin Ahmed Al Mesned.Following the meeting, many speculated that Jaishankar also met Taliban leaders who assured the foreign minister that the outfit's future relations with India will not be based on Pakistan's wishes. The speculations were further fuelled after senior Qatari officials held separate meetings with Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, and a team of Taliban negotiators.In the UNSC Debate on the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan last week, Jaishankar had called for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure reduction in violence in Afghanistan and said that terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries must be dismantled immediately for enduring peace in the war-torn country.Jaishankar had also said there needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terror acts.He had said it is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country and those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/false-and-mischievous-india-on-reports-claiming-jaishankar-met-taliban-leader-101625239310508.html
02-07-2021||India||'Treat vaccinated Indians on par with those inoculated in EU states': India||India on Friday said it expects its vaccinated citizens to be treated on par with those inoculated in the European Union (EU) states, and the recognition of its digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates by the 27-member bloc on a reciprocal basis.The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at a weekly news briefing came against the backdrop of 10 European countries, including eight EU members, recognising the Covishield vaccine for proof of Covid-19 vaccination for travel.Referring to the EU Digital Covid Certificate or “green pass” introduced on July 1 for exempting vaccinated people from restrictions on movement, Bagchi said, “Our expectation is that Indians who have been vaccinated through our domestic vaccination programme would be treated at par with those vaccinated in the EU and the CoWIN vaccination certificate would be recognised by the EU on a reciprocal basis.”Bagchi said India’s digital vaccination certificates can be authenticated on the CoWIN website. “We are in touch with EU member states in this regard for reciprocal acceptance. I understand that a number of EU countries have already taken positive steps in this direction,” he added.A large number of Indian students who have gained admission to educational institutions in Europe, as well as professionals, are keen to travel so that they can join classes or resume work. Questions have arisen about their ability to travel as Covishield hasn’t been approved as yet by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Covaxin is yet to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).EU member states, however, have the option of accepting vaccines that have been approved by the WHO or national authorities.Currently, EU members Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain, Iceland and Switzerland, which aren’t in the bloc but are part of the Schengen visa regime, recognise Covishield for travel purposes.Of the EU members, only Estonia recognises both Covishield and Covaxin, the two main jabs used for India’s vaccination programme.The Indian side has informed EU member states it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the green pass from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc recognises Covishield and Covaxin.Travel between India and Europe continues to be tightly restricted. For example, India is on the Netherlands’ list of “very high risk” areas from where travel is barred. Of the 10 European countries that recognise Covishield, India has an air bubble arrangement only with Germany, which has emerged as a key transit hub for Indian nationals.In response to other questions at the briefing, Bagchi said the government is making all efforts to augment the availability of vaccines across the country through domestic production and imports. The status of imports of specific vaccines depends on the regulatory authorities, he added.Bagchi also ruled out any immediate resumption of vaccine exports, saying, “Let me reiterate that currently, our priority remains on purposing domestic production to our domestic vaccination programme, which as you know, is progressing rapidly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinated-citizens-be-treated-at-par-with-those-inoculated-in-eu-states-mea-101625238263920.html
02-07-2021||India||Lakshadweep admin orders education dept officials in Kochi to shift to islands||The Lakshadweep administration on Friday ordered the officials of the education department in Kochi to shift to the islands. The Directorate of Education of Lakshadweep administration also asked its education officer in Kochi to shift all the office materials like electronic equipment, furniture and files dealt by five of its staff from Kochi to the islands. The Lakshadweep administration has an office in Kochi from which several departments operate.Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal PP criticised the decision saying that it will adversely impact around 4,000 students from the islands who are studying at various educational institutions in Kerala and also said that the order will be challenged in the court. The order asked the officials which include accountant, a stenographer, two clerical staff and a MSE to shift ‘consequent upon the decision to rationalise the staff of the Education Office, Kochi.’ The education officer in Kochi has been asked to relieve the officials with direction to report before director of education Rakesh Singhal Danics in seven days.“With the new decision, the students studying in Thiruvananthapuram or other parts of India now need to travel to Lakshadweep to solve their problems. Otherwise, they would only need to travel to Kochi to meet their education and resolve their issues and go back,” Mohammed Faizal PP was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Faizal said that the administration’s education office has been functioning from Kochi since the last three years and was set up for easy access for the needs of students studying in the mainland.Faizal also termed the move as an ‘unwanted action’. He also alleged that the island administrator Praful Khoda Patel took the decision unilaterally without any discussion with representatives of the people in the islands or even the standing committee on education of the Lakshadweep district panchayat.The island continues to witness protests by residents from the past month against Praful Khoda Patel’s reforms. The residents claim that measures are being implemented without taking the people of the islands into consideration. The Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF) said that the protests will continue until the administration withdraws the measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-admin-orders-education-dept-officials-in-kochi-to-shift-to-islands-101625237742758.html

Speaking at the daily briefing of the Union health ministry over the Covid-19 situation in the country, Paul said, "We are not safe until the entire nation is safe."He also said that the central teams have been sent to several states that are still reporting an alarming surge in cases. The Centre on Friday sent multi-disciplinary teams to six states - Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur - that are reporting a high number of cases. The two-member team comprised a clinician and a public health expert.On the threat of a possible third wave, Paul said, "it is not in our hands." "We must have all the preparation regarding infrastructure in rural areas, arrangement for children, ICU beds, medicines etc," he added.He further said that the government is attempting to "stall any new outbreak" and if people act responsibly and follow all the Covid-19 norms, "then this wave will not come."Speaking on the vaccination drive and the future supply of the jabs, Paul said, "The projection that 216 crore doses would be available from August-December was an optimistic, aspirational projection based on what our manufacturers had told us."Paul also informed that the number of total cases of Delta plus mutation in the country have risen to 56 across the 12 states.India saw a single-day rise of 46,617 new coronavirus infections, taking the tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,04,58,251, while the national recovery rate has crossed 97%, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-of-covid-19-not-over-yet-cautions-niti-aayog-s-vk-paul-101625237521834.html
02-07-2021||India||'Over 30 mn takedowns, most for violent content': FB's first report under new rules||From violent and graphic content, followed by adult nudity and sexual activity to suicide and self-injury content, Facebook removed nearly 30.1 million URLs, including posts, profiles and pages, according to its first monthly interim compliance report (from May 15-June 15) published by the social media giant under the new social media and intermediary rules on July 2.Also Read: Facebook to release its first compliance report in JulyAccording to the interim report published by the company on its transparency platform, Facebook’s automated and removal of such posts was pegged at over 95% for all the 10 categories. The detailed report regarding action taken for public grievances, mandated under the contentious new guidelines challenged by Facebook-owned WhatsApp for its traceability clause, is expected to get published on July 15.The social media firm removed 2.5 million counts of violent and graphic content, at a 99.9% proactive rate, which means that the content that had to be reported by users was less than 0.1%. Proactive removal translates into the automated removal of content.As for adult nudity and sexual activity, a point stressed under the new rules with a 24-hour takedown requirement, the company actioned 1.8 million counts at a 99.6% proactive rate. According to people familiar with the matter, the number of counts of actioned content includes pages, profiles and posts. Actioned content includes pages, posts, profiles, posts, et cetera, against which an action is taken.“Facebook’s India specific numbers are more detailed than offered to other countries,” a person familiar with the matter said. "The list of categories is not exhaustiveAccording to the social media firm’s last quarter transparency report, from January 2021 to March 2021, it actioned 31.8 million URLs for adult nudity, while in India the number stood at 1.8 million for the month. In terms of graphic and violent content, the company took down 34.3 million posts, pages and profiles, with India’s number for May 15 to June 15 being 2.5 million.The other actioned content includes spam, 25 million counts of which were removed, dangerous organizations and individuals, organized hate wherein 75,000 such URLs were taken down.Nearly 106,000 profiles, pages and posts were actioned for being terrorist propaganda, while nearly 311,000 hate speech URLs were also taken down.Instagram, on the other hand, removed nearly 2,031,300 URLs. Suicide and self-injury was the most actioned category with nearly 699,000 takedowns, followed by violent and graphic content at 668,000 removals and adult nudity and sexual activity at 490,000.The report concerning removals pertaining to user complaints will be generated by July 15 by the social media company, including for its messaging service WhatsApp. The compliance officers, grievance redressal officer and nodal officer for Facebook and Instagram are the same, while WhatsApp has appointed different people.“Over the years, we have consistently invested in technology, people and processes to further our agenda of keeping our users safe and secure online and enable them to express themselves freely on our platform. We use a combination of Artificial Intelligence, reports from our community and review by our teams to identify and review content against our policies. We’ll continue to add more information and build on these efforts towards transparency as we evolve this report,” a Facebook spokesperson said.Facebook is the second global tech giant after Google to publish a monthly report in keeping with the new rules. The new guidelines also seek additional safeguards from significant social media intermediaries, which have 5 million users or more, to expedite their automated removal process in order to action violative content more promptly. At Facebook, the removal process is three-tier, it can involve a user complaint, automated removal, which is followed by a human review to ensure that content actioned is for the right reasons, people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile, Google on June 30 said it actioned nearly 60,000 pieces of content in April, mostly for copyright infringement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-30-mn-takedowns-most-for-violent-content-fb-s-first-report-under-new-rules-101625237156254.html
02-07-2021||India||Theaterisation of Armed Forces: Decoding the new approach to defence||Theaterisation of the Indian armed forces could involve a significant departure from the current arrangement, a change that experts say is crucial to fighting future wars.What is theaterisation?It is a concept that seeks to integrate the capabilities of the three services -- army, air force and navy -- and optimally utilise their resources for wars and operations. Specific theatre commands – or units – will be placed under the Theatre Commander. Such commands are expected to come under the operational control of an officer from any of the three services, depending on the function assigned.What will it entail?The current theaterisation model under consideration seeks to set up at least six new integrated commands.The first phase involves the creation of Air Defence Command and Maritime Theatre Command.Air Defence Command: This will control air defence resources of all three services and will be tasked with protecting military assets from airborne enemies. It will be headed by a top three-star Indian Air Force officer based in Prayagraj.Maritime Theatre Command: This will be responsible for securing India from seaborne threats and will have army and air force elements. It will be headed by a top three-star Indian Navy officer and will be based in Karwar, Karnataka.Ultimately, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts. Additionally, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.How many commands does the military currently have?The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country’s geography. The Army has 7 commands, IAF has 7 commands and the Navy, 3 commands.Creating theatres would involve merging existing commands. The Port Blair-based Andaman and Nicobar Command is the only tri-service command.Who is responsible for theaterisation?India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has been given the mandate to steer the theaterisation drive. The government expects Rawat, who took charge as CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about an integration of the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the steps to do it involves theaterisation in not just operations and logistics but also transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance.What is the current status?A lack of consensus on the military’s theaterisation model emerged earlier this month during a key meeting of top government officials reviewing a draft cabinet note on the new joint structures. This led to the government setting up an expert committee last week for consultations and to remove differences before the reform plan is sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security for approval. The panel has members of the armed forces, defence ministry and other ministries (finance and home).Who has reservations about the current model?While the army and navy are in favour of theatre commands, the IAF has concerns about the model over the division of its air assets, the nomenclature of commands, the leadership of theatre commands and dilution of powers of chiefs. The IAF’s traditional resistance to theaterisation is well-known and has been articulated by its top leadership. The expert committee is expected to hold more discussions to iron out the details of the theaterisation plan and bring all stakeholders, especially the IAF, on board. Deliberations on the proposal are likely to take more time and previous timelines may have to be revised.How will the role of service chiefs change?The operational control of the theatre commands will eventually come under the CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces. CDS Bipin Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister. CDS is expected to have operational control over all integrated commands when they are fully functional -- this will be in his role as CDS, and not as permanent chairman, COSC.Which other militaries have theatre commands?Most leading militaries, including those of the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France, function as per the theatre command concept with the idea of seamless integration among the land, sea and air forces for better coordination and response. The US military, the world’s most powerful, has 11 combatant commands, each with a geographic or functional mission. Similarly, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands -- eastern, southern, western, northern and central, with its western theatre handling the entire border with India. Pakistan has sought Beijing’s help to reorganise its forces under the same military concept.What is CDS’s assessment of progress made on theaterisation?CDS Bipin Rawat on June 22 said new reforms do face hurdles, but the three services are in agreement on taking theaterisation forward. He said hurdles are necessary as they underscore the need for holding more discussions to fine-tune plans. According to him, the creation of theatre commands is progressing in line with the prescribed timelines for bringing about jointness among the three services. In March, he said “service parochialism” will have to make way for “a combined services outlook” to take theaterisation forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theaterisation-of-armed-forces-decoding-the-new-approach-to-defence-101625236673690.html

Their vaccine is being produced outside,” Paul said.The NITI Aayog member also informed reporters that the vaccine will be produced at Indian biopharmaceutical company Biological E (Bio E), based out of Hyderabad. “As per the plan, this vaccine will also be produced in Hyderabad's Biological E.”Johnson and Johnson recently announced that their vaccine generates a strong and persistent response activity against the new Delta coronavirus variant and also against other highly prevalent SARS-CoV-2 viral strains. Adding that the vaccine was far more effective in neutralising Delta variants than it was in fighting Beta variants.Also Read: Covid in India: 100 million doses of J&J vaccine likely to be procured from EU"We believe that our vaccine offers durable protection against Covid-19 and elicits neutralizing activity against the Delta variant. This adds to the robust body of clinical data supporting our single-shot vaccine's ability to protect against multiple variants of concern," said Paul Stoffels, managing director, at Johnson and Johnson.As per the latest data collected so far on the shot, the immune response induced by the J&J vaccine has lasted for eight months "Current data for the eight months studied so far show that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time. In addition, we observe a persistent and particularly robust, durable cellular immune response."India has approved four vaccines so far, including two foreign made vaccines-Moderna and Sputnik V. The newly emerging Delta plus variant has been a cause of concern for experts around the world. India has so far recorded 56 cases in 12 states, the government said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-in-talks-with-johnson-johnson-for-its-single-dose-vaccine-101625231367335.html

But in the affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the government reduced the estimate and brought it to 135 crore vaccine doses."When we proposed the estimate of 216 crore vaccines between August and December this year, we clearly said that we collated the figures that our vaccine makers gave us according to their responsible, optimistic and aspirational roadmap. The private sector is very influential in India; they have such a major contribution to the GDP. They are reputed vaccine-maker conglomerates. We collated what they showed," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.Took back charge of vaccine drive on states’ request: CentreThe government is responsible for the procurement of vaccines which has been fixed as 75 per cent of the monthly production of vaccines.In its earlier estimate of 216 crore vaccine doses, the government took into account the future availability of Biological E, Zydus Cadila's vaccine, Novavax and Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccines. But as far as the main vaccine makers - Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech -- are concerned, at present 90 crore vaccine doses are estimated from each, Dr Paul said. This can also go up."The situation is dynamic but satisfactory," Dr Paul said.Following the reduction in the number of projected availability of vaccines, it was alleged that the two vaccine makers may not have met their monthly production target. Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla said his company is producing 90 million doses a month which may see a 10 per cent increase in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/216-crore-or-135-crore-centre-clarifies-number-of-vaccine-doses-to-be-available-101625229916900.html

He said the lull in monsoon activity stretched longer than expected.The rain-bearing system also replenishes more than 80 nationally important reservoirs, critical for drinking, power supply, and irrigation.Also Read: Capturing Delhi’s unusual weather patterns this summerThe country is counting on farm output to cushion some of the economic impacts of a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections. In 2020-21, when India faced a recession due to the pandemic, agriculture was the only sector to record positive growth of about 3.1%. This helped to prop up the rural economy.“In the first week of July, monsoon will remain weak, it will pick up in the second week of July and return to normal by the third week of July,” Mohapatra said. The rains started on a promising note, arriving in Kerala, their first port of call in the Indian mainland, on June 3.From an agriculture point of view, July rainfall is the most critical, said Jeet Singh Sandhu, vice-chancellor of the SKN Agricultural University, Jaipur. “This is the prime time of sowing. Most Kharif crops have to be sown by July 15-20. We have another 15 days. So, at present, I don’t think there’s worry. But in areas where irrigation is not available, there will be an impact,” Sandhu added.The Met department has forecast a normal monsoon for the country as a whole for the third straight year, saying rainfall would be 98% of the 50-year average. According to the IMD’s classification, rains are considered normal if they are between 96% and 104%.Also Read: The monsoon is on a break. What it really meansThe Met chief said the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a global weather pattern that influences India’s monsoon, had not been favourable for a while. He added there were strong westerlies, or winds blowing in from the west, and a decrease in low-pressure formations, factors that lengthened the monsoon pause.An agriculture ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no reason for any concern at this stage. “Pre-monsoon showers were good, so moisture levels (in soil) are good. Rains will revive soon. There is nothing to worry about,” the official said.Farmers in the food bowl states of Punjab and Haryana have come under pressure due to a lack of rain. Electricity demand has soared, resulting in long outages, forcing farmers to depend on costlier diesel to irrigate lands. “The main impact so far has been that farmers’ cost of cultivation has gone up,” said Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Punjab’s agriculture commissioner.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered government officials to curtail office timings and curb supply to certain industries with high power consumption to save crops, an official statement said.Millions of farmers rely on the monsoon to plant crops such as rice, cane, corn, soybeans, cotton, nuts, and lentils.The dry spell has triggered a heatwave across much of north India, with Punjab facing a power crisis.Nearly 32 farm unions protesting three new farm laws have asked the Punjab government to ensure farms get at least eight hours of supply by July 5, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm union leader.According to official data, power demand shot up to a new high on June 30, touching 191.24 gigawatts (GW), higher than the previous peak demand of 189.64 GW on January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-spell-amid-sowing-a-worry-but-rains-will-revive-met-chief-101625230069328.html
02-07-2021||India||Health ministry allows Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women||The Union health and family welfare ministry on Friday extended the vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to pregnant women. Acting on the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's (NTAGI) recommendations, the health ministry said that pregnant women can register themselves for the jab on government-run CoWin portal. They are also eligible for walk-ins to the nearest Covid-19 Vaccination Centre (CVC).This comes days after Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the health ministry said that the NTAGI has recommended that the vaccination is safe for pregnant women.Meanwhile, the cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country crossed 34-crore on Friday, the Centre announced in a daily bulletin.As per the release, a total of 9,41,03,985 people in the age group of 18-44 across all states and Union territories have received their first dose and 22,73,477 received the second dose.The data showed that 34,00,76,232 vaccine doses were administered as per the provisional report till 7am, with over 42 lakh (42,64,123) doses being given in a span of 24 hours.Earlier on June 29, the health ministry issued guidelines for administering the Covid-19 vaccine to pregnant women. In the advisory, the ministry said, "after getting the vaccine injection, she can get a mild fever, pain at the injection site or feel unwell for 1-3 days. As per the advisory, they get the jab at any time during their pregnancy.The Union health ministry also said, "most pregnant women will be asymptomatic or have a mild disease, but their health may deteriorate rapidly and that might affect the foetus too." "It is important that they take all precautions to protect themselves from acquiring Covid-19, including taking vaccination against Covid-19. It is therefore advised that a pregnant woman should take Covid-19 vaccines," it added in the advisory.On side effects post vaccination, the ministry said that they can experience mild discomfort in their body. One may also experience soreness at the vaccinated spot accompanied with chills and slight fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-allows-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-women-101625228783485.html
02-07-2021||India||Hot and humid days ahead in NW India||Swathes of northwest India are facing a heatwave with most places in West Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab recording maximum temperatures of over 40 degrees C (°C). On Thursday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 43.1°C, 6.3°C above normal. Heatwave conditions are likely to abate gradually from Saturday. But heat-related discomfort will stay, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The wind direction was westerly and south-westerly. It was blowing mainly from the dry regions of Pakistan. The wind will blow from further south-westerly direction bringing moisture from the Arabian Sea.“Heatwave intensity and spatial coverage will reduce due to southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea. However, due to an increase in humidity in association with these winds, the human discomfort will continue during the next seven days,” M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said on Thursday.Also Read | Capturing Delhi’s unusual weather patterns this summerK Sathi Devi, who heads the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said the wind direction has started changing in lower levels as per their models. “Moisture incursion has started. There is a lot of heat in this region and when moisture-laden winds start blowing, there will be thunderstorm activity. We can expect some thunder and rain but that is not the monsoon. When humidity increases with heat obviously moist air will make it uncomfortable, but heat intensity will also reduce.”Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather, said the winds from the Arabian Sea will bring moisture and cause thunderstorms and some light pre-monsoon showers for five to six days. “The monsoon trough will move southwards from the foothills after a week or so. We can expect monsoon to set in over this region after that. There will be some relief from extreme heat due to the change in wind direction.”The northern limit of the southwest monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala, and Amritsar. It has been there since June 19.“Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during next five to six days,” IMD said in its Friday bulletin. It added subdued rainfall activity was very likely to continue to prevail over the northwest, central, and western parts of Peninsular India during the next five to six days.IMD said isolated/scattered thunderstorm activity accompanied with lightning and rainfall is also likely over these regions during this period. Under the influence of strong moist southwesterly winds at lower tropospheric levels from the Bay of Bengal to the northeast and adjoining east India and a trough (area of low pressure) at mean sea level from northwest Rajasthan to east Assam, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall is very likely in Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya during the next five days.IMD said moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning are very likely in Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, and Chhattisgarh during the next 24 hours.Dilip Malvankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, said there are two important things happening this time. “This is not the heatwave season. Heatwaves normally end by mid-June. It is very late this time. Secondly, if the humidity goes up, the heat index (an index that combines air temperature and humidity) also goes up which is a huge risk for old and co-morbid people. Desert coolers will not work. It is best if people working outdoors have staggered work hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hot-and-humid-days-ahead-in-nw-india-101625228809297.html

Gogoi said the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court’s verdict will serve as a milestone for all those arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the NIA Act."My case proves the gross misuse of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the NIA Act. The verdict will be a milestone for those arrested through the misuse of the two legislations," the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act activist was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Gogoi, who has served 567 days in prison for his role in the anti-CAA agitation in Assam, said the investigative agency wanted to connect him to a 2013 case but were unable to because the court verdict was already out. "Even on Thursday, the NIA wanted to slap a fresh case but by the time they reached the court with the appeal, the verdict was already out," he said.Also Read: Offered bail by NIA for joining RSS, BJP, says jailed Assam activist Akhil Gogoi"When they took me into custody, their only question was whether I would join the RSS. Not once had they asked anything about my alleged links with Maoists. My CIO D R Singh never spoke about red rebels before me. He said that if I joined the RSS, I would be released in 10 days,” Gogoi stated"When I replied in negative, he offered me to join the BJP and become a minister. I refused that too. He then said that I would be jailed for 10 years," he added.The Raijor Dal chief was arrested on December 12, 2019, from Jorhat, at the height of the anti-CAA protests in Assam, as a "preventive measure" keeping in view the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. His three associates Jagajit Gohain, Bhupen Gogoi, and Bhaskarjit Phukan were also arrested the next day. Their cases were later handed over to NIA and they were booked under the stringent UAPA for their alleged role in the violent protests and possible Maoists links.Special NIA judge Pranjal Das ruled that his speeches did not abet violent activities and dismissed all charges against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhil-gogoi-on-his-release-pressure-of-executive-is-not-permanent-101625227306043.html
02-07-2021||India||2 doses of Covid vaccine provide 98 per cent protection from death, says Govt, citing Punjab study||Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul on Friday said both doses of vaccines provide at least 98 per cent protection from Covid-19 death, citing a study done by the Post Graduate Institue of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh in association with the Punjab government. A real-life study has been conducted on police personnel of the state."The study is very simple. 4,868 police personnel were not vaccinated and out of them, 15 died of Covid-19, which translates to 3.08 per thousand," Dr Paul said.Out of 35,856 police personnel who received one dose of the vaccine, nine died, which translates to 0.25 per thousand.A total of 42,720 police personnel received both doses of the vaccine and 2 among them died, which translates to 0.05 per thousand."When we interpret these numbers, we find that one dose offers 92 protection from death while both doses offer a protection of 98 per cent," Dr Paul said adding that the study was done on police personnel as they belong to the high-risk group.As the Centre is claiming to have accelerated the pace of vaccination starting from June 21, experts are studying the real-life efficacy of the vaccines."CMC Vellore's study on healthcare workers too revealed similar efficacy. It is now scientifically established that vaccines are effective in protecting against death. There can be minor illnesses after vaccination, but vaccines eliminate the possibility of serious illness and death. This instils faith in our vaccine. We always talk about other vaccines but these studies reveal that our vaccines in real life are effective against Covid death," Dr Paul said.The study does not include the number of police personnel who got a breakthrough infection after getting vaccinated, Dr Paul said.Commenting on the third wave of Covid-19, Dr Paul said, "That is not in our hand. We must have all the preparation regarding infrastructure in rural areas, arrangement for children, IC beds, medicines etc. But our attempt would be to stall any new outbreak. And if we are disciplined, then this wave will not come."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-doses-of-covid-vaccine-provide-98-per-cent-protection-from-death-says-govt-citing-study-101625225685101.html

02-07-2021||India||India witnessed increase in antibiotic misuse during Covid 1st wave: Study||From June 2020 to September 2020, when the first wave of the pandemic was raging in India, the sales of antibiotics soared and accounted for an additional 216.4 million doses of antibiotics sales, a study conducted by the researchers at Washington University has revealed. Researchers have linked this increase with the pandemic and termed this as 'antibiotic misuse'.Antibiotics are not at all effective for a viral infection like that of Covid-19 as they are only meant to fight bacterial infection, but such antibiotic misuse can actually increase the risk for drug-resistant infections, researchers have said.In the same period of time, 38 million more doses of azithromycin, sometimes prescribed for throat, nose infections, were sold in India, the study revealed.All US-authorised Covid-19 vaccines effective against Delta, Fauci explains whyThe study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, analysed monthly sales of all antibiotics in India's private health sector from January 2018 through December 2020. The data came from an Indian branch of IQVIA, a US-based health information technology company, news agency PTI reported.What is antibiotic misuse?Antibiotic misuse/overuse is the administration of antibiotics when they are not needed. This makes bacteria harder to treat. "Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to global public health," said the study's senior author, Sumanth Gandra, an associate hospital epidemiologist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in the US."Overuse of antibiotics lessens their ability to effectively treat minor injuries and common infections such as pneumonia, which means that these conditions can become serious and deadly," Gandra said, as quoted by PTI.What has the study revealed?According to the study, a total of 16.29 billion doses of antibiotics were sold in India in 2020, which is slightly less than the amounts sold in 2018 and in 2019. But when researchers focused on adult doses, usage increased from 72.6 per cent in 2018 and 72.5 per cent in 2019 to 76.8 per cent in 2020.The sales of azithromycin for adults in India increased from 4 per cent in 2018 and 4.5 per cent in 2019 to 5.9 per cent in 2020. Apart from azithromycin, the sales of doxycycline and faropenem, two antibiotics commonly used to treat respiratory infections, went up.The researchers noted that India also had restrictions and experienced dramatic decreases in malaria, dengue, chikungunya and other infections typically treated with antibiotics, which should have decreased the use of antibiotics.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-witnessed-increase-in-antibiotic-misuse-during-covid-1st-wave-study-101625223365704.html
02-07-2021||India||SC dismisses PIL seeking VK Singh’s removal for comments on China border row||The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking removal of Union minister General (retired) VK Singh over his 'controversial' comments from earlier in the year on the border standoff between India and China.Also Read | ‘Let’s hurt them economically’: General VK Singh on India-China border row"Somebody does not approve of comments made by a minister and so the solution is to file a petition in the Supreme Court to remove them? If he has done something, it is for the Prime Minister to act if it is inappropriate. The court cannot pass any orders," Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, who headed the three-judge bench which heard the case, was quoted as saying by Live Law. Justice AS Bopanna and Justice Hrishikesh Roy were the other two members of the bench.Singh, a former chief of staff of the Indian Army, made the contentious remark in February when he said, "None of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it. Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done so at least 50 times."The PIL against Singh was filed by Tamil Nadu resident Chandrasekaran Ramasamy, who describes himself as a "scientist." On this, the bench said, "It looks like you are a scientist. You should use your abilities to do something for the country. We are dismissing the petition."Pointing to Singh's remark in his petition, Ramasamy alleged that the minister's statement was contradictory to the official stand taken by the Government of India and, in doing so, Singh, the minister of state for transport and highways, "committed a breach of his oath."Reacting to Singh's statement, China, which accuses India of being the "aggressor," had called it an "unwitting confession by the Indian side." India has always maintained that Chinese troops initiated the skirmishes in Ladakh and Sikkim in May last year, which later turned into a protracted standoff between the nuclear armed neighbours across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, which separates the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-pil-seeking-vk-singh-s-removal-for-comments-on-china-border-row-101625216045339.html
02-07-2021||India||SC refuses to stay TN law giving quota to Vanniyar community||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the Tamil Nadu law passed in February 2021 granting 10.5% quota to Vanniyar community among the Most Backward Classes (MBC) even as it agreed to issue a notice to the Tamil Nadu government and tagged it along with similar petitions challenging the same law.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat noticed that petitions challenging the 2021 Act are pending in the top court as well as the Madras high court. In Tamil Nadu, by way of a 1994 law, 20% reservation in jobs and admissions is being provided to MBCs.In February 2021, then AIADMK government passed a law providing for internal reservation within this 20% quota. Among MBCs, this law benefited the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community most as the law allocated 10.5% quota to them. The remaining share of 9.5% was apportioned between Denotified Communities and other MBCs.Senior advocate S Nagamuthu appeared for the petition filed by S Sandeep Kumar questioning the validity of the law. He sought a stay of the law alleging that it was passed for political considerations in a hurried manner without any discussion. Moreover, he pointed out that on December 21, 2020, the state government appointed a one-man judicial committed headed by retired high court judge, justice (Retd) A Kulasekaran, to gather quantifiable data on the identified castes and tribes in the state. This committee is yet to submit its report.The petition filed through advocate P Sriram said, “The impugned Act has been passed without there being any quantifiable data relating to social and educational backwardness of the Vanniyakula Kshatriyas so as to classify the said community as a separate sub-clause within the most backward classes.”Nagamuthu told the court that due to such a law, despite the state having 122 MBCs, all reservation benefits have been cornered by one community. He said that the law was passed on the assumption that the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes Commission made recommendation for separate quota for Vanniyakula Kshatriya community.This was disputed by the petitioner saying, “TN Backward Classes Commission never recommended for separate quota for Vanniyakula Kshatriyas. It was a letter written to the government by justice (Retd) MS Janardhanan, the chairman of the Commission in his individual capacity. The commission had seven other members.The petition also questioned the timing of bringing the law.

He added Gandhi has an “innate hatred against Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, India’s people and that he is blinded by the “falsehood.”Also Read | From Tripura and the Nilgiris, a lesson for India“We all know that since 21 June vaccination drive witnessed a boost in India… and it has already given a protective shield to its 340 million citizens,” he said. Bhatia added India vaccinated over 8.1 million people on July 1.“... 6.2 million people have been vaccinated every 24 hours,” Bhatia said. He asked Gandhi to do some “homework” and see if there is any other nation in the world vaccinating people at such a rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-attacks-rahul-gandhi-over-his-tweet-on-covid-vaccine-101625220648367.html

Here's why“Shri Suvendhu Adhikari did come to my residence cum office yesterday at around 3pm, unannounced. Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room of my office building and offered him a cup of tea. When my meeting was over and my staff informed me about his arrival, I requested my staff to convey to Mr Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait,” Mehta noted in a statement to Hindustan Times.“Mr Adhikari thanked my staff and left without insisting on meeting me. The question of my meeting Mr Adhikari, therefore, does not arise,” the statement further stated.Also Read: Mamata, Ghatak file new request in Calcutta high court ahead of Narada hearingEarlier in the day, the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking “immediate” removal of Mehta from the post of Solicitor General of India. “We strongly condemn Shri Tushar Mehta’s meeting with Shri Suvendu Adhikari, who has been accused of various offences that are currently being investigated. This raises some serious concerns about the integrity of the post held by the Learned Solicitor General,” the official TMC Twitter handle posted.The TMC letter, too, stated that Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, is also an accused in various offences being investigated by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Two such cases are the infamous Narada sting operation case and the Sarada chit fund case, the letter said. “Therefore, the various news reports containing videos of the alleged meeting between Adhikari and Mehta, who is advising such investigating agencies, shows that there is a direct conflict of interest with the statutory duties of the Solicitor General of India,” it noted further.Mehta is representing the CBI in the two cases.The development marks yet another faceoff between the TMC and the BJP in the wake of the bitterly contested West Bengal assembly elections in April-May. The BJP alleges that several of its workers were targeted by TMC after the Banerjee-led party won a third consecutive term. TMC, on the other hand, has dismissed the charge. On May 17, the CBI arrested three TMC leaders, including two cabinet ministers, as well as a former party leader in connection with the Narada case. On May 28, he four were later granted interim bail by the Calcutta high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solicitor-general-tushar-mehta-says-did-not-meet-bjp-s-suvendu-adhikari-101625219856600.html

02-07-2021||India||TMC MPs write to PM Modi, seek removal of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta||Trinamool Congress lawmakers have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, seeking the removal of Tushar Mehta as the Solicitor General (SG) of India. This comes in the wake of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari’s reported meeting with Mehta in the national Capital, a claim that Mehta has denied. The letter, signed by party MPs Derek O’Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mahua Moitra, points out that Adhikari is an accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case and Mehta is representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Supreme Court and Calcutta high court.Also Read | Post-poll violence: Calcutta HC orders Bengal govt to register all casesIt also says that the mastermind of the multi-crore chit Sarada chit fund scam, Sudipta Sen, had written to the authorities levelling “grave allegations” against Adhikari. Mehta has advised and appeared for the CBI in the case. “Such a meeting between an accused in grave offences with the SG, who is advising such agencies by whom the said accused is being investigated, is in direct conflict of interest with the statutory duties of the SG of India,” stated the letter. It also alleged that the meeting was organised to influence the outcome of the matters where Adhikari is an accused, by using high offices of the SG. “In order to avoid any doubt in the mind of the public at large, as to the integrity and neutrality of the office of the SG, we approach you to initiate necessary steps for removal of Tushar Mehta from the post of the SG of India,” the TMC MPs wrote in the letter to PM Modi. The SG later issued a statement denying that said meeting ever took place yesterday. He said, “Shri Suvendu Adhikari did come to my residence cum office yesterday at around 3pm, unannounced. Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room of my office building and offered him a cup of tea. When my meeting was over and thereafter my PPS informed me about his arrival, I requested my PPS to convey Mr Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait. Mr Adhikari thanked my PPS and left without insisting to meet me. The question of my meeting with Mr Adhikari therefore did not arise.”Even though Adhikari could not be contacted, the BJP said that Mehta’s statement should make it clear that the meeting never happened. “There is no proof that Adhikari met the Solicitor General. Mehta has clarified that Adhikari came to meet him but he could not meet the leader as he was busy. Those who are saying that the meeting took place should now substantiate their claims. Adhikari has also said the same thing. The question is how many persons the TMC would like to be removed from posts? They want the Governor to be removed because he is vociferous about the government. Now, they want the SG to be removed. In future, they may want the PM, home minister and even the President to be removed to survive,” said party chief in the state, Dilip GhoshReacting to Mehta’s statement, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who also happens to be the CM’s nephew, said only CCTV footage would reveal whether the meeting happened. “Reports state that Mr Adhikari entered Hon’ble SG’s residence in the presence of a cavalcade of officers and stayed there for nearly 30 minutes. Does that imply that a meeting was indeed due? As the episode gets murkier, one can only hope that the truth shall surface. Mr Mehta’s efforts to dismiss speculations regarding his clandestine meeting with @SuvenduWB can only be valuable if he makes all CCTV footage public until Mr Adhikari was in his residence. Moreover, was Mr Adhikari present in the SG’s residence without prior appointment ?” Banerjee tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mps-write-to-pm-modi-seek-removal-of-solicitor-general-tushar-mehta-101625218608027.html

However, the supply has been erratic,” he said.Among the 17 districts where vaccination is being halted are four districts with high positivity rate - Balasore, Bhadrak, Cuttack and Kendrapara.

02-07-2021||India||No case: CCI closes case against Goa taxi unions over anti-competitive practices||The Competition Commission of India, which in 2018 took up a case on its own against Goa’s taxi unions for allegedly resorting to anti-competitive practices and cartelisation to deny entry to app-based aggregators, closed it on June 22. It cited lack of evidence and said no case was made out for violation of Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 (abuse of dominant position).The regulator took up the case based on newspaper reports. It also cited a change.org petition addressed to the Goa chief minister in 2017 for allowing the app-based taxi aggregator services in the state because of the “dismal state of affairs of public transport”.The Commission in 2018 directed its director-general to investigate the matter and submit a report. In its interim order, the regulator said the “conduct of taxi unions in not allowing any app-based service providers in the State of Goa, was putting a restraint on services based on technology and limiting the competition”.Also Read | Goa moves HC against Tejpal orderThe director-general submitted a report in January 2020, saying there were no fare meters and organised groups of taxi operators in Goa control the rates as well as the routes”. The report added tourists in Goa were being overcharged. It said the government introduced GoaMiles, a taxi smartphone app, “subsidising the taxi fares by almost half of what one would pay to a taxi driver off the street.”The report said the unions not only organised demonstrations and strikes but also physically intimidated various other stakeholders. It added anti-competitive practices reports were correct.The North Goa Tourist Taxi Owners Association contested the report saying it was solely based on selective newspaper reports and that “not even an attempt was made to consider and to investigate equally.” It pointed to the exclusion of “‘relevant material” in the form of news articles, studies, which reflected “poorly on the conduct of these app-based taxi aggregators”.The operators maintained they cannot be faulted for democratically and peacefully voicing their opposition against the entry of players, which directly impacted their livelihood. They pointed out that despite their so-called anti-competitive lobbying with the government, the latter formulated a policy for the aggregators. The policy allows the aggregators to operate and to have dynamic pricing.The Commission then ruled the actions of the taxi operators do not amount to an anti-competitive practice as defined in the Competition Act, 2002. It cited the government’s decision to allow the aggregators in Goa. “It is clear that despite the opposition, the State of Goa does not appear to have acceded to or conceded to the demands of the Ops (taxi operators), and the policy allowing entry of app-based taxi aggregators was eventually notified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-case-cci-closes-case-against-goa-taxi-unions-over-anti-competitive-practices-101625216387866.html

Here's why||Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress on Friday demanded the removal of Tushar Mehta as the Solicitor General of India on account of his meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition leader in the West Bengal assembly. To this end, the Trinamool penned a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the immediate removal of Mehta from his post.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta's meeting with BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari raises "some serious questions about the integrity of the post", said Trinamool on this day. The letter, which was sent to Prime Minister Modi seeking the Solicitor General's removal was signed by three TMC MPs -- Derek O'Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, and Mahua Moitra.We strongly condemn Shri Tushar Mehta's meeting with Shri @SuvenduWB, who has been accused in various offences that are currently being investigated.This raises some serious questions about the integrity of the post held by the Learned Solicitor General. (1/2) pic.twitter.com/PQTKtNR7LaThe letter said that Suvendu Adhikari, in addition to being a BJP leader, is also accused of various offences being investigated by the CBI and the ED. One of such cases is the Narada sting operation case, in which Adhikari was seen taking bribes in videos once publicly circulated by the BJP. The other is the Sarada chit fund case, where the key accused Sudipta Sen had raised grave allegations against Adhikari. In both these cases, the TMC noted, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta is representing the CBI and has appeared before the judiciary in that regard.Also Read | HC allows Mamata Banerjee to file affidavit in Narada caseAs such, the "various news reports containing videos" about the alleged meeting between Adhikari and Mehta, who is advising such investigative agencies, show that there is a "direct conflict of interest" with the statutory duties of the Solicitor General of India.In addition to news reports, the TMC in its letter also cited tweets by prominent personalities, who have questioned such a meeting. The letter also observed that the meeting, "curiously", took place right after Suvendu Adhikari met Union home minister Amit Shah."We have, therefore, reasons to believe that such a meeting has been organised to influence the outcome of matters where Suvendu Adhikari is an accused, using the high offices of the Learned Solicitor General," the TMC letter mentioned.

There is no need for power-cuts in Punjab or for the chief minister to regulate office timings or AC use of the common people ... if we act in the right direction,” Sidhu tweeted.Sidhu stated that Punjab is paying more to buy power at an average cost of Rs. 4.54 per unit, when the national average cost is Rs.3.85 per unit due to the previous Shiromani Akali Dal government signing Power purchase agreements (PPAs) with three private thermal plants“Power purchase costs - Punjab is buying power at an average cost of Rs. 4.54 per unit, national average is Rs. 3.85 per unit and Chandigarh is paying Rs. 3.44 per unit. Punjab’s over-dependence on 3 private thermal plants at Rs. 5-8 per unit makes Punjab pay more than other states,” tweeted Sidhu.Also Read: Amid power tussle in Punjab, CM Amarinder meets leaders“Power purchase agreements (PPAs) - Badal Govt signed PPAs with 3 private thermal power plants in Punjab. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid 5400 crore due to faulty clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay 65,000 Crore of Punjab People’s Money just as fixed charges,” he added.Punjab has been witnessing power outages imposed by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), lasting up to six to eight hours in rural areas and for up to three hours in all major cities, as it is unable to meet the rising demand for electricity amid a paddy sowing season and soaring temperatures due to reduced generation.Farmers who were promised a power supply for eight hours are being supplied sufficient electricity for only six hours, which is marred by frequent interruptions. The gap between supply and demand reached 1,550 megawatts (MW) on Monday after the power demand reached 14,225 MW against a supply of 12,695 MW, Hindustan Times had reported.A PSPCL official told Hindustan Times that the current shortage is due to private power plants failure to supply the committed amount of electricity during a peak season, and even though the state has purchased 500 lakh units from the national grid it hasn’t been able to make up for the shortfall.Sidhu also suggested that the way forward for Punjab is to bring in new legislation in the assembly, to help cap purchase costs in accordance with the national power exchange, insisting it would be a better alternative to re-negotiating the PPAs signed by the SAD government, as it affords the state government no space for price negotiations.“Punjab can purchase power from national grid at much cheaper rates, but these Badal-signed PPAs are acting against Punjab’s Public Interest. Punjab may not be able to re-negotiate these PPAs due to them having legal protection from Hon’ble Courts, But there is a way forward,” the Congress MLA tweeted.“Punjab Vidhan Sabha can bring in New Legislation with retrospective effect to Cap power purchase costs to prices available on the National Power Exchange at any given time ... Thus, By amending the Law, these Agreements will become Null & Void, saving People of Punjab’s Money,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-for-power-cuts-if-navjot-singh-sidhu-tweets-solutions-for-punjab-s-crisis-101625213863341.html

02-07-2021||India||Sunanda Pushkar death case: Delhi court adjourns order on framing of charges against Shashi Tharoor||A Delhi court on Friday adjourned its order on the framing of charges in the Sunanda Pushkar death case till July 27. According to the Delhi Police, the chief accused in the matter is Pushkar's husband, veteran Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is currently on bail in the case.Sunanda Pushkar, the wife of the then UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor, was found dead in a suite of a luxury hotel in New Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014. The preliminary probe indicated that Pushkar had committed suicide, but later reports revealed that the cause of her death was unnatural. The autopsy report indicated that at the time of her death, Pushkar was under drug overdose -- "most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines, and probably alcohol." Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, her husband, was later charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including abetment to suicide and cruelty.At the Delhi court hearing on Friday, the public prosecutor insisted that Sunanda Pushkar had undergone mental cruelty, resulting in her bad health. It was also argued that the death was not accidental, according to the post-mortem report. The prosecutor stressed that Pushkar's death could have been a result of oral or injected poisoning.The Rouse Avenue court in Delhi is supposed to pass its order on the issue of framing of charges. Notably, Tharoor has been charged-sheeted by the Delhi Police under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, the Congress leader, represented by his legal counsel Vikas Pahwa, has argued that there is no admissible evidence against him and the theory of injecting poison. Special Judge Geetanjali Goyal recently had kept the order reserved after prosecution and defense counsel concluded their arguments on the issue of framing of charges.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunanda-pushkar-death-case-delhi-court-adjourns-order-on-framing-of-charges-against-shashi-tharoor-101625210960579.html

The drone was spotted within the complex during an ongoing event at the mission, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Friday.Calling it a security breach, India lodged a formal protest over the incident through a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence, the people cited above said.This comes hours after Border Security Force (BSF) troops in India spotted a quadcopter from Pakistan trying to enter the Indian territory along the international border from Jammu's Arnia sector early on Friday.The movement of the drone was noticed near the border outpost Jabowal, an intelligence official said.

Petrol is currently being sold at ₹100.13 per litre in the city.With this, all districts in Tamil Nadu have crossed the ₹100 mark, said KP Murali, president, Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association. “It crossed the ₹100 mark due to oil companies increasing prices everyday as per the administration’s price mechanism and depending on the daily crude market rate,” said Murali.This mark was breached in several parts of the city, while in a few outlets, petrol was being sold at ₹99.80 per litre. “The price isn’t uniform due to transport costs incurred from bulk fuel supply terminals to fuel stations,” said Murali.Also Read | Petrol jumps 35 paise/litre, but diesel price remains unchangedThe price of diesel, however, remained the same for a third consecutive day at ₹93.72 per litre. The new DMK government, in its election manifesto, promised to cut the VAT on fuel prices. But, recently, the government announced that it was not yet ready to cut prices due to the current fiscal deficit in the state, adding that it receiving only a decreased amount of dues from the Union government. “I would say that the Central government can insist that oil companies not increase fuel prices due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Murali. “We are not asking for the state and Central governments to cut VAT on fuel, as this is an important revenue, but oil companies can restrict fuel prices for at least six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-price-crosses-rs-100-litre-mark-in-chennai-101625209967151.html
02-07-2021||India||Shashi Tharoor learns a new word, takes a dig at PM Modi's beard||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has made a comeback with his witty word usage on Twitter and this time it is a subtle dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tharoor dropped the new word, pogonthropy, and explained its meaning on the microblogging platform on Thursday night after a Twitter user asked him to share a new "out of the box" word to learn. "My friend Rathin Roy, the economist, taught me a new word today: pogonotrophy, which means "the cultivation of a beard". As in, the PM's pogonotrophy has been a pandemic preoccupation...," Tharoor responded to the Twitter user.Pogonthropy refers to the act of cultivating, or growing and grooming, a mustache, beard, sideburns, or other facial hair. Pogonthropy, Greek in origin, finds its advent in mid 19th century with its earliest usage in The Westminster Review, according to the Lexico dictionary.Tharoor keeps dropping new words and creates a buzz around them on social media. The member of Parliament, who represents Thiruvananathapuram in the Lok Sabha, shared his word of the day on Twitter in January this year to respond to former players from Down Under. Tharoor shared the word epicaricacy along with an image of former cricketers who had predicted India’s defeat.“#WordIfTheDay: epicaricacy! I am not the gloating kind but there’s a special pleasure in reading these comments today... When everything else has been said,what remains but “wow”?! #IndvsAus,” Tharoor tweeted.In 2018, Tharoor used this fancy habit to take a dig at his trolls when he said they suffered from lalochezia. “Every day, I encounter on @Twitter people suffering from lalochezia! All too often they direct their suffering at me & others who support my beliefs,” Tharoor said in a tweet.Tharoor's fascination with big words, which often make readers look for dictionaries, has also humorously backfired.In May this year, Telangana minister K Taraka Rama Rao, known as KTR, made his discomfort with names of Covid-19 medicine public. On a 'lighter note', the minister listed out the names of the medicines, which include Posaconazole, Cresemba, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Liposomal Amphotericin, Flavipiravir, Molnupiravir, Baricitinib etc. The list is long the minister said jokingly hinting that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor may have something to do with these names.Responding to the comical allegation, Tharoor said he is not guilty of naming these medicines. Had it been left to him, the Congress leader would have happily called them 'CoroNil', 'CoroZero' and even 'GoCoronaGo'. "But these pharmacists are more procrustean..." Tharoor said. He also accused KTR of floccinaucinihilipilification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-learns-a-new-word-takes-a-dig-at-pm-modi-s-beard-101625202176030.html

The land was allotted after the high-level land allotment committee held its first meeting in Srinagar on Wednesday, which was chaired by Ranjan Thakur, principal secretary to J&K government’s industries and commerce department.“The high-level land allotment committee took up 23 cases for allotment of land in various industrial estates of Jammu division with a projected investment of ₹2,447 crore After deliberations on a case-to-case basis, the committee approved 15 cases of land allotment with a projected investment of ₹1,548 crore having employment potential of 5,000 people,” a government statement read.It added that the proposed investment in each project ranges between ₹50 crore and ₹200 crore.Also Read | Massive fire breaks out in forest at Jammu’s Rajouri, firefighting ops onIt was the first meeting of this committee that allotted the land under the newly adopted J&K Industrial Land Allotment Policy. As per the policy draft, the land “is initially allotted for 40 years” and the lease agreement can be later extended up to 99 years.Calling the decision of land allotment “historical in the industrial development” of the Union Territory (UT), Thakur said that “the process of the land allotment has been streamlined and made transparent” under the policy.The applications for the allotment have been received on the portal www.investjk.in.The government statement added that for the first time, the process of land allotment “adopted a strategy of ranking on the basis of different parameters of the project report and presentations”.“The Committee decided to keep 8 projects pending on the basis of huge requirement of power for operation with less employment potential and also due to restriction on setting up of Red category units in Industrial Area Ghatti, Kathua,” it added.It said that more project proposals with a likely investment of ₹10,000 crore and employment generation for 34,000 persons in Jammu are in process of being approved. A similar projected investment from such proposals is also expected to employ 50,000 people in Kashmir as per the government, therefore giving a potential employment impetus to UT with 84,000 jobs.Anoo Malhotra, director, industries and commerce, Jammu, who is also the member secretary of the high-level land allotment committee said that the decision ushers a “new era of growth, industrialisation, and employment generation in J&K besides promoting a culture of entrepreneurship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-govt-approves-land-allotment-for-15-projects-in-jammu-101625208886921.html

Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan asked why the Congress leader keeps repeatedly raising accusations of vaccine shortage, especially when the government has publicly released facts on vaccine availability for the month of July. On the other hand, Union minister Piyush Goyal clarified that 120 milliOn vaccine doses will be made available in July, of which states have already been informed in advance.Questioning the government on vaccine availability, Rahul Gandhi had said earlier this day, "It's July already, yet there are no vaccines." The Congress leader asked, "Where are vaccines?"जुलाई आ गया है, वैक्सीन नहीं आयीं।#WhereAreVaccinesResponding to Gandhi's question, Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan, in turn, asked, "What is Rahul Gandhi's problem? Does he not read? Does he not understand?" The minister added that he had a day ago put out "facts" regarding vaccine availability for the month of July. "There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance," he remarked, adding that Congress must think about a "leadership overhaul".Just yesterday, I put out facts on vaccine availability for the month of July. What is @RahulGandhi Ji’s problem ?Does he not read ?Does he not understand ?There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance !!@INCIndia must think of a leadership overhaul ! https://t.co/jFX60jM15wUnion minister Piyush Goyal said Rahul Gandhi "should understand that the display of petty politics is not appropriate at this time". He further clarified that 120 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be available in July, which is separate from the supply of private hospitals.वैक्सीन की 12 करोड़ डोज़ जुलाई महीने में उपलब्ध होंगी, जो प्राइवेट हॉस्पिटल्स की आपूर्ति से अलग है। राज्यों को 15 दिन पहले ही आपूर्ति के बारे में सूचना दी जा चुकी है। राहुल गांधी को समझना चाहिये कि कोरोना से लड़ाई में गंभीरता के बजाय इस समय ओछी राजनीति का प्रदर्शन उचित नही है। https://t.co/xmDqtrLcLINotably, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been a harsh critic of the central government's vaccination policy for months. He has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on numerous counts, to end the 'shortage' of vaccine doses in the country, a claim that the BJP-led government has debunked as a lie.Meanwhile, an acute vaccine shortage has been reported from various parts of the country. the Odisha government halted the vaccination drive in 16 districts due to a "shortage" of Covishield doses. Meanwhile, Assam on Thursday said it could vaccinate only 16.63 lakh people in the last 10 days, almost 45% less than the target set by state chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, due to a massive shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.In Maharashtra, the administration suspended the vaccination drive across 281 civic-run centers and 20 government-run centers in Mumbai due to a shortage of stocks. Several other states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, etc have also said that they are facing a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-rahul-gandhi-s-problem-union-ministers-hit-back-over-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-101625203270544.html

02-07-2021||India||Petrol jumps 35 paise/litre, but diesel price remains unchanged||State-run fuel retailers on Friday raised petrol prices by 35 paise per litre after a gap of two days, but spared a diesel price hike, thus decoupling the synchronous movements of the two fuels rates for the first time in last 60 days. The 33rd price hike in about two months has made petrol costlier by ₹8.76 per litre since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared. Although, diesel rates remained unchanged on Friday, it rose by ₹8.45 per litre in the previous 32 rounds. With the latest hike, petrol rates in Delhi and Kolkata have come close to the ₹100 mark. Petrol in Delhi is priced at ₹99.16 per litre, and ₹99.04 in Kolkata. While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Petrol has, however, crossed the ₹100 mark in Chennai for the first time and currently being sold at ₹100.13 a litre in the southern city. Petrol is priced at ₹105.24 per litre in Mumbai and ₹102.48 in Bengaluru. Highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar, where new rate of petrol is ₹110.40 per litre, while diesel is sold at ₹102.42 a litre. Also Read | Delhi airport sees increase in passengers but rising fuel costs may impact faresThe unidirectional upward movement Since May 4 already saw petrol already crossing ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and UTs of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Laddakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali and Darjeeling. Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps. Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with respective international benchmarks of previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. International oil prices rally continued on Friday after producers’ cartel – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) – on Thursday decided to restore less than expected supply even as global oil demand is growing. Benchmark Brent crude, which surged 1.6% at $75.84 a barrel on Thursday, was trading 0.09% up at $75.91 on early Friday -- highest since October 2018. In Delhi, central levies account for 34.03% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.08%, according to an official data of June 16. On diesel, central taxes are over 36.38% while state taxes are about 14.63%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic. Even as international oil prices saw volatility since May 4, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude had plunged to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest in these 46 days; petrol and diesel rates went up the next day by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre, respectively. According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory. During the 66-day pause on rate hike, state-run retailers had also reduced politically sensitive petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— controls almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-jumps-35-paise-litre-but-diesel-price-remains-unchanged-101625205707143.html
02-07-2021||India||Delta: List of vaccines that are claimed to be effective against this Covid variant||As the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is emerging as the new threat across the world, vaccine makers are releasing data on whether their product is effective against this variant. Among all the variants, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, Delta has proved to be the most virulent. First reported from India in October 2020, this variant is now present in 96 countries and is on its way to replace Alpha, first reported from the United Kingdom, as the dominant strain.Here is how effective the present vaccines are against Delta strain.Studies have revealed that Covid variants reduce the neutralising antibody levels created by vaccines. Based on these reduction figures, data on how effective these vaccines are against various variants, are available internationally.Pfizer: Delta variant results in a 7 to 10 fold reduction in the neutralising antibody levels of Pfizer.Moderna: Dela variant causes a 7 to 10 fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels of Moderna.Covaxin: Bharat Biotech's Covaxin sees a three-fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels against the Delta variant.Covishield: Covishield or Oxford- Astrazeneca vaccine's effect gets reduced two fold against Delta.While these are based on laboratory findings, Johnson and Johnson has carried out a sample study on 28 people vaccinated with J&J and claimed that its vaccine can neutralise the Delta variant.Russia-made Sputnik has also claimed that its vaccine is effective against the Delta variant, though Russia at present is witnessing a third wave of the pandemic.ZyCov-D, another Indian vaccine after Covaxin, which will be the world's first three-dose, needle-free, DNA vaccine has also claimed that the vaccine in the clinical trial proved to be effective against the Delta variant. The phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine was conducted during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country and hence the vaccine is believed to be effective against the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-list-of-vaccines-that-are-claimed-to-be-effective-against-this-covid-variant-101625204722242.html

It said that “history will judge” the state government for its silence over the violence.It also said that after assembly election results were declared, fearing for their lives, hundreds of BJP workers had to flee West Bengal and are now taking shelter in the neighbouring state of Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpwomens-wing-accuses-state-govt-of-sponsoring-post-poll-violence-101625201506385.html
02-07-2021||India||Pakistan quadcopter spotted entering India, flies back after BSF fires at it||A quadcopter from Pakistan tried to enter Indian territory along the international border from Jammu's Arnia sector early on Friday but retreated after it was fired at by the personnel of the Border Security Force or BSF. According to an intelligence official, the movement of the drone was noticed near the border outpost Jabowal.BSF said that the spy quadcopter was trying to get into the Indian territory for "surveillance of the area". "Alert BSF troops fired at small quadcopter belonging to Pakistan on Friday morning at about 0425 hrs (4.25 am) as it was trying to cross IB in Arnia sector. Due to this firing, it returned back immediately," the force said in a statement."The quadcopter was flying between Zero Line and the border fence. It was fired upon by the alert BSF personnel... We have searched the area and have found no arms and ammunition," NS Jamwal, BSF's Jammu frontier inspector general, said.Also read: Drones a clear, present threat, says army chiefThe sighting of the quadcopter comes five days after the drone attack was carried out on the Indian Air Force station in Jammu on Sunday. At least two personnel were injured in the attack. The attack was the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility. The technology used in the aerial attack in Jammu indicated “state support and the possible involvement of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba terror groups,” Lieutenant General DP Pandey, who heads the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, said on Wednesday.Drones, the latest threat in the security affairs of the country, have been sighted for four consecutive days over military stations in Kaluchak, Ratnuchak, Sunjuwan and Kunjwani.Spotlighting the threat posed by such incidents, Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Thursday that the easy availability of drones allowed both state and non-state actors to use them, increasing the complexity of challenges faced by the security forces.Highlighting the easy availability of devices such as the ones used in Jammu on June 27 -- and several other drones seen and repelled in the region’s Kaluchak area over the past week -- he said that building drones was akin to a “DIY project that could be tackled at home”.Also read: Army jawan killed in encounter with terrorists at Jammu and Kashmir's PulwamaPakistan Rangers have been regularly violating the international boundary through drone intrusions and trying to drop arms and ammunition in the Indian territory but have been successfully repulsed by BSF troops on the border, BSF officials have said.

Both leaders also said that the issue of development in the region was also taken up.Also Read | UP Police book Twitter India chief for faulty J&K, Ladakh mapKarbalai said the delegation has sought full statehood for Ladakh.After the abrogation of Article 370 and the reorganisation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the state was bifurcated into the Union Territory of J&K with legislature and Union Territory of Ladakh without legislature.The demand for restoration of statehood has been raised in both the Union Territories, along with seeking provisions to safeguard land and jobs for the locals.Apart from the Kargil Democratic Alliance, the apex body, a collective of social, religious and political leaders from the Leh region have also raised the demand for provisions under Schedule VI of the Constitution or under a separate schedule to protect the language, culture, traditions and secure the jobs and land rights of the people in Ladakh. The apex body has already had two meetings with the Union home ministry to push for their demands.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met political party representatives from Jammu and Kashmir. The restoration of statehood, ongoing delimitation exercise and the conduct of assembly elections in the Union Territory were discussed at the all-party meeting chaired by the PM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kargil-delegation-meets-mos-home-wants-statehood-101625200185442.html
02-07-2021||India||Can you mix and match Covid-19 vaccines? Here’s what studies say||Several studies conducted to test the efficacy of switching Covid-19 vaccines are underway and the latest research last month said that mix-and-match inoculation, where a shot of Pfizer's vaccine was given after an AstraZeneca shot, produced more antibodies than two AstraZeneca jabs. Several countries like the UK, Canada, Italy and the UAE are among those that have allowed mix-and-match inoculation, which scientists hope will have benefits. The decision to allow the mix and match combinations of the two different Covid-19 vaccines has come amid supply delays and safety concerns.Also read | Scientifically Speaking | Considering a mix and match approach to Covid vaccinesIn June, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi took the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine different from his first—as the 73-year-old switched to Pfizer-BioNTech jab for his second dose. Draghi previously received an AstraZeneca vaccine. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also received a Moderna vaccine after getting AstraZeneca for her first dose.What do scientists say about the benefits of mix-and-match of vaccines?Researchers in the past have experimented with mixing vaccines in fighting a handful of other diseases, like Ebola. Combinations of rotavirus vaccines have also been used and tested in India. Scientists say that giving people two different vaccines might generate a stronger immune response, perhaps because the shots stimulate slightly different parts of the immune system or teach it to recognise different parts of an invading pathogen.Also read | Mixing different Covid-19 vaccines theoretically possible, says Centre“The argument is that one and one makes three. How well that argument holds up in practice in the Covid area is going to need to be judged by the actual data,” John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, told the New York Times.Zhou Xing, an immunologist at McMaster University in Canada said mixing and matching also “offers much-needed flexibility when vaccine supplies are uneven or limited,” according to the New York Times.What do the data say about mix-and-match of vaccines?A University of Oxford study, called Com-COV, has said alternating vaccines where a shot of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine is given four weeks after an AstraZeneca shot will produce better immune responses than giving another dose of AstraZeneca. Researchers compared mixed two-dose schedules of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and found that they produced high concentrations of antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein in any combination. Matthew Snape, the lead investigator behind the trial, said that the findings could be used to give flexibility to vaccine rollouts, but was not large enough to recommend a broader shift away from clinically approved schedules on its own.Also read | Vaccine dose mix-up may not be a problem, says Centre as 20 in UP get 2 different shots"It's certainly encouraging that these antibody and T-cell responses look good with the mixed schedules. But I think your default has to stay, unless there's a very good reason otherwise, to what is proven to work," Snape told reporters referring to the same-shot vaccine schedules assessed in clinical trials.The US National Institutes of Health recently launched a trial of mixed booster doses. Russian researchers have said they are testing a combination of their Sputnik V vaccine and the AstraZeneca shot. Sputnik is based on a mix-and-match approach as its first and second shots have different formulations.Spanish researchers announced in June that people who received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by a dose of the Pfizer vaccine, showed a robust immune response.Is it safe?The preliminary data from Oxford’s Com-COV study suggests that mixing and matching vaccines may increase the odds of mild and moderate side effects, including fever, fatigue and headache. Most side effects faded within 48 hours, researchers found. They said that this suggests that a mismatched regimen “might have some short-term disadvantages”. It could also be possible that the side effects may be a sign of a strong immune response.What has been India’s response?In May, Dr NK Arora, the chairperson of Covid-19 working group under the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said that India may soon start testing the mix and match approach to Covid-19 vaccines. “We will be looking at the feasibility of testing the two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen but with different vaccines, for which testing may start in few weeks. Dosing interval will also be examined, that includes whether a single dose or a dose followed by a booster shot or so on works better,” Arora said.At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district in May were administered Covishield as their first dose and Covaxin as their second one. After that, the Centre said that administering two different doses of vaccines is not a cause for concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-you-mix-and-match-covid-19-vaccines-here-s-what-studies-say-101625197032542.html

Rawat rushed to New Delhi on Wednesday after he was summoned there following the conclusion of a state BJP meeting in Nainital. Since then, there has been much speculation as Rawat needs to get elected to the state assembly by September 10 to continue as the chief minister. Rawat took over as the chief minister in March. There are two assembly seats vacant in the state. The notification for the by-polls has to be issued before August 5. Normally by-polls are not held if the remaining tenure of a legislature is less than a year.The state BJP leaders remained tight-lipped about the developments in New Delhi claiming Rawat was there to discuss the 2022 assembly elections. Also Read | ‘CM, Sidhu will have a working arrangement’: Harish RawatDushyant Kumar Gautam, the BJP’s state in-charge, said coordination between the state and the Centre is important and that is why Rawat has gone to Delhi. “Also, with the next assembly elections ahead, there ought to be many issues which need to be discussed. All those would be discussed during the visit. As far as speculation is concerned, they are always there around any political personality.”Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is trying to make inroads into Uttarakhand, has announced Ajay Kothiyal, a retired army officer, will contest against Rawat from the Gangotri seat. Rawat is expected to seek his election from Gandotri. But no final call has been taken yet.AAP leader Naveen, who uses only one name, accused the BJP of “gross injustice” to the state’s people by imposing two “rubber stamp” chief ministers on them. “First Trivendra Singh Rawat and now Tirath Singh Rawat.”AAP has announced it will contest all 70 seats assembly seats next year. It is banking on Kothiyal’s background and his popularity in the state for his significant contribution to the reconstruction work of the Kedarnath shrine post-2013 floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-chief-minister-stays-back-in-delhi-amid-much-speculation-101625198925738.html

The fresh Covid-19 cases have taken India's cumulative tally of infections to 30,458,251.In the last 24 hours, India also recorded 853 deaths. So far, 400,312 people have succumbed to Covid-19 in the country.Active cases of Covid-19 in the country continued to decline and were logged at 509,637 on Friday. The cumulative recoveries in the country have also continued to outnumber the daily new infections for 50 days in a row. On Friday, at least 59,384 people recovered, taking the national recovery rate to 96.97%.Follow HT's full coverage of Covid-19 hereDeclining cases, the health ministry said, are a result of sustained and collaborative efforts by the Centre and the states and Union territories.According to the data reviewed by HT, the death toll from the country’s brutal second wave appears to be significantly higher than what official numbers suggest. Even as the pandemic has been in the country for over a year, more than 60% of all reported deaths have been recorded in just the last four months – or during the second wave of infections, data showed.All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) chief Dr Randeep Guleria said on Thursday the country may be able to avoid the next wave of Covid-19 if people follow Covid-19 safety protocols and if a large chunk of the population is vaccinated against the disease. "That depends on how we behave, if we are careful and we have a good vaccination coverage, then the third wave may not come, or it will be very little," Dr Guleria said.The senior doctor that at this stage, there is not much data available on the Delta plus variant to suggest that it is more infective or has a higher rate of mortality. "There isn't much data on Delta plus variant to suggest it's more infectious, causing more deaths, or has developed significant immune escape mechanism. But if we follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated, we'll be safe against any of emerging variants," Dr Guleria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-46-617-fresh-covid-19-cases-daily-infections-under-50k-for-5-days-101625192713169.html

He said more than 85% of the land required for the construction of the longest Ganga expressway in the state has been acquired and more than ₹5,000 crore has been given to at least 62,000 farmers. Mahana also claimed that the state has become the “first choice for industrialists nationally and internationally” owing to the efforts made on the ground to create a conducive atmosphere for businesses. The efforts made by the government to attract investment in UP is a poll plank of the BJP government in the poll-bound state. “Better infrastructure, safety, security and the adjusting attitude of the state government have allured industrialists to set up industry in Uttar Pradesh,” Mahana said. He said the pandemic notwithstanding, the state received overseas investments and electronic giants such as Samsung and Microsoft have shown interest in setting up production units in the state.

02-07-2021||India||‘Break’ monsoon likely to disrupt sowing of crops, says IMD||The country will receive “normal” rain in July, between 94% and 106% of long period average, but monsoon will revive only during the second week, India Meteorological Department said in its forecast for the month on Thursday. It also cautioned that subdued monsoon conditions during the next seven days are likely to impact agricultural activities like sowing and transplantation of crops, irrigation scheduling, etc, and also affect power requirements. Crops sown early will require protective irrigation to stop soil moisture from evaporating. But the sowing of other major crops like rice in northwest and central India may not be affected. During July, when most of monsoon rain happens normally, "below normal" (<94%) to "normal" (94% to 106%) rain is likely over most areas of northwest India, parts of south peninsular, central, east and northeast India, IMD said in its forecast. Also Read | Delhi, reeling under scorching heatwave, looks to thunderstorm alert for respite"Normal" to "above normal" (>105%) rainfall is likely over parts of central India and adjacent areas of peninsular India and Gangetic plains in July. The latest global model forecasts indicate that the prevailing neutral El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions are likely to continue over the equatorial Pacific Ocean and that there is an enhanced possibility of development of negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions over the Indian Ocean during the July to September period. “While neutral ENSO conditions don’t affect the monsoon, negative IOD conditions are not favourable to Indian monsoon. This is because the sea surface temperatures are higher in the eastern equatorial Indian ocean while cooler sea temperatures are found near the Somalia coast, so it doesn’t support the monsoon progress. There is, however, still a high probability of normal monsoon over the country during July,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. As sea surface temperature (SST) conditions over the Pacific and the Indian oceans are known to have strong influence on Indian monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring them, IMD said in its statement. ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rain, flood, and drought. Like ENSO, the change in temperature gradients across the Indian Ocean results in changes in the preferred regions of rising and descending moisture and air which is called the IOD according to Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Mohapatra said monsoon covered most parts of the country except parts of northwest India, including Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan by June 19 but monsoon flow started weakening from June 26 onwards. This was mainly because of strengthening of mid-latitude westerly winds which weakened the flow of easterly monsoon winds; unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation location; and absence of formation of any low-pressure system over North Bay of Bengal which could bring rain. Spatially, monsoon coverage reduced significantly in the past two days and the monsoon is unlikely to revive in the next seven to 10 days, Mohapatra said. “There is a chance that a low-pressure area will form over the Bay of Bengal around July 11 or 12. There is no chance of monsoon picking up very much before that,” added Mohapatra. “Break monsoon phases occur during monsoon. There have been some break monsoon phases which have lasted for 10 days. This is not a record of a situation but cannot be called normal either,” Mohapatra said during the briefing. June last week to July first week is the most critical period for farming. For south India most of the sowing happens around June 15. Those sowing late will not be able to do so and those who have sown crops those crops may not germinate when there is such a large gap in rain. The yield will be significantly affected and farmers will have to depend on contingency crops. They may choose short duration crops like millets, green gram etc but those are also difficult to source. In northwest India there is no rain till now so only those supported by irrigation will go ahead. This is a significant setback,” said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad.Humidity likely to increase over NW IndiaHeat wave conditions are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, and northwest Madhya Pradesh during the next couple of days. But it is likely to decrease in intensity and coverage due to south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea. Scientists are expecting south-westerly winds from Arabian Sea to affect the northwest region, including Delhi, for a week which will help abate heat wave conditions, but humidity will increase and may lead to very uncomfortable conditions as the impact of heat will be accentuated with high humidity. Flooding likely in NE Under the influence of strong, moist south-westerly winds from Bay of Bengal blowing to the northeastern states and parts adjoining east India, widespread and very heavy to occasionally extremely heavy (over 20 cm) rain is very likely over Bihar, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and northeastern states during the next five days. Continuous rain is very likely to increase the inflow to rivers and reservoirs originating in the Himalayas, leading to flood like situation in some catchments, IMD has warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/break-monsoon-likely-to-disrupt-sowing-of-crops-says-imd-101625196645041.html

One of the marquee programmes for the first as well as the second term of the government, Digital India is a set of initiatives meant to encourage the uptake of services and commerce over the internet.On Thursday, Modi said gains from such initiatives will further emerge as India bridges the gap between government services and people’s access to them. “This presents a massive opportunity for India, together we will be successful in making this decade India’s techade,” Modi said.“The digital India mission has enabled the implementation of the one nation, on ration card scheme and helped ease access to services for millions of people during the Covid-19 pandemic.”The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed all states and Union territories to implement the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme by July 31. The singular ration card system has been looked at as a crucial technology-driven solution at a time when rural migrants were stranded at their places of work due to Covid-19 lockdown.Interacting with the beneficiaries of Digital India schemes, Modi said direct benefit transfer helped send money to crores of people. “At a time when developed countries were unable to send aid to their citizens due to the lockdown, India was sending thousands of crores of rupees directly to the bank accounts of the people...”“Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, ₹1.35 lakh crore have been deposited directly into the bank account of more than 10 crore farmer families. Digital India has also realized the spirit of One Nation, One MSP...”Experts have seen Digital India as having played crucial role in advancing India’s fintech sector and inclusion of more people into the financial system. “The government’s focus on trying to get so much of India digitised is laudable... they need to focus on protecting Indians data rights as well...,” Raman Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-make-this-decade-india-s-techade-modi-101625188718574.html

Joint security forces, including the personnel of the army, the Pulwama Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), cornered the terrorists in the Hanjin Rajpora area of Pulwama, according to officials.#Encounter has started at Hanjin Rajpora area of #Pulwama. Police and security forces are on the job. Further details shall follow. @JmuKmrPoliceJammu and Kashmir: An encounter is underway between terrorists and security forces in Hanjin Rajpora area of Pulwama(Visuals deferred by unspecified time) pic.twitter.com/W9VeTbFN2CThe Pulwama encounter saw heavy firing from both sides. One soldier was injured in the initial exchange of firing with militants, an official was quoted as saying by PTI. He added that the jawan succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Kashmir.A search operation, reportedly launched in the area by joint security forces, triggered the gunfight. The said search and cordon operation was conducted based on inputs suggesting a number of terrorists had taken shelter at the Hanjin village in the Rajpora area of Pulwama district.As soon as the security forces reached the suspected hideout in the course of the search operation, the terrorists opened fire on them, according to the report. The security forces then took the lead and retaliated with heavy gunfire.There has been no report of casualties yet; however, as many as three to four terrorists are believed to be trapped in the encounter.On a related note, security forces gunned down two terrorists yesterday at another encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district.

02-07-2021||India||Recovered pistol not used in Dabholkar murder: Officials||Almost 17 months after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recovered a pistol from Kharegaon creek in the Arabian Sea with the help of Norwegian deep-sea divers, ballistics experts have said it is not the weapon used in the murder of rationalist and anti-superstition crusader Narendra Dabholkar in August 2013, as was originally hypothesised, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The development is a major setback for CBI, which, along with anti-terror units from Maharashtra and Karnataka, spent at least ₹7.5 crore to recover the weapon from the seabed; the recovery was also seen as a major breakthrough in the case.HT reported on March 5 last year that to find the weapon, the agency hired a Dubai-based firm, Envitech Marine Consultants, which, in turn, brought in deep-sea explorers and machinery from Norway and scoured the creek at Thane for months.One of the shooters, Sharad Kalaskar, also an accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru in 2017, dismantled four country-made pistols by taking out their barrels and sliders and threw them from a bridge in Kharegaon creek in Thane on his way from Pune to Nallasopara on July 23, 2018, according to a previous claim by CBI. The agency suspected the pistol fished out by the Norwegian divers was one of the four thrown by Kalaskar.The people cited above said ballistics experts at Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), after a thorough examination, have said the pistol recovered from the seabed doesn’t match with the markings on the fired bullets (of 7.65mm) and three spent cartridges, recovered from crime scene at Omkareshwar bridge in Shaniwar Peth, Pune. Dabholkar was on a walk on August 20, 2013 when Sachin Andure and Kalaskar shot him at this spot, according to the agency.A senior official familiar with the expert opinion said: “It’s a known fact that no two firearms, even of same make and model, will produce the same markings on a bullet or a cartridge. But bullets fired from same weapon and its cartridges can be easily matched and that’s what the forensic experts were trying by cleaning and firing the pistol recovered by us. Unfortunately, it didn’t match.”“We will continue looking for the murder weapon,” he added.CBI didn’t comment on the development officially.Advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, one of the defence lawyers, said: “It could not have matched. What was alleged to be thrown in the creek were parts of a pistol. So, there was no way that a complete pistol will come out of it.”Dabholkar’s murder, CBI believes, is linked to the killing of Lankesh, the February 16, 2015 killing of activist Govind Pansare in Kolhapur, and the August 2015 murder of Kannada scholar MM Kalburgi. CBI, which is probing the Dabholkar murder since 2014, has already filed three chargesheets in the case, naming seven people, including the alleged mastermind Virendra Tawade (an ENT surgeon), advocate Sanjeev Punalekar, Vikram Bhave, Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andure.CBI has claimed that Kalaskar visited Punalekar in June 2018 and revealed his role in the killing of Dabholkar. In response, according to the agency, Punalekar told Kalaskar to destroy the firearms used in the killings.Punalekar is out on bail since 2019 while Vikram Bhave was granted bail by the Bombay high court in May. CBI and Maharashtra police recently informed the HC that trial in both Dabholkar and Pansare murders can begin, but their probe will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovered-pistol-not-used-in-dabholkar-murder-officials-101625187108851.html
02-07-2021||India||SC strikes down cops’ appeal in ‘assault’ case||The Delhi Police must abide with the duty of being fair, said the Supreme Court on Thursday as it dismissed an appeal by the police against supplying a statement of a witness to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a case of alleged assault against former chief secretary Anshu Prakash.“You (police), as an investigating agency, cannot pick and choose what to show and what not to... It may be a politically hot potato but there is nothing in it legally. You must have a robust sense when it comes to principles of natural justice. The views of the high court support liberty and we will also support it,” said the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah.“The investigating agency must abide with the duty of being fair. You (police) have to be fair to the accused. It is not that just because something is in favour of the accused, it can be withheld,” the bench added.Prakash alleged he was assaulted during a meeting at the CM’s residence on February 19, 2018, following which a first information report (FIR) was lodged against Kejriwal, Sisodia and 11 other MLAs of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).In October 2020, the Delhi high court said that the accused should get the copy of the statement made on February 21, 2018 by Kejriwal’s former advisor VK Jain, who was present at the 2018 meeting pertaining to the case. The high court also directed the trial court to consider Jain’s statement at the time of considering the charges against the AAP leaders.On Thursday, the bench took up the Delhi Police’s petition challenging the high court order. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, appearing for the police, contended that since Jain’s statement was not made under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (examination of witnesses by police), it could not be supplied to the AAP leaders. Lekhi added that Jain’s statement was recorded in the Case Diary, and that it was a settled law that not everything in the case diary could be given to the accused unless the prosecution sought to depend on it.But the bench asked why Delhi Police should vehemently oppose sharing statement of a witness when the same person’s previous statement was recorded under Section 161 of CrPC. “Records show that this statement dated February 21, 2018 was in continuation of the previous statement of the same witness. You (police) cannot as an investigating agency pick and choose what to show and what to not. This is an absolutely correct order of the high court,” observed the court.The bench emphasised that an investigating agency was duty-bound to be fair also to the accused and was obligated to share everything that was crucial for a fair trial.The law officer tried to persuade the top court that Jain’s statement on February 21, 2018 could not be categorised as evidence under the law and was only a statement recorded in the Case Diary which did not have to be given to the accused. Lekhi complained that the high court judgment will have ramifications in other cases too.But the court remained firm that the high court order was correct. “Please understand that the criminal justice system is not only for convicting accused but to make sure that the justice dispensation system runs its full course,” the bench told Lekhi.It told the ASG that if the said statement was going to help the accused, “all the more reason why they should get it”.“Your arguments are too technical. This is not worth it. It may be a politically hot potato but there is nothing in it legally...If a statement favours the accused, they must still get it. High Court’s is a view that supports liberty and we will support it. It is a correct view,” said the bench, dismissing the appeal.Kejriwal and Sisodia, in their plea before the high court, accused the prosecution of withholding Jain’s statement since it did not suit their case and helped in falsely implicating them.Jain, in the 2018 statement that was reproduced in the high court judgment, stated that on the night of February 19, there was a meeting that took place between the AAP leaders and Anshu Prakash on the issue of ‘Doorstep Delivery of Ration’, ‘Advertisement Funds Release’, and slow processing of files. During the meeting, Jain stated, he went to the washroom, and upon returning, saw Prakash leaving. Jain added that he could not say anything about what transpired outside while he was in the washroom.Delhi Police and state government spokespersons did not respond to queries seeking comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-strikes-down-cops-appeal-in-assault-case-101625174769970.html
02-07-2021||India||‘Total nonsense’: Dominican PM skewers Mehul Choksi claim on conspiracy||New Delhi: Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit on Thursday rejected fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi’s claims that he was brought to the island as part of a plot between Dominica, India and Antigua and Barbuda, calling such allegations “total nonsense”, according to a report in Dominica News Online.This is the first time that Skerrit has responded to accusations by Mehul Choksi and his family that the three governments colluded to send the businessman to India to stand trial in a ₹13,500 crore bank fraud case.Choksi’s legal team has alleged that he was abducted by police officers from Antigua and India on May 23 and brought to Dominica on a boat the next day, where he was received by senior police officers of Dominica. It is alleged that the plan was to quietly deport him to India.Skerrit said it was absurd.“To say that the government of Dominica and the government of Antigua along with India colluded in any way, give me a break, that’s total nonsense. We don’t get involved ourselves in those kinds of activities, those practices, not at all. I mean that is absurd and we reject it and it is unfortunate that anybody would want to propagate this unsubstantiated claim by a gentleman who is before the courts,” Skerrit said in course of weekly interaction with a journalists.Skerrit also urged the opposition parties in Dominica not to make what he described as “irresponsible statements” on the matter. Dominica’s leader of opposition Lennox Linton last month alleged the government had a role in Choksi’s abduction.The prime minister underlined that his government will evenly apply the law irrespective of who is accused of committing any crimes.Skerrit said his government will allow the court to carry out its process regarding Choksi and stressed that his rights and obligations will be respected by Dominica.He also expressed support for the government of Antigua’s move to revoke Choksi’s citizenship. Choksi, who took citizenship of Antigua via its Citizenship by Investment Scheme in November 2017, is currently contesting a move by the Antiguan government to revoke his citizenship and a second case relating to his extradition to India.Since Choksi is an illegal citizen in Dominica, Indian government has sought his deportation from there on the grounds that he needs to face the courts in India and that he continues to be an Indian citizen. In a brief statement issued in early June, Skerrit referred to Choksi as an “Indian citizen” that reflected New Delhi’s position on the businessman. India has argued that Choksi’s request to revoke his Indian citizenship was rejected and the decision conveyed to him when he filed the application.Choksi’s lawyers, however, argue that the moment Choksi took Antiguan citizenship in November 2017, the businessman ceased to be an Indian citizen as per law.The 62-year-old businessman, accused of fraud along with his nephew Nirav Modi, is currently in judicial custody in Dominica after being charged by police there for “illegal entry”.He has sought bail from the Dominica courts and requested that he be sent back to Antigua, of which he is a citizen. People familiar with the developments told HT that Choksi also rented a house in Dominica last week for $6000 ( ₹4.4 lakh) per month and has informed the high court in an attempt to convince the court that he is not a flight risk. Choksi has requested that he should be placed under house arrest rather than being kept in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/total-nonsense-dominican-pm-skewers-mehul-choksi-claim-on-conspiracy-101625173839986.html

In this situation, a large number of expatriate Keralites reached Bahrain and Qatar through third countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka in order to proceed to Saudi Arabia, said a release by the Kerala Chief Minister's Office.It was also pointed out that during a stopover people were also told to stay in quarantine for two weeks to go to Saudi Arabia.The Chief Secretary highlighted that the GCC countries do not allow those who received two doses of Covaxin as the vaccine does not have the approval of the World Health Organization."There are also many people from abroad who have come home after receiving the first dose of vaccines like Pfizer and Sinopharm. There is a situation where the Gulf countries deny them entry as they do not have the means to get the second dose in India," the letter said.Further, the Kerala government also raised the need to discuss these issues with the governments of the Gulf countries and provide an opportunity for expatriates who are stranded at home to return to work as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-writes-to-centre-seeking-solutions-to-covid-19-vaccine-related-issues-faced-by-expatriates-101625171107708.html

The zoo authorities have announced a probe into the death.P Harshad was found lying near the enclosure and was rushed to hospital where he died later.The zoo has three king cobras. Two of them were in an enclosure and the third, in a separate one, a zoo official said on condition of anonymity. It is the third snake that is believed to have bitten Harshad.Harshad had moved the snake to a smaller cage while cleaning the main enclosure. When he went back to the smaller cage, he noticed it was dirty and proceeded to clean it without shifting the serpent back and was bitten, news agency PTI said, quoting the police.Harshad initially used to work with a circus but was accommodated at the zoo after the government strictly barred use of wild animals by circuses. He was taken on the zoo’s rolls as a permanent employee in 2019, two years after he locked himself in the cobra’s enclosure to protest the delay in hiring him as a permanent employee, his colleague said on condition of anonymity.Another colleague said two workers used to be deployed for cleaning the enclosures earlier but due to the lockdown, only one person was around. As a result, no one really saw what happened and it took time to get him help.King cobras are the longest of all venomous snakes. Their venom is not the most potent but the amount of neurotoxin they can deliver in a single bite can kill upto 20 people.Wildlife experts said king cobra bites are rare and they usually prey on other snakes, especially rat snakes and lizards.“King cobra is very gentle among snakes and it bites only after grave provocation. Even after provocation it gives enough warning by hissing repeatedly,” said famous snake handler Vava Suresh who is credited with having rescued over 200 king cobras and often calls snakes the most misunderstood creatures in the world.“It seems to be an accidental bite. A clear picture will emerge only after examining CCTV visuals,” said Vava Suresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thiruvananthapuram-zoo-keeper-found-dead-in-king-cobra-s-enclosure-101625167358699.html

The Trust also offered to produce all documents pertaining to the deals before any “competent person or authority” who approaches them for scrutiny.“A team of lawyers and chartered accountants went through all documents related with all land purchase deals made by the Trust. After scrutinising all documents for more than three days, they have come to the conclusion that there is no irregularity in the land purchase deals made by the Trust,” Giri said.The controversy over the land deals broke out on June 13 after former Samajwadi Party MLA from Ayodhya, Tej Pratap Pandey, and Aam Aadmi Party Rajya Sabha MP, Sanjay Singh, accused the trust of purchasing land worth ₹2 crore for ₹18.5 crore.The politicians alleged that on March 18 this year, Kusum Pathak sold a 12,080sqm plot for ₹2 crore to Sultan Ansari and Ravi Tewari, who then sold the land to the Trust for ₹18.5 crore, 10 minutes later.The Trust rejected the charges and said the land was bought at lower-than-market rates. Giri called the charges politically motivated. “People who have levelled allegations of irregularity are political persons. They do not want the Ram temple to come up in Ayodhya.”“A misinformation campaign has been launched to create confusion among devotees of Lord Ram. We want to assure all Ram bhakts there is no irregularity in any of the land deals,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-fraud-in-temple-land-purchase-claims-trust-101625167058050.html

As many as 5,044 people recovered and got discharged today, aggregating to 24,13,930 leaving 37,526 active infections, a medical bulletin said. As many as 23 districts reported new infections in double digits while there were no fresh deaths in 12 districts, the bulletin said. Chennai saw 249 people contracting the contagion aggregating to 5,32,759 till date. The number of Covid-19 related fatalities in the State capital also reached 8,191. The testing of RT-PCR samples stood at 1,63,654 in the last 24 hours, pushing the cumulative number of specimens examined so far to 3.30 crore. Among the 102 deaths, 17 were patients without any co- morbidity or pre-existing illness which include a 19 year old girl from Sivagangai. The girl who tested positive on June 29, succumbed to the virus due to the Covid-19 pneumonia on Thursday(July 1). A private lab in Madurai was recently accorded approval to hold Covid-19 testing pushing the number of facilities operating in the State to 272. Earlier in the day, Minister for medical and family welfare Ma Subramanian told reporters that the Centre in its recent letter to the state government had suggested that those interested in joining the proposed AIIMS in the state be accommodated in JIPMER, Puducherry, or the government medical college in Madurai. "All the three recommendations made by the Centre have challenges in their own way as the existing medical college in Madurai already has 250 students and if we are going to add another 150 as per the suggestion made by the Centre, a need arises to upgrade the medical infrastructure there. Similarly, admitting new students in JIPMER is also another issue as whether the students will be relatively studying in a different state (Puducherry)", he said. The Minister said the government was contemplating the idea of admitting 50 students each in the existing medical colleges in Madurai, Theni and Sivagangai districts. To a query, he said the idea was that the students after getting admitted to a different college would be studying there till the construction for new AIIMS gets over in Madurai. "Once the construction work is over they would be shifted to AIIMS in Madurai, a suggestion that was made by the Centre," he said. Noting that several months have passed since the foundation stone laying ceremony was held in Madurai district for AIIMS, he said a fresh agreement was expected to be signed between the Centre and JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) with revised project estimates. "Earlier, it was decided to set up AIIMS in Madurai at an outlay of ₹1,264 crore. However, we need to revise the estimates due to the delay in the project and the Centre was expected to sign another agreement with JICA who will be funding the project", he said. Subramanian recalled that Chief Minister M K Stalin had already taken up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June. He blamed the erstwhile AIADMK government for the project moving at a snail's pace. On the vaccination drive, the Minister said people in Tamil Nadu were keen to get the jabs. "We have been requesting the Centre for additional doses. In June they had allotted 41 lakh doses but it was enhanced by adding another 5 lakh doses. For July, they said that 71 lakh doses will be sent to the state. This morning we received over one lakh doses," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-logs-4-481-new-covid-19-cases-102-deaths-in-24-hours-101625165988955.html

The adult male elephant Baahubali (nicknamed by locals after a Telegu movie character) was found in Mettupalayam, in the foothills of the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district a year back. It had become routine for the locals to expect the tusker to roam around in residential localities, cross highways and enter their agricultural fields. The forest officials formally identified him as MP20T1 after they found him in Mettupalayam in 2020. The radio collaring operation, aimed to study the pachyderm’s habitat and movements so it can be restricted to the forest regions, started on Sunday, after residents complained that the elephant destroyed their crops and property. “He never troubled anybody and locals knew his whereabouts and timings. But recently, he began entering agricultural fields to eat and damage crops besides damaging pipelines and compound walls,” a forest officer of the Mettupalayam- Sirumugai forest range, who did not wish to be named, said. No person has been injured so far because of the animal. Three kumkis (trained elephants) were brought from Anamalai Tiger Reserve to assist them with encircling Baahubali so he can be tranquillised and radio-collared. Four teams, which included veterinary officers and surgeons, were posted in different locations, ready to fire dart guns. The operation went on for two days. “We came close once but the elephant mock-charged us,” the officer quoted above said. “He understood that we have been tracking him so he has remained inside the forest. About 70 of us are involved in the operation and we don’t want to agitate the animal.” The elephant is currently in Sirumugai. Coimbatore district has a floating population of about 300-350 elephants who move to Ooty and Kerala. “If we continue the operation, the same situation will persist, so we have pushed it by another 10 days,” district forest officer D Venkatesh told reporters earlier.

The incident came to light on July 5 last year when the customs department seized 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments, camouflaged as diplomatic baggage, came in the name of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Though four central agencies including, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Customs and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, have been roped into the case, the investigation so far has failed to make much headway since the initial arrests, officials of one of the central agencies said on the condition of anonymity. While main beneficiaries and dispatchers of the consignment are still at large, some politicians whose names came up in the course of investigation also remain untouched. So far, 32 people have been arrested in the high-profile case, which also led to major embarrassment for Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who removed his principal secretary M Sivasankar on July 7 last year. Sivasankar also had to spend some time in jail after ED named him as an accused in the case. The case also saw the Union government and state locking horns several times with the latter even constituting a judicial commission against ED, a first of its sort, alleging the agency’s bid to implicate many senior leaders of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), including CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the case. The ED later moved the Kerala high court against the judicial commission. The smuggling case was one of the main issues raised by the opposition parties during the recently- concluded assembly elections, but it failed to outsmart the ruling CPI(M), which played the victim card well, said political observers. The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front came back to power in the state, winning 99 out of 140 seats in the state assembly polls, results of which were announced on May 2. The NIA’s attempt to link smuggling with terror activities also failed to make an impact in the case. The NIA court in Kochi granted bail to 10 accused in the case in October last year, saying there was no prima facie material evidence to show that some of the accused in smuggling had any terror links. During the probe, differences among various central agencies also came to light, political observers added. “It is wrong to say investigation is slow. We have managed to detain main accused under Cofeposa (The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974) and brought some of the elusive accused from Gulf countries. We have served notices to the former acting consular general through UAE embassy last week,” a senior customs officer told HT on Thursday. The officer added that some of the politicians whose names cropped up during investigation, including former minister KT Jaleel and former assembly speaker Sreeramakrishnan, were not given clean chits. After gold was seized, three senior officials of the UAE consulate had left the country in hurry and probe agency had served notices to them through the UAE embassy, an officer aware of the developments in the case said on the condition of anonymity. As the case drags on, the opposition Congress has alleged a secret understanding between the Union and state governments. “We seriously feel there is a give and take between the two. The case was slowed down after the ED summoned the CM’s additional private secretary CM Raveendran, the CM’s right-hand man. Now all agencies are mum on the role of leaders,” Kerala Congress chief K Sudhakaran said in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. However, the ruling CPI(M) rejected Congress’s claim, saying it was coming out with new theories after its earlier charges fell flat. “The party made many grave charges against us, but all fell flat with the poll. It is busy searching for new ones,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, said the investigation in all cases was progressing well. “The central agencies are doing their work silently,” said party’s state president K Surendran. Amid tall claims and counterclaims, many independent observers maintained that the probe has lost its steam. “It seems after the elections nobody is interested in it. The initial speed and publicity is lacking now,” said political analyst Sunnykutty Abraham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-on-key-players-in-gold-smuggling-case-still-at-large-101625165317939.html
02-07-2021||India||Key accused in 2020 DJ Halli violence held: NIA||Bengaluru: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested an alleged key conspirator of the 2020 Bengaluru riots that left four persons dead. Syed Abbas (38), a resident of Govindapura, was later produced before a special court of the agency and remanded to six-day custody, the investigating agency said in a statement. Abbas is the ward president of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Nagawara ward in Bengaluru.“Investigation has revealed that accused Abbas is the president of SDPI Nagawara, Bengaluru Ward. He along with his co-conspirators...were actively involved in burning vehicles and attacking police officers on duty at KG Halli Police Station,” the NIA statement read. It added that further investigation into the case is underway.The riots in Bengaluru on August 11 last year were triggered by an alleged derogatory Facebook post by Naveen P, nephew of Congress MLA from Pulakeshinagar constituency R Akhanda Srinivas Murthy.As per a police complaint filed on the same day, a mob had gathered in DJ Halli and KG Halli areas after police sought time to initiate action against Naveen over his social media post. The attacks on public and private properties and vehicles and police stations began at 9.30 pm and continued till the early hours of August 12, according to the FIR registered atKG Halli policestation.The NIA release said the accused had set fire to KG Halli police station using petrol bombs.To control the mob, police had opened fire, killing three persons on the spot. Another person succumbed to injuries in the hospital.Abbas have been accused of rioting and being part of a mob armed with weapons, and attacking and injuring many police officers, the NIA release said. The NIA took over the probe into the riots in September last year. While Bengaluru Police had booked more than 400 people under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the NIA, in its charge sheet filed almost six months later, reduced the number of people booked and added sections of the Indian Penal Code against most of the others.Lawyers claim that several innocent people are in prison on false charges. “In the charge sheet filed by the NIA, only 47 people have been booked under UAPA. At least 370 people have been booked under various sections of IPC. Initially, when the case was filed, most of them were booked under UAPA by Bengaluru Police, which the NIA changed. Most of them were denied bail for six months because of the UAPA charges,” Mohammad Azhar, a lawyer representing some of the accused in the case, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-accused-in-2020-dj-halli-violence-held-nia-101625164958521.html
02-07-2021||India||Students face digital divide as online classes resume||Bengaluru Online classes for students in all private schools across Karnataka commenced on Thursday, after several months of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, digital classes for students enrolled in government schools are yet to begin, officials from the department of secondary education said, adding that mapping of children to determine if they have access to electronic devices and internet is yet to be completed. According to primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar, around 40% of students in the state do not have access to the internet or a mobile device, which denies them an opportunity to avail online classes. According to the state education department data, around 9.3 million out of the total 10.05 million students across private and public schools in Karnataka have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, television, radio and even email. Of the 9.3 million students, 5.8 million have access to smartphones or tablets and around 3.1 million are without any access to such devices. Further, around 5.1 million students have access to the internet while 3.7 million do not have access to the internet, rendering the exercise of online classes as a redundant practice for these children, mostly from rural and backward regions of the state, according to data. “Classes or material on television will commence from July 5. For online classes, we have asked at the school level to do mapping, which was delayed due to lockdown,” a senior official at the secondary education department of Karnataka told Hindustan Times on Thursday, requesting not to be named. In Bengaluru (rural, south and north), around 1.7 million out of the total over 1.9 million students have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, television, radio and even email. Of these, 1.3 million students have access to a mobile number they can be contacted on while 1.4 million students have access to smartphones or tablets. In terms of internet accessibility, 1.3 million students have the access to the internet while 401,269 are without the access, data from the education department suggests. The government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC), in its recommendations, argued that education is the fundamental right of the child and stated that reopening physical schools would optimise learning, physical and mental health and will improve nutritional aspects of children. “Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, trafficking, begging etc., making their condition worse,” according to the report, submitted to the chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led government on June 22. The poor access to online classes comes weeks before the state government’s proposed dates for exams for Class 10. Karnataka has decided to hold board exams for 10th graders on July 19 and July 22, in which all six subjects will be compressed into two papers, which will carry 120 marks each. Officials in the department said that in total, from class 1-10, there are only 61% students with access to online classes while another 10-15% have mobiles at home, which their parents use during the day and can be used by the student to watch and learn downloaded videos and classes at a time of their choosing. The state government has also decided to bring reforms in periodical reviews of students, like CBSE and ICSE boards, but the plan is nowhere near completion and is still on the drawing board, people aware of the developments said. The state government has begun teaching classes on TV and has created over 300,000 videos, classes and other content. However, data shows that 865,259 students across the state do not have access to radio or television in their homes. Kumar said they are now opening android banks in all taluka headquarters, where people could donate their smartphones, which would be distributed among students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-face-digital-divide-as-online-classes-resume-101625164957883.html
02-07-2021||India||MSC Bank case: ED attaches properties in case linked to Ajit Pawar||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday said it has attached assets worth ₹65.75 crore belonging to a sugar mill in Satara district in connection with the money laundering case involving Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank, while adding that a firm linked to state deputy chief minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra was involved in the case.ED said it has attached properties of Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana (SSK) situated at Chimangaon-Koregaon in Satara, worth ₹65.75 crore (as per the purchase price of 2010) under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA) 2002 in the alleged MSC Bank scam.“These assets are currently held in the name of Guru Commodity Services Pvt. Ltd. and leased to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd. Majority shares of Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt. Ltd. are held by Sparkling Soil Pvt. Ltd, which is related to Ajit Pawar, Deputy Chief Minister of State of Maharashtra and Sunetra Ajit Pawar,” ED said in a statement on Thursday.The action comes days after ED raided the Nagpur residence of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with the alleged money laundering linked to the extortion racket involving dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze.NCP chief Sharad Pawar had termed it ED’s bid to “harass” Deshmukh out of “frustration”.ED’s probe has revealed that MSCB conducted an auction of Jarandeshwar SSK in 2010 at undervalued price and without “following due procedure”. Ajit Pawar was one of the prominent and influential members of the board of directors of MSCB at the relevant time, ED said.The case is based on the August 2019 FIR of Mumbai police’s Economic Offence Wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msc-bank-case-ed-attaches-properties-worth-rs-66-75-cr-linked-to-ajit-pawar-wife-101625164297794.html
02-07-2021||India||Amid power tussle in Punjab, CM Amarinder meets leaders||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh met around 35 leaders from urban areas of the state on Thursday amid a tussle for control of the party, a day after his rival and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu met senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi VadraSingh’s meeting with the leaders, most of whom were Hindus, was aimed at calming nerves in the faction-ridden party and discussions focused on development plans and giving more representation to the Hindu community, said two people aware of developments. Punjab goes to the polls in early 2022.“Had a fruitful discussion with senior Congress colleagues from urban areas of Punjab. We have taken their feedback to strengthen the party at the grassroots level,’’ Singh tweeted after the three-hour lunch meeting at his residence.In attendance were current lawmakers, former MLAs, present and former chairpersons of boards and other government bodies, and four MPs. Current state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar was not present.On Wednesday, Sidhu’s back-to-back meetings suggested that the cricketer-turned-politician – a trenchant critic of Singh – had the ear of the Gandhis, though one party insider described the meeting as a “balancing act”. In June, Singh came to Delhi twice to meet a three-member panel set up to resolve differences but didn’t meet the Gandhis.The developments came amid reports that Sidhu may be given a key role -- including deputy CM or state unit chief -- but a member of the panel said the final decision will be taken by party chief Sonia Gandhi. “There will be a working arrangement here too between Sidhu and Captain Amarinder,” said Harish Rawat, general secretary in-charge of Punjab.Sidhu wants to be made Punjab Congress chief, a post that will give him significant power ahead of the elections. Singh is averse to giving him such an important role and has backed a Hindu or Dalit face for the post.A key leader present at Thursday’s meeting said that lawmakers told the CM that any changes in the leadership should have adequate representation of Hindus, who form roughly 39% of the state’s population and reside mostly in urban centres.“The message from this key community is that both the Congress state head and the CM. cannot be Sikhs. That position has to go to a Hindu,’’ said the leader quoted. “So Navjot Sidhu as Pradesh Congress Committee chief is unacceptable to them.”A second leader said several present at the meeting sought better representation in the Punjab Congress and upcoming elections. A third leader, a senior minister, said the ongoing rift was not discussed explicitly but some did raise the issue of delay in development works and complained about the bureaucracy ignoring party leaders. The chief minister assured them of quick action, said the minister.Tensions between Singh and Sidhu have simmered since 2019, when the latter quit the cabinet after his portfolio was changed. But the bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu and some leaders publicly accused Singh of corruption, prompting the Congress to set up a three-member panel. The panel met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on June 10. The panel recommended that Singh retain charge but Sidhu be accommodated in a key role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-power-tussle-in-punjab-cm-amarinder-meets-leaders-101625163277780.html
02-07-2021||India||‘CM, Sidhu will have a working arrangement’: Harish Rawat||Over the last month, the Congress has been trying to tackle a leadership crisis in Punjab as chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh faces a rebellion from some sections within his party led by cricketer turned politician Navjot Sidhu. Sunetra Choudhury spoke to Harish Rawat, general secretary in charge of the state and one of the members of the panel appointed to sort out the crisis, on the way forward. Edited excerpts:We recently heard Navjot Sidhu’s angry words against the chief minister. How are you all dealing with this?Sidhu ji has spoken on issues and the chief minister, and we are also addressing the same issues. They have spoken about “bargari” issues, drug menace and transport mafia; CM is also trying to address these issues. It is not a matter of any differences; it is just a matter of certain issues, which he feels should be addressed early.So, is Sidhu being made the deputy CM or head of the state Congress?It is for the Congress president to decide...Why is it that Rahul and Priyanka met Sidhu but didn’t meet the CM?The CM came to meet the committee, and there was no programme to meet the Congress president or the others... As far as Sidhu ji is concerned, he came to Priyanka ji’s house to talk about certain issues... and gave his suggestion...But will you manage to have both CM and Sidhu on board?In politics, we always talk about a working arrangement. There will be a working arrangement here, too, between Sidhu and Captain Amarinder.Don’t you think it’s bad for the party that it’s gone from a good shot at victory to factionalism?In cases where a party has a good chance of victory, there are always these pressures... I don’t think this will hamper the prospect of the party winning elections. It will be resolved soon.Finally, what’s happening in your state Uttarakhand?I think the BJP may be contemplating changing the CM. As per the provisions of the people’s representative act, it is not possible for anyone to hold an election within a year of elections being due... So there are only three options before the BJP -- changing the CM, Governor’s Rule, or early resolution of the house. All three will be the deep embarrassment for the party ruling the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-sidhu-will-have-a-working-arrangement-harish-rawat-101625163217662.html
02-07-2021||India||Covid-19 toll goes past 400k mark||The death toll from Covid-19 in India surpassed the 400,000 mark on Sunday, a grim milestone that comes at a time when several reports have emerged in recent weeks showing that the death toll from the country’s brutal second wave appears to be significantly higher than what official numbers suggest.While the pandemic has been in the country for a year and four months, data shows that more than 60% of all officially reported deaths have come in just the past four months (from March this year), or during India’s second wave of infections.Also Read | ‘Efficacy 67%’: Zydus seeks nod for vaccineOn Friday, 857 new deaths were reported across the country, taking the total number of fatalities from the viral disease to 400,364, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.The past month-and-a-half has also been marked by a series of states such as Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Bihar, etc, adding old fatalities that had gone unreported, pushing up daily death numbers in the country.This reconciliation exercise is reflected in the country’s rate of daily deaths. The seven-day average of daily infections in the country has dropped to 1,000 fatalities a day in the past week, from a peak of 4,191 for the week ending May 23 – a drop of 76%. This reconciliation, in fact, also started giving the Covid-19 death wave a sharp (and artificial) push for a seven-day period between June 9 and June 15 (see chart).The corresponding drop in daily cases, meanwhile, has been more prominent – seven-day average of daily cases has fallen 88% (from a May 9 peak of 391,819 to 46,937 in the past week).Meanwhile, in the past few weeks, a series of news reports published have used data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) – a national system of recording all births and deaths, under the Office of the Registrar General of India – to calculate the “excess mortality” reported across several states such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh.The analysis by three news organisations – Scroll, The Hindu and The News Minute – showed that the number of excess deaths in these states was as high as 42 times and as low as 4.8 times that of the officially reported Covid-19 fatalities during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-toll-goes-past-400k-mark-101625162917697.html
02-07-2021||India||Northern Command kept out of theaterisation ambit||The Indian Army’s Northern Command is the only single-service command that will stay outside the scope of the military’s theaterisation drive aimed at integrating the capabilities of the three services and optimally utilising their resources for future wars and operations, people aware of the matter said on Thursday. And a final call on the headquarters of the new Air Defence Command, one of the five new integrated commands being created , is yet to be taken, the people added.The Udhampur-based Northern Command is responsible for guarding the country’s borders with Pakistan and China in the north, and is the nerve centre of counterterrorism operations in Jammu & Kashmir.“The Northern Command will stay intact. We can’t take things lightly in that sector. As far as theaterisation is concerned, we are fine-tuning issues like command and control structures, leadership roles, distribution of assets to keep forces operationally ready and cross-service staffing at different levels,” a top official , one of the people cited above, said on condition of anonymity.The headquarters of the new theatre commands have been finalised, except for the Air Defence Command. The locations being considered for the headquarters of the Air Defence Command include Prayagraj, Jodhpur and Gandhinagar, HT learns.The Western Theatre Command will be based at Jaipur, the Eastern Theatre Command at Lucknow, and the Maritime Theatre Command at Karwar in Karnataka. The logistics command is likely to be based in Nagpur, where the Indian Air Force’s Maintenance Command is currently located. The logistics command seeks to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.Jaipur and Lucknow are the current headquarters of the army’s South Western and Central Commands. Though it does not house any of the Indian Navy’s existing commands, Karwar has adequate infrastructure to accommodate the Maritime Theatre Command.The initial plan was to base the Air Defence Command at Prayagraj — the existing headquarters of IAF’s Central Air Command — but a final call has not been taken, said a second official. “The Indian Air Force is keen to make it Jodhpur. Some have proposed Gandhinagar as an alternative as IAF’s South Western Air Command is based there. Creating new structures at existing command headquarters has advantages --- operational, minimum disruption during transition phase, cost benefits and better logistics,” the official added.The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country. The Indian Army and the Indian Air Force have seven commands each, while the Indian Navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands (except the Northern Command).“It appears that Northern Command will largely retain its current geographical area of responsibility. In case of Ladakh which has borders both with China and Pakistan, for operational and logistics reasons it is not possible to divide this sector between two commands,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).He added that it was perhaps felt that it would be preferable not to make changes in the current command arrangement due to the ongoing counter terrorism operations in J&K. “However, operations would be better coordinated if the western borders are under one theatre.”Theaterisation refers to merging specific commands of the army, navy and air force, and placing them under a theatre commander. Such theatre commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services.After they are initially rolled out, the Western and Eastern Theatres will be headed by army generals with senior three-star Air Component commanders under them, the Air Defence Command will be led by a top three-star IAF officer and the Maritime Theatre Command by a top Vice Admiral, officials said.The theaterisation model will have the inbuilt flexibility to fall back on current command and control structures to eliminate the possibility of the country getting caught off guard by its adversaries during the crucial transition phase, HT reported on Thursday.The government expects chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services by January 2023.The government has formed an eight-member panel under Rawat to fine-tune the plans and bring all stakeholders on board, especially the IAF, for speedy roll-out of new joint structures. The panel was set up last month after some differences on the theaterisation model emerged during a key meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northern-command-kept-out-of-theaterisation-ambit-101625162857686.html
02-07-2021||India||Guv, TMC row escalates ahead of House session||Relations between West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankar and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) touched a new low over a fake vaccination scam in Kolkata amid speculation on whether the governor will follow convention and read out a speech prepared by the state government to open the assembly’s budget session on Friday.TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy alleged links between Dhankhar and Debanjan Deb, accused of running fake vaccine camps and inoculating hundreds of people, including an MP, with antibiotics. He released photographs that purportedly showed Dhankhar standing near a man who Roy alleged was Deb’s security guard. The governor didn’t respond to requests for a comment. This is the second major allegation levelled by the TMC on Dhankhar in four days.On June 28, chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged Dhankhar was an accused in the 1996 Jain hawala case and branded him a “corrupt man”. While dismissing the allegation later that day, Dhankhar told the media that he was not bound to read out the speech prepared by the state government while inaugurating the budget session. “Am I supposed to read out everything that is written?” he said.This triggered speculation because in February last year Dhankhar wanted to edit the speech prepared by the state. The government rejected his suggestion. Dhankhar finally followed convention and read out the speech that was critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. On Wednesday, the governor shot a letter to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying he was “more saddened than anguished” at the allegation Biman Banerjee made against him at the June 21 national speakers’ conference chaired by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla.Biman Banerjee complained to Om Birla that Dhankhar was interfering in the functioning of the assembly and sitting on bills – charges rejected by the governor. “According to the intimation sent to me, the governor will address the inauguration of the budget session tomorrow. As far his letter is concerned, I will reply to it later,” the speaker said on Thursday evening.Earlier in the day, Roy released two photographs – one showing a man who allegedly worked as Deb’s security guard standing near Dhankhar, his wife and two other women, and another showing the same man standing behind Deb. “The man in the photograph is Arabinda Baidya, who worked as the security guard of Deb. In one photo, he can be seen standing behind Deb while in the other he can be seen standing near the governor and his family,” Roy said.Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh said: “If the TMC government has any proof against the governor then it should make it public instead of bringing wild allegations against him every other day.”SC notice to state, CentreThe Supreme Court has sought responses from the Centre and West Bengal government within four weeks on a petition demanding the deployment of Army or paramilitary forces in view of the deteriorating law and order situation following the post-poll violence in the state. The petition sought orders to the Centre and state to ensure the safety of the citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guv-tmc-row-escalates-ahead-of-house-session-101625162798944.html
02-07-2021||India||‘Efficacy 67%’: Zydus seeks nod for vaccine||Drugmaker Zydus Cadila said on Thursday it has applied for emergency use approval of its three-dose Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which has shown an efficacy rate of 66.6% in an interim analysis of its phase 3 trials.The company said that this is the first coronavirus vaccine using a DNA plasmid in advanced trials, and the first in India to be tested in a large group of adolescents. If approved, it will be India’s second home-grown vaccine, and the fifth overall to be cleared for use in the country after Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Moderna.Also Read: Zydus Cadila seeks DCGI nod for emergency use of its DNA vaccine for 12+ age“As the first ever plasmid DNA vaccine for human use, ZyCoV-D has proven its safety and efficacy profile in our fight against COVID-19. The vaccine when approved will help not only adults but also adolescents in the 12 to 18 years age group,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director of Cadila Healthcare, in a statement by the company.The clinical trials included 28,000 people who were split into two groups that either received the vaccine or a placebo. Among them were 1,000 volunteers in the 12-18 age group. The company has not yet released data from its previous phases.It also announced that the vaccine worked as well as a two-dose regimen as it did in the three-dose formulation that it was tested in, and data pertaining to that has been submitted to the regulator for scrutiny.Zydus, which aims to produce up to 120 million doses annually, said its study coincided with the peak of India’s second wave of infections and affirmed its efficacy against mutations, especially the Delta variant. It did not, however, disclose its efficacy against those variants.According to the company, the tolerability profile among the adolescents was similar to what was seen in the adult population. Primary efficacy of 66.6% was attained for symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases in the interim analysis.The company said there were no moderate cases of Covid-19 in the vaccine arm, though it did not disclose how many cases the interim analysis was based on.“We are making constructs for variants for future upgrade, if needed. Interim data has been submitted, and we will submit more data as it gets analysed to the regulator in due course. We haven’t reported any major side-effects for the vaccine. In fact, side-effects are similar to the placebo arm,” said Patel.Patel added that the vaccine candidate has exhibited robust immunogenicity, and tolerability and safety profile in the adaptive phase 1/2 clinical trials carried out earlier.On pricing, the executive said no discussions had taken place but added that this will be discussed once regulatory approvals are in place and will depend on doses, technology, etc.ZyCoV-D is an intradermal vaccine that can be applied using a needle-free applicator, which could help significantly reduce side effects.The vaccine is stored at 2-8°C but has shown good stability at temperatures of 25°C for at least three months, the company said.Experts say an efficacy rate of 66.6% is “decent”. “As per WHO threshold, 50% and above efficacy is approved for a respiratory vaccine,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The company has not begun stockpiling the vaccine, as it is currently in the process of putting together a new production facility that is likely to be up and running by July end.“We are currently in the scale-up phase. We could produce 5 crore (50 million) doses by December, with production likely to start by mid August or early September. Afterwards we plan to have a sustained production of 1-1.2 crore (10-12 million) vaccine doses per month,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/efficacy-67-zydus-seeks-nod-for-vaccine-101625162677713.html
02-07-2021||India||What is ZyCov-D, world’s first DNA vaccine for Covid?||Ahmedabad-based pharmaceutical firm Zydus Cadila on Thursday said it has applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the Indian drug regulator for its two- or three-shot Plasmid DNA Covid-19 vaccine, and plans to manufacture 100-120 million doses annually.If approved, it will be the fifth vaccine against coronavirus to be approved in India, after Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V and the Moderna shot. Here’s more about the jab.What is it called?Zycov-DHow does it work?It is a plasmid DNA vaccine. A plasmid, a small circular piece of DNA, is used to instruct cells for to make the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2. This helps teach the body to recognise a crucial part of the virus, to which it can then build defences. The shot is administered intradermally, which resembles a pinprick.How many doses is it given as?The vaccine was tested in a three-dose regimen, with the second and third given 21 and 56 days after the first. But the company said it has also evaluated a two-dose regimen and found similar results, hinting at plans to make it a two-dose regimen.How has it performed?The company said efficacy of its clinical trials in over 28,000 people came to 66.6%. However, the company has not disclosed its early phase trial data. Zydus said its study coincided with the peak of the second wave of infections and affirmed efficacy against variants such as Delta.The company added that the trial also included 1,000 adolescent volunteers in the 12-18 age group.How does it compare to others?The DNA plasmid vaccine works in a manner similar to the mRNA vaccine, in which the body is instructed to code for the antigen (the spike protein, in this case). The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (or Covishield) and Sputnik V deliver similar codes via viral vectors. Novavax’s vaccine delivers the proteins itself, while Covaxin uses an inactivated virus as an antigen.When can we expect it?Zydus Cadila managing director Sharvil Patel said the company hoped to be producing 10 million doses a month by mid-August. The roll-out will depend on the approval process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-zycov-d-world-s-first-dna-vaccine-for-covid-101625162617692.html
02-07-2021||India||Three decades of liberalisation: Banking highs and lows||The liberalisation of India’s banking sector started soon after the opening up of the economy, with the release of the first Narasimham Committee report in December 1991. Then finance minister Manmohan Singh appointed the committee on 14 August 1991, chaired by M Narasimham, the 13th governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Yet another committee, headed by Narasimham, was appointed by another finance minister, P Chidambaram, in December 1997.These two seminal reports laid the road map for the Indian banking industry — still work in progress.Let’s first take a look at how banking numbers stack up since 1991.In March I991, there were 272 scheduled commercial banks in India. By March 2021, the number was 121. There were 60,220 bank branches across India in 1991 – 35,206 rural, 11,334 semi-urban, 8,046 urban and 5,624 metropolitan. By 2021, the branch network has expanded to 158,373. The growth in the rural branches has been the least (to 52,773) but the branches in other segments have grown substantially. In semi-urban areas, the number grew almost four times to 43,683; in urban pockets too, by close to four times to 30,638; and metropolitan India now has 31,279 branches. One branch now covers roughly 9,500 people, down from 14,000 in 1991.In 1991, the deposit portfolio of the banking system was ₹2.38 trillion; and credit portfolio ₹1.32 trillion. By March 2021, the deposit portfolio was over ₹151 trillion and credit portfolio, close to ₹110 trillion.The first Narasimham report was the springboard for the initial banking reforms – deregulation of interest rates, end of directed credit, reduction of statutory pre-emptions and the entry of new banks. The so-called cash reserve ratio (CRR) or the portion of deposits that commercial banks keep with the central bank (on which they don’t earn any interest) was 15% in 1991. Now, it is 4%. Similarly, the banks needed to buy government bonds and maintain a statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of 38.5% in 1991. Both sucked out 53.5% of their deposits. Now, the comparable figure is 22% (4% CRR plus 18% SLR). For these reasons, the credit-deposit ratio was just 60.8% in 1991. This has risen to 72.46% after 30 years.The minimum loan rate, prescribed by the regulator, was 16% in 1991.In a free market, the current marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR), the floor rate for bank loans, ranges between 6.65% and 7.30% for State Bank of India (SBI), depending on the tenure of loans. For HDFC Bank Ltd, it ranges between 6.85% and 7.4%.The key to the business of banking is the quality of loan assets. The definition of non-performing assets and loan restructuring are dynamic phenomena. Following the Narasimham Committee recommendations, a structured framework was put in place in the early 1990s, after the introduction of income recognition and asset classification norms. Initially, this framework was meant only for restructuring industrial accounts. In 2008, its scope widened to deal with stressed non-industrial accounts. By 1994, the gross NPAs of all scheduled banks were estimated to be 19.07% of all assets; for public sector banks it was even worse with 24.8%. It took more than a decade to reduce those NPAs. Falling interest rates in 21st century allowed banks to book huge treasury profits; they used surpluses to provide for bad loans.RBI started tightening definitions of bad assets — classified sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets — early this century but the prudential norms were held hostage by government policies. PSBs held the bulk of the NPAs but since the government did not have the money to recapitalise them, the thrust was on forbearance. Infrastructure was the holy cow in the first decade of the century. There were many incentives, including a regulatory cushion, to lend to infrastructure. These loans were also continuously restructured, and enjoyed the standard tag.Sensing that too long a rope had been given to the banks for managing their loan books, Raghuram Rajan, who took over as RBI governor in September 2013, decided to tighten the screws. Instead of cleaning up their balance sheets, many banks indulged in what Rajan described as “pretend and extend”. They pretended that everything was fine and extended fresh loans to keep the books clean.To address this, the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits was set up in 2014. Once the banks started supplying data in real time for all loans of ₹5 crore and above, RBI found how growth-hungry banks were giving loans to large corporations even though their balance sheets did not justify such risk-taking. No bank wanted to miss out on the credit growth story. Between 2006 and 2008, bank credit grew at a scorching pace. It dipped after the global financial crisis but picked up again in 2011.Once RBI was convinced that the banks were camouflaging NPAs through fresh loans and other innovations, it launched the asset quality review or AQR, a first-of-its-kind health check of Indian banking, in 2015. The banks were given six quarters from October–December 2015 to January–March 2017 to clean up the mess.Before the exercise ended, there was a change of guard at RBI but the new boss Urjit Patel carried on the clean-up exercise with greater zeal. The gross NPAs of the banking sector, which rose to 11.2% in financial year 2018, dropped to 6.8% by December 2020. It is set to rise again because of the Covid pandemic, but that’s a separate story. The Narasimham Committee made certain other critical recommendations. For instance, it said the number of public sector banks should be reduced. There could be three to four big banks; eight to ten banks with nationwide presence; and smaller regional banks. PSBs should enjoy autonomy and the era of dual control, between RBI and the banking division of the finance ministry, should give up to the ghost.Following the consolidation drive by the government, the number of PSBs has shrunk from 27 in 2017 to 12 now. Seven of them are fairly large and at least one, SBI, is among the top 50 banks by assets, globally. The industry also welcomed new private banks in three phases – in early 1990s, early this century and in 2015. They are universal banks. While the concept of local area banks hasn’t worked out, two sets of new banks have made entry into the turf -- small finance banks and payments banks. Banking licences are now available on tap.Autonomy for public sector banks is still a far cry even though the government has taken many steps to make them independent. Shortly after a unique offsite of the CEOs of PSBs and financial institutions, Gyan Sangyam, presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then finance minister Arun Jaitley in January 2015, the finance ministry assured all PSBs freedom from interference by the government on commercial decisions, transfers, and postings, etc.It has also set made the selection process of CEOs of government-owned banks transparent by setting up the Banks Board Bureau -- an offshoot of the Indradhanush framework for transforming PSBs announced in August 2015. Describing this as “the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalization in 1970”, a government note says, “Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape.”However, there aren’t too many takers for this optimism. At the 2015 Gyan Sangam, Modi said banks would be run professionally and there would be no interference. He added that he was against political interference but not political intervention in the interest of the people. Such political intervention, according to him, would enable the voice of the common man to reach such institutions. This has been the story of India’s public sector banking industry all along.PSBs are political animals – the government’s milch cow, used for everything from funding infrastructure to supporting MSMEs; opening millions of zero-balance accounts for financial inclusion; buying government bonds to bridging the fiscal deficit; and subscribing to electoral bonds to help political parties.As we complete three decades of economic liberalisation, many are crystal ball gazing on the future of PSBs: In what form and shape should they be allowed to function? How many of them should exist? The government wants to privatise at least two of them. Let’s wait and watch. Their presence is a must to address market failures and for financial inclusion and MSME- and infrastructure-financing but we don’t need all of them.Indeed, consolidation has reduced the number of PSBs but not the government’s share in the banking industry. The problem is not with the ownership but with how the owner behaves.This is why even before any PSB is privatised, privatisation by stealth has already started. In the 1990s, before RBI gave licences to the first set of private banks to open shop, PSBs held 90% share of the banking market. In 2000, their share was a little over 80%. Now, they are much less than 60%. PSBs’ share in incremental banking business is far lower -- even in collection of deposits, despite the sovereign backing.That tells the story of Indian banking since economic liberalisation.Both the body and the soul of the industry have changed. The sellers’ market of the 1990s has become a buyers’ market. From addressing the cycle of life, the lifestyle of the customers is on banks’ radar now. Beyond meeting the financial needs, they are becoming a marketplace for everything one wants.Those banks which are changing in sync with time will survive and flourish. Others that cannot change may survive with the government’s largesse (read: recapitalisation) but the customers won’t care for them.(The writer is an author and consulting editor Business Standard.

02-07-2021||India||10 European nations recognise Covishield||Ten European countries, including key European Union (EU) members such as Germany and the Netherlands and non-EU states such as Switzerland and Iceland, currently recognise Covishield for proof of Covid-19 vaccination for travel.Questions about travel to Europe by Indians who have received the Covishield jab, which is the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by Serum Institute of India, have arisen since the vaccine has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).So far, EU members Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Slovenia and Spain, and Iceland and Switzerland, which aren’t in the bloc but are part of the Schengen visa regime, recognise Covishield for Covid-19 vaccination for travel purposes, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Thursday.However, travel between India and Europe remains tightly restricted. Of the 10 countries, India has an air bubble arrangement only with Germany, which has emerged as a key transit hub for Indian nationals travelling to Europe.Some of these countries, such as Switzerland, are accepting visa applications from fully vaccinated people who have been inoculated with doses approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) or EU or their national authority.Estonia has said in a statement that it recognises both Covishield and Covaxin for full vaccination of Indian travellers but officials have pointed out that travel between the two countries remains highly restricted. A statement issued by the Netherlands government listed Covishield among eight approved vaccines. However, Dutch authorities have listed India among countries and areas considered “very high risk areas where there is a virus variant of concern”.Also Read | Can Indians now travel to European countries? All you need to knowOn Tuesday, German ambassador Walter Lindner tweeted his country recognises a double shot of Covishield as “valid proof of anti-Covid vaccination”, but added that this does not “modify existing travel or visa restrictions for travellers from areas of concern/virus variants areas”.The Indian side has informed the 27 EU member states that it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the “green pass” from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc recognises vaccines being administered in India, such as Covishield and Covaxin.India also asked EU states to accept Covishield and Covaxin, as the vaccines have been authorised by WHO or the national authority, for Indian nationals travelling to Europe. Indian vaccination certificates can be authenticated by European authorities on the Co-WIN portal, the people said.The EU has said the EU Digital Covid Certificate or green pass is not a precondition to travel and individual member states have the option to accept vaccines approved by WHO such as Covishield.Covaxin is yet to be given an emergency use listing by WHO, and its manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, hasn’t approached EMA for regulatory approval. Apart from India, Covaxin has been approved by Guyana, Iran, Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Paraguay, the Philippines and Zimbabwe.The green pass framework, being implemented from July 1, is meant to facilitate free movement within the EU during the pandemic. Under this framework, persons vaccinated with four vaccines approved by the EMA will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU.These four vaccines are Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, Spikevax or the Moderna dose, and Vaxzevria or the European version of the AstraZeneca jab. Serum Institute of India has approached EMA for approving Covishield.External affairs minister S Jaishankar took up the issue of approving the Covishield for travel to Europe during a meeting on Tuesday with Josep Borell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. The two leaders met on the margins of a meeting of the G20 foreign ministers in Italy.The 27 EU states have agreed on easing travel restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers from outside the bloc to give a boost to the tourism sector, which has been hit hard by the pandemic.India has linked the issue of so-called vaccine passports to vaccine equity, especially in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-european-countries-currently-recognise-covishield-for-travel-101625126545695.html
