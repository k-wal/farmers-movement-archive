07-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC seeks explanation from Sirsa sessions judge on bail in drugs seizure case||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought an explanation from the Sirsa district and sessions judge in a narcotics case in which the accused was granted bail even as the matter was pending before the HC.The high court bench of justice HS Madaan, acted on the plea of G Hemavathy, a senior citizen, who was arrested in connection with alleged drug seizure case by the Sirsa police on March 21. The 70-year-old woman is a resident of Delhi, with permanent address of Chennai. She was travelling from Delhi to Sirsa with two others in a car in which 450gm heroine was recovered from a box. The FIR was registered on March 21 at Ding police station. The two other accused had claimed that they bought heroine from the woman. “Let the explanation be obtained from learned Sirsa sessions judge as to how did he entertain and decide the petition for regular bail when similar petition was pending before this court (sic),” the bench of justice Madaan said further asking the judicial officer to report whether pendency of the petition before the HC was brought to his notice by the public prosecutor representing the state or by the police officer concerned. The judicial officer has also been asked to explain how he released the accused on bail without considering the bar of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which says “no person accused of an offence punishable under provisions of the NDPS Act for offences involving commercial quantity shall be released on bail”. The bench also asked the Haryana government counsel to bring the matter to notice of director prosecution, Panchkula (Haryana) and director general of police, Haryana. The accused woman had moved a bail plea on May 24 against the dismissal of bail plea by the sessions court on April 27. The matter came to light when the accused, through an application filed in May 24 plea, had requested the court for withdrawal of the bail petition. “It is strange that the petitioner was availing remedy in two courts simultaneously,” the court said, adding that a perusal of the record will show that the accused approached sessions court on June 25 and the plea was decided on June 28, whereas the petition before the high court was pending before that since May 6 (taken up on May 25). The HC has directed the Sirsa sessions judge to submit the report on the episode by July 22 and registry has been directed that the same be put up before the court on July 30. The high court, however, has allowed the petitioner to withdraw the plea, which means she will remain out of jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-explanation-from-sirsa-sessions-judge-on-bail-in-drugs-seizure-case-101625682392488.html

07-07-2021||Noida||Paddy plantation delayed due to late monsoon, poor irrigation, say GB Nagar farmers||Noida A delay in the southwest monsoon and poor water supply in irrigation canals have taken a toll on the farmers in the district, who foresee losses in the production of basmati rice amid a 15-day postponement in paddy plantation.Rice requires a lot of water to grow and is the major agricultural produce for the Gautam Budh Nagar district, with a variety of basmati rice cultivated widely. District farmers said that they have paddy plants in their nurseries, or have revived from the state government, but to shift and plant those in the fields involve risks. Though the officials said that there are enough means of irritation, farmers — especially those without a tube well of their own — deferred. “Paddy is the main crop of the year, and we are totally dependent on the rains. The 15-day delay in the monsoon will directly affect our produce, and we are worried about it,” said Pradeep Dhalia, a farmer from Greater Noida’s Sonpur village.The plantation of the rice paddy usually starts in the last week of June and concludes around July 10-15, according to the farmers.“We have alternatives such as using diesel pumping sets for irrigation. Due to the high cost of diesel, it may cost me around ₹1,500-2,000 a day to irrigate 10 bighas of land. If I plant paddy through this method, I will have to keep irrigating for a week to keep the fields soaked and the plantation alive. This would cost me a fortune,” said Sanjiv Saini, a farmer from Greater Noida’s Saini village.Devendra Kasana, a farmer from Sunpura village, said, “Our nursery is ready, but water isn’t reaching our village through the canal as the channels are not being maintained. The plantation process should have been started by June-end, but it could not due to these circumstances. We will face losses this year, but there’s nobody to help us.”“In most of this side of the country, especially Uttar Pradesh, paddy plantation starts around June 22 and concludes by July 12. However, a lot of farmers are dependent on rains as field channels often dry up, not just in Gautam Budh Nagar, but across cities as well. As for farmers planting basmati, the produce is already lesser. While 1.5 acres of land yield about 50-60 quintals of hybrid rice, the same land would have only 30-35 quintals of basmati rice this year,” said Umesh Chandra Pandey, a Sitapur-based farmer.Officials, however, claimed that everything is under control. “Smaller channels get water alternatively, i.e., every 15 days. There are 69 irrigation canals in the city. They have enough water for irrigation,” said a senior official of the irrigation department, requesting anonymity.According to the agriculture department, while “irrigation is out of its jurisdiction”, it feels that the “plantation could be done right in time”. “The plantation could be done right in time as there are a number of private and public tube wells and irrigation canals. A number of farmers also have diesel gensets. We have also ensured that enough crops are ready in our nursery, and we have given those to a lot of farmers in the first week of July,” said Manveer Singh, deputy director (agriculture), Gautam Budh Nagar.“In 2020, Gautam Budh Nagar produced 430,000 quintals of basmati that was sold between ₹3,300 and ₹3,500 per quintal. Rice is the main crop of the city, followed by millet and maize,” he added.According to the officials, basmati rice is produced over 15,150 hectares of land, while hybrid rice over 200 hectares in the district.Meanwhile, according to weather analysts, the monsoon is likely to arrive between July 10 and 12.“The monsoon usually arrives around June 27, however, it got delayed this year due to dry westerly winds cutting the trough to Himalayan foothills. We expect it to arrive by July 12,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/paddy-plantation-delayed-due-to-late-monsoon-poor-irrigation-say-gb-nagar-farmers-101625682081013.html

07-07-2021||Lucknow||After Uttarakhand’s no to Kanwar Yatra, providing Ganga water poses major challenge for U.P.||Enforcing Covid guidelines and making arrangements to fetch Ganga Jal (water from the Ganga) after the Uttarakhand government’s ban on the annual Kanwar Yatra starting on July 25 will be a major challenge for the Uttar Pradesh authorities as the Yogi Adityanath government has decided to allow the annual pilgrimage in the state this year, said senior UP government officials here on Wednesday. Usually, a large number of devotees from Uttar Pradesh prefer to go to Haridwar in Uttarakhand to collect Ganga Jal.Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal said detailed guidelines regarding the yatra will be issued soon. “Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked to coordinate with the neighbouring Bihar and Uttarakhand and ensure Covid guidelines during the yatra,” he stated.Another senior government official said the state top officials were mulling over to coordinate with the Uttarakhand state authorities after the government there cancelled the Kanwar Yatra again this year, citing the pandemic and asked devotees not to come to Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga.“We are thinking of different options if devotees are not allowed to visit Haridwar to collect Ganga Jal. The options could be of providing tankers to fetch Ganga water from Haridwar and provide it to devotees within the state border as well as persuade devotees to collect water from Ganga passing through within the state territory,” a senior state government official said.The Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage carried out by the devotees of Lord Shiva who collect water from Ganga (usually at Haridwar in Uttarakhand) and offer it at Shiva temples in their respective states. The kanwariyas visit many places along the course of the Ganga to take the “holy water” to the temples. Apart from Haridwar, the kanwariyas visit Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand and Sultanganj in Bihar to fetch water from the river.These kanwariyas come from far-off places, covering hundreds of kilometres on foot.Last year, the pilgrimage was not held in Uttar Pradesh due to Covid-19 restrictions. Nearly 50 lakh devotees participated in this annual pilgrimage in the past, including around 10 lakh people only from the districts of west UP which are closer to Haridwar.In the past, communal violence after accidents involving kanwariyas, as well as clashes between kanwariya groups and people from other community, was witnessed in the state.UP additional director general (ADG) of police (law and order Prashant Kumar said the state police was chalking out a plan to ensure no law-and-order problem was created in case of restrictions imposed during Kanwar Yatra by the adjoining state. “We are in touch with Uttarakhand state authorities and trying to sort out the issue,” he said and added, “We are also trying to coordinate with the Bihar authorities.” The ADG further stated the state police were asked to make necessary arrangements like chalking out route charts for devotees, avert road accidents on these routes, intensify patrolling, keep aerial vigil through drones on kanwar yatra routes and make necessary traffic diversions.He said the directions had been issued to ensure that no meat shop was operational on the Kanwar Yatra routes to avert any type of communal flare-up and curb rumour mongering. He also said the district police chiefs had been asked to provide behavioural training to the police personnel on duty to deal with the devotees.In Varanasi, which is another preferred spot to offer Ganga Jal to Lord Shiva at Kashi Vishwanath temple, preparations have already been done following which Varanasi commissioner of police (CP) A Satish Ganesh held a meeting with senior police officials. In Varanasi, over 30 lakh (three million) kanwariyas from different parts of the region, including large number from Prayagraj and its adjoining districts, visit Kashi Vishwanath temple, to offer Ganga Jal and Sangam Jal (water from the confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati in Prayagraj).The Varanasi police commissioner said any decision regarding kanwar yatra taken by the government will be implemented. He said police personnel who were deployed in the security of Kashi Vishwanath temple and Gyanvapi mosque would be imparted behavioural training in order to manage devotees. He said that they had also been instructed to behave well with the devotees, including women, elderly people and children.Over 50, 000 devotees visit Kashi Vishwanth temple daily on other days in the Hindu month of Shravan on an average and the number goes up to 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh during Mondays of the month. Usually, kanwariyas from Prayagraj, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Ghazipur and various other districts and devotees from different parts of the country visit Varanasi in Shravan to take a holy dip in the Ganga and offer prayers to Kashi Vishwanath.In 2020, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, only around 30,000 devotees offered prayers at Kashi Vishwanath temple on the Mondays of Shravan. The figure was about 10,000 daily for the other days of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-uttarakhand-s-no-to-kanwar-yatra-providing-ganga-water-poses-major-challenge-for-up-101625681962355.html

A security guard of the four-storey building was injured in the incident, officials said. The incident was reported to the fire department around 11.30am, the officials said, adding that four people, including the guard, were trapped in the building. The play school -- Ravi’s Noddy Play School -- has been closed for kids for the past several months due to the pandemic, they said.“Our team reached the spot around 11.45am.

The guard was caught in the lift while three people, including a woman, were trapped on the third floor,” said Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. According to the fire officials, the area was not wide enough to use a hydraulic lift, so a crane was used to bring the trapped people out. They said that it seems the fire started after a short-circuit in the server room on the second floor.“The security guard had suffered smoke inhalation and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Rest of the people are fine,” said Vinod Kumar Singh, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.The owner of the play school, Ravi Kant Mishra, said that three people were doing some office work on the third floor when the fire broke out. “I had just stepped out of the building.

07-07-2021||Noida||Four residential towers in Kaushambi face long power outages||Ghaziabad: The residents of four towers in Kaushambi faced long power outages due to some technical faults since Monday night and the snag, although partially rectified on Tuesday, continued till Wednesday evening. Officials of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) said that there was fault in one of the cables which led to short-circuit of another 18 major cables attached to the four towers. The office bearers of the Kaushambi Apartment RWA (Karwa), the apex RWA body in Kaushambi, said that each of the residential towers has 80 families residing in flats. The affected towers are Shivalik, Kailash, Trishul and Kamadgiri. “The residents are suffering since Monday night. The PVVNL officials started work for restoration, but the supply was partially restored till Wednesday evening. Two of the towers hired diesel generator sets, but services like lifts could not be restored,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa. Though the officials of the discom continued work, Mittal on Wednesday evening tweeted the issue to office of UP chief minister and state energy minister. “No power for more than 40 hrs in 4 multistorey bldgs of Kaushambi Gzb. Pls take action,” Mittal said in a tweet. Niranjan Kumar Singh, superintending engineer of PVVNL who arrived at the spot, said, “The power supply to three buildings was restored and work is on for restoration of supply to the fourth building. The cables going to towers were damaged and we are getting these repaired.” Pankaj, chief engineer of PVVNL, said that the repair of cables going from transformers to the buildings is the responsibility of the local RWA or the developer, in case the building in not handed over. “The cables going from the transformers to the four buildings got damaged. Even though it is not in our jurisdiction, we are getting these repaired considering the summer situation and problems faced by the residents. Our engineers have been working round the clock to restore the supplies,” he added. Over the “jurisdiction” issue of the cables, Karwa president Mittal said that before the electricity code came in 2018, the power department was getting the cables repaired in case of a fault. “They were doing the maintenance before 2018. When the electricity code came into effect, they entrusted the responsibility to the RWA/developer. But we were not informed about the change. They have informed us now after the current fault took place,” Mittal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-residential-towers-in-kaushambi-face-long-power-outages-101625681661607.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Submit date of GR that allowed forming of fee complaint panel, Bombay HC tells state||The Bombay high court (HC), while appreciating the initiatives by the state government to address the grievances of parents concerning the fees, by forming the Divisional Complaint Redressal Committee (DCRC), sought to know as to when the notification for constitution of the Divisional Fee Regulation Committees (DFRC) was issued after the petitioners disputed the claims that such committee was formed. The court asked the state to produce the government notification on Thursday, failing which, it would be constrained to summon the joint secretary of the concerned department to verify the information submitted in the affidavit. The affidavit stated that the DFRC had been constituted and will start functioning at the earliest. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar and some parents was informed that though schools had been functioning virtually during the entire period of the pandemic and would continue to do so till the lockdown restrictions were lifted by the government, the court should direct authorities to get the schools to provide various reliefs to parents and not act high-handedly by increasing fees for the new academic year. The reliefs include collecting fees that were fixed for the academic year 2019-20, not hiking fees as no executive committees of parents-teachers and school managements were due to the pandemic and schools should allow parents to pay fees instalments and not debar the students from attending classes or appear for any competitive or board exam. Senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf for the petitioners further submitted that the education department had failed to constitute the DFRC as a result of which schools were demanding hiked fees in the ongoing admission season. Dr Saraf added that as the schools were not providing the various facilities that were included in the fees, the court should direct the schools not to recover such fees. However, the education department through the deputy director of education Sandeep Sangave informed the court through an affidavit that the DFRC had been constituted and would get in touch with the executive committees and seek information about the fee structure from them. The affidavit further stated that the state had constituted DCRC to address the grievances of parents in January last year and it was adjudicating disputes between parents and schools managements. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know from the petitioners as to how any orders could be passed against schools without giving them a hearing to which Dr Saraf responded that issuing directions in this regard to the concerned divisional officers would suffice. In light of the information furnished in the affidavit, the bench appreciated the education department but sought to know the date of the GR which permitted the constitution of the DFRC and posted hearing of the PIL to Thursday and observed that if the committee was not functional it would cause trouble for the parents and also result in the HC being inundated with petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/submit-date-of-gr-that-allowed-forming-of-fee-complaint-panel-bombay-hc-tells-state-101625681660971.html

But the civic body fears that lack of an adequate number of vials will hamper the spirit of the vaccination process.There are around 95 lakh people in the age group of 18 and above who are eligible for vaccination in the city. Data provided by the civic body shows 45 lakh have already taken the first shot of the available two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — of which, 11.50 lakh beneficiaries have taken both doses.Public health experts and medical practitioners said this might help subdue the effect of the third wave.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We have 401 vaccination centres in the city. Every day, we keep adding new centres. We have also started drive-in vaccination centres where people can get a shot of the coronavirus vaccine without getting out of their vehicles. We are also trying to bring the vaccination to the doorsteps of the slum dwellers. Through several initiatives, we are trying to increase the capacity of the daily vaccination,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Data provided by BMC shows that only 2.66% beneficiaries who have taken the first shot have contracted Covid-19, while only 0.01% of the individuals with both doses have been infected with Covid-19.Dr Honey Savla, internal medicine, Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central said that vaccination is an important cog in the wheel to fight the ongoing pandemic. For any outbreak of a disease, vaccinations have proved to be the most effective weapon. “More than 135 vaccines have undergone various trials, but only the safest and the most effective ones have been introduced. The first dose creates antibodies, while the second shot acts as a booster. which further strengthens the immunity in the body. Hence, it is imperative to take both shots,” he said.‘Lack of vials is slowing the vaccination’Despite having the capacity to vaccinate 1-1.50 lakh people daily, the civic body isn’t able to meet its target due to a lack of adequate vials. The civic body fears that this would slow the vaccination process before the anticipated third wave hits the city.The number of inoculations has not been consistent due to the unavailability of vials. For instance, on June 28, a total of 180,821 beneficiaries were vaccinated at the 393 vaccine centres — the highest number of people to be vaccinated in a single day since the start of the immunisation programme in January. While, on July 1, due to a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, all government-run vaccination centres in Mumbai were shut down. On that day, only 32,074 vaccinations were recorded.Due to the lack of vials, almost half of the vaccination centres in the city are not functioning to their full capacity. “We are expected to get around 1.5lakh vial from the centre but it would last only two days. But we believe more vials will be supplied soon,” said Kakani.Last month, BMC received around eight lakh vials. But this month, twice or thrice a week, the civic body would get a consignment of 1-1.5 lakh vials. “For uninterrupted vaccination, we need more vials. Unlike the beginning of the vaccination drive in January, the demand has increased drastically. So, we can’t afford to vaccinate 50,000-70,000 people daily,” said an officer from the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/47-citizens-given-first-dose-25-5-fully-vaccinated-in-mumbai-data-101625681601607.html

Dry and warm westerly winds and lack of rainfall (non-monsoon) and delay in the onset of monsoon have been cited as reasons by the weatherman for the soaring mercury.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast rain for Wednesday, but residents woke up to a heatwave. Weather analysts, however,said there is still a possibility of thunderstorms and rain over the next five days. “The maximum temperature may hover around 41°C on Thursday but we also expect light rain towards the evening that may bring respite,” said an official from IMD.On Wednesday, the mercury rose by over a degree in Noida, while the average rise in temperature across the region (NCR) was 2 degrees Celsius (°C).“The entire region of Delhi and Noida experienced a heatwave on Wednesday because there was no rain -- it should have rained on Wednesday. We expect rain on Thursday now, which may bring a slight respite from the heat. The region is getting warm, dry westerly winds, causing the heat to rise. There is a possibility of the south-west monsoon arriving by July 10 or 11, while rainfall (pre-monsoon) will pick up from July 9 onwards,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.On Wednesday, Noida saw a maximum temperature of 41.7°C and a minimum of 31.2°C, against 40.6°C and 28.7°C,respectively, a day earlier.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered the average for the National Capital Region, the maximum temperature was 42.6°C, 6°C higher than the season’s average, and the minimum 29.5°C, 2°C higher than season’s average.According to weather analysts, a heatwave occurs when the maximum temperature is either 45°C and above, or is over 40°C and 5 degrees above the season’s average.

The vaccine will be administered free of cost at all civic-run dispensaries, clinics, and hospitals.“The city has around 1.5 lakh children in this age group,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “All these children will benefit from the vaccine,” he said.The vaccine protects against lung infections like pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases. It will be offered under the expanded immunisation programme which already includes BCG, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis-B, rotavirus, measles and rubella.An estimated one lakh children under the age of five were killed due to pneumococcal diseases in India in 2010. The same year, nearly six lakh children were diagnosed with pneumonia. Introducing PCV in the programme will help reduce such deaths drastically.The PCV is given in three doses at six weeks of age, 14 weeks, and a booster dose at nine months. The civic body has already started preparing for the vaccination by training staff and arranging for syringes and other supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pneumococcal-vaccine-for-children-under-one-soon-in-mumbai-101625681540912.html

While the representation of the community was ignored the Apna Dal (S), which has influence only over a few assembly seats has been given representation in Union Cabinet with induction of Anupriya Patel,” he said.Warning that BJP might have to pay the price for ignoring the Nishad community in 2022 assembly election, Sanjay Nishad said, it was the prerogative of the BJP leadership to give place to alliance partner in the Union Cabinet, but the BJP leaders should know if the displeased Nishad community supports the rival political party in the coming assembly election it will not be easy for the saffron brigade to win 2022 assembly election.In 2018 Lok Sabha by-poll Parveen Nishad had defeated the BJP candidate from prestigious Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat.In 2019 Lok Sabha election, Praveen secured victory from Sant Kabir Nagar considered a tough seat, Sanjay Nishad said.A BJP leader who does not wished to be named said Nishad party chief Sanjay Nishad might be inducted in the state cabinet during the expansion of Yogi Adityanath government.Meanwhile, with the induction of Pankaj Chaudhary who comes from backward Kurmi community, the BJP has tried to consolidate its base among the OBC whose support is vital for victory in the Lok Sabha seats located in East UP.In 1990-91, Chaudhary was deputy mayor of Gorakhpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/praveen-nishad-misses-union-cabinet-berth-party-chief-gives-bjp-a-veiled-threat-101625681483484.html
07-07-2021||Noida||GB Nagar parents’ body to write to CBSE over new scheme for classes 10, 12||After the CBSE on Monday released a special assessment scheme for classed 10 and 12 for the academic year 2021-22, the Gautam Budh Nagar Parents Welfare Society (GBNPWS) said it will write to the board, requesting changes in the assessment scheme.According to the new scheme, the academic session will be divided into two terms, with each term covering approximately half the syllabus. The syllabus will be bifurcated by subject experts and examinations will be conducted at the end of term, on the basis of the bifurcated syllabus. The scheme said the board will conduct the first term examination in the month of November-December 2021 and second term or the year-end examination around March-April 2022According to the parents’ body, the term periods that the CBSE has set are not equal -- students would get just three months (from December to March) to prepare for the second term/end of year exams. “This scheme leaves just two to three months for students to study half the syllabus, after the first term exams in November-December. The second term also has practical assessments and it will not be conducive for students to prepare for all of this within just two to three months, whereas they are getting over seven months to prepare for the first term exams, assuming that the current session started in April this year,” said Manoj Kataria, founder of GBNPWS.“We will write to the board requesting that the first term examination be conducted in September-October instead of November-December so that the students are comfortably placed to score well in both sets of exams,” he added.Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School, Noida, also seconded this view and said usually, schools finish the whole syllabus of class 12 by November-December.“The first term has been given too many months by the CBSE while the second term has been allotted too little time. I agree with the parents’ body as we also have to prepare students for the second term examinations, which will have multiple choice questions, subjective as well as objective questions. Time from November-December to March-April is too little for students to prepare,” said Singh, who is also the CBSE coordinator for Gautam Budh Nagar.Kamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida, said, “The number of days can be better divided between the two terms. Usually, we hold half-yearly examinations around the 10th and 12th of October. This is decided after calculating the total number of days and then dividing them into half. I feel that November/December is too late for first term examinations and they should be advanced to September/October.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-parents-body-to-write-to-cbse-over-new-scheme-for-classes-10-12-101625681484091.html

The UPSESSB had issued the online advertisement for these recruitment exams on March 15, 2021 and the last date of application was May 20, 2021. The amended advertisement for these recruitment exams was issued after a gap of four months of cancelling the initial advertisement owing to legal hurdles, and had witnessed 310 posts of TGT getting reduced as compared to the first advertisement.

07-07-2021||Mumbai||Need panel to take care of hygiene, medical waste, Bombay HC tells state||The Bombay high court (HC), while stressing the need to have a proper medical waste management system and cleanliness and hygiene in public hospitals as they were necessary for the well-being of patients and staff, directed the state to consider forming hospital-level committees to oversee the implementation of measures to address these issues was required. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation filed byLokshahiwadi Balasaheb Sarode Smriti Prabodhan, was informed by advocates Asim Sarode and Ajinkya Udane that the medical waste disposal was neglected as a result of which the lives of the patients, staff and general public were put at risk. Though the issue raised in the PIL was restricted to Pune hospitals in light of reports that similar problems were faced in other cities and Mumbai, as well as the bench, observed, “Cleanliness and hygiene in the hospital are on top priority now. Ultimately, it is about human lives. So many patients are visiting hospitals and there is pressure on maintaining hospitals. We want authorities to pay special attention to deal with these aspects.” The bench then observed that as BMC hospitals were frequented by a large number of people, a proper system had to be put in place to maintain cleanliness and hygiene and directed senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC to take up the issue with the higher authorities. “We would request you to take up the issue with higher-ups. See to it that there is cleanliness. Each hospital must have a separate committee to look into hygiene. A large number of patients and relatives visit the hospital every day and there is a risk of getting infected,” said the bench. Ruing the fact that relatives of patients sitting in the corridors left trash there itself the bench added that it was another reason for the spread of infections and hence priority should be on proper disposal of biomedical waste as well as addressing the issue of cleanliness and sanitation. The bench while stressing that the committee should be a working one referred to the committee formed to oversee illegal constructions in 2002 and said that the committee had not met in a long time and said that the suggested hospital committees should be on the lines of the hospital in Malegaon. The bench recalled that the committee comprising of local public representatives and the commissioner was constituted four years ago based on the order of the HC while hearing a PIL. “In 15-20 days, the hospital looked similar to a private hospital. If there is a will, anything can happen,” observed the judge. The bench then noted that the local Member of Parliament had taken the onus of being held accountable which translated into a fantastic job. Hence, elected representatives of each constituency and ward should take such initiatives. Sakhare assured the bench that the civic authority would look into the suggestions of the petitioner and also convey the suggestion of the court to the authorities. Seeking responses from the respondent authorities, HC posted a further hearing on PIL after two weeks.Meanwhile, the Court, while hearing PIL on the issue of maintaining hygiene and cleanliness at public places while hearing public interest litigation filed by advocate Amrin Vandrewala directed the BMC to create awareness against the perils of spitting in public through audio-visual medium and also directed the government and police authorities to apprise their personnel on the need to maintain the same themselves so that it would deter the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-panel-to-take-care-of-hygiene-medical-waste-bombay-hc-tells-state-101625681480945.html

That is what destiny had in store for Ajeet who lost his left hand in a 2017 train accident while trying to save a friend.Ajeet, 27, who hails from Nagla Bidhi village in Etawah and is pursuing a PhD in physical education and sports, will pursue a gold medal in javelin throw at the Tokyo Paralympics, starting on August 24.“I lost all hope as nothing was left for me then, but today, I feel this is what God decided for me. Winning a gold medal at Tokyo will not only give me immense confidence, but will also help me start a new life,” said Ajeet on Tuesday, after finishing his day’s training at SAI’s Sonipat centre.Ajeet, who made India proud by winning the gold medal in men’s javelin throw at the Fazza Para Athletics Grand Prix, in Dubai, in February, said that his fight for gold at Tokyo would be against compatriots Devendra and Sundar Singh Gujar, who too, have been doing well in the discipline.“The fight for the gold medal will be among the Indians themselves as both my teammates are tough contenders. My mission will be to do better than those two and finish on top, that too with a world record,” said Ajeet, gold medallist at the 2019 World Para Athletics Grand Prix, in Beijing, as well.“The event at Dubai was perfect in terms of preparation for the Tokyo Paralympics. During the pandemic, it was really difficult to train and prepare well. But I managed by working out in the gym,” said Ajeet, adding, “If the train accident had not happened, I would have been aiming to become a sport teacher or a professor of physical education somewhere.”In fact, Ajeet’s story is among the most inspirational ones from the world of sport. Despite the setback, he has never lost hope and sought to work hard to be a javelin thrower and a terrific player at that.Ajeet, who threw javelin to a distance of 63.96 metres at the final selection trials in New Delhi last week, comes from a family of farmers, and holds BPEd and MPEd degrees.“I lost consciousness when I fell from a moving train near Satna in December 2017 while saving my friend. He remained unscathed, but unfortunately, I suffered multiple injuries, including amputation of the left arm below the elbow, several fractures, right hip dislocation and severe bruises all over the body.”“I couldn’t think of anything positive after that. But after being motivated by my mentor and coach VK Dabas, I came out of the mental agony and trauma. I still feel that winning gold at the Grand Prix Championship in 2019 in China and later a bronze medal at the World Para Athletics Championship at Dubai in November, 2019 did wonders to my confidence.”However, he said that before making his official entry to para sport at the National Para Athletics Championship at Panchkula, Haryana, in March 2018, he was quite nervous, as he was about to start a new life and was participating without complete recovery.“I threw the javelin standing and still won fourth place in this important championship. More than winning the medal, the main object of participating in the national championship was to learn and know about para athletics in general and para javelin in particular.”“I am thankful to my family, which never stopped me from pursuing para sport after the accident. They stood by me and it was my coaches and mentors at the Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education in Gwalior, who kept guiding me towards my Mission Paralympics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/invincible-spirit-lost-hand-but-not-courage-etawah-s-ajeet-sights-gold-at-tokyo-paralympics-101625681182814.html

We have approached all and hope to receive reply from them anytime now and immediately after that we shall plan to shift Dr Sharda Suman.”Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson of the institute said, “The state government has been kind to help financially. Immediately after our request, the amount of ₹1.50 crore had been sanctioned.”Dr Suman had tested positive for Covid while doing her duty during the pandemic. She remained in home isolation for a couple of days but had to be admitted to the Lohia institute, where she is doing PG in gynaecology.This is first of its kind case in UP where lung transplant is being planned for a doctor who got infected while on Covid duty.She joined Lohia institute in 2018 and got married on May 29, 2019, to Dr Ajay, who is also a resident doctor in the same institute.She performed Covid duty while being pregnant. “Doctors got her caesarean delivery done on May 6. Her baby girl is Covid negative and is doing fine,” said Prof Nityanand.“For the past 45-days she is on ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation) and as per the panel of experts who examined her case, she is fit for a lung transplant,” said Dr Rajan Bhatnagar, chief medical superintendent of the institute.“After expert committee report we approached the state government and chief minister Yogi Adityanath took personal initiative to get the financial support extended immediately,” said Prof Nityanand.The doctor had first fallen ill on April 12 when she got fever. The next day, she tested positive for Covid.

He claimed that UP has 70 lakh sugarcane farmer families and payment of interest will benefit each farmer to the tune of ₹20 to 25,000 thousand per acre.Singh also said that PM Narendra Modi had promised payment of sugarcane in 14 days otherwise farmers will get interest on delayed payment. “His promise remained hollow and payment of thousands of rupees of farmers is still pending with the mills,” said Singh. He said that the union government declared a relief package of ₹20 lakh during the pandemic. This amount could be either directly distributed among farmers, or distributed as loans to them. Once the mills release their interest and pending payment, the farmers would return the amount received to the government.Meanwhile, the Sangthan also has sent a memorandum to chief minister Yogi Adityanath in which they have demanded payment of sugarcane crushing season 2020-21, payment of interest on delayed payment, and to raise the sugarcane MSP to ₹450 per quintal in the wake of escalating prices of diesel, seeds, fertilizer and other commodities.CAPTION: V M Singh addressing a panchayat of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unhappy-cane-farmers-to-march-to-lucknow-on-july-15-101625680582056.html

It happened as the vaccination was being done without prior registration,” Sahu said. “No adverse events following immunisation have been reported among them but they are being put under observation.”A 20-year-old was the first to point out the mistake. Divyanshi Parmar said she discovered that she was given Covishield when she went through the vaccination slip and received a message on her phone. She confronted health officials. Later four more people, who didn’t want to be named, joined her to complain.Officials said their family members created a ruckus at the vaccination centre at Chhindwara’s MLB School.Health officials tried to control the situation by showing people reports of studies abroad on the effect of people being administered different vaccines. A UK study, for example, reported last week said a mix-and-match approach to Covid vaccines appeared to give good protection against the pandemic virus. Another study indicated that combining the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines could boost immunity.Saha made the point. “Foreigners are allowed to take different doses of vaccines. There is no problem with it but many studies show that it is more beneficial,” he said.Chhindwara collector Saurabh K Suman said: “We are inquiring into the matter and action will be taken after the inquiry.”(with inputs from Bhojraj Raghuvanshi from Chhindwara)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/5-people-in-mp-came-for-covaxin-2nd-dose-given-covishield-instead-101625679981314.html

07-07-2021||Other||When the Tragedy King introduced joyous Bhangra on silver screen||Chandigarh The story of legendary actor Dilip Kumar known for his intense melancholic roles in films like Devdas, Andaz, Milan, Daag and many others, cannot be complete without knowing that he introduced the Bhangra to Bollywood. This happened at a time when his co-actors, Raj Kapoor and Devanand, who, along with Dilip, formed the trio of super stardom clowned and flirted on screen with elan. Dilip’s Bhangra came in BR Chopra film Naya Daur, which was based on the theme of Man vs Machine, with the villagers successfully resisting the advent of the bus. As the peppy tonga driver wooing the pretty Vyjayanthimala, Dilip was the first hero to dance on the Bhangra on screen. The duet was penned by none other than lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi to the peppy musical score of OP Nayyar, ‘Udein jab jab zulfein teri’ (Whenever your tresses dance in the wind). The song and dance remains popular to date; the audience loved the star even more in his new Avtaar.It was a Markfed employee late Avtar Singh, who had played a major role in popularising the Bhangra on stage post-Independence who was called upon to choreograph this cheery number. When this writer interviewed him on the experience of teaching the steps to Dilip and Vyjayanthimala, he said, “Dilip was a Peshawari boy equally at ease in the Pakhtoon and Punjabi cultures and took to the steps at once; Vyjanthimala, from the South, too mastered the Punjabi rhythm.” The greatest compliment to Avtar came from yesteryear heroine Nargis, who exclaimed, “This is the first time that men have danced like men in a Hindi film!” Today, the Bhangra is an integral part of Bollywood. Punjabi singer Pammy Bai says, “There was a bit of Bhangra sequence with actor Manohar Deepak, brother of Avtar Singh, in the film Jagte Raho in 1956 but Dilip Kumar (Yusuf Khan) put the star stamp on the folk dance of Punjab.”In the mid-1990s when the then Punjab chief minister honoured Punjabi stars in Bollywood at the Mohali cricket stadium, it was Dilip who stole the show giving an emotive speech in Punjabi, saying: “The soil of the film-world in Mumbai was very hard and we Punjabis held it with our teeth!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/when-the-tragedy-king-introduced-joyous-bhangra-on-silver-screen-101625679141220.html

Although no building was razed on the day, officials said they are likely to start the demolition drive on Thursday.Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad, said, “We will start the demolition on Thursday morning. We are requesting residents to allow us to follow the (Supreme) Court’s order and to evacuate the village peacefully. They will be rehabilitated by the government and meetings are being held in this regard. All teams have been informed and all security measures will be taken care of,” he said.OP Singh, the commissioner of police, said that their teams are ready and will follow the instructions of the administration. “Our teams are ready. We will also ensure the safety and security of people during the demolition drive,” he said.The Supreme Court, on June 7, directed the municipal authorities to “remove encroachments on the subject forest land without any exception” and gave the civic body six weeks to complete the task.Krishan Kumar, a resident, said that they have been living in fear since June 8. “We were hopeful that the Haryana government will plan rehabilitation for us, but it seems they are not interested and are planning to throw us out to fend for ourselves. The people living in Chungi (an unauthorised colony in Delhi located in the vicinity) are safe and secure, and the Delhi government is supporting them by providing them electricity and water. The houses falling under Haryana are the worst hit,” he said.A few residents said that they are being “fooled” by the state government and that they are ready to resist the demolition drive. More than 2,000 residents were on their toes throughout the day in anticipation of the demolition process. When the bulldozers reached the village, social activists, mediapersons and local politicians also started thronging the area.Kiran Kumari, a resident, said that residents were earlier told that a decision will be taken for their betterment and that the demolition drive will take place only after discussing it with them. “We are not even going out for work, fearing our houses will be razed. We have not earned a penny for almost a month. How will we survive if the situation remains the same?” she said.Residents alleged that a delegation that was on its way to meet the deputy commissioner was stopped from exiting the village by the police.Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar with the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne, who has been studying Khori village, said, “The police have been stationed at Khori Gaon for the past three to four weeks and as per Section 144 (of the CrPC) stopping the residents from assembling and protesting. However, they have also been constantly threatening the residents, exploiting their ignorance and sometimes, forcefully getting them to fill surveys. So, what role is the police playing here?”Social activists alleged that the government had promised to rehabilitate residents, but no steps have been taken so far.Neelesh Kumar, a member of Basti Suraksha Manch, an organisation supporting the residents, said that the government on Sunday agreed that Khori residents would be rehabilitated and the plan of rehabilitation would be shared with them. On Monday, a meeting was held among residents, the deputy commissioner, MCF officials and the police, but a and final decision is awaited.Residents said that more than 50 officials of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) on Wednesday started removing various structures and installations manually, without using any machinery. They said that a large number of khaki-clad officials and district administration officials were present outside the village for more than five hours in the morning and left in the afternoon.However, the administration officials said that there was no demolition on the day and that the MCF officials were only taking stock of the situation in the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-demolition-drive-to-start-residents-asked-to-leave-peacefully-101625678781553.html
07-07-2021||Gurugram||Khori: Police helping residents find employment||The Faridabad Police is coordinating with private companies to help residents of Khori get jobs in other places as the residences are set to be razed on Thursday, officials said on Wednesday.OP Singh, the commissioner of police, Faridabad, said that a team has started collecting details of unemployed residents in the cluster, where a demolition drive is set to take place on Thursday. “We are coordinating with private companies in Faridabad, Ballabhgarh and Palwal, where they can get placement and start afresh. We will be helping them to prepare their resumes and also preparing them for their upcoming interviews, based on their qualifications,” he said.So far, the police have received details of over 200 such residents, most of whom are labourers. The police have also approached social activists working in the area to spread the word among residents.However, activists and residents alleged that the initiative is just an eyewash.Neelesh Kumar, of Basti Suraksha Manch, an organisation supporting the residents, said, “We don’t believe in this initiative of the police at all. If they want to ease residents’ pain, why are they forcing them to vacate and planning a demolition drive? They want to win their confidence and fool them to move out,” he said.Ram Avtar, a resident of Khori, said, “The Haryana government has planned nothing for us and the police are fooling us. Which company will give a job to a labourer and how much will they pay? Who will calculate the travel cost and other factors? We do not trust them or any of their schemes.”Singh said they decided to take the initiative as residents expressed concern over their prospects after the demolition drive. “They feared that if they would shift from here, they will not get jobs and will have to face a financial crunch. We are trying to help them in all possible ways and to bring the best opportunities for them,” he said.Additionally, the police also set up community meals at two spots, twice a day, for residents, to help them after the demolition drive. The police said that the food is prepared by their cooks and more than 200 families are being fed.Yashpal Yadav, Faridabad’s deputy commissioner, termed the police initiatives as a “thoughtful gesture.”“All the departments are supporting the residents in the best way they can. Residents should support the authorities and move out so that a peaceful demolition can be carried out. We are not their enemies, but want to support them in whatever way we all can,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-police-helping-residents-find-employment-101625678724979.html
07-07-2021||Gurugram||Truck operators seek reduction in fuel prices||Truck operators based in the city on Wednesday asked the state and central governments to reduce the price of petrol and diesel as they were facing difficulties in managing the operations due to high fuel prices. The truck operators, under the banner of Bharat Truck and Transport Welfare Association, also carried out a march from Mor Chowk to Mini Secretariat and submitted a memorandum of demands to the government. Ranvir Singh, the president of the association, said that running transport fleet has become difficult due to the rising fuel prices. “The government must revise fuel prices, extend moratorium on loans taken by transporters to buy vehicles and also ensure that the truckers are not harassed,” said Singh. The truckers also alleged that penalties for traffic violations have been increased by up to ten times and that these need to be reduced. They also said that there was a need for immediate relief to the transport sector, which is facing low demand and rising fuel prices and operating cost, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/truck-operators-seek-reduction-in-fuel-prices-101625678723464.html
07-07-2021||Gurugram||Snarl at border as commercial vehicles not permitted to pay toll in cash||Heavy congestion was witnessed at the Sirhaul border on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway on Wednesday morning as the concessionaire of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) allowed commercial vehicles entering Delhi to pay toll only using FASTags. The situation normalised around noon after the norms were relaxed and drivers were allowed to make payments in cash.The Gurugram traffic police said they were informed of the congestion around 9.30am and personnel were deployed to manage the situation. However, commuters said that the vehicles piled up from the border up to Iffco Chowk for three hours.An order issued by Hemant Kumar Fauzdar, additional deputy commissioner (toll tax), SDMC, on July 1, stated that the Supreme Court and Commission for Air Quality Monitoring have directed a cashless collection of environment compensation cess (ECC) and toll for specified commercial vehicles entering Delhi. “It has also been directed that commercial vehicles without RFID tags and sufficient recharge be not permitted to enter Delhi from July 1,” the order stated. Naresh Kumar, a truck driver who was stopped from entering Delhi, said, “If the truck is loaded, the fee is ₹2,600 but if the truck is empty, only ₹1,200 has to be paid. However, the RFID tags don’t differentiate this.” A senior official of Sahakar Global Ltd- JV, the concessionaire for SDMC, said, “We tried to ensure the RFID tags are read quickly and those who didn’t have them were issued one at the toll gate. The discrepancy in payment at full load and when the vehicles are empty is an issue, but we will try to get it resolved.” The concessionaire said that they will try to make the process smooth so that there is no congestion. “This was the first day of strict implementation but things will improve in the next few days,” the official cited above said. Karan Singh, the traffic inspector with the Gurugram police under whose jurisdiction the toll plaza falls, said, “Our team reached the spot immediately and jersey barriers at the toll were removed as well as on the main carriageway to ensure smooth vehicle movement. A large number of commercial vehicles did not have RFID tags, due to which they were stopped and this led to congestion. We will be sending our teams in the morning for the next few days to ensure there are no jams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/snarl-at-border-as-commercial-vehicles-not-permitted-to-pay-toll-in-cash-101625678722803.html
07-07-2021||Gurugram||MCG designates five spots for dumping C&D waste||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has finalised five sites for dumping construction and demolition (C&D) waste, a release issued by the civic body on Wednesday stated. These sites are located in Sector 56, Kadipur, Transport Nagar, Wazirabad and Pwala Khasrupur. Disposal of C&D waste is a major issue in the city, as dumping of such waste on vacant plots is considered a major source of pollution.While Wazirabad and Sector 56 are located near the Golf Course Road and Golf Course Extension Road, respectively, Kadipur is located in Sector 10, Transport Nagar in Sector 33, next to Rajiv Chowk, and Pwala Khasrupur in Sector 110, adjacent to the Dwarka Expressway.The locations of the five sites or secondary points were shared by civic officials during a review meeting held by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja regarding C&D waste management at the Sector 34 office on Wednesday. Ahuja said that in addition to the designated places, debris should be cleared from roadsides and vacant plots.“For processing the debris, IL&FS (the concessionaire for handling C&D waste) has set up a plant at Basai, which is currently operating at a capacity of 300 tonnes per day. An agency was also hired for door-to-door collection of debris from households and subsequently, dump it at the secondary points. IL&FS is responsible for transporting debris from the secondary points to the Basai plant,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG.Ahuja said that more sites should be identified for not only dumping the waste but also processing the same. The MCG has two mobile C&D waste units, each of which can process around 200 tonnes of waste per day. They currently operate in areas around Basai Road. Ahuja also directed the officials concerned to increase the capacity of the Basai plant. Further, Ahuja directed officials to prepare an inventory of the debris lying across the city and ensure that the same is picked up by IL&FS, as per a schedule.The Basai C&D plant opened in December 2019. As per MCG officials, the plant has a maximum capacity to process around 1,500 tonnes of waste per day.The MCG commissioner also directed civic officials to keep a check on unauthorised dumping of C&D waste and penalise offenders for violations, which carry a minimum fine of ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-designates-five-spots-for-dumping-c-d-waste-101625678722072.html
07-07-2021||Gurugram||Registry of plots smaller than one acre under admin scanner||A team of revenue department and municipal officials will scrutinise registration records of plots smaller than one acre, over the last three months, to ensure that the process was done only after a no-objection certificate was issued by the town and country planning department (DTCP), officials of the district administration said on Wednesday.Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that registration of small plots should be checked regularly to prevent unauthorised colonies. As per the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975, a no-objection certificate (NOC) is required from DTCP for the registration of plots smaller than one acre.“The team will comprise the district revenue officer, a senior official from MCG and other members who shall check whether NOC has been obtained wherever it is required under Haryana Development and Management of Urban Areas Act. There has been a tendency among property owners to subdivide agricultural land into smaller plots and get these registered so these can be sold as residential plots. A lot of steps have been taken to curb this practice and this is one more step in this direction,” said Garg.To curb registration of smaller plots and stop registries without NOC from DTCP, the Haryana government banned the registration of properties for almost a month from July 22 last year. It was observed that most of the plots were registered in violation of Section 7A of the Haryana Development Act, 1975. In September 2020, the state government amended the rules and made NOCs mandatory for the registration of plots smaller than one acre, which was earlier kept at two acres.Garg said that to streamline the registration process, a majority of the process is now online and submission of NOC has been made mandatory. “We are working to ensure that the entire process becomes smooth while violations are brought down,” he said.Gurugram has 291 revenue estates and land records of a majority of these have been digitized, according to officials of the revenue department.DTCP officials said they are working in coordination with the district administration to prevent violations. “It has been observed that in many cases, owners obtain NOC first and later carry out subdivision of large plots. Wherever we come to know that application for NOC is bona fide, it is issued within 15 days, but, in case the purpose is illegal plotting, we refuse to issue the same,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/registry-of-plots-smaller-than-one-acre-under-admin-scanner-101625678720662.html
07-07-2021||Gurugram||Mobile bar in private bus busted, owner-cum-driver booked for bootlegging||The police on Tuesday night arrested the owner-cum-driver of a private bus from Rajiv Chowk for allegedly running a mobile bar on service lanes of the expressway and bootlegging liquor to Madhubani in Bihar, his home town.The police said that the suspect, identified as 30-year-old Subhash Kumar, ferried tables and crockery in the vehicle and used to set up the bar in the night, charging double price for bottles of liquor. He also tied up with small eateries for delivering food and used to take a 20% cut from them, they said.Ten cases of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) were recovered from the boot of the vehicle.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that he used to smuggle liquor to Bihar to make a quick buck, as it is a dry state. “He used to ferry passengers from Gurugram to Darbhanga (in Bihar), almost a 1,200-kilometre trip, twice a week. On other nights, he used to park his bus on the service lane near Rajiv Chowk or Hero Honda Chowk and run the mobile bar,” he said.“He used to smuggle at least 150 cases of liquor to Bihar every month, to sell them at double the price. He had bought the bus on loan and was planning to buy another bus this year,” he said. Sangwan said he had been using his bus to serve liquor for the past one year. However, the police were able to track the vehicles only on Tuesday night, when a patrol team from Manesar noticed loud music being played in the bus and liquor being served.Kumar used to make nearly ₹8,000 per night. Six tables and crockery were also found inside the bus. The police said he hired a helper to clean the bus and tables, and used to run the operations at spots frequented by drivers and commuters.The police said he started smuggling liquor and running the mobile bar since a lockdown was announced in March 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19.Kumar was booked under relevant sections of the Excise Act and the Disaster Management Act at the Sadar police station. He was produced in court on Wednesday and sent to 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mobile-bar-in-private-bus-busted-owner-cum-driver-booked-for-bootlegging-101625678660522.html
07-07-2021||Pune||Monsoon to revive from July 9 in Pune||PUNE As Pune has seen hotter days with intense rainfall spell over the last few days, Meteorologists said that it was due to the local instability of weather over the city. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune, said that the Southwest Monsoon is weak and the temperature during the day is seeing a rise as there is heating of the earth’s surface. “The monsoon is likely to be active from July 9 in Maharashtra and Pune.Ghat areas may have received isolated heavy rainfall. Along with Pune, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Konkan and Goa and Vidarbha will also receive monsoon rainfall as the monsoon current will get strong,” said Kashyapi. So far, between June 1 and July 7, rainfall in Pune was at 163 millimeters (mm), 17.1 mm deficient as per IMD. Shivajinagar on Wednesday reported a maximum temperature of 33.5 degrees Celsius, 4.5 degrees warmer than normal. Lohegaon reported a maximum of 34.1 degrees Celsius, 5.1 degrees Celsius warmer than normal. Temperatures across the State have seen a rise as well. The highest maximum temperature reported on Wednesday, was 40 degrees Celsius at Akola, and the lowest minimum temperature reported was 18.3 degrees Celsius in Mahabaleshwar. Kashyapi said that this is due to local instability. “There is a huge cloud cover over Pune as per models of Wednesday evening. There is mixture in the air due to the flow of westerlies. This inflow of moisture is likely to increase by 10 per cent in the next few days. There is high moisture and rise in temperature which is causing local instability. In the afternoon time there is formatting of cumulus clouds followed by cumulonimbus clouds, because of which there is thunder and lightning,” said Kashyapi. “Due to the strengthening of the Southwest Monsoon over the Arabian Sea there is a likely formation of a low pressure area over west-central Bay of Bengal around July 11. Due to this, enhanced rainfall activity is very likely along the west coast from July 9 onwards. Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls is very likely over Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Coastal and South Interior Karnataka, and Kerala and Mahe, between July 9 and July 11,” said IMD officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monsoon-to-revive-from-july-9-in-pune-101625676740139.html
07-07-2021||Patna||Just one berth for JD(U) in Union cabinet; top leaders left fuming||There was palpable anger in Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) after it became clear on Wednesday that the party was being given just one berth in the union cabinet, an offer it had summarily dismissed in 2019 and refused to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government which returned to power under Narendra Modi. Though no one was willing to come on record to comment, top JD(U) leaders said the overall mood in the party was one of dejection since there has been a strong buzz that the party would get at least four berths.R C P Singh, JD(U)’s national president, was the lone face from the party to be inducted in the union council of ministers on Wednesday when Modi reshuffled his cabinet in its biggest overhaul so far. “It is embarrassing, disheartening… what is this? Everybody was talking of four berths and now you have to be content with just one. Then why this fuss was made in 2019 when one cabinet post was offered,” said a senior party leader, wishing not to be quoted. “We have been humiliated,” said another JD(U) leader who is a member of Legislative Council. In 2019, JD(U), then headed by Nitish Kumar, had refused to join the union cabinet, demanding proportional representation rather than a symbolic presence. JD (U) had won 16 out of the 17 Lok Sabha seats it contested in Bihar against 17 won by BJP and six by LJP as part of the NDA. One was won by Congress. Bihar has 40 Lok Sabha seats. Another top JD (U) leader said the party wanted four berths and had spelt out the formula for this. “The BJP has 17 MPs in Bihar and five ministers at the centre. But JD(U) has 16 MPs and not a single minister. In such a situation, JD (U) has asked for four ministerial posts, two cabinet and two state ministers,” said a JD (U) leader, wishing not to be named. “Now we have been put at par with the LJP, which has six MPs only,” he said.JD(U)’s state unit president Upendra Kushwaha, a former union minister, however, sought to play down the “humiliation”. “It is prime minister’s prerogative. Our national president had only said JD(U) was going to be the part of union cabinet. Rest all is media creation,” he said.Gyanendra Yadav, a political observer and associate professor (sociology) at Patna Commerce College, however, is of the view that JD(U) has been shown its place. “JD(U) has been reduced to the number three party (in terms of seats) after the 2020 assembly polls, yet BJP kept its word by giving Kumar the CM’s post. How long will BJP compromise after getting 74 seats in the assembly? It agreed to contest on equal number of seats (17 each) during Lok Sabha elections. It gave more seats to JD(U) to contest in assembly polls. After the poor performance of JD(U) in assembly polls, BJP has realized that the ally has been given more than it deserves. But just to keep intact social equations, the party honoured his demands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/just-one-berth-for-jd-u-in-union-cabinet-top-leaders-left-fuming-101625676500322.html

He is a Rajya Sabha member from JD(U) and its national president too. A native of Nalanda district, Singh is a confidant of CM Nitish Kumar and served as his personal secretary when the JD(U) strongman was a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. He also served as special secretary to Nitish Kumar during the latter’s stint as railway minister and later worked as principal secretary during Kumar’s stint as chief minister in his first term. In a surprise move last year, Kumar stepped down as JD(U) chief and handpicked Singh to head the party.Singh, who joined IAS in 1984, studied at JNU. He has two daughters. The elder one, Lipi Singh, is a 2016-batch IPS officer. Pashupati Kumar ParasThe younger brother of Lok Janshakti Party founder late Ram Vilas Paswan, is a sitting MP from Hajipur. Paras started his political innings in 1977 with his election as MLA from Alauli in Khagaria, a seat he has represented multiple times. Paras, 68, who mainly worked in the shadow of his union minister brother, shot into national limelight only last month when he, along with five of the six LJP MPs, staged a coup against Paswan’s son and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan and split the party. Both factions now claim to be real LJP. Paras, one of the founding members of the party formed in 2000, has served as its Bihar unit president. He has been minister for animal husbandry and fisheries department in the NDA government in Bihar. Paras is considered more an organizational man. He is said to have opposed Chirag Paswan’s decision to go alone in the 2020 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-new-faces-from-bihar-in-modi-cabinet-101625676260136.html

07-07-2021||Patna||Carry out assessment of flooded regions, step up flood relief operations: Nitish||Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar, who conducted an aerial survey of three districts for floods on Wednesday, asked officials to carry out realistic assessment of submerged areas and conduct adequate relief operations to ameliorate sufferings of the marooned lot.This was the second consecutive day that the CM carried out the survey along with water resources minister Sanjay Jha and departmental secretary Sanjeev Hans to oversee the impact of floods and ongoing relief operations across flooded regions.Later in the evening, Kumar chaired a meeting of senior officials of the district administration and departments concerned with flood management and relief operations. Chief secretary Tripurari Sharan and development commissioner Amir Subhani joined the meeting through virtual mode along with district magistrates of Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samastipur.Situation in around a dozen districts, criss-crossed by major rivers such as Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Kosi, Bagmati, Parmar, and Kamla, remained grim as the rivers were recorded to be flowing one metre above danger levels (DL) at different stretches along their course. Thousands of villagers have also relocated to highways and near railway tracks to save their lives along with their pet animals.At the meeting, the CM emphasized on conducting RT-PCR test of all those being rehabilitated in relief camps. “Those found positive for Covid-19 shall be isolated and treated with utmost care,” said Kumar, while directing officials to carry out vaccination drive among those affected by the floods. He also asked officials to draw up comprehensive plans to provide relief to the marooned people and assess the damage to standing crop for doling out compensation to farmers.During the review meeting, WRD minister Jha underlined that a vast stretch of north Bihar districts were facing flood-like situation owing to heavy rains and discharge from small rivers from Nepal. “All embankments of the department are safe. An intensive monitoring of embankments is being carried out round-the-clock with help of flood volunteers and locals. Advanced flood warning system is also helping the department avert chances of break of bund by swirling rivers,” said the minster.Additional chief secretary of disaster management department Pratyay Amrit also attended the review meeting.Earlier on Tuesday, the CM conducted an aerial survey of five districts in northern parts--East and West Champaran, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi--that have been facing floods due to above normal rainfall.Kumar had told media persons that providing assistance to those hit by such calamities has always been his government’s top priority. “In 2007, more than 2.50 crore people were affected due to floods and the government managed the crisis well,” said the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/carry-out-assessment-of-flooded-regions-step-up-flood-relief-operations-nitish-101625675720640.html

Tej Pratap’s younger brother and leader of the opposition in Bihar assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, had rushed to his Strand Road residence along with doctors on Tuesday night after he complained of illness. Dr S K Sinha, Yadav’s doctor, told reporters it could be a side effect of the first dose of coronavirus vaccine taken by him last week. “Body ache could have been a side effect. It could also be due to change of weather,” he said. Yadav brothers had taken the Sputnik-V vaccine on July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tej-pratap-falls-ill-better-now-101625675720025.html

Kutumba MLA Rajesh Ram is among the names Das has reportedly recommended to take over as the new state party chief, along with a set of senior leaders to be accommodated in various panels.Prominent among those who met Gandhi were former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar, former governor Nikhil Kumar, Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad, former Lok Sabha member Kirti Azad, former BPCC chief Anil Sharma, current BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha, Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma and former BPCC chief Shakeel Ahmad. They met Gandhi in the forenoon session while the legislators met him in the evening.Contrary to the AICC in-charge line, a majority of senior leaders are reported to have suggested that the party needed an aggressive upper caste leader to help revive its fortunes.A senior leader, who had one-on-one meeting with the Congress top brass, said the party required an upper caste leader even if it wished to continue its tie-up with the RJD. “RJD still depends on the Congress for upper caste voters, although Congress has alienated them with its allegiance to RJD. However, the upper castes, who are still looking for a good leadership in the state, might help the party regain its lost ground,” he said.Some also reportedly complained against Das, alleging he had prepared the panel without any deliberation with senior party leaders and workers. “One should not expect a miracle by installing a Dalit or scheduled caste (SC) leader in a highly fragmented society. The Dalits and extremely backward classes (EBCs) are still firmly associated JD(U), BSP and the left parties,” argued another leader.A senior leader present at the meeting said names of leaders Akhilesh Prasad Singh, Nikhil Kumar, Kirti Azad, Meira Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Prem Chandra Mishra and Tariq Anwar were also discussed during the discussion with Rahul Gandhi. As many as 16 out of the total 19 MLAs of the party in the state and all four MLCs interacted with the former AICC chief in the evening session. Former MLA and party spokesman Harkhu Jha said it was a formal meeting where the newly elected MLAs got the chance to interact with Rahul Gandhi. “The meeting with party’s top brass was put off due to the pandemic. The party workers would accept any committee for the state unit as finalised by the party high command,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rahul-meets-top-cong-leaders-from-bihar-ahead-of-state-unit-revamp-101625675600142.html

The plant is now running at only half of its load at 335MW (mega watt). Responding to the development, where it has lost another 300MW, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has ordered another round of operational curbs on industry, already making do with two compulsory weekly-offs. As far as the numbers are concerned, two units of 1,980MW thermal plants are already shut. One unit of the plant is down for the last four months, with the other unit tripping last week. The generation from private plants stands reduced to 2,175MW, against the installed capacity of 3,840 MW.On Tuesday, the maximum power demand was 12,969 MW. There was a shortage of 775 MW during evening peak hours, leading to the imposition of power cuts for rural and small-town domestic consumers. The PSPCL supplied 3,006 lakh units of power, with thermal units supplying 944 lakh units.The gross generation stood 5,031MW on Wednesday afternoon. The power supply from thermal units is now 1,600 MW, with hydel units supplying another 800MW. ENGINEERS FACE THE HEAT With the PSPCL resorting to massive load shedding due to the power shortage, engineers were left to face people’s wrath. Members of farm unions laid siege to the office of sub-divisional officer (SDO), suburban Maur, starting Tuesday noon. They were demanding three 10 KVA transformers, which were not available in storage room. Finally, the siege was lifted after a dozen engineers arrived at the spot around 1am on Wednesday. At the Karamgarh grid in Barnala, a crowd of nearly 500 gathered, seeking the end of power cuts. “It has become difficult to serve in the field due to the shortage of material. Long power cuts have drawn the ire of people and engineers are the first and easy targets for them to vent their anger,” said Jasvir Singh Dhiman, president, PSEB Engineers Association.PSPCL chairman and managing director A Venu Prasad has directed officials to take stock of units at Talwandi Sabo and ensure that they are operational at the earliest. The PSPCL is banking on the arrival of monsoon to ease the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-shortage-worsens-3rd-unit-at-talwandi-sabo-working-at-50-load-101625674340848.html

The new version of the gate would be exactly the same as it used to be in 1847 — the year when the construction of the Sibtainabad Imambada was completed, said officials with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the agency undertaking the restoration exercise.“Funds have been allocated for the re-construction of Sibtainabad Imambada gate. The job is expected to be completed by October-end,” said Dilip Khamari, superintending archaeologist, ASI, Lucknow Circle. Officials have also procured old photographs of the gate from the archives that shows the gate in its full glory. “Sibtainabad Imambada gate was one of the most beautiful gates in the city. But due to negligence and encroachment in its surroundings, the gate had fallen victim to apathy and eventually collapsed on April 2, 2020. Now we have launched a massive re-construction drive to bring it back to its original shape,” said a senior official with ASI (Lucknow Circle). Officials said they had hired a city-based firm —SN and Company for the rejuvenation exercise. This company has restored Gulistan-e-Eram, Chhatar Manzil and other heritage structures in Lucknow and other parts of UP. “The gate is one of the most beautiful structures. But prior to embarking upon the re-construction exercise, we first had to find out the cause of its collapse,” said Nitin Kohli, owner of the company and an expert who is leading the team carrying out the re-construction work. On studying the rubble, Kohli said it was found that the structure collapsed due to overloading. “Being an old structure, it was already weak. The encroachers around the gate had laid double RCC slab over the gate, which eventually brought it down,” he said. Kohli said the restoration work would be carried out in three phases. “In the first phase, we would ensure the removal of encroachment and the modern structures that damaged the structure to the core. Once done with the removal of modern structures, the second phase would comprise of re-construction and strengthening, which is the trickiest part,” he added. Why tricky? “In a general restoration exercise, we restore an existing structure. However in this case, there is no existing structure; we have to re-construct it from the scratch and then have to strengthen up. Hence, we have procured some old pictures of the gates and would re-construct the structure with the same dimensions, using surkhi, lime and mortar,” he said. The third phase would ensure its beautification, said Kohli. “The ASI eventually started the work. There is also a dire need of an encroachment drive as many shops are still running illegally within the gate. The district administration and the ASI should ensure that the gate remains encroachment-free in future,” said Mohammed Haider, mutwalli, Sibtainabad Imambada. Historians said the gate was built in 1847 along with the Imambada, which was started by Amjad Ali Shah, the fourth King of Awadh. But it could not be completed during his lifetime, and it was left to his son, Wajid Ali Shah, to complete the edifice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/outer-gate-of-sibtainabad-imambada-in-lucknow-set-to-regain-its-glory-soon-101625674040346.html

The proposal read, “The city is expanding and it is necessary to maintain a smooth traffic flow within the city. It is a fact that every resident of Pune owns at least two vehicles and some do not follow traffic rules. There is a need to strengthen the traffic department with new equipment, technology and adequate manpower. However, without these, it is difficult to maintain a smooth flow of traffic hence this proposal of adding 22 new signals with another additional 18 in 40 chowks.” “The budget required for one signal to be set in a chowk is approximately ₹1 lakh,” said DCP Rahul Shrirame. The names of the chowks for new signals as suggested by the traffic department to PMC are Shyamrao Ganjave chowk, Sahitya Parisad Chowk, Seva Sadan chowk, Takle Haveli chowk, Bhrahma hotel chowk, Panmala chowk, Neelayam Bridge chowk, VS Khandekar chowk, Kapil Malhar, Balaji chowk Pashan, Parnakuti chowk, Tarkeshwar chowk, General Post office chowk, Kharadi old Jakat naka chowk, Kharadi-Hadapsar bypass road, Durga Mata Mandir, Choudhary vasti chowk, New Airport road, Symbiosis school junction, Symbiosis law college chowk, Ramoshi gate chowk, Narpatgiri chowk, Beyur junction chowk and Handewadi chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dcp-traffic-proposes-22-new-signals-in-40-chowks-101625673319876.html

Yogi said other districts should also follow the Shravasti model to check the spread of the Covid.Categorized as an aspirational district, the fight against Covid pandemic was not easy for the health department in this district. When the second wave hit Uttar Pradesh in April first week, Shravasti reported 1,036 active cases on April 30 when the Covid graph was at its peak in the state.Unfolding the strategy adopted by the district to check the spread of Covid, chief medical officer (CMO), Shravasti, Dr AP Bhargava said the district has a large migrant population - people who move to metropolitan cities including Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata or states like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka in search of petty jobs.“We decided to focus on the migrant population. Surveillance committees constituted in rural and urban areas of the district were directed to collect information of people returning home from other states or districts. A health team was dispatched to their home to collect the sample of the migrants. If the report was positive, the infected person was admitted to health facilities. Samples of family members or close associates of positive persons were also collected for laboratory test,” he said.The personnel deputed at the Integrated Command and Control Centre took regular feedback from patients in home isolation. If they reported any problem, a rapid response team was dispatched to address the issue, he said.“In mid-April, the district was in the grip of an oxygen crisis. The district administration got supply from neighbouring districts to maintain the oxygen supply to the level 2 Covid facility set up at Bhanga primary health centre (PHC). Now, we have installed oxygen plant at the PHC to maintain regular supply of oxygen to the wards,” said Dr Bhargava.To check the spread of Covid, the district health department focused on RT-PCR sample tests and rapid vaccination of the rural population. Health teams were dispatched to the villages to clear doubts of rural population over the vaccine and motivate them to take the jabs at government facilities. The recovery rate is around 98%, whereas the positivity rate is zero, he added.“We have also started preparations for the possible third wave. The district administration has set up a 100-bed Level 1 Covid facility at Sonwa community health centre (CHC) while a 40-bed paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Laxmanpur health centre and a 20-bed PICU at Sonwa health centre have been set up. We are also setting up PICUs at Goura and Maldipur health centres. Door to door surveys in rural areas have been launched to check the outbreak of vector-borne diseases during monsoon,” added Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covidfree-shravasti-how-the-dist-admn-did-it-101625673259913.html

The association has called the move “a privatisation of the RTO”. The RTO staffers wore black badges while carrying out their official duties on Wednesday. “The registration work comes under the purview of the RTO department and the current policy of the central government takes away the official right. This is the first step towards privatisation and we completely oppose this move,” said association secretary, Surendra Sartape. It may be recalled that Union minister of road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, in 2014 had said that the central government was in the process of creating an efficient system in terms of RTOs. However, according to RTO authorities, the new dealer point registration method has proved useful and reduced paperwork . Once a customer registers the vehicle, the Aadhaar card, permanent account number (PAN) and related documents are uploaded on the RTO website, and then the customer receives an OTP. All payments from the distributor are then made, after which, the distributor gets the registration number and hands over a number plate to the customer. The distributor uses a digital signature when registering the vehicles. Documents no longer need to be submitted to the RTO office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rto-staffers-protest-alleging-privatisation-101625672899818.html

The property ownership has been established by the payment of property tax by the owners.PMC has already issued 4,000 notices to citizens found paying property tax, and claiming benefits under the urban poor health scheme. The health scheme is only for those with an annual income of less than Rs1 lakh.Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of PMC’s health department declined a comment on the issue. Another health officer, speaking on condition of anonymity said, “It is true that PMC had issued notices, but it is now going slow after opposition from political parties.”The allegation, as levied in the PMC notice, states: “Owning property in Pune city, means the citizen has a good income. Despite having an income of more than ₹1 lakh, they have managed to get a fake income certificate and take the benefits of the scheme.”Shiv Sena member Vishal Dhankawade had this week warned the PMC to stop issuing such notices. “It is wrong logic to say that those owning property are having more income. There are some citizens who are staying in old wadas and they are paying property tax. During the Covid-19 pandemic, whole families got affected, so people took the benefit of this scheme. It is injustice against middle-class families. We will agitate if PMC does not stop issuing notices to citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-goes-slow-on-action-against-health-scheme-beneficiaries-101625672779733.html

He said that the last year, the ministry participated in a conference in Sweden where a vision was conceptualised to have zero road fatalities in India by 2030. “We had promised that we will reduce deaths and accidents by 50 per cent. Today, we saw the success story of Tamil Nadu. It (Tamil Nadu) has reduced accidents and deaths by 53 percent,” the minister said. He also stressed that the government has taken various initiatives to put a check on road accidents and the Centre is also working on reducing black spots.

07-07-2021||Kolkata||Welfare schemes get lion’s share in Mamata govt’s Bengal budget||Welfare schemes, infrastructure, special rebate on stamp duty and amendments in road tax were the highlights of the ₹3,08,727 crore budget for 2021-22 that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government placed before the West Bengal assembly on Wednesday, around two months after being sworn in for the third time since 2011. The government said it was optimistic about creating 15 million new job opportunities in five years as committed in the interim budget presented on February 5 this year. The total revenue receipt for 2021-22, including grants in aid from the Centre, would be ₹1,86,681.26 crore and total revenue expenditure for the period would be ₹2,13,346.51 crore, the budget papers said. The expenditure on social welfare schemes would be ₹1,07,494.74 crore. Since finance minister Amit Mitra is unwell, the budget was placed before the House by industry and commerce minister Partha Chatterjee. “Our State’s economy has grown steadily in the last ten years. Gross state domestic product (GSDP), which was ₹4,60,959 crore in 2010-2011, has increased to Rs. 13, 54,518 crore in 2019-20, an increase by 2.94 times…. Expenditure in the social sector increased 10.11 times between 2010-11 and 2020-21. Similarly in the agriculture and allied service sector the increase was 10.50 times and in physical infrastructure sector it was 5.58 times,” Chatterjee said in the budget speech. Giving credit to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was also present in the House, Chatterjee said, “While India’s GDP growth dipped to minus 7.7% in 2020-21, Bengal’s GDP clocked a positive 1.2% growth from 11.3 %.” “The state has also successfully controlled all fiscal parameters like fiscal deficit, in spite of severe financial hardships in the last one year caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and cyclones Amphan and Yaas,” he said. Chatterjee focused on several social welfare schemes such as Duare Sarkar (government at the doorstep), the Swasthya Sathi medical insurance scheme and the recently launched student credit card. Offering financial relief, Chatterjee said that in view of the economic hardship faced by people the government will extend the one-time exemption on motor vehicle tax and additional tax from July 1, 2021 to December 31. Also, in view of the crisis in the real estate sector, the government reduced the rate of stamp duty by 2% from 4 to 8% depending on location, character and price of property. Also, the circle rate or market value for registration of deeds for land, house and flat etc. has been reduced by 10% . Both facilities can be availed only if the registration process is completed by October 30. Virtually addressing the media from his home after the budget was placed, the finance minister said, “We have always focused on giving more money to common people so that demand is stimulated. This will boost industries. The whole world is focusing on macro economics. The Centre’s policy, on the other hand, is to offer loans and reduce corporate tax. What has this achieved? Without elaborating on the large borrowings by the state to meet the shortfall in income, Mitra said, “processing of loans has been provisioned in the budget.” “The budget shows that we have done what we promised in the election manifesto,” said the chief minister. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised the budget saying it was an advertisement minus the mandatory disclosure clause. “The states follow various methodologies while calculating GSDP. The rate of increase announced by the Bengal government is not correct. The actual increase is by 2.4 %. It is true that in 2020-21 Bengal’s GDP growth was higher than the national rate. But it is also true that in recent years Bengal’s economy has shrunk in comparison to the national average. Had there been so much development people from Bengal would not have migrated to other states for work. This proves Bengal has fallen back,” said economist and BJP legislator Ashok Lahiri who was earlier the chief economic adviser to the Centre. “The budget talks about welfare schemes but the government has not said how many of these are assisted and sponsored by the Centre. For example, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is called by a different name in Bengal while the bulk of funds for the scheme come from the Centre. The budget speech did not disclose this,” said Lahiri. “The implementation of these schemes should be evaluated. We need to find out who and how many benefitted from these. There should be transparency. This government only provides relief, whether by giving food to the poor or pumping out water from flooded areas. But where is the infrastructure that provides permanent relief from these problems,” said Lahiri. “The finance minister has said that the state government has given 23 million Covid-19 vaccines to people but the budget document does not say how many of these were purchased by it and how many were given by the Centre,” he added. “The budget is also silent on north Bengal and people from the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities,” said Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/welfare-schemes-get-lion-s-share-in-mamata-govt-s-bengal-budget-101625670260359.html

The tribunal released another report on June 21, in which it kept its 2017 order intact but specified that it was subject to the finalisation of the SLP filed by Odisha government before Supreme Court. As per the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956 the final order of the tribunal would be operational once it is published in the official gazette of the Centre. It would have the same force as an order or decree of the Supreme Court.Also Read | Students of elementary edu course to teach primary school kids in Odisha“As three SLPs in this matter are pending before Supreme Court, the tribunal cannot be published in the official gazette,” said Raghunandan Das, Odisha water resources minister. The Odisha government has filed SLP against the tribunal’s order (dated September 23, 2019) issued for joint survey in the territory of Odisha. This case is also pending before the apex court.Srinivas Chokkakula, a fellow with New Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research and an authority on water dispute issues, said it is still not clear if Supreme Court would adjudicate in the Vansadhara water dispute case, though in 2018, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Mishra had allowed Karnataka to release less amount of water to Tamil Nadu than what the Cauvery water dispute tribunal had ordered. “The issues are complex. It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will adjudicate. It all depends on the merits of this particular case,” said Chokkakula.Vansadhara river originates near Lanjigarh village in Kalahandi district and Kalyansinghpur in Rayagada district of Odisha and flows for about 265km till it merges with the Bay of Bengal in Andhra Pradesh. Its river basin occupies 8,015 square kilometres in Odisha and 2,815 square kilometres in Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh started the Neradi Barrage Project to provide irrigation facility to 203 villages, covering an area of 107,280 acres of land in Srikakulam district.Stressing that the construction of a flood-flow canal at Katragada would result in drying up the existing riverbed and consequent shifting of the river affecting ground water table Odisha in February 2006 had sought constitution of an Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal for adjudication. The tribunal had pronounced its final order in September 2017, allowing Andhra Pradesh government to construct Neradi Barrage on river Vansadhara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-rejects-andhra-proposal-of-publishing-water-tribunal-order-in-official-gazette-101625668281012.html

The delay is being attributed to the state government not paying the board ₹427 crore as reimbursement for printing textbooks and fee for Scheduled Caste students since 2013. Director public instructions (DPI), secondary, which is running its office from the board building in Phase-8 has not paid rent and arrears since 2012, running up a bill of ₹20 crore. Employees claim that the Adarsh Schools have also proved to be a major drain on the board’s revenues. The monthly expenditure of the board is ₹15 crore, of which ₹5 crore goes in salaries and ₹5.5 crore in pension payment. The board has offices in each district of the state. Parvinder Singh, president, PSEB Employees Association, said, “This is the first time that the board has failed to pay our salaries. The situation is grim. We have provided textbooks to students on time, but have not got money from the state government.” He added that Adarsh schools had become a liability for the board. “Their expenditure is a big hole on the board’s budget,” he claimed. Board chairman Yog Raj said, “There is a major financial crunch before the board. We have already requested the state government to clear our dues. We hope for a resolution soon.” ADARSH SCHOOLS A MAJOR BURDEN Adarsh schools, meant to provide admission to brilliant but poor students, has proved to be a major drain on the board’s finances. The board constructed 11 Adarsh schools and spends ₹34 crore a year on these, but earns a mere ₹1.5 crore. This loss of ₹32.5 crore a year is eating into the board’s finances. In 2007, the board, under the then chairman Dalbir Singh Dhillon, spent ₹16 crore on the building of such a school in Mohali. The building has now been given to Punjab government departments on rent, but payment is irregular. In 2017, it was decided to hand over these schools to the government, but the move has not been implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-board-heading-towards-major-financial-crisis-fails-to-pay-june-salary-101625666120233.html

When [the] second wave hit, he allocated funds slowly…We asked for ₹3 crore, [but] he did not give and gave us ₹2 crore in six months,” the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Banerjee further claimed that the funds provided to the West Bengal government by the Centre is less than the actual budget allocated. She said that in the 2020-21 Union Budget, devolution of Central taxes for West Bengal was ₹58,962.55 crore, but the “actual devolution received was ₹44,737.1 crore,” thereby claiming that there was a reduction of ₹14,225.54 crore in the actual allocated funds.The West Bengal chief minister said that the same reduction was noted in 2019-20 Union Budget allocation, too. “Similarly, in 2019-2020, [the] state did not receive a devolution amount of ₹11,000 crore,” Banerjee added.She stated that the state will receive an outstanding amount of ₹33,314 crore from the Centre in the form of centrally sponsored schemes. “We are deprived of about ₹60,000 crore,” Banerjee said.The TMC chief also spoke on the increasing petrol and diesel prices across India, saying that the ruling dispensation at the Centre earned ₹3.71 lakh crore through increased fuel prices from the people. “Don’t you think Narendra Modi is cutting the pockets of the common people and filling his own pockets?” she told ANI.Notably, petrol prices in the national capital surpassed the ₹100-per-litre mark after the latest hike.Her remarks come on a day the Union cabinet is undergoing an enormous reshuffle, with prominent names such as health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and minister for environment, forest and climate change Prakash Javadekar among those who resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-takes-jibe-at-pm-modi-says-he-gives-more-money-to-bjp-states-101625665193321.html

Not just Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, Kanwariyas from as far as Rajasthan, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh travel to Uttarakhand every year during the monsoon season. But owing to thethreat of a third Covid wave, the state government has not allowed this yatra this year and also cancelled the pilgrimage to Char Dham shrines in the state.Uttarakhand’s director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said the idea of ferrying Ganga waters through tankers on demand basis was being discussed with the police of respective neighbouring states and concerned department officials.Meanwhile, traders in Haridwar are demanding that the government allows the Kanwariyas to travel to fetch Ganga waters, which in turn provides a huge yearly fillip to the local economy.“Covid-19 positive cases have declined sharply in Uttarakhand to less than 100 and 35, 000 in the whole country. A separate Kanwar fair standard operating procedures can be issued in this regard so that amidst safety guidelines Kanwariyas can arrive in Uttarakhand,” said Sanjay Triwal, office bearer of a traders’ body.Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal city convener Tej Prakash Sahu said the tanker service idea was impractical and insufficient to serve around 35 million Kanwariyas, who visited the state during the last Kanwar yatra in 2019.“Kanwar yatra is an ancient on foot pilgrimage practice so the authorities should ensure it’s held by allowing the devotees to arrive physically,” Sahu said.Ganga Sabha, which manages the affairs of Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat also demanded that the Kanwar fair was held while adhering to Covid containment guidelines.“It is about faith, perseverance, pain, physical and mental endurance that the Kanwar pilgrimage is all about. Covid is still a threat but we need to allow festive fairs, pilgrimages with Covid specific safety measures,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha.Last year to overcome the travel restrictions, Uttarakhand Youth Congress had distributed around 10,000 units of canned Ganga Jal to temples and Kanwar related social-religious organizations in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and the National Capital Region (NCR) region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/utarakhand-mulls-ferrying-ganga-water-to-states-due-to-kanwar-yatra-ba-101625665520350.html

07-07-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to check interstate transportation of agriculture produce||Madhya Pradesh has initiated the process of revoking the implementation orders issued following the passage last year of the Centre’s three farm laws. Officials said this is being done since the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the legislation in January.Thousands of farmers have camped at Delhi’s borders in protest against the laws which farmers say will benefit private buyers.Madhya Pradesh will check interstate transportation of the agricultural produce and resume taxation on it as part of the process. “The 54 checking points, set up at border areas to check interstate transportation of agriculture produce from Mandis, were closed in June last year after the implementation of three new farm laws. After the laws, the checking points became illegal and of no use. The Centre ended the power of the state government to impose taxes on the purchase of any agriculture produce outside Mandi,” said an officer of the state’s Mandi Board, who did not want to be named.Also Read | Protests outside Parliament will start on July 22, say farm unionsThe Board has cited poor financial condition and losses of ₹250 crore after implementation of the laws for re-starting the checking points, said another officer.BB Faujdar, president of Madhya Pradesh Mandi Board Association,, an organisation of employees of Mandi Board, said after the stay on the laws, the Board has started levying a tax of 1.5% on all purchases of the agricultural produce. “But due to confusion over implementation of the news laws, the traders, who are purchasing the produce outside the Mandis, are not paying the tax. A large number of traders are involved in interstate transportation of agriculture produce illegally.”He said by restarting these checking points, the government is not only going to increase its revenue but will also give security to farmers. “These checking points are meant to check the tax slips and also to check whether the trader has made payment of the produces to the farmer or not. This will end the issue of fraud with farmers.”Farmer welfare and agriculture development minister Kamal Patel said they are restarting the checking points to stop the illegal trade to other states. “Many people duped farmers and have taken the produce without taxation. Now, if any trader is found to be involved in illegal trading of agriculture produce, he has to pay five times tax as a penalty.”Patel maintained the farm laws are beneficial for farmers. “The three farm laws came into existence with the objective of increasing the income of farmers and not to increase the revenue of the state governments. We resumed the old practices due to the court’s stay order. If the laws come into force again, we will not levy the tax. We are strengthening our mandis by developing them into model mandis.”Madhya Pradesh Kisan Union president Anil Yadav said it is good the state government realised the loopholes in the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-to-check-interstate-transportation-of-agriculture-produce-101625663001381.html

07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Curtains down on British-era cinema halls in Shimla||Shimla, the summer capital of the British for 83 years, was once known for its cinema halls and theatres. After Independence, the Queen of the Hills became a draw for Bollywood with over 35 films being shot in town. Seven decades on, time has taken a toll on the tradition of movie-going but it’s the Covid-induced curbs over the past year and a half that have drawn the curtains on single-screen theatres. Home to three British-era cinema theatres, namely Ritz, Rivoli and Regal, Shimla has seen their closing down over the years and the two comparatively newer ones are on the verge of closure due to social distancing norms to keep the pandemic at bay. “Movie halls were an intrinsic part of Shimla’s social world. Within the town, both young and old went to the movies which was a big treat not so long ago. People coming from the rural areas would make it a point to watch a movie if they visited Shimla. A couple of folk songs corroborate this,” says Shimla-based historian Raja Bhasin. Down memory lane on The Ridge The hit film of 1960, Love in Simla, was also shot in town, starring Joy Mukherjee and Sadhna. Legendary actor and director Raj Kapoor along with Nargis and Prem Nath visited Shimla in 1950 to promote the iconic film, Barsaat. The premier show was held at Ritz near the historic Christ Church on the Ridge. “It was a great day for the theatre, and for Shimla,” says Ashok Kapoor, 69, who served as a manager at the Ritz for 51 years. “The cinema house has been shut since the lockdown last year. There is hardly any business left now. Viewership has fallen drastically,” he says. He recalls how the cinema house hosted a special show of Pakeezah in 1972 for Benazir Bhutto, who visited Shimla with her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the then prime minister of Pakistan, for the Simla agreement with his Indian counterpart Indira Gandhi. Crumbling under vagaries of time Rivoli was shut down in 2013 after the British-era building was declared unsafe. “Cinema theatres are no longer profitable. We closed it down after the building developed cracks,” says Vinod Seth, the last owner of the theatre. Regal cinema hall was destroyed in a fire in the mid-’80s. The building was later mired in a property-related dispute. Shahi, the lone survivor, for aam aadmi SRS Cinemas set up at the inter-state bus terminus at Tutti Kandi was also shut last year after the owners incurred losses due to the lockdown. Today, Shahi is the only surviving theatre but it faces an uncertain future. Set up as a theatre for the common man by Shahi Hakim, it’s located near the old bus stand. “This theatre was not located in the vicinity of the Mall as only the elite went to Regal, Rivoli and Ritz. During the British era, one could visit the Mall only in formal attire. Ordinary folks didn’t have a cinema to call their own. So, grandfather made a cinema hall for the common man,” says Sahil Sharma, the present owner. Hakim got Fern Cottage at Ram Bazaar from philanthropist Puran Mull, who gave the property in charity in 1929, and it was converted into a trust in 1930 with businessmen of Shimla as trustees. The trust converted a portion of the building along Cart Road into the Rai Bahadur Puran Mull Dharamshala, but the upper portion where the theatre exists today was with the Republican Party of India.The office was vacated and a licence to screen films was procured. The rates of the ticket started from 5 annas (30 paise). There were no chairs, but only benches and a labourer inaugurated the hall.Films began being screened at the hall from June 1953 and soon the theatre became popular with workers. Women avoided visiting it till it was decided that the 12 noon show every Wednesday would be for women.The benches were replaced with folding chairs when Dilip Kumar’s Mughal-e-Azam was screened.“Though we don’t want to close it down, the Covid restrictions are making it difficult to run the theatre,” Sharma adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/curtains-on-british-era-cinema-halls-in-shimla-101625660544711.html

After collecting this huge sum, he is sitting silently, sometimes preaching on Mann ki Baat. Sometimes, he should also talk about petrol, diesel, vaccines and dead bodies being dumped in river in Uttar Pradesh in his Mann ki Baat,” Banerjee said while talking to reporters after placing the state budget in the assembly. On July 5, the CM had also written to Banerjee had written to the PM to slash taxes on fuel. Also Read | Calcutta HC judge recuses from hearing Banerjee’s plea against Nandigram lossThe chief minister also attacked Modi over vaccine supplies, saying that the alleged mismanagement of vaccines by the Modi government is tainting the image of India. “I am not against you, but I have to raise political and economic issues. Today, we are facing an economic disaster. FIR is being lodged against India in Brazil. China supplied vaccines to Bangladesh as you didn’t do so. You have given Covaxin to students for which they are facing problem in going abroad. Indian’s image is getting tarnished,” she said. Banerjee was referring to Brazil’s Supreme Court authorising prosecutors to investigate their President Jair Bolsonaro over accusations that he ignored irregularities in his government’s procurement process to buy Covaxin from India. “The Centre should provide free LPG to all citizens. If I (West Bengal government) can introduce so many social welfare schemes, why can’t you? You have got ₹3.71 lakh crore and have earned extra from LPG. Above this, you have PM Cares fund,” said Banerjee. The ruling Trinamool Congress in the state has already called for a two-day state-wide protest on July 10 and 11 to protest against the rising prices. Earlier in the day, labour minister Becharam Manna pedalled around 40 km on a bicycle from his Singur home to reach assembly in protest against the hike in fuel prices. On his way, he was joined by Kalyan Ghosh, TMC legislator from Domjur in Howrah. “We all want the prices to come down. Prices are rising because the fuel prices are linked to the international market. The state and Centre should do away with the cess to bring down the prices of fuel,” said BJP state unit chief Dilip Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/pm-modi-should-talk-about-fuel-prices-vaccine-in-mann-ki-baat-says-mamata-101625658440055.html

On the afternoon of June 7, an accident at SVS Aqua-Tech company in the Uravade area of Mulshi, Pirangut claimed the lives of 17 people and the fire raged on for almost 40 minutes before the fire tenders could reach the spot.“There is a piece of government land which has been chosen and the district collector office has been informed. The area will be around two-acre,” said Diwase, chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune metropolitan region development authority (PMRDA).The land is government-owned and is currently used for a different purpose. However, this is not the only fire station that is awaiting a nod, as per protocol.Diwase added that the Development Plan for the entire PMRDA jurisdiction is ready and it has provision for several fire stations, trauma care centres, nearby police stations, and air ambulances in it.“There needs to be organised development. Every time a tragedy happens, there is a knee-jerk reaction from factions including the media. The fire station’s land-related work will take another 9-11 months,” said Diwase.As far as the DP of the region is concerned, a planning committee has to approve it before the plan is published.Kin of victims await government aid The state government had promised ₹5 lakh while the central government had promised ₹2 lakh from the Prime Minister National Relief Fund. While that money is yet to see the light of day, the company insurance money has started reaching the families of the victims.The deceased were identified as Archana Vaikant Kawade (36), Sachin Ghodke (24), Sangita Maruti Polekar (43), Mangal Baban Margale (29), Surekha Manohar Tupe (45), Suman Sanjay Dhebe (38), Sunita Rahul Sathe (28), Mahadevi Sanjay Ambare (40), Manda Bhausaheb Kulat (49), Trishla Sambhaji Jadhav (32), Atul Lakshman Sathe (23), Seema Sachin Borade (34), Geeta Bharat Diwadkar (41), Shital Dattatray Khopakar (43), Sarika Chandrakant Kudale (42), Dhanashree Rajaram Shelar (22), and Sangitla Ulhas Gonde (43).“We got multiple cheques amounting to ₹10 lakh collectively. The company has also promised a pension that will be 90 per cent of the salary that was drawn by those who lost their lives. We have encashed two cheques in July and will be encashing two more in December. Our pension work is remaining,” said Sachin Borade, who lost his wife in the incident.“We have given whatever papers were required in the talathi’s office. I have the cheques, but I have not put them in the bank yet.

07-07-2021||Pune||Pune Smart City project a failure, say opposition leaders, activists||Even as the Smart City Mission has completed five years, the city-based activist and opposition parties claim the scheme has failed as many projects are just on paper.Pune currently is ranked 15th at the national level on the Smart Cities list.Vandana Chavan, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and MP, said, “Smart City Project is a complete failure not only in Pune but at the national level and no one is answerable for the same. Now the government must think twice about forming a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) as there is no citizens participation. Even SPV is not answerable to citizens and the result is a failed project.”Projects which did not get kick start are smart parking, bicycles, non-motorised streets, Bus rapid transit (BRT) system, river water cleaning, riverfront development, slum rehabilitation and affordable housing, IT connectivity, transit hub at Balewadi and Intelligent Transit Management System (ITMS) for buses.Vivek Velenkar, a civic activist, said, “The government projected a picture that everything in the city will get smarter, but the ground situation is different. It is a complete failure. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not speaking on the project.”“If Pune is at the 15th spot at the national level despite the ground reality, we can imagine what happens in the remaining 85 cities,” he said.Total hundred cities get selected under the Smart City Scheme.Avinash Oak, a member citizen from Baner, said, “After the Smart city project was implemented we thought that our area would be developed completely. Wide footpaths were erected, but they have encroached. Even it is not possible to walk or pedal the cycle continuously on it.”The project is divided into two parts, one was an area-based project (ABD) and another was a pan-city. In Pune Aundh, Baner and Balewadi area got selected as area-based project and mainly roads got developed under it.Ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) members usually avoid making comments on the project at public events. Recently, city-based Sajag Nagrik Manch carried out the discussion on Smart City Project, but ruling BJP members remained absent during the discussion.Despite repeated attempts to reach Mayor Murlidhar Mohol for a comment on the Smart City Project, he did not respond to the phone calls.One of the officials from Pune Municipal Corporation(PMC) on condition of anonymity said, “It was expected that the Smart City Project would get good financial help from the central government, but we got little funds to execute the schemes.”Rajendra Jagtap, former chief executive officer of Pune Smart City, said, “Some positive things happened through the smart city project in Pune. A smart control room was erected by PMC which remained useful during Covid-19. Smart roads are erected in Aundh, Balewadi and Baner and cycles on hire scheme have also been launched.”“Placemaking was one of the major projects. But it is also true that many mega projects which were planned do not commence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-smart-city-project-a-failure-say-opposition-leaders-activists-101625655139967.html

The two were first arrested in 1994 on charges of overstaying in the country. In their petition, Rasheeda and Hassan said they suffered due to the case and spent three years in jail in Kerala. They requested the court to hear them before taking a decision on Mathew’s bail plea and added they were framed and tortured. Narayanan has also opposed Mathew’s bail plea and the court is expected to take up all pleas together on Monday.Also Read | Kerala HC orders setting up of medical board to examine child with rare diseaseThe two women said they were also entitled to compensation citing ₹1.80 crore paid to Narayanan in 2018 over his framing. They added they do not have the wherewithal to fight the case in India. The two said they suffered physical torture, mental agony, and stigma due to the case.Mathew has, in his bail plea, claimed IB officials, including its then joint director R B Sreekumar, pressured him to arrest Narayanan. He argued the materials collected during the initial stage of the probe “clearly proved nexus of foreign nationals with the other accused and illegal transaction between them.” Mathew, who headed a special investigation team in 1994, claimed “a spy network linking Colombo-Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram and Maldives were revealed during his investigation.”In April, the Supreme Court ordered CBI to investigate the conspiracy behind the framing, calling the matter “serious” and requiring “deeper investigation” into the role of the officers responsible. It accepted the report of a committee constituted by the court in 2018 to probe the circumstances that led to the framing. Narayanan, 79, was arrested in 1994 in the alleged espionage case. He was exonerated two years later following a CBI closure report.The accused police personnel have been charged with conspiracy, framing of false evidence, and illegal custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/isro-spy-case-2-maldivian-women-also-oppose-bail-plea-of-former-kerala-top-cop-101625652319257.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ancestral land, piece of heart and peace of mind||Neither would the condescending sulks of the junior members nor the fluctuating mercury of the seasonal turns be able to modulate the steadfast mindset of the oldest yet contrastingly fittest member in our family from doing what he loved doing for ages. The inconceivable zeal of my grandfather towards farming traces its roots to my great grandfather’s allegiance to ancestral land who had handed over the reins to his son to cultivate the clan’s legacy. Be it family or friends, whoever dared to guilt-trip grandfather’s conscience into selling even a fraction was, by default, subjected to his scathing lecture over such money-grubbing shortcuts. The clichéd yet substantive remark would always hang on his lips: A mother can’t be sold at any cost nor can she be divided proportionally among her children. Also read: Caught off guard, taking the interviewer for a rideIn his own words, his unrequited love for fields and farming significantly helped him offset the double whammy of entering into a new life post retirement besides losing his partner. Farming tools and implements are his best friends that aided him in living his belief that one who ploughed himself reaped a good harvest. My grandfather would derive utmost pleasure in working the land manually loosening and turning the soil with a plough cutting uniform grooves in the earth before sowing every seed apiece painstakingly into parallel furrowed beds. A precious moment of childhood often comes rushing to the mind as to how he would tightly harness me in the foolproof lock of his arms and legs encouraging me to urge the pair of yoked oxen forward with a series of high-pitched incoherent shrilling whistles, stuttering shouts, or with even quirky slangs of amusing nature. His handsome pension would often irk his coeval peers into finding logics behind his avoidable sweat and labour yet he would carry on unaffectedly, caring a toss for the whirlpool of deterring pessimism spinning around him. To discern the subtle transition in the slow and gradual grading of the crops, especially the changing shade of the wheat from green to golden, has always been one of his favourite spectacles, not to miss, feeling the undulating ripples in the tips of the maize as the wafts of soft gentle breeze drifts through them. Refusing to get the aid of a combine-harvesting machine that fuelled sedentary life, his veined hands to our absolute awe would reap the crops with repeated majestic sweeps of a scythe, thresh them thunderously with flails, and garner them with patience followed by separating chaff from grain with a winnowing fan. Even the waste morphs into useful residue with the Midas touch of his hands as it would either go in refilling the mangers of his livestock or used as an organic fuel in the hearth. Along with the prevailing discrepancies in our political system to address agrarian woes, he never eschews from pinning equal blame on skewed tendencies of the today’s youngsters taking pride in picking the keys of an expensive car over picking an axe or a spade. What worsened the situation further are the usurping ideologies of the real estate sector gobbling up every inch of land into cutting plots and building skyscrapers to mint quick money at the expense of the fertility of the land. However, at a personal level, my grandfather is, voluntarily and merrily, bound by an oath to quit farming only after he quits breathing with a lurking suspicion as to whether his posterity against all odds would tend their ancestor’s land as a priceless mother or put it up for sale. sandeep.charnoal@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based professional in the banking sector||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ancestral-land-piece-of-heart-and-peace-of-mind-101625651359300.html

He said that the deputy commissioners, police superintendents, civil surgeons, and officials of urban local bodies should be members of the committee.In an official statement, Vij further highlighted that officials of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) should also be involved so that if the third wave arrives, it can be handled efficiently. The minister, while presiding over the meeting of the state-level Covid monitory committee in Chandigarh, also directed that importance must be given on administration of both Covid-19 doses to maximum people before the onset of the probable third wave.The meeting, which was held virtually, saw the attendance of police superintendents, deputy commissioners, civil surgeons and other district officers. The health minister stated that as a part of preparations to combat the possible third wave of Covid-19, facilities such as increasing the number of beds with oxygen facility, ventilator beds, and the ones with ICU should be present.Anil Vij said that to scale up the vaccination process in the state, concerned officials should seek cooperation from social, religious and business organisations. Notably, in another official statement on Tuesday, he said that the multinational firm Procter and Gamble (P&G) has rendered a cheque to the tune of Rs1 crore to him in support of Haryana’s fight against Covid-19.Haryana on Tuesday reported 73 new Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s overall tally to 769,030, the state health bulletin data showed. The state recorded 10 fatalities, after which the cumulative death toll reached 9,506. According to the bulletin data, as many as 68,852 people were inoculated with Covid-19 vaccines on Monday, and a total of 9,578,632 people have been vaccinated so far, the bulletin data revealed.A recent report by SBI Research titled “Covid-19: the race to finishing line,” showed that the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic would hit India from August, and would reach its peak in September. It added that based on the current data, daily caseload can be nearly 10,000 somewhere around the second week of July, but it will begin to see a surge by the second fortnight of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anil-vij-directs-formation-of-covid-monitoring-committee-to-tackle-3rd-wave-101625649270386.html

This is to protest against the hike in fuel prices, which has resulted in the increase of prices of all items. The Narendra Modi government has failed to alleviate the burden on the common man,” said Manna, the state labour minister.TMC lawmaker Kalyan Ghosh joined Manna along the way from Domjur in Howrah, around 20km from the assembly.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said the Modi government has failed to control the fuel prices. “It has no planning and vision. Everything from public transport to everyday commodities is becoming costlier. Repeated appeals to the Modi government have fallen on deaf ears,” he said.

07-07-2021||Mumbai||Congress leader Naseem Khan demands restoration of Muslim quota in education||Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) deputy president Mohammad Arif Naseem Khan on Tuesday said that five per cent reservation in education be granted to the Muslim community of the state, citing that the same was approved by the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MKV) government.Pointing out that in 2014, the then Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) combined government had offered five per cent reservation to the Muslim community in jobs and education, Khan demanded that the same be restored.“Between 2014 and 2019, I repeatedly demanded that quota be restored to Muslims, but the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government did not relent,” Khan was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The former state cabinet minister also recalled that the current state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik of NCP said last year that a decision on the issue of Muslim quota reservation would be made. He added that the matter was a part of the Congress-NCP manifesto for the 2019 elections, and also given a nod by the ruling state dispensation.“There is resentment among the Muslim community that the announcement is not being implemented by the MVA,” Khan added.Furthermore, the MPCC deputy president said that till the Muslim quota reservation is restored, the state government should provide a special package for Muslims similar to what they’re doing for other communities in order to remove “their backwardness.”The Congress-NCP government in 2014 had issued an ordinance whereby they gave five per cent quota to the Muslim community, and 16 per cent to the Marathas. However, the BJP-Shiv Sena government that came to power in the state in the successive polls, had enacted a law for the Marathas but scrapped the Muslims.However, the Supreme Court in May this year scrapped the Maratha quota law, calling it “unconstitutional”. Several Maratha units have been staging protests in Maharashtra, demanding restoration of the Maratha quota reservation in jobs and education.People hailing from the Other Backward Classes (OBC) have also been staging protests in the state, seeking restoration of 27 per cent political reservation in all local bodies.The Supreme Court in May quashed the OBC reservation, and ruled that the same should not go beyond the 50 per cent cap in reservation quota. The apex court also ordered the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for the collection of empirical data, on the basis of which the quota issue would be fixed.This ruling will have a political impact on the forthcoming by-polls in the state as it means no seat would be reserved for the OBCs in the local bodies consisting of municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishad, panchayat samiti, gram panchayats, and municipal corporations.The by-polls are scheduled to take place on July 19, and the counting of the votes will be held on July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-leader-naseem-khan-demands-restoration-of-muslim-quota-in-education-101625645798944.html

07-07-2021||Delhi||Original versus modern: What’s your pick?||The sight of delicate, steaming hot momos with scrumptious chicken or veggies, paired with your favourite drink can instantly turn around a bad day. The dish that tops the list of our most favourite comfort food dates back to the 14th century, but whether they were created in Nepal or Tibet remains debatable. “It is believed that momo came to India in the 1960s when a large number of Tibetans entered the country and settled in several different parts of the country including Ladakh, Darjeeling, Dharamshala, Sikkim and Delhi. These are the major momo hotspots that we know and love. Another theory suggests that it was the Newar merchants of Kathmandu who brought the recipe from Tibet during their travels along the Silk Route. Their popularity then trickled down to other parts of the country, ultimately becoming the much-loved soul food for so many of us,” says chef Karma who has been working with Prasuma Momos’ for the last 16 years.Authentic momo, steamed or in the form of a thukpa, is highly popular. Over the years, we have seen numerous modifications and exciting new renditions of the dish. However, this often upsets the purists who believe that the original is the best. Sneha Saikia, a chef from Assam, says, “Momo means emotions for the Northeastern people. Thoughtless experimentation with momo sometimes upsets us. It has ruined the original recipe. Now momo comes with the stuffing of noodles, paneer, cheese and even chocolate. Sellers are putting it in tandoor and serving with synthetic sauces. It is losing its authenticity but you will find the authentic momos in the cafes in the Northeast.” Chef Reetu Uday Kugaji agrees that such experiments may damage the essence of momos. “As chefs, it is our responsibility to preserve and pass on age-old recipes to the new generations. Otherwise one day these recipes would be gone forever. I have tried tandoori momos but nothing can be compared to the original. I love the Kothey momos (Himalayan pan-fried dumplings) made with ginger-flavoured pork as its filling, half steamed and half pan-fried till they become crisp and golden brown, served with a sharp, tangy chutney.” Sharing her views, Lisa Suwal, CGO (Chief Growth Officer) of Prasuma, says, “We have noted that consumers like to try new things and experimentation when done with a balance is always worth it. The classics will always remain classics, while new variants will also be embraced by welcoming taste buds.” Momos are also getting a few healthy twists. Chefs are using wheat, buckwheat and finger millet to make momos. One may also add natural flavours and colouring to the flour before kneading the dough for momos by using beetroot, spinach, cilantro and kale. Chef Nishant Choubey says the newer versions of momos with a healthy spin should be welcomed. “I love the modern interpretation of momos as they are less starchy. You can see the stuffing inside. Any interpretation, if done right, should be accepted,” says Choubey.Chilli and Vinegar MomoBy chef Karma Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/original-versus-modern-what-s-your-pick-101625642548108.html
07-07-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka relaxes Covid curbs, ‘plague temples’ open doors for devotees||For Ramachandra Rao (70), a resident of Malleshwaram, his long wait to visit the Maramma Temple in Basavanagudi seems to be over after the Karnataka government allowed temples to reopen from Monday following a two-month lockdown due to Covid-19. The retired public sector undertaking employee, who has received both doses of Covid vaccine, hopes to visit the temple to pray for good health. “It is an age-old belief that deity in the temple protects people from illnesses. We have been praying at the temple for years now. The fact that it has remained open for more than a century shows the faith people have in ‘plague’ amma,” Rao explained.Experts, however, have questioned such superstitions and beliefs . “If it doesn’t harm the society or misguide other people or the diagnosis, they can practise it (going to such temples). If you go to a temple and pray for your good health, make offerings, it is fine. But if you don’t go to doctors, don’t get oxygen and just pray or sleep in some temple and think that you will become alright, then that is not advisable,” Dr. Madhusudhana Kariganur, former president of Indian Medical Association’s Karnataka chapter told HT.Also Read | Ready to appear over no-arrest guarantee: Twitter head to Karnataka HCThough, for the younger generation in Bengaluru, the existence of such temples is amusing, for others, the deity, which finds its origins during the plague of the late 1800s, still holds importance.According to government records, the first case of the plague in ancient Bangalore got reported in the city cantonment in August 1898. By the end of the pandemic, around 3,393 unofficial deaths in areas outside the cantonment, and 3,321 deaths were reported in the cantonment.Meera Iyer of the National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) said that the first change in the city’s lifestyle was the development of a new, spacious layout system instead of the crowded markets like Chickpet. Basavanagudi, Malleswaram, Frazer Town and other areas were developed to ensure people did not live in congested areas. “There was a lot of emphasis on lighting, ventilation and hygiene post the plague. It changed the way houses were built too,” she said. Along with the new layouts came the plague temples. “When the pandemic hit in the late 1800s, people flocked to these temples for protection since there were limited medical resources available,” said historian Suresh Moona.The Rajarajeshwari Plagueamma Temple on the Mysore Road is the only temple dedicated to plague. According to the officials of the temple, the temple enshrines Goddess Rajarajeshwari and two holy stones. The faith in these stones was justified when the disease was completely wiped out. From then on, people started worshipping these stones.According to Moona, the removal of a worship site is frowned upon in the Indian culture. “Over the years, the belief came into existence that these temples would keep people safe from further pandemics,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-relaxes-covid-curbs-plague-temples-open-doors-for-devotees-101625641520363.html

In his petition, Arif said he has obtained permission to import the medicine for his son from the US but will be unable to pay for it without the government’s help.The government informed the court that 102 people in the state suffer from the rare disease and 42 of them have received treatment with support from medical firms under the corporate social responsibility programme. The government cited the National Rare Diseases Policy and added the disease was categorised under Group 3 and the treatment cost for it is very high. The government said it recommends crowd funding for such patients as it was not in a position to extend financial support to them. It pointed out Arif’s son was on ventilator support for three months. The government said the drug can be administered if the child can survive without the ventilator for at least 16 hours. The court then directed the government to set up the board to study the efficacy of administering the costly drug. It said the court will take up the case on a priority basis on Wednesday and if the medical board submits a report favouring the treatment.Also Read | More Covid-19 curbs in Kerala with high positivity rate areas from today ₹18 crore were earlier raised in Kerala via a crowd-funding platform for an 18-month child suffering from spinal muscular atrophy in Kannur within a week. After the money exceeded the amount needed for the treatment, P K Rafeeq, the child’s father, said he does not have words to express his gratitude. “Everything is not lost in trying times. It is a symbol of brotherhood and love. I was told the medicine will be most effective if it was administered before the child turns two,” said Rafeeq. His daughter, Afra, also suffers from the disease and moves around in a wheelchair. Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare genetic disease that affects the central nervous system and muscle movement. It mostly affects children but can develop in adults also. People with the disease lose a specific type of nerve cell in the spinal cord, called motor neurons, that control muscle movement and cripple them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-hc-orders-setting-up-of-medical-board-to-examine-child-with-rare-disease-101625640318742.html

The application of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo was rejected by Justice Chanda himself. He, however, decided to step away from the case on his own personal discretion and released the case from his bench, said those familiar with the development.Mamata Banerjee is facing a fine of ₹5 lakh for painting the judiciary "in a bad light", the court order said.

However, he still recused himself from the case so that "trouble-mongers" don't get an opportunity to keep the controversy alive. "It will be contrary to the interests of justice if such unwarranted problem continues along with trial," said Justice Chanda while stepping away from the case.Earlier, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had sent a letter to the Acting chief justice of the Calcutta high court, mentioning her objection to Justice Chanda's appointment as a permanent judge over "likelihood of bias", citing his associations with the BJP during his days as a lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-faces-rs-5-lakh-fine-for-seeking-recusal-of-calcutta-hc-judge-over-alleged-links-with-bjp-101625636881522.html

A team of three university officials and information technology experts inquired into the matter and submitted its report on Monday.An official said the report has highlighted loopholes in the system and found grave irregularities in the exam results.

Saxena changed the marks on the sheet and sent it to the company. The company later released the result with modified marks,” said the inquiry report. HT has seen a copy of the report.The report said the private company kept the mark sheets instead of providing them to the confidential branch of the university, thereby raising the possibility of tampering.JK Gupta, the university registrar, has terminated the contract of Mindlogics Infratech for the alleged irregularities. and blacklisted it. He said Jaiswal has been suspended for getting the marks sheets of students on his personal mail as part of the fraud. “...Saxena, who received marks sheet on her email before the official announcement of the results, has been shifted to the Indore Medical College.”Tripathi said a clerk would contact the students. “They would take ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 to increase the marks. The company’s manager used to change the marks on the direction of the controller.” He said the matter should be probed thoroughly as the private company was facing fraud charges also related to its work with the Agra University.“I have moved court and requested it to hand over the investigation of the case to Central Bureau of Investigation or other independent investigative.” He added that there were similar irregularities in undergraduate and postgraduate medical examinations.Sarang said they will probe the matter and not spare anyone. “Criminal cases will also be registered.”The irregularities have surfaced eight years after an entrance examination, admission, and recruitment scam was exposed in Madhya Pradesh in 2013 involving Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, popularly known by its Hindi acronym Vyapam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/another-examination-scam-surfaces-in-madhya-pradesh-101625636418351.html

Police said the two were shot dead at Naruana’s house at his native village by another accomplice, Manpreet Singh Manna, who also sustained a bullet injury and was undergoing treatment at the Bathinda Civil Hospital. Also read: ‘Will accept whatever Sonia Gandhi decides’: Amarinder amid rift with SidhuThe incident occurred at 7.30am. Both victims were rushed to the civil hospital, but were declared brought dead. Police sources said Manna was a former gunman of Naruana. He was arrested and brought to the civil hospital under tight security as Naruana’s supporters gathered at the hospital. Escaped bid on life in June On June 22, Naruana escaped unhurt in an attack by four gunmen when he was going to his village in his bulletproof car near Ring Road, Bathinda. Naruana had identified the accused and a case was registered. Naruana was accused in half a dozen cases, including two of attempt to murder. He was behind the attack on police personnel in the civil hospital in which he threw chilli powder in their eyes before freeing convict Gurwinder Bindu. In 2015, Naruana and his gang opened fire at a constable at the Bathinda cantonment police station. Brush with politics In 2014, Naruana joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) when former Talwandi Sabo MLA Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu switched to the SAD from the Congress. He was honoured with a siropa by then revenue minister Bikram Singh Majithia during a rally organised by Sidhu outside his house in Bathinda in March 2014. In July 2014, Naruana and Manna were arrested with illegal weapons. Naruana remained a controversial figure during his stay in the central jail as he along with his accomplices uploaded their photos on Facebook from behind bars. He was also engaged in a gang war with the rival group of Gurpreet Singh Sekhon inside the jail. In April 2015, Naruana secured a country-made pistol inside the jail. Naruana fired two shots from the pistol at Gurdeep Singh Maana, a member of the rival gang led by Sekhon.

The body of T-65, also known as Sooraj, was found at around 9am by the patrolling team in Khandar area of the RTR. The tiger was born to T-19 on May 26, 2011, and had litter with Tigress T-69. Chief wildlife warden TC Verma said the tiger was found in a water hole and a probable cause of its death was cardiac arrest but they could only confirm once the viscera report was received. The postmortem has been done. In April, a five-month-old tiger cub was found dead in Gandhra Deh area of RTR. The mutilated body had canine marks around the neck so forest officials suspected it was killed by another tiger. Earlier, in March, four tigers, including two sub-adults, were reported missing from RTR. The administration started an intensive search for them. RTR has around 80 tigers in an area of 1,334 square kms, making it the third most congested habitats for the big cats in India after Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The ‘Status of Tigers in India-2018’ report said Rajasthan has witnessed an increase of tiger population by 115% in the last 12 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tiger-t-65-found-dead-at-rajasthan-s-ranthambore-reserve-101625635998726.html

07-07-2021||Delhi||Snatchings up 47%, rape and assault rise in first half of 2021 in Delhi||At least five people were raped and six sexually harassed in the national capital every day till June 15 this year, according to updated data uploaded on the Delhi Police’s website, even as street crimes such as snatching shot up by nearly 50% compared to the same period last year.During the corresponding period last year, three people were raped and four were sexually harassed in the Capital, showed the police’s data, highlighting that crime against women is one of Delhi’s perennial and most urgent problems.Cases of snatching, the most common street crime in Delhi, also went up 47%, with the city reporting at least 23 snatchings every day compared to 16 per day during the same period in 2020. A total of 3,829 snatching cases were registered till June 15 this year, against 2,612 cases reported during the corresponding period last year. Similarly, at least six persons were robbed every day in the city till June 15, compared to four in 2020, according to the latest data.All crime went up by 8% in Delhi till June 15 this year, compared to the same period last year, the data shows. Till June 15 this year, 123,295 cases were registered in the city, up from 113,855 the previous year.The data was made available a week after police commissioner Balaji Srivastava took charge from his predecessor, SN Shrivastava, who retired on June 30 after a 15-month term.Between January 1 and June 15 this year, the city police registered 833 cases of rape and 1,022 of molestation, up significantly from the 580 rapes and 735 molestation cases filed in the same period last year.To be sure, a lockdown was imposed across the country from March 25 last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19, limiting movement and travel, and restricting most people to their homes. Curbs began being lifted in phases from June 1.This year, too, the state government imposed a six-week lockdown in the Capital starting April 19, in light of a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections in the Capital’s fourth wave.According to the data, 2,315 heinous crimes have been reported this year, compared to 2,436 last year.Police officers define heinous crimes as crimes that are serious in nature or extremely evil.Senior police officers attributed the increase in crimes, such as snatching and robbery, to the “free and fair registration of cases” policy, and the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown, which they said led to a loss of livelihood for several people, adding that street crimes increased after the lockdown restrictions were eased.“The Delhi Police has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to registering cases or converting valid complaints to first information reports (FIRs). All crime-related calls made to the police control room are scrutinised and converted into FIRs after due verification. We also receive complaints through various media, including our integrated complaint monitoring system (ICMS), which was launched last November with an aim to quickly process complaints and expedite flow of information to citizens regarding the status of their complaints,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chimnoy Biswal.Other crimes such as vehicle thefts, burglary, and theft also went up marginally. Data shows that 295 cases of attempt to murder were registered this year, up from 236 in the same period last year. Cases of murder and kidnapping for ransom have seen a decline -- from 226 to 196 and 8 to 7 respectively, the statistics show.Experts said registration of data is just one of the parameters that can be used to gauge the extent of crimes in any city or state, and is not a perfect scale to judge policing.“We all know about data fudging, so it cannot be the sole way of determining the crime situation in any city. The best way to judge the performance of the police is by ascertaining the number of cases they have solved and how many convictions were achieved in the charge sheets that were filed in the courts. Instead of just registering cases, the police officers should focus on meeting people in the field, addressing their grievances and strengthening their faith in the police. They should also be taking steps to curb crimes and keep a vigil on registered criminals,” said retired IPS officer Prakash Singh, who headed the Uttar Pradesh Police between 1991 and 1993.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/snatchings-up-47-rape-and-assault-rise-in-first-half-of-2021-in-delhi-101625613055578.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Market associations push for joint teams to manage crowds||Representatives of nearly 200 markets in the city participated in a video conference on Tuesday and collectively decided to approach the district administrations, police and civic agencies to set up joint action committees to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 regulations – a move that comes in the light of crackdown of district administrations on markets over the last one week for violation of protocols.“In today’s (Tuesday) meeting, the traders observed that the responsibility of controlling the crowd outside shops in the markets should be the primary responsibility of authorities – district administration, municipal corporations and the police. While shop owners will ensure Covid-19 regulations in the premises of the enterprises, the joint action committees will be helpful in following regulations outside the shop premises. We will write to the police, MCDs, the L-G and the revenue department in this regard,” said Brijesh Goyal, president of the chamber of trade and industry (CTI) – a Delhi-based traders’ body which organised the online meeting of market associations.In the last seven days, the district administrations have ordered temporary suspension of markets in areas including Laxmi Nagar, a section in Gandhi Nagar, a pocket in Sadar Bazar, Nangloi, Punjabi Basti and the central market in Lajpat Nagar, for alleged violation of Covid-19 regulations such as social distancing and mask compliance.Vinay Narang, a trader leader from Kashmere Gate market, said: “A joint action committee comprising market association representatives, police, municipal officials, civil defence volunteers and enforcement officials is necessary at this stage. We have collectively decided to write to the concerned agencies at the earliest regarding this.”Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar market traders’ association, who also took part in Tuesday’s meeting, said, “It is time the authorities crack down on illegal encroachments instead of cracking down on market associations. If shop owners are found flouting rules, action should be taken against the particular shop, instead of closing an entire market.”Atul Bhargava, president of the Connaught Place market association, said, “Unauthorised street vendors and hawkers are increasing the size of the crowd in the markets. That is not in the hands of the power market associations to control.”However, representatives of street vendor associations countered this viewpoint.Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors of India, said, “Accountability in this case should be evidence-based and not prejudiced. Street vendors are often poor and end up being blamed for most problems. Secondly, they operate in the open, which is less risky in terms of Covid-19 transmission than closed spaces from which permanent shops operate. When there is a protocol for penalising for violation of Covid-19 regulations, there is no room for such blame games.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-market-associations-push-for-joint-teams-to-manage-crowds-101625612611937.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||AAP alleges corruption by MCDs in building construction||Citing a purported conversation between BJP MLA Anil Bajpai and an east municipal corporation engineer, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj on Tuesday said that the BJP leader has exposed alleged corruption, with “only those who give money to the municipal corporations of Delhi (MCD) being allowed to construct buildings in the city”.Addressing a press conference, Bhardwaj, who is the MLA from Greater Kailash, alleged that MCD officials are taking ₹10-15 lakh for each building in his constituency.“Today we have a live audio recording of Anil Bajpai, BJP MLA from Gandhi Nagar Assembly constituency in conversation with a building department officer of the east MCD. They are talking about stopping the demolition of a building. Bajpai is asking the MCD engineer to stop his JE (junior engineer) from demolishing a particular building. When the engineer replies that the demolition took place on the complaint of the mayor, the MLA, exposing the Delhi BJP, pointed out that he has not demolished other illegal and unauthorised constructions under the mayor’s protection. This way, the BJP MLA has confessed about rampant corruption in MCD. He said the BJP-ruled MCD doesn’t demolish the buildings where it gets bribe. Dozens of such buildings were left untouched,” Bhardwaj said.Meanwhile, Bajpai said he was just trying to help a poor family which was about to lose their home: “I did or said nothing wrong. If houses are being demolished, then every such unauthorised construction should also be demolished. Why selectively target the poor?”EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Agrawal too denied the allegations as “baseless”. “If this is the case I would request the AAP to show where it has happened and we will surely take action if anyone is found guilty. There are many wards under AAP councillors where people neither pay the taxes nor get their house maps approved. There are many 25-30-metre houses for which we have never received the drawings from owners to be approved by the civic body. I have even sent a suggestion for the new Master Plan in the making to make a provision for all houses to be built as per approved design,” said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-alleges-corruption-by-mcds-in-building-construction-101625612325750.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||‘Wet-bulb temperatures’: Soaring mercury, humidity make outdoors dangerous||As the monsoon continues to play truant over northwest India, including Delhi, the Capital is experiencing a mix of heatwave-like conditions and high humidity levels, which, forecasters say, will last till July 10 when the monsoon is expected to arrive. Scientists said that in the absence of rainfall, Delhi and parts of NCR are recording high wet-bulb temperatures, a combined measure of heat and humidity of a region.On Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature in Delhi was 40.6 degrees Celsius, four degrees above what is considered normal for this time of year. The relative humidity was around 54%. This translates into a wet-bulb temperature of 32.28 degrees Celsius. That may not seem like much, but according to scientists, it is next to impossible to work outside when the wet-bulb temperature is over 32 degrees. Worse, on prolonged exposure to a wet-bulb temperature of 35 degrees or higher, even fit people may face significant discomfort, even collapse and require hospitalisation.Scientists say the wet-bulb temperature is a good indicator of how hot we feel (as opposed to how hot it is). To be sure actual measures of heat perception involve other variables such as angle of sunlight and wind direction and speed, but, in general, the wet-bulb temperature itself is a good proxy for this. The formula for wet-bulb temperatures is complex although it involves only two variables -- temperature and relative humidity. It makes up for this by using inverse tangent (or arc tan) trigonometric functions.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster, explained that temperatures are high in Delhi on account of a delayed monsoon, but moisture carrying easterly winds that are intermittently blowing into the city are keeping the humidity levels also high. The result is high discomfort.“Usually during this time of the year, Delhi receives a few spells of rainfall that brings the maximum temperature down. So, even if the humidity levels are high, the discomfort is not as much. But this time, the temperatures are high because of delayed monsoon and so are the humidity levels, this makes people sweat more profusely and makes staying outdoors extremely difficult,” Palawat explained.In short, it’s almost as bad as it is in Chennai in May when temperatures in the low 40s and relative humidity in the high 80s combine to take wet-bulb temperatures dangerously high.Climate Trends, a Delhi-based communications group focusing on environment and climate change, said that Delhi experiences 63 such days in a year (called wet-bulb days) , Mumbai , 47, Trivandrum, 113 and Chennai, 140.India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday revised the dates for monsoon arrival in Delhi and parts of northwest and central India to July 10, which will make this the most delayed monsoons in at least the last 17 years.“The human body can withstand dry heat, but as humidity levels increase along with heat, the ability to spend time outdoors slowly decreases,” said a senior IMD official.IMD forecasts temperatures in the city over the next two days to be around 40 degrees Celsius, which will continue the spell of sweltering heat in the city.Climatologists explained that this shift to recording felt heat is a global trend.“People do not grasp the seriousness of the situation. An entire set of livelihoods depends on being outside. Imagine being a construction worker who can’t work for two months of the year,” said Camilo Mora, associate professor (department of geography and environment), University of Hawaii.He added: “Your sweat doesn’t evaporate if it is very humid, so heat accumulates in your body. People can then suffer heat toxicity, which is like sunburn on the inside of your body. This is all an impact of years of neglect of the environment and it is now coming back to haunt us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wetbulb-temperatures-soaring-mercury-humidity-make-outdoors-dangerous-101625611943338.html

The alignment is yet to be approved by the central government.The NCRTC has asked experts from the Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) to do an assessment to gauge the impact of the vibration caused by the trains running underground as well as the construction work.“The stretch below the Delhi zoo will be constructed at a depth of around 80 feet. CRRI will carry out the vibration study in zoo premises after minimisation of Covid impact to establish the current baseline data for vibrations,” a spokesperson for NCRTC saidThe Delhi-SNB corridor, along with the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut line will provide seamless connectivity in the national capital region by linking cities in the Capital’s east -- Ghazibad and Meerut, to those in south -- Gurugram and Alwar. In Delhi, both corridors will originate from Sarai Kale Khan in south east Delhi. These corridors will also connect all these cities to All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Safdarjung, one of country’s biggest hospitals.Of the total 107 kilometres, 83kms of the Delhi-SNB corridor will be constructed in Haryana, 22 kms in Delhi and 2 kms in Rajasthan. While the corridor in Haryana and Rajasthan will be mostly elevated, it will be completely underground in Delhi. Except for Sarai Kale Khan station, the remaining three stations at INA, Munirka and Aerocity will be underground.Nasim Akhtar, senior principal scientist at transportation planning and environment division, CSIR-CRRI, said, “We will study the current ambient vibration levels in the zoo, both during day and night, and will ensure that they do not exceed the present levels during the construction and operation of the RRTS line.”Akhtar said the first part of the study was done last year before the lockdown to record the day time ambient vibration levels. But the study had to be stopped after a lockdown was imposed again in April this year in view of an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases. Even though a gradual unlock process has begun, the government is yet to reopen the zoological park.“The day time ambient vibration levels in the zoo is around 75-76 VdB. The vibrations are caused by a railway track nearby, and the movement of vehicles inside the premises. But we couldn’t do the study at night due to the lockdown. We will do the remaining part of the study once the zoo reopens,” he said.When contacted, a senior Delhi zoo official said, “The matter was discussed last year. As of now, no permission has been given to carry out the study, as the zoo is closed due to the pandemic.”Stressing on the need for night time study, Akhtar said, “The train operations will continue till late at night. The ambient vibration levels at night are much less than day time; we don’t want animals and birds’ sleep patterns to get disturbed because of train movement. Our recommendation regarding vibration control to NCRTC will be based on the vibration levels at night time.”The NCRTC spokesperson said that it will be ensured that there is minimal impact of the train movement on the ground level. “The proposed tunnel is very deep in this zone and NCRTC is going to use special track structure to mitigate vibration,” he said.Akhtar said there are a several technologies which can be incorporated during construction to minimise vibration. “According to the soil report from the area, there is sand filling till 17-20 metres depth. This is a good thing, as the vibration will get absorbed. If the night time level is less than 70 VdB, then we might recommend NCRTC to use technology such as a floating chamber to kill vibration at source.”Anish Andheria, CEO of Wildlife Conservation Trust, said animals are far more sensitive to vibrations than humans, and if an alternate alignment of the corridor is possible, then it should be considered. He said if the current alignment is allowed, it should be ensured that there is minimal disturbance to the animals, especially during construction. “The executing agency should put in the public domain the technology they plan to use to minimise vibration impact from the perspective of animals. They should also look at similar projects carried out in other parts of the world to ensure that the most effective technology is deployed,” Andheria said.While the Centre’s approval is awaited, NCRTC has started pre-construction work. “We are working on preparing the detailed designing of structures, geo-technical investigation work, initial pile load test, topographic survey work, shifting of utilities such as electric high-tension lines, water and sewer pipelines etc,” the NCRTC spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ncrtc-ropes-in-experts-to-study-impact-of-underground-rail-corridor-on-delhi-zoo-101625611679722.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||Grim milestone for Delhi as Covid-19 toll crosses 25,000 mark||Over 25,000 people in the national capital have died of Covid-19 since the outbreak of the infection in March last year, showed government records, after the state added four fatalities to the city’s toll on Tuesday.The first Covid-19 death in Delhi was reported on March 13, 2020, when a 69-year-old woman succumbed to the viral infection.Most of the 25,001 deaths in the city so far were recorded in just two months, between April and May, as a fourth wave of infections ravaged the city, and left health care infrastructure teetering on the brink of collapse.At the height of the fourth wave, Delhi added an average of 25,294 cases a day in the seven days ending April 23.State government records show that 13,210 people died of Covid-19 in the city in April and May alone, accounting for nearly 53% of Delhi’s coronavirus deaths.Delhi continued to add around 20,000 new cases each day till the first week of May, after which cases fell, on the back of a lockdown imposed in the Capital from April 19.Deaths of the illness peaked between May 1 and 3, as Delhi recorded over 400 fatalities each day. In Delhi on May 3 alone, 448 died of the illness. In comparison, 131 people died of Covid-19 at the height of the third wave of infections on November 18.Delhi saw over 100 Covid-19 deaths on only 11 days before the fourth wave set foot in the city. In the fourth wave alone, Delhi added over 100 deaths on 47 occasions, showed Delhi government data.Even as the fourth wave ebbed from the second week of May, Delhi continued to add an average of 101 Covid-19 deaths a day till the seven days ending June 2.So far, 1.74% of those who contracted the infection in Delhi have died, slightly higher than the national average of 1.3%, according to the government data.The city also added 79 fresh infections on Tuesday, with 0.11% of those sampled testing positive. Over the past week, Delhi has added an average of 85 new cases every day.Experts said a fifth wave of infections in Delhi is unlikely “for at least six months.”“The delta variant was so infectious that a very high proportion of people in Delhi have already been exposed, protecting them against another infection from at least six to 10 months as the current evidence suggests. In the meanwhile, we are also increasing the vaccination; people who do not have immunity from a previous infection will get it through immunisation,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, had previously said, ““For a fifth wave of cases, we need a variant that is significantly different from the circulating delta variant which will take time or a significant drop in population-level immunity which will also take time. There could be some ups and downs of the fourth wave over the next few weeks but a fifth wave is unlikely for some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/grim-milestone-for-delhi-as-covid-19-toll-crosses-25-000-mark-101625611495553.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||HC gives Delhi Police two weeks to conclude inquiry in riots charge sheet leak||The Delhi high court on Tuesday granted two more weeks to Delhi police to undertake a “comprehensive inquiry” into the leakage of contents of the charge sheet and supplementary charge sheet filed in case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi last year, to the media even before cognisance was taken by the court.Jamia Millia Islamia student and riots accsued Asif Iqbal Tanha approached the high court last year, alleging misconduct by police officials in leaking his alleged disclosure statement in the main charge sheet, recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media.Pulling up the Delhi Police for the delay in the inquiry, Justice Mukta Gupta asked how much time the Delhi police will take to complete the probe while remarking that “one institution which keeps moving even during a lockdown is the police department”.To this, special public prosecutor (SPP) Rajat Nair said that the agency (police) was burdened with additional duties. Nair added that although notice was issued to parties concerned for the purposes of the inquiry, it could not be concluded on account of Covid lockdown.SPP Nair sought two more weeks’ from the court to file the inquiry report which was granted by the court .Advocate Sowjhanya Shankaran, representing Tanha, told the court that while an additional affidavit on a subsequent leak with respect to a supplementary charge sheet was filed, response from the State was not on record.The judge proceeded to record SPP’s submission that “a comprehensive inquiry on the leakage of the contents of the charge sheet and the supplementary charge sheet is underway and is likely to be concluded within two weeks”, and listed the matter for hearing on August 5.Tanha, who was arrested in May 2020, was recently released from jail after the high court granted him bail.The police have alleged that Tanha, a resident of Abul Fazal Enclave in Shaheen Bagh, was a member of the Students Islamic Organization and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee which spearheaded protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-gives-delhi-police-two-weeks-to-conclude-inquiry-in-riots-charge-sheet-leak-101625611134552.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||EDMC to set up app, call centre and collection points for e-waste safe disposal||Soon residents, institutions, commercial and industrial units in east Delhi could dispose of their electronic waste in an environment friendly manner and even get some value back as the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) plans to engage an agency for collection and transportation of e-waste for further processing and disposal in a scientific manner. Citizens will be able to access the facility on the corporation website, municipal officials in the know of the matter said.The officials said the agency will have collection centres at suitable locations and will also facilitate the disposal process by way of a mobile app and a call centre with a toll-free number. “Additionally, users will be able to raise a request on the EDMC website mentioning details of the item(s) they need to dispose of and request a pick-up. The value of the discarded items will be decided and paid to those disposing of the goods,” said a senior EDMC official handling the project.E-waste includes old, discarded and unserviceable electronic items such as mobile phones, television sets, chargers and refrigerators, among others.Until now, the corporation did not have a strategy for handling e-waste and most such waste was segregated and processed illegally by the informal sector -- ragpickers and scrap dealers and small workshops -- in an unscientific manner that posed serious environment hazards. Officials said as e-waste contains toxic chemicals and minerals such as arsenic, cadmium and acid, among others, it was imperative that such waste is recycled in a scientific manner.“Our request for proposal (RFP) for the project is in the final stage of approval for appointing an agency. This maiden initiative will pave the way for handling of electronic waste in a responsible and environment friendly manner,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand.The cash-strapped municipal corporation also aims to generate some revenue through the initiative. “We plan to earn some royalty from the agency executing the project, which will help the municipal body earn some revenue,” said an official, who asked not to be named.“Currently, most of the e-waste in the city is recycled illegally by informal groups such as ragpickers and small workshops to extract metals such as copper out of it. “A large volume of such waste from all parts of Delhi reaches pockets such as Seemapuri where a number of informal groups are engaged in extracting metals out of the junk. We will be creating larger awareness about our initiative so that people have a way to dispose of e-waste safely,” the official said.So far, there has been no assessment of the volume of e-waste being generated or recycled in the city. However, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and recently the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) have set up similar mechanisms for collection and disposal of e-waste in areas under their jurisdiction.The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) notified the E-waste Management Rules in 2016 following which all civic bodies were to implement the same in their jurisdiction.According to experts, there is still little awareness around the consequences of discarding electronic gadgets in an improper manner. These gadgets often land up in makeshift workshop, where metal is extracted using the crudest methods, releasing a range of toxic chemicals, which ultimately flows into drains and then into water bodies, thereby heavily polluting them.Satish Sinha, associate director, Toxic Link, said it is important to have a formal set-up for e-waste collection.“When recycled illegally, the methodology used is rudimentary in nature, releasing toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury etc into the immediate neighbourhood. Processing of e-waste requires good technology, which is why a formal set-up is required,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/edmc-to-set-up-app-call-centre-and-collection-points-for-e-waste-safe-disposal-101625610089435.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||Farmhouse drug bust: Afghan man gave Aadhaar card for registering rent agreement||The Punjab Police are investigating an Afghan man who leased a farmhouse in Sainik Farms where a heroin-manufacturing unit was busted on Sunday, and four people were arrested during a raid by the state police, officers privy to the probe said on Tuesday.The officers said Najibullah Khalid, the man who rented the farmhouse, submitted a copy of his Aadhaar card when the rent agreement was signed between him and the owner of the property, Pravesh Kumar alias Bobby.The Aadhaar card, a copy of which is with HT, was prepared on a Neb Sarai address. Bobby, and Ganesh Kumar, the property dealer who got the deal fixed, said they have submitted the copy of Khalid’s Aadhaar card to the Neb Sarai police. They have told the police that Khalid introduced himself to them as an Indian citizen, who is involved in the supply and sale of dates. The rent agreement was prepared last month and the four arrested men began staying in the farmhouse around June 26-27, the investigators said.“We are carrying out another operation to nab more drug dealers associated with the syndicate. As far as investigation regarding the Aadhar card and other documentation regarding the rented farmhouse is concerned, we will investigate everything once we complete our operation,” said Tushar Gupta, ASP Garhshankar police (in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur), who led the raiding party during the crackdown on the farmhouse.On Sunday, around 5pm, a Punjab Police team raided the farmhouse number 227, in Sainik Farms and arrested four Afghans for running a heroin-manufacturing unit there. A total of 17 kilogram heroin, assorted chemicals, acids and lab equipments were seized from the farmhouse.The raiding team caught Khalid when he reached the farmhouse to meet his alleged accomplices. The raiding team took Khalid with them for questioning, as the farmhouse was taken on rent in his name. He is yet to be arrested, said a Punjab Police officer, who asked not to be named.“Khalid came to me with the reference of a property dealer in Malviya Nagar, who helped him purchase a flat in Neb Sarai. The Aadhaar card that Khalid gave us for preparing the rent agreement of the farmhouse has the address of the same flat. Khalid told me that he sold that property and wanted to move into a farmhouse with his wife, whom he introduced as an Indian citizen,” said Ganesh.According to Ganesh, the farmhouse leased on a monthly rent of ₹1.6 lakh and Khalid paid ₹4.80 lakh as advance rent and two months of security money. “As a property dealer, I followed all the procedures while renting out the property. Apart from the rent agreement, I also applied online for the tenant’s verification,” he said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (south), Delhi Police, Mandava Harsh Vardhan said a case under Indian Penal Code’s section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) has been registered at the Neb Sarai police station against the farmhouse owner for not getting the tenant verified from the police. Asked if Khalid could have prepared a fake Aadhaar card for obtaining the farmhouse on rent, the additional DCP said, “We will look into all the aspects pertaining to the case that we have registered.”Another police officer, requesting to remain anonymous, said holding an Aadhaar card means that the card holder is residing in India. But, according to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, even a foreigner who has stayed in India for more than 182 days is eligible to apply for an Aadhaar card.“Khalid has told the police that he was staying in India as an Afghan refugee for the past six years. This information has to be verified, before we find out how he got an Aadhaar card,” the officer added.About the case and the charges against him, Bobby said he did not violate any law because the tenants never told him that they were foreigners. “I would have never rented out my property or had alerted the concerned agencies, if I knew that the tenants were foreigners. Being a responsible citizen, I will cooperate with the police in their investigation,” said Bobby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmhouse-drug-bust-afghan-man-gave-aadhaar-card-for-registering-rent-agreement-101625609662355.html
07-07-2021||Patna||Chirag Paswan says will move court if Paras is given Cabinet berth on LJP quota||Amid speculations of Pashupati Kumar Paras securing a berth in the Union cabinet expansion, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Tuesday said that he has already informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the suspension of five party MPs and that he would go to court if his uncle was inducted on the party quota.“If any of them gets included in the Cabinet from the party’s quota, I will certainly have an objection to it and I may have to take legal recourse. If anyone is made minister as an independent or from some other party, I have no issue, as it is entirely the prerogative of the Prime Minister. But as far as the LJP is concerned, the party Constitution allows me to be the president and the matter is before the Election Commission (EC) as well as the Lok Sabha Speaker,” he told reporters at his residence in Patna.“I have already written to PM Modi as well as the EC in this regard. A common practice is that the party president is consulted if anyone from the party has to be included in the cabinet,” he added.Chirag, who is locked in a power tussle with the Paras-led faction, ever since the party split on June 17, said his party continued to be with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre. In the 2019 elections, LJP had won six seats as an NDA member.The MP from Jamui seat, who launched his ‘Ashirvad Yatra’ from Hajipur on Monday to mark the the birth anniversary of his father and party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, accused his uncle of engineering the split in the LJP to become a minister at the behest of chief minister Nitish Kumar. “It is ironic that Nitish Kumar always tried to insult my father, but my uncle chose to sit in his lap even at the cost of the family and party, which gave him everything,” Chirag said.The LJP leader said he had chosen the difficult path for himself as this was the lesson his father taught. “I am not eager to become a minister, as my first objective is to build the party as a viable alternative in Bihar. Even when my father was around, attempts were made to break the party, but LJP continued its march. It will continue its march and I am overwhelmed with the response of the people for my Ashirvad Yatra the very first day,” he added.A faction of the LJP headed by Hajipur MP Paras last month removed his estranged nephew Paswan as the party chief, prompting Paswan’s loyalists to respond by stripping five rebel parliamentarians of the party’s primary membership. The party, which has six MPs but no MLAs, plunged into a crisis after five lawmakers rebelled against Paswan’s leadership and chose Paras as the new leader of the parliamentary party.Chirag later met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and urged him to reconsider his decision to recognise Paras as the parliamentary party leader, saying it was against the party’s constitution. He also said that the party will consider taking the legal route if his demand was not considered by the Lok Sabha Speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/chirag-paswan-says-will-move-court-if-paras-is-given-cabinet-berth-on-ljp-quota-101625605784631.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Vitamin D significantly reduces Covid mortality: PGIMER study||An analysis by the doctors at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) shows that the use of Vitamin D in Covid-19 significantly leads to improved clinical outcomes—reduction in mortality and intensive care unit admission.The doctors, however, warn against irrational use of Vitamin D, as it can be toxic.The study, ‘Vitamin D supplementation and clinical outcomes in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis’, recently published in the Journal of Endocrinological Investigation, was conducted by Dr Rimesh Pal, Dr Mainak Banerjee, professor Sanjay K Bhadada, Dr Anirudh J Shetty of the endocrinology department of PGIMER; Dr Birgurman Singh of Government Medical College, Patiala; and Dr Abhinav Vyas of Rabindranath Tagore Medical College, Udaipur.“As Covid-19 continues to rampage, the search for an effective therapy still remains elusive. Accordingly, multiple existing drugs have been repurposed for Covid management. In this context, Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, which is primarily related to bone and mineral metabolism, has shown some promising results,” said Dr Sanjay K Bhadada, head of the endocrinology department, PGIMER.“Pooled data from 13 studies with 2,933 Covid-19 patients showed that Vitamin D supplemented after the diagnosis of Covid-19 leads to improved clinical outcomes in terms of reduced mortality and/or intensive care unit admission,” said Dr Bhadada.The study lends ample support to the fact that Vitamin D can be used as an effective adjuvant treatment in patients hospitalised with Covid-19.He said that the anti-viral and the immune modulatory role of Vitamin D were perhaps helpful in this regard. Nevertheless, the irrational and rampant use of Vitamin D to prevent Covid-19 should not be a norm: “The use of Vitamin D in high doses, especially injectable preparations, to treat Covid-19 should be strongly discouraged. Vitamin D, supplemented prior to the diagnosis of Covid-19, was not found to improve clinical outcomes in our meta-analysis. And overuse can lead to Vitamin D toxicity,” explained the doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vitamin-d-significantly-reduces-covid-mortality-pgimer-study-101625602696596.html

The DRI in coordination with the customs department had recovered the contraband hidden in two containers imported by a Tarn Taran-based firm, Sandhu Exports, from Afghanistan via Iran. The containers were declared as cargo of semi-processed talc stones. Prabhjit Singh (25) of Chohla Sahib village in Tarn Taran who had placed the order, was arrested by a team of the DRI after the recovery. The Tarn Taran police team, led-by superintendent of police (narcotics) Jagjit Singh Walia, will also visit the port where the contraband was seized. More teams of the Punjab Police, including the state special operation cell (SSOC), special task force (STF) and the organised crime control unit (OCCU), will also visit Mumbai in the coming days. The Tarn Taran team has also taken details of the assets of the accused and his family. The police had also called one Manpreet Singh of Chohla Sahib, who was reportedly in contact with Prabhjit, for questioning. He was, however, released later after nothing suspicious was found during his questioning. The police have also found links of Prabhjit with a Dhun Dhai Wala village family that is involved in drug smuggling. A DRI official said Prabhjit had rented a godown in Shivpuri district of Madhya Pradesh where all the goods imported by him were stored before being dispatched elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/293kg-heroin-haul-in-mumbai-tarn-taran-cops-reach-mumbai-to-quiz-key-accused-help-dri-in-probe-101625602160033.html

ADC (development) Subash Chander and zila parishad chairman Inderjit Singh, who have already borrowed minimum ₹1.5 lakh each from several panchayats that generate sufficient income from village common land and other sources, even passed a resolution on Tuesday in this regard in a meeting that was also attended by three MLAs from the district. Besides MLAs Harjot Kamal (Moga), Darshan Singh Brar (Baghapurana) and Sukhjeet Singh Kaka Lohgarh (Dharamkot), 14 zila parishad members and 5 chairpersons of block samitis of district were also present in the meeting. The agenda of purchasing cars with panchayats’s income was tabled by the ADC (D), it is learnt. Justifying the move, Chander said, “It has been two years since I am posted here but I am yet to get a government vehicle. I have been using my personal vehicle for official work. The cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance is resulting in financial burden on me. I don’t think there is anything wrong in buying vehicles as they will be used for official purpose.” The panchayats were told that they will get double the amount (for buying of cars) from the rural development and panchayats department through the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) funds and other means.Chander said, “Yes, I tabled the agenda in the meeting and it was cleared unanimously. Nearly 10 panchayats have already given money to us. Some have given 1.5 lakh each while others have given more. Development works being carried out in these villages will continue.”Inderjit Singh said, “Like the ADC (D), me and the zila parishad secretary also do not have official vehicles.”Jagroop Singh Takhtupura, a zila parishad member and a Congress leader who was also present in the meeting, said, “Priority needed to be given to development works. The resolution on purchasing vehicles should be reviewed at the earliest.”Parampal Singh, chairman of the Nihal Singh Wala market committee who was also present in the meeting, said, “The government is facing fund crunch due to the pandemic and it is hampering development works. It is condemnable to borrow funds from panchayats at this time.”Additional chief secretary (rural and panchayats development) Seema Jain did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moga-adc-zila-parishad-chairman-pooling-money-from-panchayats-to-buy-official-cars-101625602159018.html

In the fresh orders issued on Monday, the corporation announced another electricity regulatory measure with three weekly-offs for the general industry (large scale), rolling mills, arc and induction furnaces from July 7 to July 10. The power crisis reared its head on July 1 when industries located in the state’s central zone comprising Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh, Khanna, Amloh and Sirhind and north zone consisting of Jalandhar, Phagwara and Hoshiarpur were asked to compulsorily close their units for 48 hours and resume operations only after 2pm on Saturday. Manufacturing units in these areas constitute 90% of the state’s industries. In another order, the existing curbs in the central and north zones were extended by a day with an additional weekly-off. In industrial units of the central zone, three-day compulsory off ended at 2pm on Sunday (July 4) while the shutdown ended at 8am in mixed land use areas the next day. In the north zone, compulsory offs on industrial units ended at 8pm on Sunday. With Sunday being observed as a closed day, the general industry resumed operations only on Monday. Sudershan Jain, president, Knitwear and Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, said the situation is worse for the hosiery sector. “We are shaken by all that is happening. Ours is a seasonal industry and we have to honour commitments to all our clients in both India and abroad. Working amid such uncertainty is causing huge losses to us,” he said. Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja said they are in talks with the government for a solution. “The announcement has triggered panic in the industry but we are going to meet the senior functionaries for a solution,” he said. For the cycles and cycle part manufacturing units, the going has been equally tough. “It’s a complete system failure of the government. Repeated shutdown announcements are not the solution. We are the supporting industry for the larger firms and the entire chain is broken with such curbs,” said DS Chawla, president, United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association. Badish Jindal of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association said, “Each day counts for the manufacturing industry and we have already borne the brunt of the Covid pandemic and the farmers’ protest last year when goods trains were stopped for over a month. The industry doesn’t seem to be important for the government and we are made the scapegoat in times of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-crisis-pspcl-closure-order-triggers-panic-as-manufacturers-fear-losing-orders-101625602157970.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala Cantt property dispute: Contempt notice to former DC, SSP, 4 others||In a 2017 case of title suit of a 39 bigha 6 biswa property in Ambala Cantt’s Hathikhana area, an Ambala court has issued contempt notices to former deputy commissioner (DC) Ashok Kumar Sharma, incumbent senior superintendent of police (SSP) Hamid Akhtar, Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) general secretary Chitra Sarwara, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) state spokesperson Onkar Singh and two local YouTubers Yashpal Khabrilal and Jagjit Sufi.The officials were issued summons on Monday under Section 2(b) (civil contempt) of the Contempt of Courts Act for disobeying the court judgement dated July 6, 2017, while the others were given notices under Section 2(c) (criminal contempt) where the publication (whether by word, spoken or written or by signs or by visual representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever.As per the notices, the said persons have been asked to appear before the court in person at 10am on July 29.The order comes almost a month after the officials of the municipal council, Ambala Sadar, had conducted a demolition drive at the site. Despite heavy police presence, the officials had to face resistance from locals.Apurva Chaudhary, executive officer of the civic body, said that they had stopped the construction once and given notices in due time. “We only demolished the boundary walls and three shops that were recently constructed illegally,” he said.However, the prosecution’s counsel, Momin Malik, claimed that the construction was demolished despite a civil court decree already passed in favour of one Khajan Devi in 2017, where the court had restrained the civic body from interfering in any manner into the possession over the property.“The officials can misuse their extraordinary unlimited administrative powers against my client and her family members to implicate in fake cases and forcibly dispossess them from the property.....and have also mentally tortured, harassed them through their employees of police and other administrative officers,” the petition reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-cantt-property-dispute-contempt-notice-to-former-dc-ssp-4-others-101625602156645.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Reserve five seats in J&K for Sikhs: SAD to delimitation panel||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday urged the Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory Delimitation Commission to reserve five seats for members of the Sikh community in the union territory legislative assembly. Akali leader and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra handed over a letter written by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal in this regard to delimitation commission chairman Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai in Srinagar. The SAD has urged the commission to favorably consider reserving three seats for the Sikh community in Jammu and two in Srinagar. Badal, in his communiqué to the delimitation commission, said that several times, including at the time of the Partition of the country, promises were made to the Sikh population of J&K that counterchecks will be created in the democratic process to ensure their social and economic wellbeing. “It was even proposed that a definite number of seats will be reserved for members of the Sikh community in the J&K legislature on the pattern of that done for the Anglo Indian community in Parliament and state assemblies. Sadly, the then Congress government did not honour any of the promises made to the Sikh community post Partition,” he wrote. Asking the commission to right this historical wrong, Badal said reservation of seats for Sikhs in the J&K UT will ensure the voice of the community was taken into consideration while making executive decisions. He said Sikhs in J&K had been complaining for long that they were being left behind in the development process because there was no reservation for Sikhs in jobs in J&K despite their minority status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/reserve-five-seats-in-j-k-for-sikhs-sad-to-delimitation-panel-101625602096656.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sexual harassment of GMCH student: Accused surrenders in Chandigarh court||The OT technician, who allegedly sexually harassed a third-year medical student of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32, surrendered before the court on Tuesday and was sent to one-day police remand.The surrender comes a day after the district court had dismissed the accused’s anticipatory bail application.The complainant had stated in the FIR that on June 27, she was on evening duty and when she went to the store room to get some medicines, the OT technician, named Kamleshwar, followed her: “As I tried to run away, he held me from the front and molested me. As I managed to get out of the store room, he threatened that he would kill me if I ever complained about it,” the student had complained.The accused, who is a resident of Mullanpur, was booked under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (Criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code on June 28.In his plea, the accused had alleged being a victim of regionalism and had told the court that a “false” case had been registered against him. He had said that on the day of the incident, the complainant had asked for technical support and rudely addressed him as “bhaiya”. He added that he had only objected to it and sought that instead he be addressed as “sir”. He had also said that his wife worked there as well, so how could he commit such an act.He was placed under suspension on July 3. A letter issued by GMCH had mentioned that the accused had not appeared in front of the internal complaint committee of sexual harassment of women at workplace, and a case against him was under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sexual-harassment-of-gmch-student-accused-surrenders-in-chandigarh-court-101625602036732.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray quashes speculation of BJP patch-up||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday dismissed the speculation that the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would renew their alliance and slammed Opposition legislators for boycotting the last day of the monsoon session of the Assembly in the midst of a pandemic.“There is no possibility of anything happening which did not happen in 30 years,” Thackeray told reporters after the two-day session drew to a close.The BJP and the Sena have been allies since 1995, but latter formed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government in 2019 with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress. Thackeray walked out of the alliance even though the saffron combine won a majority that would have allowed them to form the government, after the BJP rejected Sena’s demand to share the CM post over half a tenure each.Recent meetings between leaders of both parties however, fuelled speculation over a shift in the political equation between the former allies. BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis’s meetings with BJP’s top leadership, especially with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi last week, led a section of BJP leaders to speculate on the longevity of the state government. On Sunday, Fadnavis also said that Sena and BJP may have differences of opinion but they were not enemies.“Ours is a formidable combine and I am sitting between Congress and NCP,” Thackeray said referring to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on his left respectively. “There is no question slipping out of this,” Thackeray said.The CM criticised the BJP legislators’ behaviour on Monday which led to the suspension of 12 Opposition leaders, including former ministers Ashish Shelar, Sanjay Kute, Girish Mahajan, and Jaykumar Rawal.They were suspended for a year for misbehaving with the presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav during a heated debate on the issue of obtaining caste census data from the Centre. Jadhav said the legislators had hurled abuses at him, and added on Tuesday that he had received threats on social media for his action.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that the party was considering moving court to challenge the suspension.BJP legislators protested the suspension and boycotted the Assembly on Tuesday. They held a mock session outside the Vidhan Sabha building prompting security personnel to put an end to the protest. The legislators however continued the mock assembly in the press room.The incident occurred during a debate on the resolution moved by the state government on July 5 to seek empirical data from the Centre in order to restore reservation granted to members of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) which stands to be abolished following a recent Supreme Court order. There is a 27% reservation in local self-government body elections for this category. The BJP opposed the resolution and as the discussions became heated, Opposition legislators approached Jadhav’s seat and tried to snatch the microphone and remove the mace on the table.“What was the need for the BJP to create a hue and cry over a resolution asking the Centre to provide census data of 2011 to enable the State Backward Class Commission to prepare empirical data of OBCs? Even if you feel the resolution wouldn’t yield anything, couldn’t you still support it?” Thackeray said.“The action taken against the BJP legislators was for their shameful and unprecedented behaviour. If they are calling it black chapter in democracy, what they are doing by using the Central agencies against us? (…) Is using Central agencies like CBI and ED a sign of a healthy democracy? If the priority is to grab power at any cost instead of providing relief to the people battling the Covid pandemic, then it’s a really sad state of affairs,” Thackeray added.MVA leaders have accused the BJP-led Centre of attempting to “destabilize” the state government through central probe agencies. Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh is under investigation for his alleged role in an extortion racket and a purported cash-for-transfer scam involving police officials based on allegations by former Mumbai police commissioner, Parambir Singh, while relatives of the deputy chief minister are also under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik is also under probe for alleged money laundering.“Yes, Uddhav Thackeray is right, what happened in the lower house on Monday was unprecedented. We have never seen an action against legislators like this before. The suspension came from a presiding officer, and not from the deputy speaker Narahari Zirwal (who is acting as Speaker). The action was taken on false charges. As far as Thackeray’s allegations about the so-called misuse (of power) is concerned, they should understand that the probe by the Central agencies is being conducted on the complaints of the police officers (Param Bir Singh and Sachin Vaze) in state government service,” Maharashtra BJP’s vice president Madhav Bhandari said.Bhandari said that there was no substance in the reports of any alliance between the two parties. “These are all speculations floated by the Sena,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-quashes-speculation-of-bjp-patchup-101625601407830.html

07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Decade on, Dera Bassi waste management project yet to take off||Even after a decade, the solid waste management project at Samgoli in Dera Bassi is yet to see the light of day as the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has backed out.Now the state government is looking for the latest technology, by which refuse-derived fuel (RDF) or by-products produced from waste can be used to make coal to be sold to thermal plants in the state.In March last year, the Punjab government had given approval to hand over construction and operations of the ‘waste to energy’ plant to NTPC. The state government had also given approval to the local bodies department for an MoU between NTPC and the Mohali municipal corporation (MC), being the nodal agency, for the execution of the project, but the project could not be materialised.The project has been hanging fire for the past decade. Mohali MC had prepared the detailed project report (DPR) 11 years back at a cost of ₹100 crore, including the land cost.A senior official of the local bodies department said, “We have not received any response from NTPC and are now working on the latest technology to process waste, which will help us make RDF into coal, which can be sold to thermal plants in the state. We will be sending the technology to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for approval within a week.”Currently, Mohali is generating 150 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage in a day, which is being dumped at an unauthorised site in the Industrial Area, Phase 8B; the nearby residents and industrialists are already protesting.In August last year, Mohali had slipped to the 157th place out of 382 cities, in the nationwide Swachh Survekshan rankings. In 2019, the district’s rank was 153, while in 2018, it was 109. The main reason for Mohali’s worst slip is that the city failed to get garbage-processing projects off the ground.When contacted, MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have only constructed the boundary wall of the plant and the state government is in the process of signing a deal with the company with the latest technology.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decade-on-dera-bassi-waste-management-project-yet-to-take-off-101625601736643.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers to submit land details with revenue dept from Aug 1||From August 1, the Punjab revenue department will start receiving from the state farmers the details of their farmland as per Centre’s mandate to integrate the land records with food grain procurement. The Centre has already made it clear that there will be no further postponement and “it has to be done from the upcoming paddy procurement scheduled in October-November”. The Union ministry of food and public distribution had last year asked the state to implement the new system, however, the Capt Amarinder Singh government was apprehensive that it will put a full stop on the open-ended procurement system. The state was allowed an extension during the previous rabi season, but now the state’s top officials say the Centre has made it clear that the new system has to be in place for the kharif season since in its absence, there will be no procurement. The decision was taken on Tuesday in a meeting of top officials of revenue, food and civil supplies, governance reforms and agriculture departments and the chief minister’s office (CMO). “We will draw out a plan for a publicity campaign, inviting farmers to make voluntary declarations. The government is also finalising a detailed concept plan,” said financial commissioner (revenue) Ravneet Kaur. It was also decided in the meeting that farmers can submit land details at the 175 farad kendras of the revenue department and 500 sewa kendras of the governance reforms department across the state. The details will be accepted by the end of September as the paddy procurement is scheduled to start from October 1. After compiling the information collected at the farad and sewa kendras, it will be linked with the public finance management system portal used for payment of minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers. “The farmers will give information about the land they own or the land they are tilling or both; area over which paddy is sown and if they are tenants or have taken land on lease, along with the details of the landowner,” added a top revenue officer. At least 30-lakh hectare area is expected to go under paddy cultivation this kharif season out of which 5 lakh hectares is expected to be under premium basmati crop. At least 9.53 lakh farmers were transferred MSP by way of new direct benefit transfer (DBT) in the rabi season. The number, however, is expected to go up during the paddy procurement as more farmers sell their produce to government agencies, unlike wheat, which private companies also purchase. The Centre has not yet released the rural development fund (RDF) to Punjab for wheat procurement that ended in May, setting the condition to first integrate land records. The state charges 3% RDF on wheat and paddy procured on behalf of the Centre. With ₹25,500 crore disbursed to farmers for wheat procurement at MSP this season, the Centre owes Punjab ₹760 crore in RDF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-to-submit-land-details-with-revenue-dept-from-aug-1-101625601676951.html

On June 23, a police inspector working with CID, Pervaz Ahmad Dar, was shot dead at Nowgam when he was coming out of a mosque after offering prayers. Five days before that special police officer Javid Ahmad was gunned down outside his house. These back-to-back attacks on policemen, especially when they were not on duty, have prompted officials to review SOPs and adherence to the new guidelines. Soon after such attacks last month, J&K DGP Dilbag Singh ordered security review of policemen, especially those considered as the ‘soft targets’. As per the official data of last three decades, more than 520 SPOs and around 1,100 police personnel have been killed in J&K and many among them were murdered either inside their residences or somewhere close by.Kashmir IGP Vijay Kumar has said that by targeting innocent civilians or policemen, militants are trying to create fear among people. “These attacks are barbaric,” he said.“There are SOPs in place which policemen and officers need to follow, especially in those areas where movement of militants is prominent. After every targeted attack, officers try to educate their men about precautions which they should take when they are either on leave or off duty,” said a senior police officer. He said militants always look for ‘soft targets’.This isn’t the first time when militants have targeted cops in the Valley. Earlier, militant groups had asked locals to leave their jobs in the police or face consequences. The police have blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed for these recent attacks.Many SPOs after deserting the forces have even joined militant ranks and several have been neutralised during encounters.Last year, an SPO-turned-militant, Shakoor Parray, was killed in a gunfight with forces in Anantnag. He had joined as an SPO in 2014 and was converted as a constable. He had even taken away four rifles before joining a militant outfit. In October 2020, SPO Altaf Hussain had decamped with two AK-47 rifles and three magazines.In April, a woman SPO was arrested in south Kashmir after police blamed her for uttering anti-India and pro-freedom slogans off camera, thus inviting action under the ULA(P) Act. She had accused the forces of trying to harass her family in the name of search operation.The household of the accused is a suspected shelter point of an active Hizbul-Mujahideen terrorist, Aslam Dar. The woman has been on police radar as a suspected OGW. “It remains to be investigated whether her act was meant to be a disruption tactic to aid escape of the said terrorist when the search operation was underway,” a police spokesperson had said soon after her arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/backtoback-attacks-on-cops-prompt-police-to-review-security-of-their-men-101625601375895.html

Senior leaders, including state party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, CLP leader Mukesh Agnihotri, GS Bali and Sudhir Sharma, were present at the meet. The byelections were necessitated due to death of the sitting members. While Mandi MP Ramswaroop Sharma allegedly committed suicide, Fatehpur MLA Sujan Singh Pathania died due to prolonged illness. Jubbal-Kotkhai legislator Narinder Bragta succumbed to post-Covid complications. Shukla said Kangra was a politically significant district and he was here to discuss the strategy for byelections as well as the 2022 assembly polls. “Public’s mood is in the Congress’ favour and we would return to the power in 2022 with thumping majority,” said Shukla. “There is also possibility of winning all three byelections. People are fed up of the government and there is anger building up against the regime,” he added. He said nothing significant has happened in Himachal on the development front under BJP regime. Taking a dig at the Centre for rising fuel prices, Shukla said the petrol rates have crossed ₹100 while diesel would soon hit the century. Shukla said the Congress will announce its nominees as soon as the Election Commission declares the byelections. He also downplayed the infighting in the Congress stating that all leaders were united and will work to win the elections. Shukla said there was no party without factionalism. “More than us, it is in BJP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-gears-up-for-bypolls-in-hp-shukla-presides-over-crucial-meetings-101625601316495.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Carry out exercise in free, fair manner: NC, Cong to J&K delimitation panel||Leaders of different mainstream political parties on Tuesday met the Delimitation Commission soon after its members arrived in Srinagar, beginning their four-day J&K tour. Besides political leaders, the commission will be holding talks with district officials and other stakeholders on the ongoing process of carving out new constituencies in the region. Leaders of the National Conference (NC), the People’s Conference, the CPI, the CPI(M), the Panthers Party, the Congress, the BJP, the Apni Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party met the commission at Hotel Lalit.Former SC judge Ranjana Prakash Desai heads the commission that was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of J&K, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. The commission has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise. It will also carve out constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the first time in J&K.The issue of delimitation was discussed at PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir on June 24. The commission arrived in Srinagar a day after the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration said it was disappointed over the outcome of the all-party meeting with the PM. The alliance had demanded the restoration of the region’s statehood before elections were conducted. It also criticised the lack of ‘confidence-building measures’.A five-member NC delegation that met the commission told them the exercise should have been done after elections and termed it ‘unconstitutional’ based on the Reorganisation Act that has been challenged in the Supreme Court.“We told them that people in J&K have lost faith on institutions, so this should be done on transparent basis as people have lot of apprehensions. New constituencies should be created on the basis of population and nothing else,” said NC’s provisional president Nasir Aslam Wani. Sofi Yusuf, who led the BJP delegation, said, “We told them that delimitation should be done on the basis of merit and due to huge population of Schedule Tribes, nine to 10 assembly segments should be kept reserved for them. Also, we told them that previous delimitation had helped a few political families of J&K, which shouldn’t happen this time.” Jammu & Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir said, “The commission members told us that the process will be transparent based on the suggestions of different political parties. We believe this should have been done in 2026 along with the entire country with the new Census.” Mir said, “We didn’t give any suggestion to them as we feel this process is not legal.”Apni Party leader Rafi Mir said they had a fruitful interaction with the commission. People’s Conference spokesperson Adnan Ashraf said the party’s delegation told the commission that there were rumours that the aim of the delimitation was to disempower people in Kashmir. “The number of seats in each district should be based on population,” he added. Meanwhile, CPI (M) delegation told the commission that whatever happened on August 5, 2019 was unacceptable. “These decisions have dented the confidence level of people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions. We are not against delimitation, but wanted it to be carried along with rest of the country,” party’s J&K secretary Ghulam Nabi Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/carry-out-exercise-in-free-fair-manner-nc-cong-to-delimitation-panel-101625601315965.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||KLF’s targeted killing module busted, Patiala jail escapee among 4 held||Police claimed to have busted a targeted killing module run by Germany-based radicals associated with the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) and arrested four persons, including a murder case undertrial who escaped from the Patiala jail in April, following an exchange of fire in Ludhiana district’s Khanna late Monday. Those arrested are Jaspreet Singh Noopi, the jailbreak escapee and a resident of Dadi village in Rupnagar district, Jaswinder Singh of Fatehpur Bunga village of Rupnagar, Gaurav Jain, alias Minku of Kaliawala village in Haryana’s Sirsa district and Prashant Silelan, alias Kabir of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. The police have recovered two .32 bore pistols along with four magazines, a country-made weapon and a Toyota Etios car which the accused had robbed from Mohali a few days ago. Jaspreet, who is facing trial in 7 cases, including that of murder and attempt to murder, was dismissed from the army. Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gursharandeep Singh Grewal said a checkpoint was set up near Pristine Mall on the national highway. The police team stopped the Etios (bearing number PB-01-AS-6845) for checking. “The three occupants of the car opened fire on the police party in an attempt to escape. The police arrested Jaswinder and Gaurav on the spot, while Jaspreet managed to flee. The police formed special teams to arrest him. Hours later, he was arrested along with his Prashant,” the SSp added. A case under sections 307, 332, 336 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act was registered against the accused at the Khanna (city-2) police station.Grewal said on June 25 Jaspreet had robbed a commuter of the Toyota Etios on Airport Road in Zirakpur, Mohali, at gunpoint. “Jaspreet revealed that he was lodged in the Patiala jail in a murder case registered against him at Kiratpur. He escaped from the Patiala jail on April 28 along with two other inmates Sher Singh of Lopoke village of Amritsar and Inderjit Singh, alias Dhiana of Ranipur Komboa village of Kapurthala. On July 3, he along with his accomplices also looted ₹50,000 from a petrol pump employee at Kharar. He came in contact with foreign-based radicals and they agreed to finance him in return for targeted killings. He even did recce on some people in Punjab,” said the SSP. His Germany-based handlers financed him through international payment platforms like Western Union and PayTm and sourced the weapons from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand for targetted killings.Jaswinder is also facing trial in a liquor smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/klfs-targeted-killing-module-busted-patiala-jail-escapee-among-4-held-101625601260104.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing case: Ex-DGP Saini refuses to undergo lie-detector test, suspended IG agrees||Former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and ex-Moga senior superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Sharma have refused to undergo the lie-detector test in connection with the Kotkapura firing case while suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal agreed for the same if the Supreme Court guidelines are followed. The special investigation team (IST) probing the Kotkapura case had filed an application in a court last month, seeking permission to conduct narco-analysis, polygraph test and brain electrical activation profile (BEAP) of Saini, Umranangal and Sharma. Citing ailments and age, Saini’s counsel told the court that the medicines used during the polygraph test could harm his client’s health. Also, Sharma’s counsel told the court that he underwent a cardiac bypass surgery last year so he will not be able to undergo the test as advised by his doctor. Umaranagal’s lawyer Gursahib Singh Brar said the suspended IG is ready to undergo the test and they have informed the court about this. “But we have demanded that the test should be conducted by following the apex court guidelines. The police will have to inform him about the procedure used in the test. Now, the court has asked Umranangal to appear in person to give written consent for this,” he added. Judicial magistrate Ajay Pal Singh has summoned Saini, Sharma and Umarnagal to appear in the court on July 9.

In a series of tweets, Sidhu pressed for the annulment of these PPAs through a new legislation in the assembly, stating that the free power promise is a mere fantasy till this is done. “Hollow promises of free power have no meaning until PPAs are annulled through a new legislation in Punjab Vidhan Sabha... 300 units of free power is merely a fantasy, until the faulty clauses in PPAs are keeping Punjab bonded (sic),” he tweeted, reiterating the fix suggested by him. Sukhbir defends PPAs signed during SAD-BJP rule His latest tweets came a day after Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal stoutly defended the PPAs signed during the previous Akali-BJP regime, rebutting the objections related to fixed charges and costly power raised by the Congress leaders. He even dared the government to cancel the PPAs and register an FIR if any wrong was committed but make good the shortfall at cheaper rates. Sidhu, Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa and some other detractors of Amarinder in the ruling Congress have been demanding cancellation or renegotiation of PPAs without offering a strategy for bridging the supply-demand gap if the state government accepts their demand. The renegotiation of PPAs with independent power producers is a part of the 18-point agenda given by the Congress high command, based on the feedback from party leaders, to Amarinder for implementation before the assembly elections early next year. PPAs designed to pay fixed charges at peak demand Hitting out at Sukhbir Singh Badal, Sidhu, in his tweets, alleged that these PPAs are just another example of the Badal family’s corruption, designed to give corrupt benefits to them (Badals) without any thought for welfare of Punjabis. “PPAs bind Punjab to pay fixed charges for 100% production, whereas other states pay no more than 80%. If these fixed charges being paid to private power plants under PPAs were not paid, it would directly and immediately decrease cost of power in Punjab by ₹1.20 per unit,” he tweeted. Claiming that PPAs are based on a wrong calculation of power demand in the state, he said that peak demand of 13,000-14,000 mega watt (MW) is only for four months, whereas non-peak power demand falls down to 5,000-6,000 MW, but PPAs have been designed to pay fixed charges at the peak demand. “Even more alarming! There is no provision for mandatory supply of power from these private power plants during the peak season under the PPAs... Thus, they have shut down two power plants in this paddy-sowing season without repairing them and Punjab has to buy additional power (sic),” he posted. He said that private plants keep finding loopholes to file litigation that has cost Punjab ₹25,000 crore already. On Monday, Sidhu demanded a white paper on PPAs, stating that he had been seeking this since 2017. “Bureaucratic control of the department relegates people-elected minister to mere showpieces,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/free-power-promise-mere-fantasy-if-ppas-not-annulled-says-sidhu-101625601257600.html
07-07-2021||Bangalore||Ready to appear over no-arrest guarantee: Twitter head to Karnataka HC||Twitter’s India head Manish Maheshwari told the Karnataka high court on Tuesday that he was ready to appear before the UP Police if they guarantee that they will not arrest him, even as the single-judge bench asked the police if they had ascertained that Twitter India was capable of controlling the content on its platform.The UP Police had insisted that Maheshwari appearing before them in-person while he had offered to give a statement over video conferencing with regards to a video that alleged an elderly Muslim man in Ghaziabad was a victim of hate crime. Police said that their investigation later revealed that the incident was over a personal dispute and booked nine people, including Twitter India, for allegedly circulating false information to fan communal tension.During Tuesday’s hearing, in a petition filed by Maheshwari challenging his appearance before the UP police for questioning, the single-judge bench of justice G Narendar asked the police: “Have you even ascertained whether Twitter India is capable of controlling the content… if the entity is not able to commit such acts, then where is the point?”The court added: “This petition is nothing unless you can show he could have prevented it.”Senior Advocate CV Nagesh, representing Twitter India, told the Court that the firm and its employees do not have control over the data of Twitter users. Twitter India and Twitter are two different entities and should not be mixed up, the court added.In response to this, UP Police’s council Prasanna Kumar said that it did not have information on the responsibilities and liabilities of Twitter India.“This is information available in the public domain. If the investigation officer says that information can only be extracted through interrogation, I don’t know what to say. You do not want to investigate this,” the court responded.Twitter India’s council also told the court that UP Police not agreeing to Maheshwari appearing before the police via video conferencing showed an ulterior motive on the police’s side. He added that Maheshwari is ready to appear before the police in Ghaziabad within 24 hours if UP Police give an undertaking to the court that they will not arrest him.He, however, submitted that UP Police did not have jurisdiction to issue notice to Maheshwari under Section 160 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC), and that the FIR does not name the provisions of the new IT Rules, 2021.CrPC 160 pertains to a police officer’ s power to require attendance of witnessesOn June 16, the government said that Twitter will be considered an intermediary only after it follows the new Information Technology (IT) rules and it will no longer be protected from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third party content, if it did not do so.Meanwhile, Twitter on Tuesday sternly told by the Delhi High Court that it cannot take “as long as it wants” in this country to appoint a grievance officer. The company has been given time till Thursday to tell the court when it will appoint an India-based officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ready-to-appear-over-no-arrest-guarantee-twitter-head-to-karnataka-hc-101625600872951.html

07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cricketers move to US with eye on national team||For cricketer Sarbajit Ladda, the last couple of days have been traumatic. He lost his father in Patiala and could not attend his last rites due to the ongoing travel ban. The leg-spinner was in the US playing in the WCL Premier Division cricket championship for Potomac Cricket and Sports Club.Coping with the grief, a determined Ladda now wants to make his late father’s wish come true: to play for the USA.Had the 34-year-old cricketer got ample chances from the Punjab Cricket Association, he would not have made the shift. Seeing another Punjab cricketer Sunny Sohal getting picked for the USA team a few years back motivated Ladda to chase greener pastures. Also, the fact that USA Cricket is growing and expanding tempted Ladda to make the move.Ladda was selected in the DC Hawks team which will be featured in the USA Cricket and ICC-backed inaugural Minor League Cricket starting from July 31. A total of 27 teams will be competing in Minor League Cricket.‘Eyeing a place in USA team’“It is a great chance for me. I have been doing well in the various leagues in the USA since 2018. A cricketer who does well in the Minor League Cricket will draw attention for national team selection and further get a chance to make a strong case for selection in the Major League Cricket next year. I want to do well for the DC Hawks and leave a mark. I am eying a place in the USA team,” said Ladda, who has played for Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils and Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League.He first went to the USA to play in the WCL Premier Division cricket championship for former Punjab U-19 team captain Rajit Passey, whose also from Patiala and owns Potomac Cricket and Sports Club. He did exceptionally well and bagged 23 wickets in 13 games, and the following year was much better with 27 wickets in 13 games.“I was being ignored by the Patiala Cricket District Association along with the Punjab Cricket Association. Passey paaji was very encouraging and kind. And when I got to know that USA Cricket is going to expand and was inviting players from India, Pakistan, South Africa and West Indies, I decided to make a move to the US,” added Ladda, who last played in the Ranji Trophy for Punjab in 2015.A sharp leg-spinner, who has played 28 first-class (89 wickets), 13 List-A (17 wickets) and 13 T20 (10 wickets) matches for Punjab, and an employee of the State of Patiala, Ladda has bid adieu to India in pursuit of making it to the USA cricket team.Another cricketer from Patiala, Ravi Inder Mehra, has also followed the same path and has been roped in by DC Hawks for the Minor League Cricket after doing well for Potomac Cricket and Sports Club for six years. A left-handed opening batsman, Mehra has played 45 first-class, 37 List-A and 28 T20 matches for Punjab.“I started playing for Potomac Cricket and Sports Club in 2015. It was a great experience going to the US and exploring; cricket-wise, things were bad in Punjab. I would do well in the inter-district tournaments, but won’t be picked for the Punjab senior team. It was disappointing. Our club has been winning the WCL Premier Division cricket championship since 2016. With Minor League coming up, it will provide a great platform to players like me. Cricket is going big in the USA and players from various countries are coming here. Like Sunny Sohal, I, too, hope to play for the USA some day,” said 32-year-old Mehra, who last played for Punjab in 2017 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Tournament.Passey, who co-owns DC Hawks and also Potomac Cricket and Sports Club, has invited several cricketers from India to a platform since 2013. He believes Minor League Cricket would be an ideal tournament for cricketers from various countries like India, Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa to get involved with USA cricket and to play at top-level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cricketers-move-tous-with-eye-on-national-team-101625600837963.html

Police suspect it to be the handiwork of Irani gang members as the modus operandi seems to match. Complainant Shanti Lal, 23, said he was heading to his workshop after receiving a gold wire from a jeweller when two men intercepted him and engaged him in a religious conversation. The duo even tricked him into handing over his wallet for a brief moment.

PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said, “The sero survey was initiated on June 24 and so far, out of the 396 children from urban areas that have been tested, antibodies were found in 257 of them (65%). The samples were collected from Sectors 22, 24, 36, 56 and 11. Besides, 262 children from rural areas (73%), out of the 360 that were tested from Burail, Maloya, Dhanas, Attawa and Khajeri, had natural antibodies. This means the infection was widespread in rural areas.” He added that children from colonies will be tested in coming days.A sero survey examines how many people have been infected with Covid-19 and recovered from it. It is conducted using an antibody test, also known as a serology test, and it helps examine if an individual’s immune system has responded to the infection.Dr Ram added these are the interim results as the study aims to collect around 2,700 samples in total, which will provide a clearer picture of the actual percentage of children between 6-18 years of age who had been infected. Dr Mini P Singh from the virology department said the testing is being carried out using a high throughput CLIA machine through which reports can be made available quickly.  Dr Ram said, “The initial findings revealed that two-thirds of the children have already been infected in Chandigarh and have enough antibodies to fight the virus, even without vaccination. The fatality rate among children is also low in UT, indicating that children recover from the virus quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sero-survey-by-pgimerfinds-antibodies-in-69-children-in-chandigarh-101625600596498.html

She has been replaced by Dr Mukta Kumar.While Dr Kaur refused to talk, Vij and Rajeev Arora, Haryana’s additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, did not revert to HT’s multiple attempts to contact them.Dr Veena Singh, director general health services, said she was unaware about the suspension, but the inquiry was held as per administrative procedure.Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta confirmed the suspension was a fallout of person reasons: “It seems Anil Vij had given some direction, which was not followed by her.”“I am disheartened to know that Dr Jasjeet Kaur has been suspended. She has done a lot of good work and I have not seen anyone as dedicated as her. She is the best chief medical officer in Haryana,” the MLA, who is also the state’s Vidhan Sabha speaker said.Dr Kaur took charge as Panchkula’s civil surgeon in February 2020, a month before the pandemic hit the district and is believed to have played a crucial role in the district’s fight against the contagion. At the time, the civil hospital in Panchkula’s Sector 6 had no ICU, molecular lab for sampling or oxygen plant. But she managed to set up a 15-bed ICU by April and subsequently increased its capacity to 24 beds. From none to 18 ventilators and 40 BiPap machines were also installed.

A survey – in which 15,950 parents from across the country participated – has revealed that 63% respondents mentioned that their children’s schools had hiked fees, even though classes are being conducted online completely and 65% said that their respective state governments have been ineffective in regulating school fees during the Covid-19 outbreak.“In separate incidents, parents from across the country have been protesting against unjust school managements hiking fees in private schools. Several states, such as Uttar Pradesh, have directed schools to not hike fees, and the Supreme Court, too, has asked school managements not to insist on payment of fees for facilities not used by students. But the unrest among parents persists,” said a report made public by LocalCircles, a community social media platform enabling citizens and small businesses to escalate issues for policy enforcement and interventions.The survey further highlighted that those who were forced to pay an increased fee for the 2021-22 academic year, nearly 33% are bearing a 20% increase in the annual fees. “Hike in school fees is a fight between parents and the management every year, and most times, the school managements give no explanation behind the hike. However, in a year when families have been struck emotionally and economically, the least these schools can do is maintain the same fee structure,” said Anju Mehta, a parent activist who has regularly fought against private school managements in the state. She added that the incapability of state mechanism to control private school managements is the root cause of the problem.At the same time, school heads have time and again highlighted that whatever costs they have saved by non-usage of certain facilities, have been instead invested in providing digital education to students. “Several schools have invested in software and software expert companies to handle virtual classrooms and ensure that regular classes are not affected. None of these have come cheap, and in order to continue good quality education, we have no choice but to hike fees. Most schools have also given the option of fee payment in instalments to parents, knowing the financial burden everyone is facing,” said the principal of a south Mumbai school, on condition of anonymity.Previously, LocalCircles had also conducted a survey of 19,000 parents where 76% of the respondents said that they are not ready to send their children to school unless there is no Covid-19 case in their districts or till all the children are vaccinated first. Interestingly, over 65% respondents have said that their children receive the Covid-19 vaccine if it is made available for kids by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/63-parents-say-schools-increased-fees-despite-lectures-being-held-online-survey-101625600235822.html

It is our endeavour to hold discussions with all,” Maken said at a media briefing at the party office in Jaipur.“The work is in progress. It means that discussions with all are being held”. He added that a discussion with the chief minister will also be held later in the evening. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot can induct nine ministers to the cabinet that can have 30 members at the most.Maken was in Jaipur on Tuesday to hold meetings to review the preparations for the campaign against inflation and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government from Wednesday.Maken said differences between leaders in states such as Rajasthan and Punjab was not unique to the Congress.“Why do you only see Congress…why not BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal? Every time in every state, in all political parties there are different people with their own thoughts. When has it happened that people do not have different thoughts or opinions? Our effort is to take everyone together and make decisions,” he said.In July last year, Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur to camp in Haryana’s Manesar, threatening the stability of the Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as the state Congress chief. It was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold. The Pilot camp has been nudging the party leadership to take the requisite steps.The demands for political appointment and cabinet reshuffle gained momentum after reports of resentment in the camp led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who along with 18 MLAs rebelled against the leadership of Ashok Gehlot last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/cabinet-reshuffle-and-political-appointments-in-rajasthan-is-work-in-progress-ajay-maken-101625599936464.html

Waste collected from households is dumped at over 40 secondary dumping points in the city. The tipping fee is paid to the company for shifting garbage from secondary dumps to the main dumpsite on Tajpur road.Citing hike in fuel prices and mounting maintenance expenses, the firm had been threatening to suspend work from June 10 if the tipping fee was not revised. The firm had demanded that the civic body should at least pay ₹435 per tonne.Already facing flak from the National Green Tribunal for failure to dispose of the legacy waste in the city, the municipal corporation didn’t want more trouble, especially ahead of monsoon.Mayor Balkar Sandhu had recently conducted a meeting with MC officials to look into the matter. A committee, including senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, leader of opposition in MC house Harbhajan Singh Dang, councillors Jai Prakash, Yashpal Chaudhary and few health branch officials, had found that the MC won’t be able to lift the garbage on its own.An official, requesting anonymity, said, “The city generates over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage a day. It will be Herculean task for the MC to lift garbage on its own as it has no machinery, especially tippers, required for transporting garbage to the main dumpsite on Tajpur Road.”Mayor Sandhu said on Tuesday, “After due deliberations, the committee decided to hike the tipping fee by ₹101. We believe that with the revision of rates, garbage collection in the city will be back on track,” said mayor Sandhu.On February 4, A2Z company, the firm previously tasked with solid waste management of the city, had terminated its services over pending dues and delay in payments. Following this, the MC had made a stop-gap arrangement and roped in the third party to whom A2Z company had sublet the work of lifting garbage in the city. BJP councillors had earlier targeted mayor Balkar Sandhu for allegedly favouring the contractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tipping-fee-of-firm-lifting-garbage-in-ludhiana-hiked-by-rs-101-101625599516468.html

The development is considered significant ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) elections as Singh is a prominent North Indian face and has support in the community which is BJP’s vote bank from the past few years.According to a statement by the party, Singh will join BJP in Mumbai in the presence of leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.“I quit Congress on the issue of the abrogation of Article 370. There could be opposition to the process but there was no reason for Congress to oppose the move. I had asked for reasons on the party’s stand on it, but did not get any reply. I am joining BJP without putting forth any conditions,” Singh said.He had quit Congress in September 2019 after he felt side-lined by the party leadership. Singh had been sulking from party activities at least a couple of years before that.

After Bharadwaj’s counsel submitted that the judge who granted the 90-day extension of her custody to Pune Police in 2018 was not competent and the order was illegal, the court adjourned the hearing till Wednesday so that the information about the judge could be verified by the court registry. The counsel further informed the court that if the contention was correct, not only Bharadwaj’s detention, but that of the eight other accused in the case – Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling and Mahesh Raut – would also be illegal. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing Bharadwaj’s bail application, was informed by advocate Dr Yug Choudhry that the judge who heard the application of Pune Police for the extension of Bharadwaj’s custody was not a designated special judge under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, and hence, could not hear matters pertaining to scheduled offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Choudhry further submitted that based on the responses received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act from HC registry, it was found that judge KD Vadane, who had granted the 90-day extension of Bharadwaj’s detention on November 26, 2018, was only a district and additional sessions judge at Pune, though he had claimed to be a special judge. Choudhry submitted that Vadane had signed two orders, one as a special judge and the second as special UAPA judge. Citing the RTI response, Choudhry informed the court that between January 2018 and July 2019, Vadane was not appointed as special judge under section 22 of NIA Act. Choudhry submitted that Vadane also could not have authorised the supplementary charge sheet filed by Pune Police in February 2019. The court was then informed that the RTI responses showed that though there were other NIA judges at the sessions court in Pune, the police had placed the matter before Vadane. Choudhry expressed his dismay and said, “This goes to the very heart of the judicial system. With utmost humility, the bedrock of judiciary is shaken when a non-designated judge calls himself a designated judge... And people are languishing in custody under his orders…” After hearing the submissions and on Choudhry’s insistence that the state should not be allowed to file a reply as it had not done so even after being given sufficient time, the court directed chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare to produce relevant records in relation to the petition. The court then said that it would ask the HC registry to verify the information provided by the petitioner and posted further hearing to Thursday. Meanwhile, Gadling has filed an appeal against the rejection of his temporary bail application by the special NIA court last September. Gadling had sought bail to conduct the last rites of his mother, but he was denied the same. On Tuesday, Gadling’s lawyer, senior advocate Indira Jaising, informed the bench of justice Shinde that on the first death anniversary of the accused’s mother on August 13, he should be granted temporary bail. HC will hear the appeal on July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-case-furnish-records-of-sudha-bharadwaj-s-default-bail-plea-hc-tells-maharashtra-govt-101625599335801.html

They include two women, aged 28 and 37, who are residents of Chander Nagar and Kailash Chowk area respectively, and a 55-year-old man who lives at Bhamia Road near Jamalpur area.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said the trio had tested positive in the month of June following which teams swung into action to check and destroy the dengue larvae.He said none of the patients have any travel history and all developed the fever indigenously.As many as 1,809 confirmed cases of dengue had been reported in the district last year, while 2,516 people were suspected to have caught the disease. Of the total, as many as 1,353 were from Ludhiana city while 408 were patients from other districts.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia has issued an advisory and appealed to residents to stay alert as the season of dengue and chikungunya fever has started. She said residents must be careful and not let water stagnate in coolers, containers, nets behind the fridge, pots, rubbish on roofs etc. She also advised people to wear clothes that cover the body completely and make use of mosquito repellents nets at bedtime. She further said in case of fever, people should go for paracetamol instead of aspirin or ibuprofen.The civil surgeon revealed that suspected dengue fever patients have been shifted to sentinel surveillance hospitals of civil hospitals at Ludhiana, Khanna and Jagraon where patients can get free confirmation tests. Supportive treatment for dengue is provided free of cost by the health department. The health department has also started activities to prevent dengue and chikungunya fever, the civil surgeon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-receding-covid-wave-dengue-poses-fresh-challenge-for-ludhiana-health-dept-101625599276474.html
07-07-2021||Other||HC chides Maharashtra government, BMC for treating state land as ‘paternal property’||The Bombay high court, while coming down heavily on the Maharashtra government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), observed that it seemed that the state assets were being assumed to be the “paternal property” of the executive, as illegal and unauthorised constructions were allowed to blatantly come up on government land without adhering to the existing laws. The sharp criticism was prompted after the state submitted that as per the Slums Act, structures of slum dwellers holding valid photo pass were protected and could not be demolished. However, amicus curiae Sharan Jagtiani pointed out that while there was protection for slums, there was no law that restrained the local authorities concerned, including BMC, from taking action against the structures that violated the 14-feet restriction. Hence, the report of court-appointed inquiry commissioner was justified in its observations that illegal structures had the patronage of local civic and political entities. A division bench of chief justice Dipanakar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo motu public interest litigation initiated by HC last year following the Bhiwandi building collapse, was informed by Jagtiani that the BMC’s submissions, expressing its inability to curb illegal extension of slums due to the protection extended to such structures by state policy was not valid. He referred to the Slums Act which was relied upon by BMC and stated that while the Act provided protection to the structure of a slum dweller with a valid photo pass, it did not turn a blind eye to any addition or illegal extension to the structure. Jagtiani referred to the relevant clauses of the Slums Act which dealt with protection, relocation and rehabilitation of protected occupiers and also powers to the competent authority to demolish unauthorised or illegal dwelling structures. He submitted that the Act enabled the authority to carry out demolition of illegal extensions and additions to structures that were built after January 1, 1995, by following the due process of law on receipt of complaints and hence, BMC could not wiggle out of its responsibility. On Monday, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy for BMC had canvassed the arguments that due to the photo pass, structures of slum dwellers which were illegally extended or added could not be demolished and the competent authority was the collector who could initiate action on such structures and not BMC. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state informed the bench that the cut-off date of protection granted to slum dwellers was January 2000 and any structure thereafter would be considered illegal. When asked about the proposal to extend the cut-off to 2011, Kumbhakoni assured the court that the state was not extending it but was trying to accommodate slum dwellers till that date. He added that the 2000 cut-off date was accepted by all governments. After hearing the submissions and justifications, the bench noted that from 1976 to 2000, the state had been legitimising encroachers on government land. “The moment you bring them under a beneficial scheme, state land and corporation lands are written off. This is absolute recognition to encroachers so that you have a maximum floor space index (FSI). This is a method to indirectly legitimise encroachments of structures for benefits,” noted the bench.It added that including government land under DCR (development control regulations) 33 (10) was an attempt to use public land for vested interest as the slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) was not a competent authority to curb such manipulations and manage public largesse. The court also hinted at the large-scale misuse of the rehabilitation policy in Mumbai. “I am new to all this. But it seems like the state’s property is the paternal property of the executive,” said chief justice Datta. He had become the chief justice of Bombay HC last April and was earlier a judge at Calcutta HC. “The biggest planning mistake is to to include government land within the purview of 33 (10) of DCR. Actually it is a fraud on the Constitution. Public largesse cannot be handled by slum redevelopment or such authorities. This also speaks about the rehabilitation that is happening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-chides-maharashtra-government-bmc-for-treating-state-land-as-paternal-property-101625599215756.html

According to authorities, instead of the earlier target of July 2023 for project completion, the civic body aims to finish all the work by December 2023. The Covid-19 restrictions have affected the pace of the work. The completed work includes about 470 metres (m) or 25% of tunnelling work of one tunnel and reclamation of 105 hectares (ha) of the total 111ha, Vijay Nighot, chief engineer for the coastal road project, said on Tuesday. “At present, the piling work, casting of piers and girders, construction of the ramp work at Marine Drive and tunnelling work are in progress,” said Nighot. Last December year, BMC had announced that its original target of completing the coastal road project by October 2022 had been pushed to July 2023. Nighot had then said, “We lost eight months due to the court case that had stayed the construction of the project in 2019. We also lost an additional six months due to the lockdown. However, during the lockdown, we did not stop the construction work completely.”The 10.58-km coastal road will connect Nariman Point to Bandra Worli Sea Link. Twin tunnels of 2.07km will connect Girgaum Chowpatty and Malabar Hill. Each underground tunnel will have three lanes at a depth of 70m. The cost of the project is ₹8,429 crore, as per information from BMC. As per the plan announced by the civic body, 55% of the work should be completed by this December, and by 2022, 85% of the work should be over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-coastal-road-project-36-of-work-completed-against-40-target-says-bmc-101625599035790.html

According to ratings agency ICRA, domestic passenger traffic was estimated at around 2.9 million to 3 million in June, implying a sequential growth of around 41- 42% as compared to approximately 1.9 million in May. The report stated that the airlines’ capacity deployment this June was around 46% higher (around 31,700 departures) than June 2020 (21,696 departures). Moreover, the number of departures in June 2021 was higher by 14-15% as Covid-19 infections demonstrated a downward trajectory. Kinjal Shah, vice president and co-group head, ICRA, said, “For June, the average daily departures were at approximately 1,100 – significantly higher than the average daily departures of approximately 700 June 2020, and higher than about 900 this May – though it remains significantly lower than around 2,000 in April 2021. The average number of passengers per flight this June was 94, against an average of 77 passengers per flight the month before that.” However, Shah also said that though some recovery was observed in June, there exists continued stress on demand, driven largely by the second wave of the pandemic, limiting travel to only necessary travel. Both leisure and business travel have been curtailed due to various state-wide restrictions, despite the decline in infections. The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) permitted airlines to increase the capacity on domestic routes gradually from 33% on May 25 to 80% from December 3, 2020. However, it reduced the permissible capacity deployment to 50% of pre-Covid levels from June 1 due to the surge in cases in the second wave of the pandemic. However, on Monday, MoCA increased the capacity to 65%, which is applicable till July 31. Scheduled international operations have been suspended further till July 31. However, under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) – for evacuating Indians from foreign countries – the international passenger traffic (inbound and outbound) for domestic carriers has been approximately 3.7 million for the period May 7, 2020, to June 30 this year. “For June 2021, the international passenger traffic for Indian carriers under VBM was estimated at approximately 147,000 – a sequential growth of about 4% – as flights to/from India remained suspended by many countries, citing the new variant of Covid-19 and high infection levels,” said ICRA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/indias-domestic-passenger-traffic-witnesses-41-42-growth-in-june-101625598795737.html

The tree felling was in violation of stage-1 forest clearance granted to the project, the minutes of a recent meeting of the regional empowered committee (Nagpur), constituted by the Union environment ministry, has revealed.The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) had been granted stage-1 clearance to divert 75 hectares (ha) of forest land for the project in Raigad and Pune districts on February 6, 2019 “subject to fulfilment of certain conditions”. “Maximum number of trees up to 60cm girth proposed to be felled may be translocated by the state government at the cost of the user agency,” the REC had stated while granting in-principle approval.It now emerges that the trees were not, in fact, translocated but felled en masse, after the chief conservator of forests (CCF), Pune, issued a work order for it in 2019. On April 22, in a compliance report submitted to REC, “the state government mentioned that the DCF (deputy conservator of forests), Alibag, has reported that the project-affected trees have been felled as due to steep slope and geographic condition it is not possible to translocate such trees.”In its last meeting on June 24, 2021, REC noted that this was done “without giving any secondary thoughts”. “The committee recorded its displeasure over such negligence and labelled it as direct violation of stage-I approval,” the minutes noted. A formal inquiry report in the matter was sought within three weeks, from a senior forest department official not below the rank of CCF. The committee has also deferred granting stage-2 forest clearance to the project for the time being.Given the conditions stated in the state government’s compliance report, REC opined that the matter should have been brought to its notice, along with a formal request to change the terms of compliance, and that a cogent justification for felling the trees should have been submitted to the Central government, which would have then decided on the issue on merits. A former, unnamed DCF, who executed the work, has also been rapped for not following due protocol.When contacted for a comment, Chandrakant Pulkundwar, joint managing director of MSRDC, directed that inquires be made to SK Survase, a senior engineer with the corporation. However, despite attempts, Survase could not be reached on Tuesday. HT was also unable to contact MSRDC vice-chairman and managing director Radheshyam Mopalwar. Ashish Thakre, current DCF Alibag , however, said, “The felling of trees was carried out in mid-2019 before I assumed my current role. It is not uncommon for clearance works to begin without stage-2 approval, which is the final and official assent given by either the state or the Centre. It is allowed as long as the compliances specified in stage-1 approval are met.” Thakre did not directly comment on the specific violations highlighted by REC.Environmentalists criticised the scale of the offence, but said they were not surprised. “This is the same sad story with nearly every government project. The authorities simply think they are above the law. Sadly, in most cases, the very authorities who are supposed to protect the environment watch as mute spectators to such illegal acts. In this case, the committee has at least expressed their displeasure and called for a report. We do hope that some action is actually taken under the law,” said Zoru Bhatena, a city -based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4431-trees-felled-for-mumbai-pune-e-way-expansion-101625598676288.html

The body was found in a decomposed state, leading police to suspect the man was murdered about three days ago. Neighbours had alerted the police after foul smell started emanating from the house.The victim has been identified as Harjinder Singh, 70, of Buyani village. He had contested the 2012 assembly elections as an independent candidate from Payal but lost. His father, Ajmer Singh Jhajj, was a freedom fighter. The body was found dumped in the kitchen of the house, known as Purani Haveli. As per preliminary findings, the man was bludgeoned with a blunt weapon and strangled with a piece of cloth. The assailants had covered the body with sacks before fleeing. Deputy commissioner of police (DSP, Payal) Hardeep Singh said according to locals, the man used to live in Khant village of Fatehgarh Sahib with his in-laws. He used to visit his ancestral house in Buyani village frequently. On July 3, he had come to Buyani on a routine visit but no one had seen him after that. “There are no signs of robbery or burglary in the house. Daljit Kaur, the wife of the victim, told the police that they had not kept cash, jewellery or other valuables in the house. He was not carrying any money either,” said the DSP. “It could be a matter of old rivalry. Police are investigating the case from all aspects,” he added.

07-07-2021||Mumbai||Jet Airways 2.0: Boarding cleared, take-off to be scheduled||A bankruptcy court in Mumbai recently approved a revival plan for grounded carrier Jet Airways paving the way for the airline to take wings again under the new owner-Kalrock-Jalan Consortium- after protracted quasi-judicial proceedings. This is the first time in the country’s aviation space that an airline is set to be revived after shutting down. None of the carriers in the past, including Kingfisher Airlines, could get an investor to restart operations. Founded by ticketing agent-turned-entrepreneur Naresh Goyal about three decades ago, the once premier carrier shut down operations abruptly on April 17, 2019, due to the inability of then promoters - Goyal and Etihad Airways—to put more money in Jet Airways. Later in June that year, bankers dragged the defaulter airline and its promoters to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover their dues. Meanwhile, Jet Airways’ slots or the available schedule time of arrival or departure of its flights at various airports were given away to other domestic airlines. After almost two years of proceedings at NCLT, the revival plan submitted by the consortium of UK-headquartered Kalrock Capital and UAE-based Murari Lal Jalan finally got the go-ahead. The tribunal, however, has made it clear to Jet Airways that the company has no rights over the slots and the decision will rest with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The Bench has given 90 days to implement the revival process. The consortium has proposed a total cash infusion of ₹1,375 crore, including ₹475 crore that will be used for payment to stakeholders, including financial creditors. Additionally, an amount of ₹900 crore will be invested for capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the smooth functioning of the airline, as per the plan A seven-member monitoring committee, including members appointed by the Consortium and the lenders, will soon start managing the day-to-day affairs of the airline till the resolution process is complete. Before its abrupt closure, Jet Airways had one of the most experienced and efficient workforces including pilots, engineers and cabin crew, in the industry. Even today, there are around 3,500 employees still attached to the airline.However, a lot has changed since 2019. The pandemic has altered every business plan and strategy of airlines globally. In the changed situation, the moot question is how sustainable will be the operations of Jet Airways 2.0 at a time when the passenger demand is at the lowest ebb and it is difficult to predict the time the industry will take to return to pre-Covid levels. “ Jet 2.0 will start with a clean slate. It will be debt-free and will have no legacy baggage. Certain factors like low lease rentals of aircraft, reduced fuel prices, growing airport infrastructure in India will be aiding factors (in its revival). Besides, being a full-service airline, it has an opportunity within the business and high-end leisure travel space,” said Amit Kelkar, vice-president, Jet Airways Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Association (JAMEWA).Moreover, 12 aircraft in the fleet including the wide-bodied ones still in the possession of the grounded airline will also help it take off the ground again, he said.“This is for the first time in the history of Indian aviation that a revival of an airline is in offing after getting grounded. However it’s been more than two years now, and the road ahead does not seem to be that easy,” says a former senior airline executive.On June 22, the consortium said it will decide on the next steps after receiving a written order from NCLT, and emphasised that it will work with the aviation authorities to see the airline taking wings again.The aviation industry is currently struggling with consumer confidence and demand. “Vaccination and opening of borders will certainly speed up domestic travel, which needs to restart and there is a lot of pent up demand”, said Jyoti Mayal, president, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI).Noting that domestic tourism will certainly be a driving force and hoping the situation gets better in six months, Mayal said, “Taking the aviation industry perspective, it is not going to be easy for the airline on the road ahead... The demographic post-Covid 19 is changed and Jet airways will need to adhere to all the needs of a changing environment.”Adding, “Also, all domestic airlines are planning to adopt newer strategies going forward, so they (the new promoters) will need to do more so.”Echoing similar views, an aviation expert on condition of anonymity said, “You can’t set up an organisation based on a legacy and traditional cost-structure. Such a cost structure will not allow you to survive in the present situation.”He added, “At a time when airport charges and fuel costs are increasing and there are no passengers, anyone who is brave enough in this period to start will have to be smart enough to maintain a very low-cost structure by way of smart negotiations on all cost fronts. Success will be defined by how smartly you get low and technology-enabled costs along with a well-thought-out risk mitigation strategy. That is something that every airline new or existing will have to see.”With aviation being a business that can come down to the ground in a day due to certain risks associated with it, he said Covid-19 is another major risk now with the potential to bring down your load factor to zero from 80% in just one day and is now added to the business risk list.According to Mayal, Jet Airways will have to establish a lot in the next six months from negotiating new contracts and re-establishing the operational front. “Though the owners are new, they will need to gain consumer and industry confidence to sustain. It is not going to be easy,” she said.Asserting that the slot issue is unlikely to come in the way of revival Kelkar said, “Many slots remain unutilised in today’s (Covid-19) situation. Even as a new entrant we can have access to many slots in the common pool.”According to Kelkar, new airports and operationalising of new runways will create new slot availability. Besides, there could be options in plus / minus 15 minutes space.“The pandemic circumstances, although unfortunate for the society, has created a level-playing field for both Jet Airways and the existing players. The industry is going through a reboot today and the coming 6-9 months will open up a few slots as the capacity will get back to the pre-Covid levels, but not in the same ratio among carriers as it used to be pre-Covid, said a former airline executive who did not wish to be named. The executive on condition of anonymity said whoever can add capacity now may be able to get some good slots. “Getting slots in Mumbai is a big question but other cities will see a shift in capacity share from one carrier to another (could be existing or new), he said. “The current situation has saddled balance sheets with liabilities that will take a long time for carriers to do away with. The cash-rich have burnt a lot of cash that has considerably brought down their reserves. The timing (of revival) therefore couldn’t get any better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jet-airways-2-0-boarding-cleared-take-off-to-be-scheduled-101625598496454.html

Research, marketing, and commercialisation are important factors, he said, while emphasizing promoting sustainable agriculture among farmers.Shailender Kaur, director of horticulture, Punjab, was the guest of honour. She informed, “A Horticulture Technology Centre is being established on 76 acres of land at Ladhowal (Ludhiana). In addition, three more estates are being established; these include a pear estate at Verka (Amritsar), litchi estate at Sujanpur (Pathankot), and guava estate at Wazidpur (Patiala).”Kaur urged the PAU to start a wing on sericulture and upgrade the lab for virus detection in crops, especially potatoes. She also stressed speeding up the research on the cultivation of exotic fruits like dragon fruit, avocado, and custard apple.AS Dhatt, additional director of research (horticulture), while presenting PAU’s research highlights, said, “Around 60% area under horticultural crops has increased in the last 10 years.” The university has developed new varieties, such as PKH 11 of cucumber; PCP 2 and PCY 2 of carrot; Punjab Sarda of muskmelon; Antirrhinum 16, Antirrhinum 21, Antirrhinum 27, and Antirrhinum 34 of antirrhinum. These varieties are yet to be approved by the state varietal approval committee, he added.TS Riar, the additional director of communication, coordinated the programme.

He said all posts lying vacant since 2018 will be recruited through the MPSC. Non-IAS posts in administration are recruited by the state government through competitive examination of the MPSC. Speaking at the state council, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the state was committed to this task. “The finance ministry has already given nod for filling up the posts. We will complete the recruitment process by July 31,” said Pawar. He said of the 15,511, 4417 were in Group A, 8031in Group B and the rest 3063 in Group C. He said all vacant MPSC members post will be filled and the government was seeking to increase the members from six to 11 or 13. He also announced that the government was toying the idea to conduct the functioning of the MPSC on the lines of the Central’s United Public Services Commission (UPSC) who announces their schedule a year back and all exams, recruitment as well as the posting dates are given. He said the delay was caused due to various technical and legal issues. The 24-year-old youth was found dead in his sister’s house in Hadapsar in Pune on Saturday. He left a note blaming the delay in the MPSC recruitment process. He had cleared the attempt in 2019 and in 2020 as well. This time he was awaiting an interview from the commission, but it was pending due to the pandemic and delays. Leader of opposition in the council and BJP leader Pravin Darekar squarely blamed the government for the death of the aspirant. “They have killed the man as they turned a blind eye to the youngsters who are struggling to get MPSC jobs. If the government does not take corrective actions at least now, we will see multiple suicides,” warned Darekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-15-511-mpsc-recruitments-by-july-31-101625597536120.html

The announcement came after state Congress chief Nana Patole said his phone was being illegally tapped by Fadnavis government using a dummy name. A few legislators also suggested the state explore the possibility of putting in place a mechanism to stop “targetting by agencies like Enforcement Directorate”. “A few issues are being raised by legislators, including the one of phone tapping raised by Patole. He also said that phones of other leaders were also tapped or kept on surveillance during 2016-17. If phones are being tapped using a dummy name, the matter needs to be investigated. In my view, it is a very serious issue and I declare a high-level probe in the matter. All those guilty will face strict action,” Walse Patil said in the state Assembly on Tuesday. He also said there are clear rules which need to be followed in case of phone tapping. The intelligence commissioner is required to take prior permission from the additional chief secretary, home by disclosing the name, contact number and the reason behind the move. The ruling legislators raised the issue after Patole informed them that his phone was tapped during Fadnavis government. “In 2016-17, my phone was tapped by the previous government by giving a dummy name — Amjad Khan. It was done on the grounds of narcotics smuggling. We need to investigate who gave the order to tap my phone,” Patole, also a Congress legislator, said in the lower House. “Not only this, phones of other public representatives were also tapped in the previous government. Such acts are alarming for all. It is an attempt to destroy the public life of public representatives. Democracy is in danger if legislators are being threatened in the assembly. They will face the same fate as Anil Deshmukh and Chhagan Bhujbal,” he added. Jayant Patil, water resources minister and NCP legislator, also said the ruling MLAs are constantly getting threats in the media over initiating enforcement directorate or CBI probe. “The home minister should initiate a probe if central agencies are being misused and individual rights are being violated through the means of phone tapping. If investigation agencies other than Maharashtra are being used for tapping phones of legislators, it is our responsibility to protect them,” Patil said. Patole also suggested the government should explore the possibility of putting in place mechanism to “prevent targetting of the opposition leaders by central agencies”. Another NCP minister Nawab Malik demanded a probe into Patole’s allegations. The home minister said he will check if phone tapping was done by central agencies in the state. “The fear of central agencies and a discussion in the state Assembly over their misuse has never happened in Maharashtra before,’’ said presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/phone-tapping-of-congress-ncp-leaders-maharashtra-minister-announces-probe-101625597476306.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra introduces three farm bills||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday tabled its own farm bills with multiple changes, including the provision for minimum support price (MSP), compared to the three contentious laws of the Centre. The changes include mandatory minimum support price for farmers, licence for traders, recovery against cheating, punishment not less than three years and a fine of ₹5 lakh against the offenders. The three amendment bills introduced in the state assembly have been opened for people to give their suggestions in the next two months. All suggestions received will be examined and changes will be made by the departments concerned, if necessary. The bills will be reintroduced in the winter session of the state legislature for approval.Agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said, “The laws passed by the Centre have no provision for making MSP mandatory for the farmers, which we have decided to incorporate in our law. No agreement will be found valid if the price of produce is quoted less than MSP.”The decision was taken considering the demand from various outfits of the farmers for consultation before approving them in the state legislature, the state said. It was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Tuesday morning. The amendment bills — Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Farmers’ Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities Act, 1955 – were introduced by Bhuse, marketing minister Balasaheb Patil and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, respectively. “Farming agreement shall not be valid unless the price paid to farmer (against its produce) is equal to or greater than MSP,” states the amendment bill for Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.It stated that the farmer and sponsor (trader) can make a farming agreement below minimum support price with mutual consent for a maximum period of two years. The bill also allows farming agreement for crops where minimum support price is not declared, in which case, the farmer and sponsor (trader) may enter into an agreement with a mutually agreed price. As agriculture comes under the concurrent list, the bill also talks about a provision for power to the state to make rules.Bhuse urged people to give their suggestions so further changes can be made in the draft bills. The amendment in the Farmers’ Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 stated, “No trader shall trade in any scheduled farmers’ produce unless such trader has a valid license of a competent authority.” It is against the provision of the central law that allows trade of agricultural produce having just a PAN card which was strongly opposed by the farmers’ outfits.State revenue minister Balsaheb Thorat said, “We all know how farmers are being cheated, therefore a law was needed to ensure they will get remuneration for their agricultural produce, if not, it can be recovered from the trader and the offenders also be punished.”The state has proposed to form a mechanism for grievance redressal in case of disputes in contrast with the provision made in the central law which says they can approach a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), who is already overburdened with work in the existing system and has also no jurisdiction in these matters as it is revenue official post, said a senior official requesting anonymity. “In case of a dispute arising out of a transaction between the farmer and a trader, the parties may seek the solution by filing an application to the competent authority and appeal against the order of the competent authority to the appellate authority,” stated the bill.It has a provision for punishment of imprisonment of not less than three years and minimum fine of ₹5 lakh or both if a farmer is found to be harassed. It explained that the offence of harassment shall be treated to be committed where the trader does not make the payment to the farmer in accordance with the terms of agreement or within seven days from the date of receipt of delivery of goods, whichever is earlier.Besides, if both the parties failed to settle their dispute through reconciliation process, the authority can pass an order for recovery of the amount under the dispute with penalty and interest as it deems fit. “In cases where the sponsor (trader) fails to make payment of the amount due to the farmer, such a penalty may extend to one and half times of the due amount. In case the order is against the farmer for recovery of the amount due to the sponsor (trader) on account of any advance payment or cost of inputs as per term of farming agreement, such amount shall not exceed the actual cost incurred by the sponsor.”In the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, it has proposed an amendment for the state having the powers to regulate or prohibit the production, supply, distribution, imposing limits under extraordinary circumstances, which may include famine, price rise and natural calamity. The current law provides the power only to the Centre in this regard.“There were several flaws in the three farm laws passed by the Centre. Farmers’ outfits have been protesting these legislations for the past seven months. The situation may not have arisen if the Centre had taken farmers into confidence,” said the agriculture minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-introduces-three-farm-bills-101625597415698.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Opposition boycotts proceedings, Jadhav complains of threats||A day after high-voltage drama in the legislature resulted in the suspension of 12 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs, the opposition party boycotted the proceedings of the Assembly and held a mock session outside the legislature on Tuesday. The state legislature security intervened to stop the mock session that was held without permission. On the other hand, presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav said he was facing threat on social media for suspending the MLAs. The home department announced that his security would be increased. The 12 BJP legislators were on Monday suspended for a year, the first day of the two-day monsoon session, for unruly behaviour. The legislators faced action for snatching microphone of the presiding officer occupying Speaker’s chair, an attempt to remove the mace and hurling abuses inside the chamber of deputy speaker when the lower house was adjourned following the pandemonium. Jadhav who was in the chair when the suspension was announced also alleged that BJP leaders hurled abuses at him and tried to manhandle him. Terming it a “murder of democracy”, the BJP boycotted the proceedings of house by walking out immediately after suspension. The boycott continued on Tuesday as the opposition held a mock session of lower house on the premises of the state legislature throughout the day. “Our legislators were suspended under false charges. None of our legislators had abused, in fact, the presiding officer used objectionable language. Spreading lies from the supreme chair was unfortunate. The suspension was an attempt to suppress our voice as we have been continuously talking against the corruption of the government by exposing them,” said Devendra Fadnavis, opposition leader. While BJP legislators staged the mock session, members of the lower house demanded action against them. Minority affairs minister Nawab Malik raised the issue and enquired if the opposition has been given permission to use microphone on the premises. Social justice minister Dhananjay Munde said that when the Congress and NCP were in opposition, then Devendra Fadnavis government did not allow them the use of microphone on the premises of the legislature. They also demanded action against the members from opposition benches. Jadhav ordered security officers of the state legislature to take action for use of microphone. The microphone was seized and the leaders were removed from the premises. The BJP continued the mock assembly at the press stand. Jadhav also said he was being threatened on social media for the action taken against 12 BJP MLAs. In response, home minister Dilip Walse Patil said Jadhav has been given security and if required it will be beefed up further. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil has also announced to move court against the suspension. Ruling party leaders, however, said the court does not intervene in the house proceedings. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the court has never intervened in the action taken by the sovereign house. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, “Even the Kerala high court in one of its rulings has said that the legislators resorting to the unruly behaviour should face criminal action,” he said. CM Uddhav Thackeray said the unruly behaviour of the BJP was unprecedented and shameful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-opposition-boycotts-proceedings-jadhav-complains-of-threats-101625597356783.html

07-07-2021||Chandigarh||Gurugram school murder: HC seeks Haryana’s response on prosecution sanction of four cops||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday sought response from the Haryana government on the plea of a Gurugram man, whose eight-year-old son was murdered at a prominent private school in 2017.The father has challenges denial of prosecution sanction of Haryana cops by the state government. These cops had initially probed the case. A minor is accused of murdering a Class-2 student of the same school on September 8, 2017, on school campus in Gurugram.Initially, the Haryana Police probed the case and arrested a bus driver for the murder. Later, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by the state government, which claimed role of the minor, studying in the same school. Trial is underway at a CBI special court in Panchkula.The father seeks quashing of the February 19, 2021 order of the state government, whereby the sanction of prosecution sought by CBI of four policemen associated with the probe has been declined. The plea demands that trial be stayed and the state’s decision be quashed. The cops against whom allegations are being levelled are Narinder Singh Khatana, Birem Singh, Shamsher Singh and Subhash Chand. It has been argued that the state passed the order in a mechanical manner, without appreciating the facts and culpability of crime attributable to these persons. They ignored the clinching evidence, statements of witnesses, recovery made and other relevant material while probing the case, the plea says adding that the chargesheet filed by the CBI prime facie makes out the offence alleged to have been committed by these cops. The plea says it is an extreme case of abuse of power which can never be said to a part of official duties required to be performed by a government servant and protected under Section 197 of the CrPC which enables the authorities to scrutinise the allegations made against a public servant and to shield him against frivolous, vexatious or false prosecution causing embarrassment and harassment. Every official from the highest to the lowest is under the same responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any other citizen and that the act of these cops is outside the scope of their official duties, it adds.The HC has sought response by November 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gurugram-school-murder-hc-seeks-haryana-s-response-on-prosecution-sanction-of-four-cops-101625597297929.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Five of Bihar gang that duped over 250 Covid patients arrested||The crime branch cyber-crime officers have busted an inter-state cyber fraud gang that duped hundreds of people across the country under the pretext of providing Remdesevir injection, oxygen, beds and life savings medicines used in the treatment of Covid-19 and mucormycosis. The gang was operating from the naxal affected areas of Bihar and was duping people by posting posts on social media platforms under the name of renowned pharmaceutical giant Cipla. “They would accept money under the pretext of providing injection, medicines, beds in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Jaipur, Hyderabad, etc. in advance and later switch off the cell phone,” said Milind Bharambhe, joint commissioner of police, crime branch.After Cipla started receiving complaints from relatives of Covid victims about being cheated, the pharma company informed the Cyber police about the same. Cyber police first lodged a first information report (FIR) in the matter on June 16 on the complaint of a Kandivli-based doctor AM Chavan who was cheated similarly. During the investigation, the police identified over 100 mobile numbers shared through various bogus Twitter accounts. “From each number 10,000-15,000 phone calls were made. These numbers had sim cards of West Bengal origin,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police, cyber-crime.After tracing locations of the suspicious numbers in Bihar, police inspector Mangesh Mazgar and assistant inspector Alka Jadhav-led police team went to Bihar and discovered that the accused persons are operating in groups from Katrisaray in Bihar, Sharif and Varsaliganj areas which are considered Naxal affected regions. The police team raided call centres of these groups and arrested Dhananjay Pandit, 20, Sharvan Paswan, 29, Dharmjay Prasad, 29, Nitish Prasad, 27, Sumant Prasad, 26 and detained a minor boy and seized 18 cell phones from them.“The gang members, who are qualified and well educated, have cheated around 250 people and made a profit of ₹60 lakh during the period of the second wave of Covid-19. We have frozen 32 bank accounts belonging to the gang,” Bharambhe said.“The gang was previously duping people in the name of providing loans, but during lockdown, they could not make much profit as people were not taking loans during the lockdown, hence they switched to cheating relatives of Covid victims who are urgently looking for medicines, beds and oxygen,” assistant inspector Alka Jadhav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-of-bihar-gang-that-duped-over-250-covid-patients-arrested-101625597296269.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||32 prisoners at Thane temporary jail test positive for Covid-19||As many as 32 new prisoners at the temporary prison attached to Thane Central jail have tested positive for Covid-19. The undertrial prisoners were tested during their 14-day compulsory stay at the temporary prison before they were housed in the central jail.Jail administration claimed that random testing led to the detection of infection among the new prisoners. They have been now moved to a local civic facility for treatment and regular monitoring.“On random testing of prisoners lodged in our temporary prison located at Vitawa area in Kalwa, on July 1, nearly 12 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19. Following this on July 2 we subjected all prisoners in the temporary jail to test and found 20 more prisoners infected by the virus. In all over 200 prisoners were subjected to the test,” said Harshad Aherao, superintendent of Thane Central prison. “All the infected prisoners have been moved to a local quarantine centre in Bhayanderpada, a local civic facility. None of them is serious and most of them are asymptomatic and recovering fast,” Aherao added.He said in the main prison there is no new case of infection. Most of the prisoners have been vaccinated and we also randomly carry RT-PCR tests, the superintendent added.At present, the prison has 41 active Covid cases, and all of them are lodged in quarantine facilities. Since April 2020, a total of 232 prisoners of Thane Central jail tested positive for Covid-19 and 191 of them have already recovered.Thane prison is one of the most overcrowded central prisons in the state. This south range prison is housing over 3,500 prisoners against its capacity of 1,105 inmates.“Even after spending 14 days in an isolation centre (the temporary prison), one can not be 100% sure that a prisoner is not infected. So to ensure zero spread of infection among other prisoners, after completing 14 days in temporary jail, the new inmates are again lodged separately in quarantine cell within the jail and are not allowed to get mixed with other prisoners for the next 14 days,” Aherao said.In April this year, in a similar outbreak, 39 women inmates at the Byculla women’s Jail including Sheena Bora murder case convict and wife of Peter Mukherjea; Indrani Mukherjea, had tested Covid positive. Last year in June there was a major outbreak in Arthur Road Central prison when over 180 prisoners have tested positive for Covid-19. In Maharashtra so far a total of 4,199 prisoners have got infected by the deadly virus across 46 jails. Of them, 13 succumbed to the disease while 4,109 have recovered. At present, there are 77 active Covid infected prisoners. On June 30 the number of active Covid infected prisoners was 35. Around 947 prison staff across the state had also contracted the virus and nine of them succumbed to the infectious disease, while 921 recovered. 17 staff are still undergoing treatment at different facilities. The current population of jails in the state is 33,711 against the capacity of around 24,000.A jail official from Pune said that nearly 70% population in the state jails have been vaccinated (mostly with the first dose).The state prisons have been following a practice wherein new prisoners are lodged in the jails compulsorily after RT-PCR tests and Vaccination.The prison department since the outbreak of Covid in jails in May 2020 has not been allowing any fresh inmates without the Covid tests. ‘Mulaqats’ (visits of prisoner’s relatives to jail to meet prisoners) are still not permitted.Taking cognizance of the April 16 report of Hindustan Times and another publication the Bombay High Court had initiated a suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation. During one such hearing of the matter, the High Court had directed authorities to compulsorily subject the new prisoners to RT-PCR test and a vaccination shot 24-hours before being admitted to the prison. Last month after observing a decline in cases of Covid-19 among prisoners the court had expressed its satisfaction over the measures implemented by the prison authority to contain the spread of the infectious disease among prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/32-prisoners-at-thane-temporary-jail-test-positive-for-covid19-101625597295658.html

07-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Close to 2mn in 18-45 age group got at least 1 vax dose||mehul.thakkar@htlive.com A little over two months after Covid-19 vaccination for the 18 to 45 age group was permitted, close to 2 million citizens in the age group have been vaccinated with at least one dose across 400 vaccination centres in the city, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). This is around 20% of the total estimated 9 million citizens to be vaccinated in the 18-45 age group. The data revealed that of the 1,937,410 citizens vaccinated in the 18-45 age group, 1,441,723 (74%) citizens were vaccinated in private hospitals. Public vaccination centres operated by the BMC and state government were suspended for over a month due to vaccine shortage. In the 18-45 age group, of the 1,937,410 citizens, only 49,750 citizens are fully vaccinated. The second highest number of citizens vaccinated at least one dose is in the 45-60 age group followed by senior citizens. Dr Mangala Gomare, head of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have to administer 18 million doses for those in the 18-45 age group, considering we have to give two doses to each individual. We want to vaccinate them at the earliest, but it all depends on how the supply is. We have been demanding maximum doses for Mumbai, and are hoping the supply will be smooth in the coming days.”In the category of healthcare and frontline workers, over 600,000 vaccine doses have been administered. However, contrary to the trend of maximum vaccination in private hospitals in the 18-45 age group, for other age groups, maximum vaccination is done at civic run vaccination centres. The BMC has also administered vaccines to around 3,400 lactating mothers and over 7,000 citizens heading abroad for further studies or going out for work or going to Japan to participate in the Olympics. Overall, 5,793,487 citizens have been vaccinated in the city, of which 4,598,933 have been administered at least one dose and 1,194,544 have been given both the doses. Of the total, 5,424,669 citizens have taken Covishield and 365,563 have taken Covaxin and the rest 3,255 have taken Russian Sputnik. As of Monday, the city has 401 vaccination centres, of which 283 were run by the BMC, 20 by the state government and the remaining by private hospitals. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, vaccination centres will remain functional on usual timings between 9am and 5pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-close-to-2mn-in-18-45-age-group-got-at-least-1-vax-dose-101625597244950.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to counsel senior citizens to attain 100% immunisation rate||Around two lakh senior citizens above 60 years haven’t taken a single shot of the Covid-19 vaccine in the city. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now decided to contact and counsel them to attain a 100% immunisation rate among senior citizens who are considered the most vulnerable group to the Covid-19 infection.Last year, the civic body conducted a door-to-door survey under the campaign—‘My Family, My Responsibility’. According to data compiled during the survey, there are around 11.50 lakh senior citizens residing in Mumbai of which 9.50 lakh have taken the first jab dose, while 4.50 lakh has been administered both doses so far. This indicates that around two lakh individuals haven’t taken the vaccine yet.Public health experts said this section of the elderly is still reluctant to take the jabs because they doubt the vaccine’s efficiency rate.“We have decided to track down all these senior citizens who have not taken a single shot yet. We would disseminate the details at the Covid war rooms who will follow up with their respective residents from their wards,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. “If anyone shows hesitancy to get the shot, we would also counsel them,” she added.According to public health experts, a certain section of society is reluctant to take the shot.A survey commissioned by the Central government found out that four in 10 unvaccinated adults above the age of 70 were hesitant to take the shot against the vaccine. The study conducted over the phone with 4,000-plus participants, also found that 57% of the unvaccinated in the 70-plus age group were concerned with the safety or efficacy of the vaccine and 29% thought they were too old to receive the vaccine.Improper information circulating on social media often creates doubts among senior citizens. “Most senior citizens are confined to their homes due to Covid-19. So, they are addicted to social media and believe everything they read online. As a result, they refuse even if their family members insist they get the jab. But to attain a 100% immunisation rate among the elderly, it is essential to get each one of them vaccinated,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Data shows below 1% of beneficiaries have developed any adverse effect to the vaccine. Data provided by BMC shows that only 2.66% of beneficiaries who have taken the first shot have contracted Covid-19. While only 0.01% of the individuals with both doses have been infected with Covid-19.Since the start of the pandemic, doctors have stated that senior citizens who generally have underlying health issues are most susceptible to Covid-19 infection. As per BMC, as of July 5, a total of 4,295 senior citizens between the age group of 60-69 years have succumbed to the infection, the highest mortality rate to be recorded in any other age group.“We don’t know how the third wave will unfold. In the second wave, young adults got infected. So, it is essential to complete the vaccination of the senior citizens before we enter the third wave. This will help in controlling the chain of transmission,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant general physician at Bombay Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-to-counsel-senior-citizens-to-attain-100-immunisation-rate-101625597244367.html
07-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC stays Haryana instructions on admissions without SLCs||The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the Haryana government’s instructions of waiving production of school leaving certificate (SLC) for an admission in a government school.The high court bench of justice Sudhir Mittal acted on the plea of Sarv Haryana Private School Trust, a Hisar-based body of private schools.The schools had argued that on March 10, district education officers have been asked to make admissions of students in government schools without SLCs, which is contrary to Rules 136(5) and 139(1) of the Haryana Education Rules, 2003.No recognised school can admit a student from another recognised school without SLC. As a result, the private unrecognised schools are suffering financially, the court was told.The Haryana government counsel had told court that the said rules permit the state government to issue directions permitting a school to admit students without SLC.However, court observed that a perusal of the said rule, prima facie, does not grant any such powers. It adjourned the matter to October 28 while staying instructions issued on March 10.The petitioner had told court that government is passing the orders from time-to-time which shows that it is not only violating the statutory provisions of law rampantly but also substantiating their action on this ground that provisions be amended so that the respondents could justify their actions.The orders have been passed to scuttle the rights of the private unaided schools who are facing so much financial issues on the aspect of the non-receiving of fee from the students since the outbreak of Covid-19 and the department has passed the instructions from time-to-time curtailing the rights of private unaided schools to charge the fee from the students studying in the member schools, the court was told adding that the HC has already settled the issue of collection of fee in which the rights of the private unaided schools have been upheld to charge the fee from the students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-stays-haryana-instructions-on-admissions-without-slcs-101625597243866.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to again request SEC to postpone ZP bypolls||The Maharashtra government has decided to again request the state election commission (SEC) to postpone the bypolls declared for zilla parishads. The decision was taken following a Supreme Court decision authorising the SEC to take an appropriate decision.The Apex court decision came in response to a petition filed by the state government requesting it to extend the bypolls for six months considering the prevailing Covid-19 situation and cases of Delta plus virus found in the state.“The Apex court directed the SEC to take an appropriate decision on holding ZP bypolls. After which the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to request the election commission to postpone the bypolls considering the prevailing Covid-19 situation,” said Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister, in the state Assembly on Tuesday.SEC had declared bypolls in five zilla parishads — Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, and Nagpur and 33 other panchayat samitis — on the seats vacated following a Supreme Court against political reservation for Other Backward Classes.This has heated the political temperature of the state as all the political parties have opposed the by-election.Last month, the chief secretary wrote a letter requesting the SEC to postpone the bypolls. SEC refused to accept the request saying the Apex court had directed them to hold bypolls on the vacated seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-again-request-sec-to-postpone-zp-bypolls-101625597115677.html

The state recorded 171 deaths, with Mumbai reporting 10. There were 195,828 tests done on Tuesday, while recoveries clocked 10,548.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 114,297, of which Thane tops with 16,670 patients, followed by Pune with 16,524 active patients.The number of deaths has reduced significantly in June, compared to both April and May, by around 74%. June saw 6,621 deaths, down from 26,037 in May and 26,970 in April.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said this drop directly corresponded to the number of cases. “We saw a significant decline in the number of cases in June compared to April and May and this corresponded directly to death rates. Since the transmission rates declined, this translated to fewer deaths,” said Dr Awate.There were 1,789,406 Covid-19 cases in April, 1,155,570 new cases in May, which dropped to 316,283 new cases in June. Dr Ameet Mandot, Director, Gut Clinic, cited multiple factors for the decline. “The pandemic has the character to start declining after peaking itself, which it did in June. In addition, we had the lockdown as well the vaccination going on simultaneously, which played a huge factor in lowering down both cases as well as deaths,” said Dr Mandot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-8-418-new-covid-19-cases-101625596815693.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav quashes speculation of BJP patch-up||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday dismissed the speculation that the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would renew their alliance and slammed Opposition legislators for boycotting the last day of the monsoon session of the Assembly in the midst of a pandemic. “There is no possibility of anything happening which did not happen in 30 years,” Thackeray told reporters after the two-day session drew to a close. The BJP and the Sena have been allies since 1995, but latter formed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government in 2019 with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress. Thackeray walked out of the alliance even though the saffron combine won a majority that would have allowed them to form the government, after the BJP rejected Sena’s demand to share the CM post over half a tenure each. Recent meetings between leaders of both parties however, fuelled speculation over a shift in the political equation between the former allies. BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis’s meetings with BJP’s top leadership, especially with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi last week, led a section of BJP leaders to speculate on the longevity of the state government. On Sunday, Fadnavis also said that Sena and BJP may have differences of opinion but they were not enemies. “Ours is a formidable combine and I am sitting between Congress and NCP,” Thackeray said referring to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on his left respectively. “There is no question slipping out of this,” Thackeray said. The CM criticised the BJP legislators’ behaviour on Monday which led to the suspension of 12 Opposition leaders, including former ministers Ashish Shelar, Sanjay Kute, Girish Mahajan, and Jaykumar Rawal. They were suspended for a year for misbehaving with the presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav during a heated debate on the issue of obtaining caste census data from the Centre. Jadhav said the legislators had hurled abuses at him, and added on Tuesday that he had received threats on social media for his action. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that the party was considering moving court to challenge the suspension.BJP legislators protested the suspension and boycotted the Assembly on Tuesday. They held a mock session outside the Vidhan Sabha building prompting security personnel to put an end to the protest. The legislators however continued the mock assembly in the press room. The incident occurred during a debate on the resolution moved by the state government on July 5 to seek empirical data from the Centre in order to restore reservation granted to members of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) which stands to be abolished following a recent Supreme Court order. There is a 27% reservation in local self-government body elections for this category. The BJP opposed the resolution and as the discussions became heated, Opposition legislators approached Jadhav’s seat and tried to snatch the microphone and remove the mace on the table. “What was the need for the BJP to create a hue and cry over a resolution asking the Centre to provide census data of 2011 to enable the State Backward Class Commission to prepare empirical data of OBCs? Even if you feel the resolution wouldn’t yield anything, couldn’t you still support it?” Thackeray said. “The action taken against the BJP legislators was for their shameful and unprecedented behaviour. If they are calling it black chapter in democracy, what they are doing by using the Central agencies against us? (…) Is using Central agencies like CBI and ED a sign of a healthy democracy? If the priority is to grab power at any cost instead of providing relief to the people battling the Covid pandemic, then it’s a really sad state of affairs,” Thackeray added. MVA leaders have accused the BJP-led Centre of attempting to “destabilize” the state government through central probe agencies. Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh is under investigation for his alleged role in an extortion racket and a purported cash-for-transfer scam involving police officials based on allegations by former Mumbai police commissioner, Parambir Singh, while relatives of the deputy chief minister are also under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik is also under probe for alleged money laundering. “Yes, Uddhav Thackeray is right, what happened in the lower house on Monday was unprecedented. We have never seen an action against legislators like this before. The suspension came from a presiding officer, and not from the deputy speaker Narahari Zirwal (who is acting as Speaker). The action was taken on false charges. As far as Thackeray’s allegations about the so-called misuse (of power) is concerned, they should understand that the probe by the Central agencies is being conducted on the complaints of the police officers (Param Bir Singh and Sachin Vaze) in state government service,” Maharashtra BJP’s vice president Madhav Bhandari said. Bhandari said that there was no substance in the reports of any alliance between the two parties. “These are all speculations floated by the Sena,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-quashes-speculation-of-bjp-patchup-101625596695789.html

The police are suspecting personal enmity as there were signs of a friendly entry into the house. Also, no valuables were found missing from the police, senior police officers associated with the investigation said.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said that at 7.08 pm, the police was informed about a double murder on the second floor of a building in Raj Nagar Part 1. A police team reached there and found Babita Verma and her son Gaurav inside the flat.“Gaurav’s body was on the bed in a room while his mother was lying on the floor near its door. Both of them were attacked by a blunt object, probably a heavy dumbbell. Prima facie it appears that Gaurav was working on his laptop on a table when he was attacked. He may have tried to escape but was attacked again on the bed,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.Police said the crime came to light when Verma’s husband, Krishan Swaroop Sudhir returned home from office at Palam Air Force Station and found the main gate open. He went inside and found the bodies of his wife and son. Sudhir alerted his neighbours and one of them informed the police control room about the double murder.Gaurav earlier worked in a computer manufacturing company in Hyderabad but was employed for the past one year. His mother was a housewife, the police said.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/52yearold-woman-her-son-murdered-in-delhi-101625596455642.html
07-07-2021||Mumbai||Stan Swamy’s funeral held at Bandra church||The funeral service for activist and Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, who died in a private hospital while waiting for medical bail in the Elgar Parishad case, was on Tuesday held under Covid-19 protocol at St Peter’s Church in Bandra, amid tributes and a small, brief vigil outside. Citizens, many representing civil society organisations, began gathering at the corner of Perry Road and Hill Road around 3pm, soon after Swamy’s body was brought over from Holy Family Hospital, a few hundred metres away.“We were prepared to come in larger numbers, but we have to consider the Covid-19 situation. The Priests Society of Jesus sent a message telling us not to gather, and to watch Father Stan’s funeral service online. But some of us have come to honour his martyrdom,” said Dolphy D’souza, spokesperson, Bombay Catholic Sabha, an organisation with over 60,000 members spread across four districts.Swamy, 84, who was in judicial custody, died of a cardiac arrest on Monday afternoon at the Holy Family Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment for multiple ailments.The tribal rights activist was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from Ranchi in October 2020 under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), based on his alleged Maoist links and was kept at Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail since his arrest. However, after his condition deteriorated, an application for bail on medical grounds was moved in the Bombay high court (HC). Through an order on May 28, the HC directed the jail authorities to shift Swamy to a hospital of his choice. Swamy, who suffered from Parkinson’s disease, tested positive for Covid-19 and was kept in the ICU of the hospital. The court extended his stay after it was told that though the priest had recovered from Covid-19, he had some heart complications and his condition had deteriorated.Those present at the funeral service expressed varied responses to the death of Swamy. While some, like Aslam Ghazi of the Association for the Protection of Civil Rights, feared that Swamy’s death would discourage dissent against the state’s allegedly anti-poor, and undemocratic policies, others like Feroze Mithiborwala (who was one of the organisers of the Mumbai Bagh protests in 2019) said that Swamy’s death will mark a turning point for the other 15 accused in the Elgar Parishad case. “This shocking incident only redoubles our resolve. We will continue to demand that the other accused be released immediately. We will also continue to demand that Father Stan Swamy’s name is cleared of all criminal allegations. The court still has a responsibility toward the innocent. It is deeply disturbing that for all his cooperation with the authorities, Father Stan was not let out on medical bail. Else we may not have been here today,” Mithiborwala said.The Hindustan Times also attempted to speak to a few priests and nuns, who were not part of the vigil, but were passing through the closed church gates. All declined to comment. A larger gathering in support of Swamy is expected to take place today at Chaityabhoomi in Dadar, the cremation site of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.Swamy’s family in Viragalur village of Tamil Nadu’s Trichy district watched his funeral live on the YouTube channel of St Peters Church. The house where Swamy grew up was built in 1890. It is where Swamy’s 89-year-old elder brother, Irudayaswamy, and his wife live in a joint family with their children and grandchildren. Swamy’s 26-year-old grandnephew Benito Prabhu, who lives there, earlier in the day said the six family members in the house would gather together to watch the livestream of his funeral at 4pm on their TV. Swamy’s relatives, most of whom live in Trichy and Chennai, watched it online. Following his funeral, the family will hold a special mass at the local church in the village in his memory. They were denied permission to hold a procession due to Covid-19 norms.The family had requested for Swamy’s body and ashes, but it was not possible.“When he had visited us in 2016, he had said that his last rites should be in Ranchi. He wasn’t sure how long he would live because of his age and ill health. So his ashes will go to Ranchi, but his body will not be handed over due to the pandemic,” said Prabhu.The family has been coordinating with Joseph Xavier, the current director of Bangalore-based Indian Social Institute – a Jesuit Centre – since Swamy’s arrest last October. “We hope they allow for his things from his Ranchi home to be sent to us,” Prabhu said. “He didn’t have too many things anyway.”“One of our relatives saw a news channel and called us. That’s when we switched on TV. We knew he had died before we received the official information,” said Prabhu. Relatives and villagers have been coming to their ancestral home since the news of his death.The Elgar Parishad case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made by some activists at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017. Police claim these speeches triggered violence the next day near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial located on the outskirts of the city and that the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. Swamy was the last and oldest of the 16 people, most of them academics and human rights activists, to be arrested in the case.(inputs from Divya Chandrababu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stan-swamy-s-funeral-held-at-bandra-church-101625596338410.html
07-07-2021||Other||HC orders North MCD to keep hawkers out of Library Road crockery market||New Delhi: Remarking that civic officials extort money from street vendors to allow them to operate in a no hawking zone, the Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the city police to keep a strict vigil against squatters on the Library Road Crockery Market in old Delhi.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh also directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to put up permanent and prominent display boards within two weeks to make it clear that the area is a no hawking zone.The court’s order and remarks came after the counsel for the MCD, Jyoti Taneja, tried to justify the non-existence of boards displaying that the market area as a non-hawking zone by pointing out that they have already filed an affidavit to that effect. However, the bench remarked, “You cannot ask the citizen to fish out your affidavit..How do people get to know if you don’t put up the display boards? We know how these hawkers keep coming again and again…They are paying hafta to your officers.”The city police’s counsel Pankaj Yadav, on a direction by the court to keep strict vigil against the street vendors, had also said that there were no display boards to let people know about the no-hawking zone. On Tuesday, the bench dismissed an application by the vegetable vendors’ association, which had sought to be heard in the petition, observing that the vendors have not been able to show any document that permitted them to squat in the no hawking zone. It also said that there is no dispute to the fact that the Library Road is a no-vending zone.The application was filed in a pending plea by the Crockery Merchants Association which had contended that despite the Library Road crockery market in Azad market being declared as a no-hawking zone, squatting and hawking activities were still continuing with the civic body and the Delhi Police turning a blind eye to it.The association, through senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, had given photographs to the court showing that a vegetable market was being run in front of their shops.On April 8, the court had taken note of the pictures and said that even though the market claims to run only in the morning, it is evident from the photographs that it is not the case. “The photographs show that the vegetable market is operational while the crockery shops are open... In fact, the photographs placed on record by the petitioner carry a time-stamp declaring the time when the photographs were taken, which appears to be around 11.30 am,” the court had said in its order.The court had also asked the Delhi Police to ensure that unauthorised vending, hawking and squatting does not take place in the no-hawking zone and the SHO of the Bara Hindu Rao police station should be held personally responsible in case hawking is not “permanently stopped”.It had also expressed surprise as to how the civic body can issue licenses in no hawking zones after the police counsel contended that some hawkers claimed to have licenses from the North MCD.On Tuesday, advocate Taneja, appearing for the municipal body, told the court that action has been taken along with the local police and all temporary encroachments have been removed from the area.The court, while dismissing the plea of the vegetable vendors, posted the matter for further hearing on September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-orders-north-mcd-to-keep-hawkers-out-of-library-road-crockery-market-101625596337859.html

The two agencies questioned the suspects to get information about their contacts in Kashmir to whom they sold the vehicles. Officers privy to the development, however, said there was no evidence so far to suggest that the suspects were involved in terror activities. On Sunday, Delhi police said they busted an organised gang of vehicle thieves, and arrested Showkat Ahmad Malla, 25, a resident of Baramulla, Kashmir and Mohammed Juber, 22, a resident of Shamli, Uttar Pradesh. The two were arrested from central’s Delhi’s Paharganj area. Police said that the gang, to which the two men belonged, has sold more than 100 vehicles to buyers in the Kashmir valley. Explaining their operation, Delhi police officers said Showkat flew to Delhi and drove the vehicles to Sopore town in Kashmir’s Baramulla district, from where they were sent to other places. “A team of CID officers from DIG CID unit of J&K police came yesterday. Separately, the IB officials also came and interrogated them. Some photographs found on the phones of the two men aroused suspicion so they had to be interrogated. Though one cannot say it is linked to terror activities. They questioned the two men for their contacts. They will verify the information shared by the two men. There are some members of the gang, who are still believed to be hiding in the valley,” an officer, who asked not to be named, said. To be sure 90-100 vehicles are stolen across the city every day. Between January 1 and June 15, 2021, police registered 15,667 cases of motor vehicle thefts in Delhi. Police have in the past busted vehicle thieves, who took stolen cars to states as far as those in the Northeast. But this is the first major case of organised theft racket spread from western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to the Kashmir valley, the officer said. As part of the probe, a Delhi police team is also going to Kashmir to find the associates of the two suspects. Police are on the lookout for a man named, Wasim Sheikh, a resident of Baramulla. “Wasim is our main link in the case. He has come to Delhi on several occasions and has taken cars to Kashmir. Showkat learnt the trade from him. We will seek the assistance of J&K police to trace him,” added a second police officer, who asked not to be named. Police said Shaukat also works as a civil contractor for the state government in Kashmir. Police said Shaukat and his accomplice Juber, received the stolen vehicles from one Rinku. Rinku tampered with the chassis and engine numbers, changed the registration plate of the vehicle before handing it to Shaukat. Police have recovered at least 100 registration number plates and 150 duplicate car keys from the two suspects, investigators said. When contacted, Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police(central), whose team arrested the two alleged vehicle thieves, said, “The investigation in the case is on. There are some missing links that we are trying to establish. We are probing who bought the stolen vehicles in Kashmir.” Singh did not comment on the joint interrogation of the two men by the IB and the J&K police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/srinagar-police-ib-quiz-vehicle-thieves-nabbed-in-delhi-last-week-101625596336128.html

According to DMRC, commuters can now enter and exit, and also make payment for four-wheeler parking, using FASTag. “Only those vehicles with FASTags will be permitted to park in this facility. Two-wheeler users can swipe the Delhi Metro smart card, which will note the entry and exit time and help calculate the fare. Money will not be deducted from the smart card,” Dayal said.Metro officials explained that the parking fee in such cases can be paid using UPI applications after scanning a QR code. Officials said they are also working on allowing payments through DMRC or national common mobility cards as well.“The cashless parking facility is DMRC’s pilot project. Further, Delhi Metro is planning to establish similar systems at more of its parking facilities across Delhi-NCR,” DMRC said. Apart from this, the station also threw open dedicated lanes for cabs, autos and e-rickshaws near the station’s gate numbers six and eight. “These lanes will allow a smooth movement of vehicles as well as enhance the last mile connectivity at the Metro station. In MMI’s second phase, which is presently under construction, there will be a food court (to be set up by Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation) as well as a bus terminal (three lanes with a capacity of five buses each),” DMRC statement read. According to DMRC, these facilities will provide a big relief to passengers travelling to and from the Kashmere Gate metro station, which is connected to a major ISBT as well as several offices around the station. “We have taken this up as a pilot project. After observing the response, we will plan similar systems at more of our stations. In fact, we will explore more opportunities to go digital wherever there is a scope. This will not only help us in modernising the facilities, but will also help the commuters by saving their time and ease the process. Under MMI, we have many other projects, which will be implemented in a graded manner,” said Mangu Singh, managing director, DMRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-a-first-dmrc-launches-fastag-based-parking-facility-in-kashmere-gate-101625596276168.html
07-07-2021||Delhi||EDMC to set up app, call centre and collection points for safe disposal of e-waste||Soon residents, institutions, commercial and industrial units in east Delhi could dispose of their electronic waste in an environment friendly manner and even get some value back as the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) plans to engage an agency for collection and transportation of e-waste for further processing and disposal in a scientific manner. Citizens will be able to access the facility on the corporation website, municipal officials in the know of the matter said. The officials said the agency will have collection centres at suitable locations and will also facilitate the disposal process by way of a mobile app and a call centre with a toll-free number. “Additionally, users will be able to raise a request on the EDMC website mentioning details of the item(s) they need to dispose of and request a pick-up. The value of the discarded items will be decided and paid to those disposing of the goods,” said a senior EDMC official handling the project.E-waste includes old, discarded and unserviceable electronic items such as mobile phones, television sets, chargers and refrigerators, among others. Until now, the corporation did not have a strategy for handling e-waste and most such waste was segregated and processed illegally by the informal sector -- ragpickers and scrap dealers and small workshops -- in an unscientific manner that posed serious environment hazards. Officials said as e-waste contains toxic chemicals and minerals such as arsenic, cadmium and acid, among others, it was imperative that such waste is recycled in a scientific manner.“Our request for proposal (RFP) for the project is in the final stage of approval for appointing an agency. This maiden initiative will pave the way for handling of electronic waste in a responsible and environment friendly manner,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand.The cash-strapped municipal corporation also aims to generate some revenue through the initiative. “We plan to earn some royalty from the agency executing the project, which will help the municipal body earn some revenue,” said an official, who asked not to be named.“Currently, most of the e-waste in the city is recycled illegally by informal groups such as ragpickers and small workshops to extract metals such as copper out of it. “A large volume of such waste from all parts of Delhi reaches pockets such as Seemapuri where a number of informal groups are engaged in extracting metals out of the junk. We will be creating larger awareness about our initiative so that people have a way to dispose of e-waste safely,” the official said.So far, there has been no assessment of the volume of e-waste being generated or recycled in the city. However, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and recently the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) have set up similar mechanisms for collection and disposal of e-waste in areas under their jurisdiction.The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) notified the E-waste Management Rules in 2016 following which all civic bodies were to implement the same in their jurisdiction. According to experts, there is still little awareness around the consequences of discarding electronic gadgets in an improper manner. These gadgets often land up in makeshift workshop, where metal is extracted using the crudest methods, releasing a range of toxic chemicals, which ultimately flows into drains and then into water bodies, thereby heavily polluting them. Satish Sinha, associate director, Toxic Link, said it is important to have a formal set-up for e-waste collection. “When recycled illegally, the methodology used is rudimentary in nature, releasing toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury etc into the immediate neighbourhood. Processing of e-waste requires good technology, which is why a formal set-up is required,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/edmc-to-set-up-app-call-centre-and-collection-points-for-safe-disposal-of-ewaste-101625596215648.html

In the first incident, reported from Keshavpuram area, two bike-borne men allegedly snatched a bag containing ₹12 lakh from the accountant of a building construction material supplier based in Kundli near Sonepat in Haryana. The accountant, identified as Nitin Kashyap, was riding a motorcycle and returning to his office after collecting money from different clients in Azadpur, Roshanara Road, and Bharat Nagar in north and northwest Delhi, when the snatchers targeted him, said a police officer associated with the investigation.In his complaint, Kashyap said that two men on a bike waylaid him as he reached near the Keshavpuram metro station, and snatched his cash bag. “Kashyap could not see the faces of the suspects because they were wearing helmets. They did not use any weapon in the crime. Kashyap said he did not resist because he knew how snatchers stab or open fire at their targets if they showed any resistance in their attempts,” the officer said, adding that Kashyap informed the police about the crime and a case of snatching was registered at the Keshavpuram police station.Even as the district police teams were carrying out the legal formalities and investigation into the matter, around 2.30pm, the police control room was informed about another robbery at a rice merchant’s office in Maurya Enclave’s WP block, just about five kilometres away from the first crime spot. The police team met the rice merchant, Rajneesh Jain, who told them that four unidentified men had arrived on two bikes and carried out the robbery.Jain told the police that the robbers entered his office posing as customers and allegedly held him and his staff hostage under gunpoint. The robbers then allegedly forced him to open the almirah, took out ₹42 lakh and fled on their motorcycles. The four accused were wearing helmets so their faces were not visible, another police officer said, quoting Jain’s statement.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said the two crimes were committed by two sets of criminals, as the modus operandi were different. “Our teams have got certain clues in both the cases and are working on them. The suspects will be caught soon,” she said.Investigators said that they have not ruled out the role of an “insider” in the cases as the robbers knew about the cash and where it was kept.Delhi Police’s statistics show that the city witnessed 3,829 snatching and 942 robbery cases till June 15 this year. Last year during the same period, 2,612 snatchings and 701 robberies were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/54-lakh-robbed-in-two-separate-incidents-in-northwest-delhi-101625596216255.html

On the first few days warnings were issued, while we have also started collecting fines at many places,” said Amitabh Gupta, Pune’s police commissioner.The street stalls on Baner road and Bharati Vidyapeeth were full on Tuesday evening.Rajendra Tilak, a resident of Pashan said, “All the street eateries continue to provide service at their stalls. I have seen police taking rounds, but they are not taking any actions.”The owner of Kunal chaat on Baner road, on condition of anonymity, said, “Timings for serving at stalls should be increased. Our peak period for customers starts after 4pm and PMC allows only parcel service after. It is hurting business badly therefore, many street eateries continues to remain functional.”Tea stalls also remain functional at most places.“Most of the customers cannot carry tea for long distances and hence, we continue serving tea by keeping the shutter half-open. We make sure people dont gather at one place and they tend to stay far away from each other,” said he owner of tea shop owner on Pashan road.In Kondhwa and Camp area street eateries are functioning till 9pm.Oumar Aga, a frequent customer of eateries in Camp, said, “For a couple of days only parcel service was allowed, but in the last few days we are allowed to dine-in even after 7pm. Eateries were functioning till 10 pm yesterday. Although non- essential shops closed by 5pm.”Non-essential shops following ordersLaxmi road, a major shopping centre, is shutting down completely by 5pm. However, traders are unhappy with the ongoing restrictions.“Postivity rate is under control still traders have been told to shut their shops at 4pm. We continue to remain a soft target and the administration is not concerned about traders. We continue to follow order but we expect changes soon,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Association of Pune.Reena Goswami, owner of boutique in Kothrud said, “PMC should allow us to remain functional even after 4pm.

A total of 1.697 million people got the vaccine in June in the district. However, private hospitals saw more people get the vaccine, as opposed to government hospitals. As per the information from the district health office, of the 1.697 million doses administered in Pune in June, 0.984 million got the vaccine at private hospitals, while 0.712 million got it at government centres. As per the information, of the 1.697 million who got the jab, a total of 712,871 got it at government centres, of which 458,099 got their first dose, while 254,772 got their second dose. Of the 984,198 who got their dose at private centres, 916,205 got their first dose while 67, 993 got their second dose and were fully vaccinated. These include both Covishield and Covaxin. Private centres saw 15.98% or 0.27 million more vaccines administered as compared to government vaccination centres. While private hospitals saw more and uninterrupted vaccinations, government centres had to be shut due to a shortage of vaccines. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of PMC’s health department said, “Due to shortage of vaccines we had to shut down the vaccination drive on three days last week, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. However, the state has assured that we would now get an uninterrupted supply of vaccines from here on. “Earlier in May, when there was acute shortage of vaccines, the civic body had considered directly procuring the vaccines from manufacturers, since Serum is located in Pune. However, now that the supply is much better we have kept that plan on hold. It would be wrong to compare the vaccination at government centres with private centres, as the civic body covers the entire city and all sections of society. We have multiple drives aimed to vaccinate the most vulnerable through our Vaccine on Wheels initiative,” Dr Bharti added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pvt-hospitals-out-jab-govt-centres-for-covid-vax-in-june-101625595077031.html

Trump visited France in 2018 to commemorate 100 years of the first world war, which came to an end in 1918.Details about the conversation were revealed in a book titled ‘Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost’ by Michael Bender of the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian reported. The Guardian also said it had obtained a copy of the book that is yet to be released in stores.According to the report, Kelly, a retired US Marine Corps general, was “stunned” by the former President’s comments. In the book, Bender also wrote that Trump’s comments came during a conversation with Kelly who “reminded the president which countries were on which side during the conflict” and “connected the dots from the first world war to the second world war and all of Hitler’s atrocities,” The Guardian reported. However, HT has not accessed the book.Also read | Trump to sue Twitter, Facebook and Google﻿Also, Bender further wrote that Kelly tried to tell Trump that he was wrong but Trump insisted on German economic recovery during the 1930s under Hitler, The Guardian’s report showed.Meanwhile, Liz Harrington, a spokesperson for Trump, denied the excerpts in Bender’s book. “The report from the Michael Bender book is totally false. President Trump never said this. It was probably made up by an incompetent general who was fired,” she tweeted on Wednesday.‘Crack their skulls’Earlier on June 25, CNN reported citing another controversial excerpt from the book, according to which Trump had made inappropriate comments about protesters against the murder of George Floyd.When police officers used force against the protesters Trump had told his top law and order officials “That’s how you are supposed to handle these people. Crack their skulls !” CNN reported.He also wanted the US military to go and beat the protesters, CNN reported, citing Bender’s book, and had also reportedly said “Just shoot them.”Notably, Trump during the France trip had cancelled his visit to a US military cemetery because it was raining on the day, while many other European leaders attended the memorial events, according to several news reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hitler-did-a-lot-of-good-things-new-book-reveals-stunning-comments-by-former-us-president-donald-trump-101625681315633.html

07-07-2021||World||Fast-track lanes for Covid-19 vaccinated passengers at Heathrow||Heathrow Airport in London is planning to trial fast-track queues for those arriving from some destinations fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as part of plans to facilitate smoother travel.The trial scheme by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will mean passengers from certain select countries will be able to upload their vaccination status before boarding.It comes as the aviation industry calls for quarantine-free travel to the UK from lower-risk amber list countries and UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to announce such plans later this week."At the moment the main barrier to people who have been doubly vaccinated travelling being allowed to do that, is being able to demonstrate to the government that we can check that they've had the vaccination already,” John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told the BBC."The trial that we're starting later this week will allow us to demonstrate we can do that safely with 100 per cent checks on double vaccination before people get on the plane," he said.The trial, due to start this weekend, will allow passengers who are fully vaccinated and are travelling on selected flights to Heathrow from Athens, Los Angeles, Montego Bay and New York to show proof of their vaccination status. It will accept internationally recognised vaccination credentials, including the NHS app, CDC card, US state-level digital certification and the EU digital Covid certificate.India currently remains on the red list of high risk countries from where travel remains effectively banned, with compulsory hotel quarantine for returning British residents.People taking part in the Heathrow trial from this weekend will be able to use a dedicated arrivals lane at the UK border. Sean Doyle, British Airways chief executive and chairman, said he was "confident" the trial would be successful."We look forward to providing the data that proves it's simple for fully vaccinated status to be verified and to the government meeting its commitment to get the country moving again," he said.“To reap the benefits of the UK’s world-leading vaccine rollout, the UK government must act now to remove self-isolation for fully vaccinated passengers arriving from ‘amber’ countries, and no later than the domestic reopening on 19 July,” added Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss.July 19 is now set as the timeline for an end to all legal lockdown restrictions in England, with rules on international travel set to be finalised in the coming days.UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid laid out plans in Parliament on Tuesday to end compulsory 10-day self-isolation for people who come in contact with a Covid positive case for those fully vaccinated against coronavirus with both doses of a vaccine.“We can't live in a world where the only thing we are thinking about is Covid and not about all the other health problems, not about our economic problems, or education challenges, and we have to make use of a vaccine that is thankfully working,” he said.On Tuesday, another 28,773 cases and 37 Covid-19 deaths were reported across the UK. According to government estimates, the number of new infections could rise to 100,000 a day as lockdown measures are lifted but it is hoped the vaccinations and better therapeutics will continue to keep a check on the hospitalisation and death figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fasttrack-lanes-for-covid-19-vaccinated-passengers-at-heathrow-101625674789675.html

Even as officials faced each other across the vast tables in Tehran and Iran’s top diplomat pledged to end the crisis, fighting surged in Afghanistan’s western Badghis province.The Taliban political committee, led by chief negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, flew from Doha to Iran’s capital to meet Afghan government officials, including former Vice President Younus Qanooni and others from the High Council for National Reconciliation.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif greeted the delegates, urging them to “take difficult decisions today for the future of their country," state-run media reported.After the “failure of the U.S. in Afghanistan,” Zarif said, Iran stands “ready to assist the dialogue” and to “resolve the current conflicts in the country."“Returning to the inter-Afghan negotiation table and committing to political solutions is the best choice,” he added.But any solution appeared a long way off Wednesday as the Taliban offensive, which has recently captured many districts in the country’s north, pushed into Badghis province. The insurgents attacked the provincial capital of Qala-e-Naw from several sides, its governor Hasamuddin Shams said, adding that Afghan troops had so far managed to push the Taliban back.From early Wednesday morning, battles raged near the provincial police headquarters and a Qala-e-Naw army base, said Abdul Aziz beg, head of the provincial council in Badghis.The fighting killed at least two civilians and wounded 28 others, including women and children, said Dr. Sanahullah Sabit at the Provincial Badghis Hospital. Medics sent five people in critical condition to a regional hospital in the neighboring Herat province for further treatment, he added.Videos widely circulated on social media appeared to show Taliban fighters speeding into the provincial capital on motorcycles. Other clips show insurgents approaching the city’s prison and releasing inmates. The Associated Press could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage.Fawad Aman, the Afghan defense minister's deputy spokesman, promised security forces would clear the city in the coming hours. The Taliban have not publicly commented on the violence in Qala-e-Naw.The surge in fighting — and the sudden news of peace talks in Tehran — come at a critical time for the war-battered country.After a two-decade-long military campaign, the U.S. military announced on Tuesday that 90% of American troops and equipment had already left the country, with the drawdown set to finish by late August. Last week, U.S. officials definitively vacated the country’s biggest airfield, Bagram Air Base, the epicenter of the war to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America.The Taliban have made relentless territorial wins since April, when President Joe Biden announced that the last 2,500-3,500 U.S. soldiers and 7,000 allied NATO soldiers would depart Afghanistan. With their victories in northern and southern Afghanistan, the Taliban are escalating pressure on provincial cities and gaining control of key transportation routes.Afghanistan’s uncertain path toward peace bears profound consequences for its western neighbor Iran, which the U.N. estimates hosts some 2 million undocumented Afghans. Amid the specter of another civil war, fears have grown in Iran over a new wave of Afghans seeking refuge in the country, which already is struggling to stem worsening poverty under tough U.S. sanctions.Iran and Afghanistan share deep cultural ties and a 945-kilometer-long (587 miles) border. Tehran has historically viewed U.S. military presence in neighboring countries as a threat and pushed for American troop withdrawals from the region.Iran, the Shiite powerhouse of the Middle East, has occasionally in the past hosted the Sunni militant Taliban and Afghan government officials in Tehran for peace talks. In playing host, Iran seeks counterbalance against regional rivals like Saudi Arabia that typically wield greater influence over Sunni groups in the Middle East.The Taliban's recent territorial gains also have fueled national security concerns in Iran.“We do warn the Taliban not to get close to Iranian borders,” said lawmaker Shahriar Heidari, a member of influential parliamentary committee on national security and foreign relations. “This is Iran's red line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-hosts-high-level-afghan-peace-talks-as-fighting-surges-101625677281445.html

Microsoft released the security update after researchers found a serious vulnerability in Windows, known as PrintNightmare which could allow multiple users to access a printer.In May, researchers at cybersecurity company Sangfor said they had found vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler service. They published a proof-of-concept online but deleted it after realising the mistake. However, the how-to guide for exploiting the vulnerabilities was published on other sites, including developer site GitHub.On Tuesday, Microsoft released an Out-of-Band (OOB) security update for PrintNightmare in a cumulative update release, which means it contains all previous security fixes. The tech giant said that the update fully addresses the public vulnerability, and also includes a new feature that allows customers to implement stronger protections.“We feel that it is important to provide security updates as quickly as possible for systems that we can confidently protect today,” the company said.Also Read | Microsoft joins Apple in exclusive $2 trillion clubBefore the patch update, the printer operators' security group could install both signed and unsigned printer drivers on a printer server.

The negative fallout of unrest in Afghanistan includes a rise in terrorism and a fresh influx of Afghan refugees, the report said.Pakistani officials, quoted by the local newspaper, said although Taliban gains were quite rapid in recent weeks, the situation could change if the Afghan security forces show some resistance.In recent weeks, the insurgents have seized nearly a third of Afghanistan’s rural districts and besieged several provincial capitals. Hundreds of Afghan security force members have fled into neighbouring Tajikistan in the face of Taliban advances since the US vacated its main Afghan base as part of a plan to withdraw all foreign troops by September 11.“Therefore, it is too early to predict where things are heading in Afghanistan.

His original name was Yousuf Khan.Pakistan's top leadership, including President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan, condoled Kumar's death, describing him as "an outstanding actor, a humble man, and a dignified personality".Kumar, India’s enduring film legend through the decades, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday after prolonged illness.In 1998, the Pakistan government honoured Kumar with the 'Nishan-e-Imtiaz' - the country’s highest civilian award.The government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) condoled the demise of the legendary actor, saying he will always be remembered for the love and affection he had for the people of his ancestral home town in the province.The Pakistan government has already declared his native house as a national heritage and completed all formalities to convert it into a museum in his name.Lateef-ur-Rehman, Spokesman of KP Archeology, Sports and Tourism Department, said the provincial government has taken over the possession of Kumar's ancestral house and it would soon be converted into a museum.Kumar visited Peshawar in the early 90's. He was given an unprecedented reception and welcome by the people of Peshawar.The Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, put up a banner offering "special condolences to his bereaved family".Peshawar's leading businessman and ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Senator Mohsin Aziz said Kumar was his uncle in relation and the entire Peshawar city is in a state of mourning due to his demise."I am deeply shocked after hearing that my uncle is no more in this world," said Aziz.Aziz said Kumar left Peshawar in 1935 at the age of 13 for Mumbai and excelled himself in the field of acting."When Dilip uncle visited Peshawar in 1998, he exclusively requested for Peshawari Chappal and Kurta Pajama being his favourite shoe and dress that was provided by his family," Aziz said.Sarfraz, who deals in artificial jewellery business in Mohallah Khudadad close to Kumar’s ancestral property, expressed deep sorrow and grief over the actor's death."We lost a great man. The people of Peshawar will always remember him and his services," he said.Majeed Lala, who also owned a shop, said he was shocked on hearing about Kumar's death.Often known as the Nehruvian hero, he did his first film 'Jwar Bhata' in 1944 and his last 'Qila' in 1998, 54 years later. The five-decade career included 'Mughal-e-Azam', 'Devdas', 'Naya Daur', and 'Ram Aur Shyam', and later, as he graduated to character roles, 'Shakti' and 'Karma'.The actor is survived by his wife Saira Banu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dilip-kumar-s-fans-gather-for-funeral-prayers-at-his-ancestral-house-in-peshawar-101625670383961.html

During a news conference in Geneva, Ryan warned countries with low levels of vaccination coverage against opening up, saying the presence of variants could start filling the hospitals again.“Countries opening up who have very low levels of vaccination coverage in the presence of variants is a real toxic mixture for your hospitals filling up again. And this is something that must absolutely be avoided,” said Ryan.Commenting on Britain’s decision to remove most of the coronavirus-induced restrictions, the senior WHO official said all countries are trying to reach a balance of measures that allow their societies to open up while trying to maintain an element of control over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He said that the United Kingdom, which has achieved a high rate of vaccination, is “very alert to the threat represented by variants, especially the Delta variant.” Ryan, however, also stressed that countries need to be extremely cautious and have to be ready to step back.Also Read | WHO recommends lifesaving tocilizumab, sarilumab for critically ill Covid-19 patientsAt the press briefing, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhnom Ghebreyesus reiterated the need to share vaccines with low- and lower-middle-income countries. The WHO chief criticised the decision of some countries with high vaccination coverage to roll out booster shots in the coming months and drop public health social measures. The top WHO official said that variants are winning the race against vaccines because of inequitable vaccine production and distribution."Vaccine nationalism, where a handful of nations have taken the lion’s share, is morally indefensible and an ineffective public health strategy against a respiratory virus that is mutating quickly and becoming increasingly effective at moving from human-to-human," said Ghebreyesus.“It didn’t have to be this way and it doesn’t have to be this way going forward," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toxic-mixture-who-warns-countries-with-low-vaccination-coverage-against-opening-up-economies-101625672248397.html

The Biden administration has been counting on high vaccination coverage to restore normalcy by relaxing federal guidelines on coronavirus-induced restrictions but the spread of the Delta variant has caused concern to the authorities.The new Covid-19 cases related to Delta variant accounts for more than 51% of Covid-19 infections in the country, as per the CDC. The ‘variant of concern’ B.1.617.2 was first detected in India and now accounts for more than 80% of new infections in several US states, including Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. In western US states like Utah and Colorado, the Delta variant is causing 74.3% of infections.The United States has been administering mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to reach the so-called herd immunity but vaccine hesitancy has emerged as a major roadblock in achieving the goal. Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned that the Delta variant poses a "significant threat" to unvaccinated people, saying the variant was not only more transmissible, but it can also cause more severe disease."If ever there was a reason to get vaccinated, this is it," Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN on Tuesday.Texas A&M University virologist Benjamin Neuman said mRNA vaccines appear to provide protection against the Delta variant but a large number of unvaccinated individuals in the state remain a concern. The low percentage of vaccination coverage in Texas has made it difficult for experts to predict the threat of the Delta variant.“It really depends on what's out there, and at the moment we’re not sure.

The UN health agency on Tuesday updated its patient care guidelines to include the drugs that are lifesaving in critically ill Covid-19 patients, especially when administered alongside corticosteroids.The drugs were recommended after analysing data from over 10,000 patients enrolled in 27 clinical trials. According to the WHO, patients severely or critically ill with Covid-19 often suffer from an overreaction of the immune system, which can be very harmful to the patient’s health. IL-6 blocking drugs – tocilizumab and sarilumab – act to suppress this overreaction and were in high demand during India’s devastating second wave of Covid-19 which claimed thousands of lives.A study showed that administering interleukin-6 receptor blocker drugs to critically ill patients with Covid-19 reduces the odds of death by 13%, compared to the standard care. The chances of mechanical ventilation required by severe and critical patients were also reduced by 28%. These are the first drugs found to be effective against Covid-19 since corticosteroids were recommended by WHO in September 2020.The WHO urged drug manufacturers to reduce prices of the lifesaving drugs and make supplies available to low- and middle-income countries, especially where the virus is surging. While highlighting the inaccessibility of IL-6 in the majority of the world, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu said in a statement that the drugs offer hope for patients and families suffering from the impact of severe Covid-19.“The inequitable distribution of vaccines means that people in low- and middle-income countries are most susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19. So, the greatest need for these drugs is in countries that currently have the least access. We must urgently change this,” the WHO chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-recommends-lifesaving-tocilizumab-sarilumab-for-critically-ill-covid-19-patients-101625663124372.html

First Lady Martine Moise was also shot and is currently receiving treatment, added Joseph.“The country’s security situation is under the control of the National Police of Haiti and the Armed Forces of Haiti," Joseph stated, adding, “Democracy and the republic will win.”While Joseph said that some of the assailants spoke Spanish, but offered no further explanation on who could be behind the assassination. The interim prime minister said that police have been deployed to the National Palace and the upscale community of Pétionville.Haiti, a Caribbean nation of more than 11 million people, had grown unstable under Moise amid a constitutional crisis. Moise, a former banana exporter, and his supporters had been claiming that his term should end in 2022, five years after he took the office in early 2017. This stance was also backed by the United States, the UN and the Organization of American States.However, the opposition leaders were of the view that Moise should have stepped down in February this year, citing a constitutional provision that starts the clock when a President is elected, not when he takes office. Moise took the office a year after he was elected following a chaotic election that forced the appointment of a provisional President to serve during the year-long gap.Opposition leaders accused Moise of seeking to increase his power as he had been ruling by decree for more than two years after Haiti failed to hold elections. Haiti has also been facing deep economic, political and social woes.The capital of Port-au-Prince has been witnessing a spike in gang violence amid a scarcity of food and fuel. About 60% of Haiti’s population makes less than $2 a day and the region has been trying to recover from the devastation caused by the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew that struck in 2016.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-president-jovenel-mo-se-assassination-what-do-we-know-so-far-101625658513059.html

According to forecasters, Elsa is now tracking off the Florida west coast where it is expected to make landfall in the morning with threats of storm surge flooding, strong winds, heavy rain and isolated tornadoes.Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been urging the residents to take the warnings seriously as the cyclone is expected to come ashore sometime between 8am and 9am. “We ask that you please take it seriously,” DeSantis said on Tuesday. “This is not a time to joyride because we do have hazardous conditions out there.”Elsa briefly turned into a hurricane on Tuesday evening, causing concern for the state authorities as they were already struggling with the Florida condo collapse disaster, further complicating the search and rescue operation. According to the National Hurricane Center, Elsa’s maximum sustained winds stood at 120kmph early Wednesday when its core was 105km southwest of Tampa."Elsa is forecast to make landfall along the north Florida Gulf Coast by late Wednesday morning and then move across the south-eastern United States through Thursday," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.Meanwhile, the National Weather Service’s Tampa Bay office has issued a tornado watch for parts of Florida until 8am. Hurricane warnings remain in place even as the system weakened to a tropical storm on Wednesday. More than 12 million people across three states are under a tropical storm warning.Forecasters have predicted that Elsa would slice across inland north Florida as a tropical storm with strong rains and wind before moving on to Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia and then heading out in the Atlantic Ocean by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-us-states-under-tropical-storm-warning-as-elsa-nears-landfall-in-florida-101625653927281.html

The images of a 51-centimetre-tall cow, Rani, has set off a tourist frenzy after local newspapers and television channels threw the spotlight on the tiny bovine. Despite the nationwide lockdown, people are flocking in rickshaws to a farm in Charigram, 30 kilometres southwest of Dhaka, to see Rani."I have never seen anything like this in my life. Never," said Rina Begum, 30, who arrived at Charigram from a neighbouring town.According to news agency AFP, Rani is 66-centimetres-long and weighs only 26 kilograms. MA Hasan Howlader, manager of Shikor Agro farm, where Rani lives, claims that the cow is shorter than Manikyam, a small bovine from Kerala that currently holds the Guinness World Record for the shortest cow. Howlader has been using a tape measure to show dozens of onlookers to claim the record.Rani is a Bhutanese cow, prized for its meat in Bangladesh, and other Bhutanese, or bhuttis, on the Shikor Agro farm are twice Rani's size. The owner said that most of the visitors want to take selfies with Rani and more than 15,000 people have come to see Rani in the past three days alone."Honestly speaking, we are tired," Howlader told AFP.The shortest cow, Manikyam, is a Vechur – a breed well known for producing dwarf cows with a maximum height of 90cm. Manikyam, owned by Ashkay NV, in Kerala, measured 61.1cm from the hoof to the withers when a team from Guinness World Records travelled to Kerala.“It is hot and particularly humid here, and we believe this has an effect on the height of our cattle. If Vechur cattle are taken elsewhere in the country, over time they increase in height. It’s only in Kerala that they maintain their dwarf stature,” local veterinarian Dr EM Muhammed had told the Guinness team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dwarf-cow-in-bangladesh-attracts-thousands-amid-lockdown-owner-eyes-guinness-world-records-101625649919330.html

Though it has declined to change its drawdown schedule or slow it down, the US has said politically negotiated settlement is the only way forward in Afghanistan, and not a military solution.State department spokesperson said at a separate briefing that “any Afghan government that comes to power at the barrel of a gun, that comes to power through the use of force, is almost certainly going to lack … critical ingredients” that will be needed - international assistance, international legitimacy and popular support of the Afghan people.The Taliban have sought to assure the world of their commitment to a negotiated settlement but have stalled talks till the US forces are out. The last round that was supposed to take place in Istanbul, Turkey was never held.As an important stakeholder in Afghan peace, India has watched US drawdown with some concern. On a recent US visit, external affairs minister S Jaishankar attributed US drawdown to “political expediency”. And at a UNSC debate, he reiterated India’s call for a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” in Afghanistan and for the United Nations to play a leading role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bagram-exit-was-coordinated-with-afghans-us-101625633118528.html

The country could experience a "harsh lean period" as early as next month, the UN body has said. According to the FAO report, as quoted by AFP, North Korea is projected to produce a "near-average level" of 5.6 million tonnes of grain this year, which is around 1.1 million tonnes short of the amount required to feed its entire population. With "commercial imports officially planned at 205,000 tonnes", North Korea will likely face a food shortage of around 860,000 tonnes.Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the world"If this gap is not adequately covered through commercial imports and/or food aid, households could experience a harsh lean period from August to October," it said.What is the present food crisis situation in North Korea?In June, North Korean leader Kim Jon Un formally addressed the food shortage issue of the country and said the situation is now getting tense. Reports said the price of rice skyrocketed in June and corn has been on the rising path since the beginning of 2021. South Korea's Korea Institute of National Unification has said rice price has soared owing to a lack of supply. In 2020, North Korean grain production also fell by an estimate of 5.2 per cent.Several key government officials have been replaced apparently for the mismanagement of the crisis.What led to the food crisisNorth Korea shut its borders since 2020 amid the pandemic, while its own agriculture sector failed because of flood damage. All these, compounded with the ongoing international sanctions on the country, have led to this situation. But the food crisis was not unforeseen as the crunch began from last year itself. According to a report from the US department of agriculture, North Koreans were eating 445 calories less a day than the 2,100-calorie diet recommended by the United Nations.How will North Korea overcome the food crisis?In an article, South China Morning Post has said "emaciated" Kim Jong Un will ride out the famine in North Korea with China's help. Kim's greetings to Xi Jinping on the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Chinese Communist Party are being interpreted by experts as a message from Kim that North Korea's strong ties with Beijing will help Pyongyang navigate the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harsh-lean-period-kim-jong-un-s-north-korea-to-face-food-shortage-of-860-000-tonnes-this-year-101625630756469.html

Severely ill Covid-19 patients experience an immune system overreaction known as a "cytokine storm" that can cause severe organ damage and death, the study noted.Tocilizumab and sarilumab are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition, by inhibiting the effects of interleukin (IL)-6, a type of protein called a cytokine that signals the body to mount an inflammatory response.But previous research on whether IL-6 inhibitors can be useful against severe Covid-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect and harm. This prompted the WHO to coordinate the new study that combined data from 27 randomized trials conducted across 28 countries, the study said.The analysis included information on 10,930 patients, of whom 6,449 were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-6 inhibitors and 4,481 to receive usual care or placebo. Overall, the risk of Covid-19 death within 28 days was 22 per cent compared with an assumed risk of 25 per cent in those receiving only usual care.Outcomes were better when patients also received corticosteroids with the risk of dying 21 per cent compared to 25 per cent for those receiving usual care. This means that for every 100 such patients, four more will survive, the study said.The study also examined the impact of these drugs on whether patients progressed to ventilators or death. Among patients also given corticosteroids, the risk was found to be 26 percent for those receiving IL-6 inhibitors compared with an assumed 33 percent in those receiving usual care. For every 100 such patients, seven more will survive and avoid mechanical ventilation.Tocilizumab and sarilumab which are given by infusion or injection are currently recommended for use along with corticosteroids in severe Covid-19 patients by Britain. The United States also recommends tocilizumab with corticosteroids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arthritis-drugs-tocilizumab-and-sarilumab-lower-deaths-by-covid-19-says-study-101625623227206.html

More than 182 million Americans have received at least one shot, including nearly 90 per cent of seniors and 70 per cent of adults over the age of 27,” Biden said."By the end of this week, we'll have reached the mark of 160 million fully vaccinated Americans. That's a goal I set in March that I'm thrilled we're going to hit just a few days after July the Fourth. So, we will have 160 million fully vaccinated Americans -- up from roughly three million when we took office five months ago," he said after receiving a briefing from his entire Covid team.Biden said businesses are reopening and projected economic growth is the highest it's been in four decades."The bottom line is: The virus is on the run, and America is coming back. We're coming back together. This is one of the greatest achievements in American history, and you, the American people, made it happen,” he said.At the same time, the president said America's fight against the virus is not over as a large number of people are still unvaccinated because of which their communities are at risk."This is an even bigger concern because of the Delta variant,” he said, adding that the Delta variant is already responsible for half of all cases in many parts of the country.Biden said it's more easily transmissible and potentially more dangerous."It seems to me that it should cause everybody to think twice. And it should cause reconsideration, especially in young people who may have thought that they didn't have to be vaccinated, didn't have to worry about it, or didn't have to do anything about it up to now," he said.The president said the good news is that vaccines are highly effective."Fully vaccinated Americans have a high degree of protection, including against this Delta variant. Study after study after study has shown that, since early May, virtually every Covid-19 hospitalisation and death in the US has been among the unvaccinated," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-reach-160-million-fully-vaccinated-americans-by-end-of-this-week-biden-101625622975186.html

It announced opening up the field to other players, including Amazon, the biggest cloud computing provider.The move comes after the Bide administration said it would likely parcel out the project to multiple companies, a departure from Trump's policies, who favoured a single provider.Why this is a big deal?Software companies have been trying to persuade the government and businesses that it was safe to shift computing work into their data centers. They have presented various studies to prove the point that cloud computing is safe.Grabbing the contract of US military by meeting all their security requirements will act as a stamp of approval to sway other companies.The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) was part of a broader digital modernisation of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.What happened in 2019?Trump awarded the contract to Microsoft despite bids from technology titans like Amazon, IBM and Oracle. The former US President had taken public swipes at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, saying he was reviewing the company's bid after complaints form other players.The contract was put on hold after Amazon filed a lawsuit challenging the decision. The company claimed that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon.What does the latest decision mean for Microsoft?Experts say the cancellation and new contract could benefit Microsoft because the company has had nearly two years during the legal wrangling to invest in its technology."If there is now another competition, Microsoft is going in from a better position," Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Bernstein, told news agency Reuters.Microsoft, meanwhile, said in a statement that the company was confident it will "continue to be successful as the DoD selects partners for new work". Microsoft could submit a termination bid to recover costs of the scrapped project, Sherman said.Amazon too has welcomed the cancellation of the deal.The Pentagon hopes to have the first awards by April 2022 for its new Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-hits-reset-on-trump-s-10-billion-cloud-deal-all-you-need-to-know-101625621954611.html

It added that cases of lambda variant have been detected in more than 30 countries in the past four weeks."The Lambda strain was reported to have originated from Peru, the country with the highest mortality rate in the world," the Malaysian health ministry tweeted on Monday.It cited a report by the Australian news portal news.com.au saying that the lambda strain had been detected in the United Kingdom too. The researchers are worried that this variant may be "more infectious than the Delta variant", The Star reported.Lambda accounts for nearly 82 per cent of the coronavirus case samples reported during May and June in Peru, Euro News reported citing the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO).In Chile, another South American country, the strain accounts for more than 31 per cent of the samples from May and June, according to Euro News.The World Health Organization (WHO) has already designated lambda as 'variant of interest' due to its elevated presence in South America. The global health body said that lambda shows increased transmission and resistance to antibodies.Meanwhile, Public Health England (PHE) has added lambda to its list of variants under investigation (VUI) due to international expansion and several notable mutations, including L452Q and F490S.Six cases of Lambda have been identified across the country to date, all have been linked to overseas travel, according to PHE.According to UK health officials, there is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. But PHE said it is carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of mutations on the behaviour of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lambda-variant-of-coronavirus-deadlier-than-delta-malaysian-health-ministry-101625620329562.html

This comes in the wake of Elsa weakening into a tropical storm near Cuba earlier on Tuesday before regaining its hurricane status back ahead of Florida landfall.Hurricane Elsa is headed toward Florida's northern Gulf Coast at incredible speeds of up to 75 mph (121 kmph), the Associated Press reported, citing the National Weather Service. A hurricane alert has been issued for the coastline -- a long stretch between the Egmont Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay and the Steinhatchee River in Florida's Big Bend area.Elsa is projected to make landfall somewhere in between these areas in Florida anytime from 8am and 9am today (US time; here in India the news is likely to be received around the evening).At 5:30am IST on Wednesday, Hurricane Elsa was located about 100 miles south-southwest of Tampa Bay, Florida, according to Accuweather. The region is highly vulnerable to a storm surge, an AP report noted, due to the shallow offshore waters. It is likely that the Tampa Bay area would take a hard hit from the storm overnight, the report quoted Florida governor Ron DeSantis as saying.The storm surge could reach five feet (1.5 meters) over normally dry land in the Tampa Bay area if Elsa passes at high tide, forecasters said. The storm's westward shift spared the lower Florida Keys a direct hit on Tuesday, but the islands were still getting plenty of rain and wind. Tropical storm warnings were posted for the Florida Keys from Craig Key westward to the Dry Tortugas and for the west coast of Florida from Flamingo northward to the Ochlockonee River.(With inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-elsa-turns-into-hurricane-alert-issued-in-florida-101625617493044.html

Mir Asadullah Kohistani, Bagram’s new commander said.U.S. military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett did not address the specific complaints of many Afghan soldiers who inherited the abandoned airfield, instead referring to a statement last week.The statement said the handover of the many bases had been in the process soon after President Joe Biden’s mid-April announcement that America was withdrawing the last of its forces.Leggett said in the statement that they had coordinated their departures with Afghanistan’s leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troops-left-bagram-airfield-silently-at-night-101625615041147.html

The CENTCOM said it has officially handed over seven bases to the Afghan security forces and evacuated the equivalent of nearly 1,000 C-17 air freighter loads of equipment from the country, ahead of the September 11 deadline to complete the troop pull-out.On Friday, US forces handed over the sprawling Bagram air base north of Kabul, the main centre of US military operations in the country for most of the past two decades of conflict.Tuesday’s announcement underscored that most of the process of withdrawing US military and civilian personnel ordered by President Joe Biden in April had been completed.At the time of Biden’s order, there were officially 2,500 US troops and 16,000 private contractors in Afghanistan. According to reports there were also some 1,000 US special forces operating in the country at the time who were not included in the official tally.While Biden had set a deadline of September 11, the Pentagon has moved quickly to reduce its presence to a minimum.“We expect it to be completed by the end of August,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday after the Bagram handover. The US is expected to keep a reported 650 or more military personnel in the country to protect the US embassy and diplomats.Time to retake districtsAfghan authorities on Tuesday vowed to retake all the districts lost to the Taliban group and deployed hundreds of commandos to counter the insurgents’ blistering offensive in the north, a day after more than 1,000 government troops fled into neighbouring Tajikistan.“There is war, there is pressure. Sometimes things are working our way.

Besides, it said, there were 431 prisoners who were eligible to file a request but hadn’t applied, 83 prisoners sought legal aid to apply and 752 prisoners had their applications rejected. The findings convinced the bench to ask NALSA to study state policies and come up with a uniform scheme to deal with remission applications.Advocate Gaurav Agrawal, who appeared for NALSA informed the court that a uniform scheme would be problematic since states had different policies, criteria on the eligibility of prisoners and the period that life convicts need to serve. Even the authority empowered to approve remission requests were different. In some states, the jail officials are empowered while some others require a recommendation of an advisory committee.One common factor, NALSA’s analysis concluded, was that there were no deadlines for the authorities. The NALSA scheme approved by the top court involves three steps. It gives states three months for identification and collection of data about eligible prisoners by prison authorities, three months for a recommendation by Sentence Review Board (SRB), and two more months to state government for missing final orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-quick-decision-on-appeal-by-life-convicts-sc-to-up-bihar-and-chhattisgarh-101625682185602.html
07-07-2021||India||Delhiwale: His handmade summer accessory||These days you rarely see hand fans. Most of them, anyway, tend to be of plastic. But this hand fan is so distinct that you might like to have it as drawing room decoration. It’s entirely made of cloth. The fabric is square, pinkish, and enhanced by a red border. Little patches of pink and red are arranged alternately around the fan. In the centre is tucked a tiny swirl of yellow.Sadly, the fan is not for sale.“I made it myself,” says Liyakat Ali in a tone without ego. An elderly beggar in a central Delhi locality, he is sitting this evening on the street-side, perched on an empty rice sack laid on the dusty ground. It’s hot, there’s no breeze, and he’s fanning himself with this very fan. “I made the punkah during the pehla (first) lockdown.”Mr Ali had then gone back to his UP village in Ferozabad, “the district famous for making glass bangles”. While working on the punkah at home, he didn’t benefit from any relative’s help, simply because “I’ve lost my home.” His wife died 40 years ago, he says.At this point, Mr Ali’s long-time friend Om Veer, who earns his living by measuring bodyweight of passersby, and who always sits beside him with his weighing machine, joins the conversation and says, “My wife, too, is dead.”Fanning towards his friend, Mr Ali casually narrates that “my home was over after I married off my three daughters. One died soon after, but two are alive.” In the next sentence, he returns to the fan, saying that “I used bits of clothes lying here and there in the house to sew the punkah.”The finished work looks as neat as if it had been made by the rehearsed hands of a tailor. Was Mr Ali one at some stage of his life? He shakes his head.Meanwhile, Om Veer, the man with the weighing machine, is looking at the fan with renewed admiration. Mr Ali tells him reassuringly, “If you want, I’ll make one for you in the agla (next) lockdown.”Soon it will be dark. Mr Ali will head for dinner in an eatery, after which he will settle down at his regular night-time spot on another footpath, nearby. There he will fan himself to sleep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-his-handmade-summer-accessory-101625681987843.html

Minorities don’t have any issues with our party and governance. But due to ideological differences they have with the BJP, they didn’t vote for us,” said Shunmugam who lost his seat in Villupuram.to the DMK’s R Lakshmanan by a margin of 22,291 votes.His party, the AIADMK, won just 66 seats in the election, less than half of the 133 seats won by the rival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK, while the BJP netted four seats. The combined alliance with other regional parties won a total of 75 of the assembly’s 234 seats.The video clip upset many BJP leaders.“Even some of our cadre think that we lost in a few places because we allied with the AIADMK and due to certain decisions they took while they were governing in the last four years,” said BJP’s general secretary KT Raghavan said, asserting that minorities across the country did vote for the party.“But we have to see if CV Shunmugam’s statement is the party’s opinion.”BJP’s Khushbu Sundar shared a Tamil newspaper report of his speech and tweeted, “Actually it’s the other way around.”The AIADMK tried to mollify the BJP, underlining that Shunmugam’s statement wasn’t a formal statement. “It was an internal party meeting. Several party members can share their opinions. That’s off-the-record,” AIADMK’s former minister and spokesperson D Jayakumar said. “He spoke among the party cadre internally so I cannot give my opinion on his statement.”AIADMK’s coordinator and deputy opposition leader O Panneerselvam went into damage control mode and first tweeted a statement that the AIADMK has full faith in the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Considering the interests of the nation and also the welfare of Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK-BJP alliance will continue and there is no second opinion on this,” he said.Later, Panneerselvam and former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami issued a joint statement to underline that there were no two opinions in the AIADMK about its pre-poll alliances. Without naming the BJP, the statement by the AIADMK’s joint leadership said the alliance formed ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-tries-to-mollify-bjp-after-ex-minister-blames-ally-for-losing-tamil-nadu-101625681241510.html
07-07-2021||India||Former bureaucrat Ashwini Vaishnaw to head railway ministry as Goyal moves out||50-year-old Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament from Odisha Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday took oath as a cabinet minister in a major reshuffle by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The bureaucrat turned politician, who has been given the charge of the railway ministry, was elected to the Upper House as a BJP candidate two years ago.A 1994 batch IAS officer, Vaishnaw was particularly known for his involvement in the Public Private Policy framework in infrastructure projects.An IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) graduate, Vaishnaw quit government service in 2008 and went to Wharton University in the United States to pursue MBA. On his return, after working for top firms, he set up his own automotive components manufacturing units in Gujarat. He then held leadership roles across major global companies such as General Electric and Siemens.Vaishnaw’s entry into the railway ministry comes at a time when the national carrier has been mulling ways of generating revenue through different streams, including the non-fare revenue segment, leasing out its vast pool of vacant land and, most importantly, opening doors for Public Private Partnership (PPP) for its trains and stations. It has felt the need to bring in private investment to upgrade its facilities and infrastructure, while keeping an eye on the competition as domestic airlines take away its AC class passengers and passengers increasingly opt to travel by road for shorter distances.The Indian Railways plans to introduce private trains on its network in phases, with the first dozen to be introduced in the 2023-24 financial year and 151 such trains by 2027. In its pre-bid meeting, Bombardier Transportation India, Siemens Limited, Alstom Transport India Ltd were among the initial 23 firms that evinced interest in running private trains in India.During his tenure as an IAS officer, Vaishnaw worked as the district magistrate-cum collector of Balasore and Cuttack districts. He was also involved in the rescue efforts when the super cyclone hit Odisha in 1999, killing at least 10,000 people.Vaishnaw worked in Odisha till 2003 before being appointed as deputy secretary in the office of former Prime Minister A B Vajpayee. He was later appointed as Vajpayee’s private secretary after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) lost the election in 2004.Interestingly, in April, Vaishnaw was also nominated as a member of the Press Council of India, for three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bureaucrat-ashwini-vaishnaw-to-head-railway-ministry-as-goyal-moves-out-101625680444561.html
07-07-2021||India||PTI files suit against Centre’s new IT rules, says it impinges on freedom of speech and violates right to privacy||Press Trust of India (PTI), one of India’s largest news agencies has challenged the guidelines of the new Information Technology (IT) rules and has argued that it infringes the right to freedom of speech and expression and violates the right to privacy of the users as well.The news agency has challenged parts of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which seek to supervise the regulation of digital news media publishers. It has called the Code of Ethics "draconian" and said that the Rules "usher in an era of surveillance and fear” that will lead to "self-censorship" and violation of fundamental rights, according to a Forbes India report.Also read: Centre asks SC to transfer petitions against new IT rules from 5 high courtsThis the ninth lawsuit filed by a news organisation against the Centre's Digital Media Code of Ethics and the second by a legacy media company. Filed on behalf of the chief administrative officer Mohini Ranjan Mishra, the petition states that its editor-in-chief and CEO, Vijay Joshi, is involved in the matter, as per the report.The petition, however, stated that it is challenging the Rules only concerned with news publishers and not OTT platforms or intermediaries.On impinging the freedom of speech and expression, PTI argued that the three-tier grievance redressal mechanism, which is headed by an inter-ministerial committee has also been granted emergency blocking powers, which will "inexorably" result in the adjudication of news by the executives. In the new rules the blocking powers have “travelled beyond the scope and mandate of Section 69A(2)”, which allowed the use of blocking powers only against intermediaries. PTI has called the mechanism an "eye wash" as it claimed that publishers of news will be subjected to government diktat at every stage and said that allowing the State to regulate news is "against public interest".The news agency also argued that the Part II of the Rules, under which entities like Jio, Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. are regulated is “antithetical to fundamental rights” and give “private intermediaries with excessive powers in shaping the disclosure of free speech in the country," reported Forbes. It also said that Rule 7, under which the intermediaries will lose immunity from liability for third party content on non-compliance, will have "chilling effect of the intermediaries" on free speech as they will be over compliant.The news agency also submitted that the Rules aid in the creation of the surveillance state as it requires a publisher to furnish information to the ministry of information and broadcasting in a way for the government to get access to the list of subscribers and users of publishers. The government in this way is "effectively seeking circumvention of industry standard encryption tools and creating a backdoor entry for themselves to monitor online activity of users”, PTI said, arguing that it violates the right to privacy, according to the report.As per a Forbes India previous report, this means that the digital publishers not only have to submit the names of the Twitter handles and Facebook pages but also the details of their telecom service provider, cloud service provider, email service provider, payment service provider, hosting service provider etc. Nikhil Narendran, partner at Trilegal called this "excessive", reported Forbes India and said it is a “symptom of the government trying to exert excessive control over free speech itself”.This is scared to pose a huge cybersecurity risk according to the report as it will create a single database within the ministry that will bare the technical structure of all digital news publishers across the country.PTI also said that the rules have not been consulted by the stakeholders and “it is an abuse of plenary powers enjoyed by the executive with the clear intent of choking the media, which is an anti-theses to the principles of democracy,” said the report.Also read | ‘Follow rules if you want to work’: Delhi HC raps Twitter over non-complianceThe news agency also contested the constitutional validity of the rules. “Given the unconstitutional nature of the Rules, we decided that we would challenge them straightaway," Wasim Beg, partner at L&L Partners that is representing PTI, told Forbes India.The lawsuit differs from that of the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), whose members include the digital wings of publishers and news channels such like the Times Group, India Today Group, NDTV as it argues that digital media as a concept has not been defined under the IT. “If the parent act has not defined digital media, the delegated legislation can’t look to govern it,” Forbes India quoted Beg as saying.Earlier in the day, the Delhi high court refused to grant interim protection to PTI against coercive action by the government but issued notice to the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), and the ministry of information and broadcasting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pti-files-suit-against-centre-s-new-it-rules-says-it-impinges-on-freedom-of-speech-and-violates-right-to-privacy-101625672098137.html
07-07-2021||India||Inclusion of 4 Bengal BJP MPs in union govt seen as part of bigger 2024 plan||Induction of four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha members from West Bengal as union ministers of state on Wednesday evening-- hours after two junior ministers from the state resigned-- was seen in political circles as a ‘reward’ for regions where the saffron camp has gained dividends in the Bengal assembly polls.BJP leaders, such as Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh, said John Barla from Alipurduar, Nisith Pramanik from Cooch Behar, Shantanu Thakur from Bongaon and Dr Subhas Sarkar from Bankura were rewarded for their “performance” and the move was part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constant efforts to give “opportunity” to everybody.Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and Industry minister Partha Chatterjee said Barla was indeed rewarded but for raising the demand for a state or Union territory comprising the north Bengal districts. “This shows that the Centre encourages those who want to divide people and split states,” he said.After Barla, a tribal leader, raised the demand a fortnight ago, several Gorkha groups from the Darjeeling hills as well as the Dalit Rajbanshis in the plains of north Bengal have started talking about their age-old demands for statehood. Armed movements carried out by some of these outfits claimed numerous lives in the past, posing a problem for Marxist chief ministers Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and their successor Mamata Banerjee.The BJP has officially maintained that Barla has expressed his personal opinion and the party has nothing to do with it.For the record, north Bengal, which comprises eight districts, is where the saffron camp outdid the ruling party in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well as in the recent assembly election. Two TMC ministers were defeated in the region in the assembly polls. Pramanik defeated a former minister but resigned from the assembly to retain his Lok Sabha constituency. Barla did not contest the assembly polls.All the four MPs who got promoted on Wednesday represent regions and communities that backed the BJP in the last two elections.In the assembly polls, the TMC won by securing 213 of the 294 seats against the BJP’s 77 seats. The results showed that TMC managed to regain the trust of many Hindu, tribal and Dalit voters who backed the saffron camp in 2019 in the south Bengal region which comprises 240 assembly segments.In north Bengal, on the other hand, BJP candidates stood their ground at 30 of the region’s 54 assembly segments where identity politics played a key role. Even in south Bengal, the BJP bagged sizeable votes in constituencies located close to the Indo-Bangladesh border where Hindus migrated from East Pakistan either after 1947 or the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.The BJP’s success in 2019 was credited largely to its ability to reach out to upper caste Hindus, tribal people and Hindu Dalit or Namasudra voters. To secure the votes of citizens representing various castes, sub-castes, religions and linguistic groups in assembly polls, the TMC and BJP banked on strategic campaigns.Dr Sarkar, a physician, represents a region with sizeable backward caste and tribal population where the BJP made maximum inroad in 2019.The state’s scheduled tribe (ST) population stood at 5.29 million during the 2011 census, accounting for about 5.8% of the whole population. Despite the welfare schemes launched by Mamata Banerjee, the BJP won the Bankura and Bishnupur Lok Sabha seats as well as the Midnapore, Jhargram and Purulia seats.In the assembly polls, the BJP won seven of the 12 seats in Bankura district. The competition was so close that in the Bankura assembly seat the BJP defeated TMC’s Sayantika Banerjee, a young actor, by less than one per cent votes.“Seeing Dr Sarkar as a union minister will elevate the morale of local voters. The same applies to the other MPs. This will help the BJP consolidate its position before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Modi and Amit Shah have specific plans for these regions,” a senior state BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.Caste politics also became an important factor in large parts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia districts in south Bengal where the Hindu Dalit community has a sizeable presence. In 2019, BJP wrested the Ranaghat and Bongaon Lok Sabha seats in Nadia and North 24 Parganas respectively, largely because of the support from this community.To attract Dalit voters, the saffron camp promised to enforce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Bengal so that the Matua community, which is a part of the larger Namasudra community and who came from Bangladesh as refugees, could be granted citizenship.Shantanu Thakur is the head of the Matua community. On March 27, when Bengal voted for the first phase of assembly elections, the chief minister accused Modi of violating the model code of conduct by trying to “woo” the Matua community during his Bangladesh visit on that day. The PM paid a visit to Thakurbari, which is the most sacred pilgrimage site for the Matuas across the world. Modi was accompanied by Thakur who has demanded immediate implementation of CAA.Thakur is the grandson of Binapani Devi, the Matua community’s head who died in 2019, a month after Modi’s visit to the Matua headquarters at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas district.CAA promises citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Buddhists and Jains coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The TMC is opposed to it.Union ministers Babul Supriyo, the MP from Asanol in West Burdwan, and Debasree Chaudhuri from Raigunj in north Bengal resigned from the government on Wednesday. While Chaudhuri did not react in public, Supriyo, who unsuccessfully contested the Tollygunge assembly seat in Kolkata, did not hide his feelings.“Yes, I have resigned from the Council Of Ministers. As I had framed it earlier, “Asked to resign” may not be the right way to put it. I thank Hon’ble Prime Minister @narendramodi for giving me the privilege to serve my country as a Member of his Council of Ministers..” Supriyo tweeted with a smiley.“I am extremely happy that I go today without a spot of corruption on me, having served my constituency with all my might & having enjoyed their confidence when Asansol voted me back as their MP once again, with triple the Margin in 2019,” he said in a second tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inclusion-of-4-bengal-bjp-mps-in-union-govt-seen-as-part-of-bigger-plan-before-2024-101625678961251.html

07-07-2021||India||‘Very good selection’: Yediyurappa on induction of 4 Karnataka MPs in PM’s team||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inducted four Karnataka Parliamentarians including Shobha Karandlaje, A Narayana Swamy, Bhagwanth Khuba and Rajeev Chandrashekar- a Rajya Sabha MP, as ministers of state into his government at the Centre.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a higher priority to Karnataka and inducted four ministers from the state. On behalf of the people of the state, I thank the prime minister. He has done a very good selection. All four are influential, work impactfully and this will also give the state more strength,” BS Yediyurappa, the Karnataka chief minister said on Wednesday.Senior party leader from the state, DV Sadananda Gowda was dropped as the Union minister for chemicals and fertilizers.However, analysts and observers said that the induction of Karandlaje, the firebrand member of parliament from Udupi-Chikmagalur, raises several possibilities and has a bearing on the power struggle going on in the Karnataka BJP.“The induction of Shobha Karandlaje you can read in one of two ways. One is it can be seen as Yediyurappa is secure or as a kind of prelude to attacking Yediyurappa,” said one Bengaluru-based political analyst, requesting not to be named.Karandlaje, a Yediyurappa loyalist, had left the saffron outfit in 2012 following Yeddiyurappa’s exit from the party due to differences with the party high command following his removal as Karnataka chief minister after he was indicted in the Lokayukta report for illegal mining in the state.BY Raghavendra, the member of parliament from Shivamogga and Yediyurappa’s son, was among the probables but did not make it to the union cabinet.The analyst cited above said that Raghavendra’s induction would have been a clear sign that Yediyurappa was to be replaced in line with the unwritten rule in the saffron party that only allows one person per family to hold an administrative post.“The current selection is not going to give any political dividends to the BJP in Karnataka,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University said.Induction of Karandlaje, a Vokkaliga; Khuba, a Lingayat; and Narayana Swamy, a scheduled caste is being seen as giving representation to all the major communities in Karnataka. Chandrashekar, a Brahmin, is likely to have been drafted in as a technocrat, analysts indicate.Karandlaje has long held a reputation of making provocative and communally charged statements, courting controversies, as seen in the run up to the 2018 assembly elections.Analysts said that the BJP ignored Yediyurappa’s choices and selected its own candidates like done in the past for Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and even the legislative council, suggesting his powers had waned over the years.Barring Chandrashekar, the other three candidates are proficient only in Kannada, which puts them at a disadvantage in corridors of power in Delhi, analysts said. They added that the reshuffle continued the consolidation of powers with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).The BJP is yet to come to an agreement with Yediyurappa, who hopes to not just continue in the top chair for the remainder of the two-year term but also place his sons within the party and government, people aware of the developments said.The 78-year-old Yediyurappa is facing attack from all quarters, including from within his own government and party over alleged corruption, non-performance, Covid mismanagement and charges that his other son, BY Vijayendra is running a parallel administration under the aegis of his father.His past cases have also returned to haunt him, making the negotiations harder between the party and the chief minister over a possible replacement, analysts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-good-selection-yediyurappa-on-induction-of-4-karnataka-mps-in-pm-s-team-101625677041065.html

In the 2019 elections, LJP won six seats as an NDA member. Five of these MPs led by Paras Paswan have rebelled against Chirag and have been recognised by the Lok Sabha speaker. Chirag has not only sought a review of the speaker’s preliminary decision to recognise Paras as the leader of the LJP in the Lok Sabha but had also indicated on Tuesday that he would go to court if his uncle was inducted as a union minister on the party quota.“A case is to be filed against Paras’s induction in the union cabinet in Delhi high court on Thursday,” said party leader Javed Ashraf.A few hours before the expansion of the cabinet, he tweeted, “Pashupati Kumar Paras from Lok Janshakti Party has already been expelled from the party for betraying the party and top leadership and now on inducting him in the Union Cabinet... the party lodges strong objections.”Paswan has said that while it was the PM’s prerogative to appoint ministers in his cabinet, Paras can not be given a ministerial berth on LJP quota since he had been expelled by the party’s highest decision making body led by Paswan himself. “LJP has nothing to do with him if he is made a minister, from his faction,” Chirag Paswan said.The Jamui MP said that the LJP considered Pashupati Paras ji to be the leader of the House among the MPs expelled from the party. “The LJP had again given a review petition before the Lok Sabha Speaker on his decision, which is still under consideration. The LJP has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court against the decision of the Lok Sabha Speaker’s preliminary decision in which expelled MP Pashupati Paras from the party was considered as the leader of the LJP.Chirag claims that 66 out of the 75 members in the LJP national executive are with him and Pashupati Kumar Paras claim of becoming the national president will not stand before the Election Commission or in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chirag-paswan-to-move-court-against-uncle-paras-s-induction-in-union-cabinet-101625673680680.html

He also pointed to the resignations of the Union education minister and the minister of state, education, and said that the national education policy (NEP) “should be shown the exit door.”Chidambaram made his remarks in a series of tweets during the reshuffle of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet on the day. Former ministers Harsh Vardhan (health) and Ramesh Pokhriyal (education) had submitted their resignations ahead of the revamp, which were then accepted by the President of India.“The resignations of the Union Health Minister and the MoS Health is a candid confession that the Modi government has utterly failed in managing the pandemic,” Chidambaram said.There is a lesson for ministers in these resignations. If things go right the credit will go to the PM, if things go wrong the Minister will be the fall guy.That is the price a Minister pays for implicit obedience and unquestioning subservience.“There is a lesson for ministers in these resignations. If things go right the credit will go to the PM, if things go wrong the Minister will be the fall guy. That is the price a Minister pays for implicit obedience and unquestioning subservience.”In a similar comment about Pokhriyal, Chidambaram questioned the NEP and mentioned that the policy was criticised by “states, political parties, educationists, teachers, academics and scholars.” He also said that the “NEP too should be shown the Exit door.”“We need an NEP that recognises States’ rights, the primacy of science, the importance of liberal arts and the centrality of regional languages. We need an NEP that lays stress on measurable outcomes,” he further tweeted.The NEP too should be shown the Exit doorWe need an NEP that recognises States’ rights, the primacy of science, the importance of liberal arts and the centrality of regional languages.

07-07-2021||India||Contact tracing in Delta variants a challenge: Karnataka||When Bengaluru reported its first Covid-19 case on March 8, 2020, the health department along with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) made a list of 2,666 primary and secondary contacts of the 40-year-old techie who was diagnosed with the infection after arrival from the United States. In the following months, BBMP ensured that most of the contacts were traced and tested. This was one of the reasons why Bengaluru had only 385 cases on June 1, 2020, while Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi had reported 15,770; 40,877 and 20,834 cases respectively on the same day. More than a year later, during the peak of second wave of Covid cases, authorities were tracing only four contacts, while government guidelines required 20 contacts per patient to be traced. The failure of contact tracing was one of the biggest reasons attributed to the spike in Covid cases in the state, among others. With the cases coming down and the new Delta variant posing a threat, authorities are now looking to revive the contact tracing efforts, at least in the case of patients infected with the Delta variants. So far, the state has recorded 725 cases of the Delta variants and two cases of Delta plus. As per BBMP records, out of the 725 cases of patients infecting with the Delta variant, 525 are from Bengaluru, followed by 77 from Vijayapura and 40 from Udupi. Two labs in Bengaluru — Nimhans and National Centre for Biological Sciences are involved in genomic sequences of samples. A day after the second Delta Plus variant case was detected in Karnataka, on June 23, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said that the state was monitoring the emergence of new variants and announced six labs for genome sequencing. “Wherever we have a suspicion, we are doing genomic sequencing. We are doing random checks of 5% of the total samples checked,” Sudhakar had said. The Delta variant was the most predominant variant circulating in May and June in Karnataka. Nearly 3,000 samples have been processed at the two labs and Nimhans has done more than 1,000 of them. However, health department sources said the samples are almost a month old and results are coming now. The increased genome sequencing comes with a challenge and also an opportunity for the health department officials. Since the new variants are considered a bigger concern, the health department is now focussing on increasing contact tracing in these cases. “We want to trace as many contacts as possible in these cases,” said a senior health department official, who didn’t want to be named. He, however, added that the department is facing a big challenge in contact tracing since it takes at least 15 days for genomic sequencing of samples. “Since it takes time for these sequencing results to come, most of the patients have left the hospitals after recovering or it has been a considerable amount of time before we can go back to them,” he said. He added that contact tracing in normal cases has been affected in recent times because of the spike in cases during the second wave. “In most of the cases, we have to go back to ensure in-depth tracing is done in case of Delta variants. It is a difficult task,” the officials added. Experts, however, said there is no need to panic over the new variants. “Whether it is more infectious, there is no evidence to show that. They are tracking the patients to find if the virus spreads faster. We will know this soon,” said Dr Ravi, former head of the neurovirology department at NIMHANS and member of Karnataka’s TAC on Covid-19. He added that it doesn’t seem that the Delta Plus variant is more virulent. “The pattern of disease in Delta Plus is no different from what is seen in the Delta variant. Most of the Delta Plus cases are from samples collected more than a month ago. My reading is that if it was collected one month back, had it (the Delta plus variant) been so deadly, there would have been a higher number of cases and deaths. In fact, the numbers are low now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contact-tracing-in-delta-variants-a-challengekarnataka-101625671400443.html

A graduate in science, Bhowmik has been with the BJP since 1991. A year after joining the party, Bhowmik became a member of the BJP state committee and was made chief of the party’s Dhanpur Mandal the subsequent year. Pratima also served as the vice president of the party’s youth and women wing. Later, in 2016, she was made the general secretary of the party. She twice challenged Tripura’s longest serving chief minister Manik Sarkar in assembly polls in 1998 and 2018 but lost.Later, she defeated the then sitting MP Shankar Prasad Datta in 2019 Lok Sabha polls by a huge margin of 305,689 votes.Born of a school teacher father, Pratima has three siblings. In her earlier days, Pratima used to play Kho-kho and Kabaddi at block, district and state-level events. She also used to practise farming in her native place at Baranarayan in Sonamura. Prior to her, Dr Triguna Sen from West Bengal represented Tripura in the Rajya Sabha and became education and petroleum minister in former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s cabinet. Santosh Mohan Dev, a resident of Assam, contested the Lok Sabha polls in 1989 from West Tripura constituency and became a minister in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s cabinet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inducted 36 new faces into his council of ministers, promoted seven junior ministers, and dropped 12 ministers in his biggest reshuffle since the beginning of his first term in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pratima-bhaumik-1st-permanent-resident-of-tripura-to-get-union-cabinet-berth-101625667801213.html
07-07-2021||India||SC asks Centre to submit panel report on aircraft fumigation to prevent mosquito||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to submit the report of an expert committee tasked at finding out if spraying of insecticides or fumigating aircraft as a solution to mosquito menace was harmful for passengers. The apex court’s order came after additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati informed the bench that owing to the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, the committee was unable to submit the report. It had to be submitted in pursuance of the November 29, 2019, and February 7, 2020 orders.The Centre has now taken time till September 7, 2021 to complete the exercise, the top court bench stated. “The Union of India shall apprise the Court of the report of the expert committee in the meantime,” the bench added.The Supreme Court was hearing pleas against the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) ban of spraying disinfectants and pesticides in aircraft. The NGT had initiated proceedings based on an e-mail by US-based neurologist Dr Jai Kumar, who said that fumigation on planes with chemicals like phenothrin, an organo-phosphorus neurotoxin, was harmful for human beings. He claimed that these chemicals pose the risk of causing cancer and auto-immune diseases, including lupus, Parkinson’s disease and memory loss. Kumar further claimed that this practice solely exists in Indian airlines, and that all other airlines have ceased doing it.Notably, the apex court had earlier said that it was not in favour of imposing a blanket ban and may permit it on certain routes where mosquito problem was prevalent to follow the practice, after the committee submits its report.IndiGo Airlines, which moved the Supreme Court against the NGT ban, stated that several Indian airports are faced with mosquito menace, including in Kolkata, Patna, Delhi, Jaipur, Chennai, Raipur, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Dehradun, Lucknow and Pune.The airlines also said that the blanket ban was keeping them from taking steps towards safety and protection of passengers, especially in monsoon season when vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue are abundant.IndiGo further claimed that they have already received several complaints due to the issue, with some even filing cases against the company.The apex court has directed the expert committee to find out if fumigation is injurious to human health, and what are the best practices followed by foreign airlines.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-centre-to-submit-panel-report-on-aircraft-fumigation-to-prevent-mosquito-101625666641589.html

While only classes 9 and 10 were initially commenced, other classes were reopened a few months later between January and February 2021. However, due to the increase in the number of cases during the second wave of infections, the government again ordered that the schools would remain shut.According to a bulletin from the state health department on Wednesday, 3,166 new Covid-19 cases and 21 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.

In May, Assam governor Jagdish Mukhi announced the introduction of the legislation in the assembly session this month. The proposed law also envisages a complete ban on the transportation of cattle from other parts of the country.Assam is the only source of the transportation of cattle and almost all goods from the rest of the country to the northeast. Though the legislation is yet to be enacted, the Assam government has stopped the entry of cattle into the state.Most of the cattle that enter Assam gets supplied to other states in the region, where beef is consumed. Meghalaya’s Khasi Jaiñtia Butchers Association general secretary Generous Warlarpih said their friends, who sell beef in Guwahati and Shillong, are complaining about the shortage of meat. “In fact, it is slowly becoming a rare commodity in Guwahati especially.”Also Read | Total Covid lockdown in 7 districts of Assam from today: Check guidelines hereHe added Meghalaya, a Christian-dominated state, imports 90% of meat from other states via Assam. Warlarpih added the proposed legislation there will affect both supplies and lead to a steep rise in the price of beef.“We hope the Meghalaya government foresees this problem and puts in place measures to ensure safe and smooth transportation of our cattle through Assam,” Warlarpih said. “We are already facing so many problems in bringing cattle to the state and cattle smuggling is also a major hurdle. If this law is going to be another burden, then it will be the people who will suffer.”Meghalaya’s principal secretary (animal husbandry) GHP Raju said they are aware of Assam’s plan. “The laws by other states shall not create any inconvenience to the poor farmers of our state.” He added it was too premature to comment on a law yet to be enacted. Raju said the government will not allow such a law to impede meat consumption and will ensure smooth transportation of cattle via Assam. He added it is entirely up to Assam to enact legislation on cow protection since it is a state subject, “The Assam government, or for that matter any government, can create a mechanism to verify if the cattle have been brought from outside Assam and if their destination is Meghalaya. “If it is prohibited, then there has to be a mechanism to facilitate the transportation of cattle from other places to Meghalaya through Assam.”Meghalaya chief secretary MS Rao said the citizens should not be unduly worried about this. “It is a non-issue, and we will handle it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assams-cow-protection-law-move-raises-concerns-in-meghalaya-101625663000012.html

His family said Ranjit Sen lost the will to live ever since he was declared a foreigner by the foreigners’ tribunal in 2018. He was arrested and put in a detention centre meant for suspected foreigners inside Silchar Central Jail. He didn’t challenge the tribunal’s order to prove his citizenship. He was released only last year following a Supreme Court directive ordering release of those who have been in detention for over two years. His grandon Hrithik said, “He regularly voted in elections. But he wasn’t the same ever since his arrest and detention. He didn’t want to live anymore because he felt insulted.” Also Read | Total Covid lockdown in 7 districts of Assam from today: Check guidelines hereSen was declared positive for Covid-19 virus last week when his family took him to a local hospital for regular health checkup.

Justice M Nirmal Kumar ordered for the petitioner to be released on bail after he surrendered his passport and deposited two sureties of ₹10,000 each on the condition that he will appear before the investigating officer daily for two weeks and thereafter whenever called.The minister and the Malayasia women had been living together though Manikandan was married. According to the complainant, the accused had established sexual relations with her on the false pretext of marriage after divorcing his wife. She also alleged that she was thrice forced to abort her pregnancy by the minister. Manikandan’s counsel pointed out that a substantial portion of the investigation was over and assured the court that the former minister will “not evade from justice and shall abide by any condition”. He stated that the case was filed out of political vendetta. Earlier, the court had granted Manikandan interim protection till June 9 before dismissing his anticipatory bail plea on June 16, following which he was arrested from Bengaluru on June 20. Upon his arrest, police recorded his confession and took him to Madurai where the duo often stayed in an apartment.In his bail petition, Manikandan argued that the complainant was a well-educated and employed girl and could not have been waylaid by the leader. After hearing both sides of the argument, the court noted that they were in a relationship from May 2017 to April 2021 and the complainant had the intelligence to understand what she was consenting to.“The defacto complainant was well aware of the consequence that the marriage between her and the petitioner would not take place,” the court said in its order.“Thus leading to the inference that she freely, voluntarily and consciously consented to have sexual intercourse with the petitioner and her consent was not in consequence of any misconception of fact and they were living together as man and wife. Thus, there is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex.”The Malayasian woman’s counsel did not immediately respond to the court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-grants-conditional-bail-to-former-aiadmk-minister-101625662339873.html

She is an old and frail lady and summoning her is nothing but pressure tactics of the government. Irony is that the summon was issued just hours after the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) declined to meet the visiting Delimitation Commission,” PAGD spokesman Mohamed Yusuf Tarigami said in a statement.Nazir, in her 70s, has been asked to be present before the ED zonal office in Srinagar on July 14. According to news agency PTI, the case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is linked to the recovery of at least two diaries following raids on an alleged associate of Mehbooba. The diaries contain details of some purported payments made from the chief minister’s discretionary fund in alleged contravention of rules. These funds are alleged to have been diverted during the PDP rule in the erstwhile state. A few lakh rupees from these funds are alleged to have been transferred into the accounts of Nazir and some others, officials told the news agency.Mehbooba was also questioned by the central agency in March this year in connection with a separate money laundering case. She had then alleged that those speaking against the Central government were being hounded by National investigation agencies such as ED. On Wednesday, she said summons to her mother was another attempt by the Centre to “intimidate” political opponents.“On the day PDP chose not to meet [the] Delimitation Commission, ED sent a summon to my mother to appear in person for unknown charges. In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI [Government of India] doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores,” mufti wrote on social media.Gulshan Nazir, wife of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and PDP founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was served the summon on Tuesday, the day PDP said it will stay away from the delimitation exercise ahead of election in Jammu and Kashmir calling it a “pre-planned” process aimed at disempowering people and for realising a particular political party’s “political vision”.The PAGD said the summon was aimed to “silence the genuine demand for the reversal of unilateral and unconstitutional decisions of August 5, 2019”, referring to the day when Parliament scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status by abrogating Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union Territories.The Bharatiya Janata Party state spokesman Altaf Thakur however refuted the allegation of misuse of probe agency and said that the ED must be doing investigation on some basis. “If they are clean they shouldn’t worry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-alliance-says-ed-summon-to-mehbooba-mufti-s-mother-gulshan-nazir-is-humiliating-101625661440187.html

Ravi Shankar Prasad was the minister of law and information technology while Prakash Javadekar was the environment minister. Both these big-ticket resignations came to much surprise as Ravi Shankar Prasad was at the forefront of the government's new IT rules for which the government is at loggerheads with Twitter. Prakash Javadekar's exit from this ministry has also been surprising as he was also the spokesperson of the government.Follow all updates from PM Modi's Cabinet reshufleAhead of the Cabinet reshuffle scheduled to begin at 6pm on Wednesday, health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, chemicals and fertilisers minister DV Sadananda Gowda, labour minister Santosh Gangwar, education minister of state Sanjay Dhotre, minister of state for women and child development Debasree Chaudhuri, minister of state for jal shakti Rattan Lal Kataria and minister of state for environment Babul Supriyo stepped down from their posts.Thaawarchand Gehlot who was in charge of the social justice and empowerment ministry had resigned on Tuesday and was made the Governor of Karnataka.In a major reshuffle that will bring focus on equal representation of gender, caste and community, 36 new ministers on Wednesday took oath and seven ministers of state are being promoted.Both Javadekar and RS Prasad announced the new IT rules for social media and digital media in February following which they issued regular statements regarding the IT rules. Under RS Prasad, Twitter lost its status of an intermediary in India as it failed to comply with the new I-T rules. Reports said there might be some organisational role inside the BJP for RS Prasad as several states will be going to the elections next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prakash-javadekar-ravi-shankar-prasad-quit-ahead-of-pm-modi-s-cabinet-shuffle-101625659429944.html
07-07-2021||India||Monsoon likely to gradually revive from Thursday||After a hiatus of around 10 days, the monsoon is likely to revive gradually from Thursday onwards and spread across northwest India over the weekend, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said. There has been a 5% deficiency in the rain in the country since June 1. Central India is 7% rain deficient, northwest India 13%, and east and northeast 2%.IMD scientists are expecting active monsoon conditions in northwest India around July 16-17 when a low-pressure system is expected to move there. Moist easterly winds in the lower levels from the Bay of Bengal are likely to establish gradually over parts of eastern India from July 8 onwards. They are likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10. Accordingly, the southwest monsoon is likely to advance into the remaining parts of west Uttar Pradesh, more parts of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi around July 10, IMD said in its bulletin on Wednesday.Also Read | Arctic sea ice loss triggering extreme Sept rains in India: StudyA deviation in the predicted weather pattern has led to delayed and scanty rainfall in most parts of the country. The subdued monsoon has coincided with the critical period of sowing and paddy transplantation. It is likely to impact agricultural activities such as sowing and transplantation of crops, irrigation scheduling, and power requirements.A western disturbance is also likely to impact the Western Himalayas and parts of northwest India around July 10. “There will be rain over northwest India on July 10 and 11 and then an active spell of monsoon is likely around July 16. This is because a low-pressure system is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal on July 11 which will travel north-westwards covering central India and move towards Rajasthan. It is likely to bring a lot of rain in its path,” said DS Pai, who heads IMD’s climate research and services. “A western disturbance is also likely to affect the region around July 10, but it may not weaken the monsoon winds. Sometimes monsoon winds interact with westerlies to bring heavy rain.”RMSI, a global disaster risk management firm, said on Tuesday that the mid-latitude westerly winds and westerly trough approaching northwest India would hold back the rapid monsoon advancement during the next week. So, Delhi and other north-western areas would not get much rain as should normally be the case after the arrival of the monsoon. Also Read | Govt paves way for ecotourism in forest areas; experts remain waryMahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather, said western disturbances have been forming one after the other but they are feeble. “The Madden Julian Oscillation (characterised by a band of rain clouds moving across the tropics) is likely to be in the Indian Ocean in the next couple of days which will enhance monsoon flow. So, we do not expect the monsoon to weaken.”IMD said scattered to widespread rainfall was very likely in Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh from July 8 onwards. Isolated very heavy rainfall was also very likely in Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on April 8, West Madhya Pradesh on April 11, and East Madhya Pradesh on July 10. IMD said scattered to widespread rainfall was also very likely in northwest India from July 9 onwards. It added isolated heavy rainfall was also very likely in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh from July 9 and in East Rajasthan from July 10 onwards. IMD said due to the strengthening of monsoon over the Arabian Sea and likely formation of a low-pressure area over the west-central Bay of Bengal around July 11, enhanced rainfall activity was very likely along the west coast from July 9 onwards.Due to the revival of monsoon from July 8, rainfall intensity and distribution is very likely to decrease over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura from July 9 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-gradually-revive-from-thursday-101625657419581.html

While the resignation was being interpreted by observers as an admission that the pandemic could have been managed well, Congress leaders said Harsh Vardhan was made into a scapegoat.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh took to Twitter and said Harsh Vardhan has been made a scapegoat for "monumental failures at the highest level -- nowhere else". The Congress leader also said the former health minister is a good man.National Disaster Management Authority is responsible for criminal mis-management of #COVID19.It is headed by the Prime Minister.Will PM take responsibility for his failures?Or will PM only make Dr. Harshvardhan the scapegoat for PM’s failures?#CabinetExpansion2021Congress leader Randeep Surjewala too extended defence for Dr Harsh Vardhan and said the National Disaster Management Authority, headed by PM Modi, is responsible for the criminal mismanagement of Covid-19. "Will PM take responsibility for his failures? Or, will PM only make Dr Harshvardhan the scapegoat for PM’s failures?" Surjewala tweeted.The Covid-19 pandemic was the biggest challenge for Dr Harsh Vardhan as the health minister. Apart from health, he also had two portfolios-- science and technology and earth sciences.Follow live updates of PM Modi's Cabinet reshuffleThe Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be tumultuous for health ministers of several countries. For example, Brazil has seen four health ministers since the beginning of the pandemic. The Czech Republic has got five health ministers since the beginning of Covid-19. The United Kingdom too saw its health minister resigning after being embroiled in a controversy where he flouted social distancing norms.While these have been direct casualties of the pandemic, Dr Hrsh Vardhan's role in managing the pandemic has always been highly praised by PM Modi. In his second stint as the health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, who is an ENT surgeon, also became a member of the World Health Organization executive board.The pandemic brought Dr Harsh Vardhan to prominence as he was at the frontline shielding the government's Covid-19 management and Covid-19 vaccination policy. "History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation and valuable advice was followed by your leaders as well in such extraordinary times," Dr Harsh Vardhan wrote to former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poor-dr-harsh-vardhan-jairam-ramesh-on-health-minister-s-resignation-101625656026150.html

All you need to know||The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a national multi-agency consortium of Genome Sequencing Laboratories (RGSLs), established by the Centre on December 30 last year for sequencing and analysis of genome data.All you need to know about INSACOG:The scope of laboratories under INSACOG has been expanded from the initial 10 labs in the country to 28 at present. RGSLs are responsible for genome sequencing and identification of variants of concern/variants of interest, potential variants of interest, and other mutations.Also read | Covaxin booster dose: What is it? What does govt say about this?The consortium was established to expand whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, commonly known as Covid-19, across the nation to aid the understanding of how the virus spreads and evolves.The objective of the consortium is to ascertain the status of variants of interest (VOI) and variants of concern (VOC) in the country and to establish sentinel surveillance and surge surveillance mechanisms for the early detection of genomic variants.So far, VOC has been found in 174 districts in 35 states of the country. The highest number of VOCs have been detected from districts in Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Telangana, West Bengal and Gujarat. Variants of Concern of public health importance detected in community samples in India are, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta, stated ministry of health and family welfare."The B.1.617 lineage, first observed in Maharashtra, was associated with the unusual rise observed in several districts of the state. It is now found in many states in India," the ministry said.B.1.617.2.1 (AY.1) or commonly known as Delta Plus variant signifies Delta variant with an additional mutation, according to the ministry.Initially, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) sequenced samples of international passengers who arrived in India from the UK, Brazil or South Africa or travelled through these countries, as these countries reported a surge in Covid cases.RT-PCR positive test samples from states reporting sudden hikes in cases were sequenced in priority, this was further expanded by efforts of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), as well as individual institutions.The country first focussed on controlling the spread of global variants in the country with a high transmissibility rate. Subsequently, Delta and Delta Plus variants were also identified based on genome sequencing analysis conducted by the consortium laboratories.Also read | 'Lambda variant of coronavirus deadlier than delta': Malaysian health ministryIndia's strategy for Covid surveillance:Earlier genomic surveillance was focussed on the variants carried by international travelers and their contacts through sequencing 3-5% of the total positive samples.Sentinel surveillance strategy was subsequently communicated to states and Union territories in April 2021. Under the strategy, multiple sentinel sites were identified to adequately represent the geographic spread of a region, and RTPCR positive samples are sent from each site for sequencing.Surge surveillance strategy for districts with Covid-19 clusters or those reporting surge in cases was also undertaken under which a representative number of samples are collected and sent to RGSLs.The detailed SOPs for sending samples from identified sentinel sites regularly to the designated Regional Genome Sequencing Laboratories (RGSLs) were shared with states/UTs, the ministry said.The SOPs for sending samples for sequencing are:The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) machinery coordinates sample collection and transportation from the districts/sentinel sites to RGSLs.The information obtained on VOCs and VOIs is submitted to Central Surveillance Unit, IDSP for establishing a clinico-epidemiological correlation in coordination with state surveillance officers.Upon identification of a genomic mutation of public health relevance, RGSL is required to submit the same to the Scientific and Clinical Advisory Group (SCAG). After discussion, The SCAG, if felt appropriate, recommends VOIs and other potential mutations to the Central Surveillance Unit for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insacog-and-india-s-strategy-for-covid-19-surveillance-sequencing-all-you-need-to-know-101625648572527.html

We appeal to the Indian authorities to restore the memorial in its original place to preserve the relationship between people of the two countries”, a group of Bangladeshi artists, historians and freedom fighters stated in a joint statement released recently. The war memorial at Post Office Chowmuhani including a tank, an artillery gun and some other war materials captured during the 1971 war from erstwhile East Pakistan is being relocated to the Albert Ekka Memorial Park, built in 2018, as part of Smart City Mission project and following the Indian armed forces’ demand to move the old Chowmuhani war memorial alongside the new one at the memorial park. A replica of the 40 feet victory pillar already exists at Albert Ekka Memorial Park, named after Lance Naik Albert Ekka, who died fighting to save Agartala from the Pakistani forces and was awarded Param Veer Chakra, which is the highest war time military honour, for his valour shown in the battle at Gangasagar (now in Bangladesh) during the 1971 war. Shifting of the war memorials from Post Office Chowmuhani began last November and the then West District magistrate Shailesh Kumar Yadav said it was partly being done following the Indian Army’s long standing demand to bring both memorials together after Biplab Kumar Deb became Tripura chief minister in 2018. “Army & Sainik board raised this issue in front of chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb after he came to power in 2018. The project was taken up under Smart City Mission after floating an open tender at a cost of ₹4.83 crore and it was done following written permission from Sainik Board and consultation with the Indian Army authorities,” a statement signed by Yadav had said. However, political parties and other social organisations in Tripura are against the move. “We demand the war memorial to be restored. We are hopeful that the government will take a positive approach in this regard,” a member of Tripura Cultural Coordination Centre, a CPM-backed organisation, said. Left Front convener Bijan Dhar said, “We condemn the act of the government. The memorial [represents] a historical sentiment. Without consulting with any political party, the memorial was removed. We protest against this.” Congress vice president Tapas De said it was “an insult” to people of Tripura and the freedom fighters. “India and especially Tripura had played a vital role in the Bangladesh Liberation movement. By removing the memorial, they have insulted the martyrs and Tripura,” he said. BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “Our government is trying to protect the memorial and that’s why, all the memorials are being shifted to Albert Ekka Memorial Park that has larger space. We can maintain the memorials properly there.”Under the Smart City Mission, the diameter of Post Office Chowmuhani will be reduced to 18 metres from 28 metres after relocation of the memorial, allowing space for traffic movement. The square will then be rebuilt with the Tree of Life theme under the Smart City project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-erupt-over-relocation-of-bangladesh-liberation-war-memorial-in-agartala-101625655199537.html

We can create an enormous deficit which can never be filled up otherwise," he said while speaking at the foundation day event of the Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, according to news agency PTI.The Wipro chairman said a graded approach such as the one that involves conducting classes in open areas in neighbourhoods, vaccinating teachers against Covid-19 and re-engineering education programmes is the need of the hour to ensure that the lost schooling time over the past one and half years is covered.Wipro's philanthropic arm has committed an additional ₹1,000 crore of grants over and above the ₹1,125-crore support it had announced in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Premji said that the additional grant will be directed primarily on universal vaccination.He termed the Covid-19 pandemic as a once-a-century event which led the people and the institutions to take it as a challenge and fight it with all the resources. “A comprehensive set of plans was drawn up in the early days itself to tackle both the humanitarian and health aspects,” Premji said.He said close to 83 lakh people in rural communities and vulnerable areas revived their livelihoods through field interventions like seed and fertiliser supply for farmers and working capital for poultry farmers and handicraft industry through the help of its foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/azim-premji-voices-concerns-against-idea-of-promoting-students-to-next-class-101625649461059.html
07-07-2021||India||'Without a spot of corruption': Babul Supriyo says he is sad but he was 'not asked to quit'||Union minister Babul Supriyo on Wednesday resigned from the council of ministers and took to Facebook to clarify that he has resigned from the post and so to frame it like he has been asked to resign might not be proper. The BJP minister of state for environment, forest and climate change was considered as BJP's strong leader in Bengal before the union minister lost in the state assembly election from Kolkata's Tollyganj Assembly seat against Aroop Biswas, who was the incumbent MLA of the seat. Since then, the singer-turned-politician was found missing from the central leadership and his political presence appeared confined only in the criticism of the TMC leadership in the state. Just a day before his resignation, however, Babul Supriyo was present at an event in which his ministry signed a joint communication with the ministry of tribal affairs.Full list of ministers: Scindia, Sonowal and Lekhi make it to the cabinet"I am extremely happy that I go today without a spot of corruption on me, having served my constituency with all my might and having enjoyed their coincidence when Asansol voted me back as their MP once again, with triple the margin in 2019 again," he wrote in a long Facebook post."Yes, when there is smoke there must be a fire somewhere. Not being able to take phone calls of my friends in the media who care for me hence let me spell it out myself..Yes, I have resigned from the Council Of Ministers !! (As I had framed it earlier, “Asked to resign” may not be the right way to put it)" Babul wrote with many smileys."My bestest of wishes to my colleagues, whose names I can’t spell out but by now everyone is aware, will be sworn in as Hon’ble Ministers from Bengal. I am surely SAD for myself but very HAPPY for them. More power to all of them," he wrote.From 2019's Jadavpur University incident to the recent controversy over his tweets 'Beti paraya dhan hoti hai', Babul Supriyo has remained the centre of several controversies. But what apparently put a quick full stop to his ministership is the poor show in the West Bengal assembly election which, as state BJP leaders have acknowledged, was not predicted. On the personal front, the former minister had suffered from Covid and also lost his mother in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/without-a-spot-of-corruption-babul-supriyo-says-he-is-sad-but-he-was-not-asked-to-quit-101625652893062.html

07-07-2021||India||Health minister Harsh Vardhan resigns ahead of Cabinet reshuffle||Union minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday resigned from the post of health minister ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's big Cabinet reshuffle. Harsh Vardhan's resignation comes soon after education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and labour minister Santosh Gangwar stepped down from their posts, making way for some big-ticket announcements as both education and health are crucial and challenging departments to fill in amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Pokhriyal, however, has cited ill health as the reason behind his resignation.Follow live updates from PM Modi's Cabinet reshuffleThis was Dr Harsh Vardhan's second stint as the health minister as he was in the post for seven months in 2014, after the PM Modi government came to power. From November 2014 to the end of the first term of the Modi government, JP Nadda was the health minister. In 2019, as the PM Modi government came back to power for the second time, Harsh Vardhan was given the responsibility of this department again.During the pandemic, which proved to be a major challenge in Dr Harsh Vardhan's term as the health minister, he was also handling the responsibility of the science and technology and the earth sciences departments.Harsh Vardhan, associated with RSS since childhood, completed his medical education from Kanpur University's Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College and from the same college, he got his master of surgery in Otorhinolaryngology. After completing his studies, he set up his practice as an ENT surgeon in Delhi and held several organisational posts in the Indian Medical Association.Harsh Vardhan was Delhi's health minister in the '90s and played a crucial role in the Pulse Polio programme.Harsh Vardhan's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been criticised by the opposition, though on several occasions PM Modi praised his proactive role in fighting the pandemic. The health minister, who was also elected in WHO's executive board, was at loggerheads with states and state ministers who criticised the government's vaccine policy||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-harsh-vardhan-resigns-ahead-of-cabinet-reshuffle-101625650188177.html
07-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle: Union council design with an eye on social engineering, polls||The Union council of ministers, which will be expanded with the swearing-in of new entrants this evening, is expected to have more representation from socially and economically backward communities, of women and people with administrative and legislative experience, people aware of the matter said.At 6pm, the expansion will take place at the Darbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The new team is being built in the run-up to the state elections early next year including in Uttar Pradesh. It will be in line with the ruling party’s outreach to the socially and economically deprived sections. The sections are the key to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s social engineering strategy.As the government is keen to walk the talk on inclusivity, the council is likely to have 12 ministers from Scheduled Caste communities from states such as Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal. Two of them are likely to be Cabinet ministers.From the Scheduled Tribe communities, eight representatives from Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Assam, and Madhya Pradesh are likely to be inducted. Three of these are likely to be Cabinet ministers. Also, 19 members from Other Backward Class (OBC) communities will be sworn in too. Five of these OBC members are expected to be Cabinet ministers.The council is also likely to have five members representing the minority community from five states. Of these, one each is likely to be from the Muslim, Sikh, and Christian communities. Two ministers are expected to be Buddhists. Three of the ministers from minority communities are likely to get Cabinet berths.The new council of ministers is also expected to have 11 women of which two will be Cabinet ministers. At present, Nirmala Sitharaman and Smriti Irani are Cabinet ministers.In line with the BJP’s effort to promote younger people, the council will have an average age of 58 against the current 61. Fourteen ministers are expected to be below 50 which includes six Cabinet ministers.According to people aware of the details, the selection of ministers has also been done with the intent of bringing on-board people with administrative experience as the government has faced criticism including over the state of the economy, job crisis, rising prices, and the response to the second Covid-19 wave.Consequently, 46 ministers with experience of being in the central or state governments will be included. People aware of the details said 23 ministers have been Members of Parliament for three or more terms, bringing in over a decade of legislative experience. The new council is also expected to have four former chief ministers and 18 former state ministers. It will have expertise from across professional sectors. On-board will be 13 lawyers, six doctors, five engineers, seven civil servants, three with MBA degrees, and seven with PhDs.Among the states going to the polls next year, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Manipur will have representation in the expanded council of ministers. From Uttar Pradesh, , which sends the highest number of lawmakers to the Lok Sabha, the representation will be from regions including Poorvanchal, Awadh and Bundelkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-council-of-ministers-to-have-more-representation-from-backward-communities-101625650399031.html
07-07-2021||India||Doctor recalls how Dilip Kumar used to recite Urdu shayaris||Legendary actor Dilip Kumar breathed his last at Mumbai’s Hinduja Hospital after suffering a cardio-respiratory arrest around 7.30 am on Wednesday. The 98-year-old veteran actor was diagnosed with an advanced stage of prostate cancer apart from age-related illnesses.Kumar had been in and out of hospitals recently due to his deteriorating health condition. “He had developed an advanced stage of prostate cancer. Along with it, he also suffered from kidney failure,” said a doctor from the hospital.He was hospitalised in the first week of June after he complained of breathlessness and was diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusion which is accumulation of fluids between the layers of pleura outside the lungs.Within two weeks of getting discharged, he was once again admitted at the hospital on June 29 with the same complaints. Just like earlier that month, doctors treated Kumar and he was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where water was pumped out of his lungs.“On June 30, he also underwent blood transfusion but it didn’t help him much,” said the doctor. As per the doctors, the cancer had spread to other body parts and it was extremely “challenging” to treat. He also used to undergo dialysis for his failing kidney. “He was 98 years old, so he already had several health issues and was completely bed ridden. He had a medical set up in his house for his daily treatment. But the advanced cancer further deteriorated his health,” said another doctor. “At the end, he got cardio-respiratory arrest.”He was being treated by cardiologist Dr Nitin Gokhale, pulmonologist Dr Jalil Parker, pulmonologist and urologist Dr Anita Patel. Dr Parker was only in his 20s when he first saw the veteran actor on a podium while studying medicine at Grant Medical College, also known as JJ hospital. He was the chief guest of the college’s annual programme—August Melodies. But never did he know that one day he would have to treat him and also declare his death.“I remember the first time I saw him. He was so dignified and had an aura around him. As soon as he walked up to the podium, there was pin drop silence on the ground as we were all glued to his speech,” he recollected. Infact, Dilip Kumar discussed politics and general affairs with Dr Parker while undergoing treatment. “He had respect for all the political parties, be it the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena or others. He believed in the development of the underprivileged citizens. It was really an honour to treat him,” he said. Dilip Kumar was known for his command of Urdu language and love for ‘shayaris’ (a type of poetry). He often recited Urdu ‘shayaris’ to the medical staffers. “He was an ardent reader. When I was younger, I had seen him reading books in his car under a reading light. In fact, in hospitals, he would read books while lying on the bed,” Dr Parker said while remembering the first superstar of the Hindi film industry. Last year, the iconic actor lost his two younger brothers—Aslam Khan, 88, and Ehsan Khan, 90, due to Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-recalls-how-dilip-kumar-used-to-recite-urdu-shayaris-101625650279075.html

07-07-2021||India||4 years after losing arm, para-athlete hopes to win another medal at Paralympics||Ajeet Singh Yadav’s life turned upside down when he fell from a moving train near Madhya Pradesh’s Satna in December 2017 while trying to save a friend. He suffered several fractures, right hip dislocation, bruises all over the body, and lost his left hand and a part of arm. Yadav, 27, could not think of anything positive after the tragedy. But his mentor and coach VK Dabas would motivate him. Dabas not only helped him overcome the mental agony and trauma but also become a para-athlete of international standing.Yadav won a gold medal in the javelin throw at a championship in 2019 in China and a bronze medal at the World Para Athletics Championship in Dubai the same year. Yadav won the gold medal at the Para Athletics Grand Prix 2021 in Dubai in February. Now he hopes to win a gold medal at the Tokyo Paralympics starting next month.Also Read | PCI picks 24 para athletes for Tokyo ParalympicsYadav said his success in China and later in Dubai did wonders for his confidence. But it was not easy, to begin with. His first big challenge was the National Para Athletics Championship at Panchkula (Haryana) in March 2018. “I threw the javelin standing and still won fourth place in this important championship. More than winning the medal, the main object of participating in the national championship was to learn and know about para-athletics and para javelin.” Yadav credits his family for encouraging him to pursue a para-sporting career after the accident. “They stood by me, and it was my coaches and mentors at the Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education in Gwalior, who kept guiding me towards my mission--Paralympics.”Yadav, who wanted to be a sports teacher or a professor, is from Nagla Bidhi village in Uttar Pradesh’s Etawah and is also pursuing a PhD in physical education and sports. He is currently undergoing training at Sonipat.Yadav will compete against fellow Indians Devendra and Sundar Singh Gujar for the gold medal in Tokyo. “My mission will be to do better than those two and finish at the top that too with a world record.” He said the Dubai event prepared him well for the Paralympics. “During the pandemic, it was really difficult to train and prepare well. But I managed by working out in the gym,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-years-after-losing-arm-para-athlete-hopes-to-win-another-medal-at-paralympics-101625646318921.html
07-07-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi slams govt over petrol price hike, calls it tax extortionist||Congress on Monday slammed the government over petrol prices crossing ₹100 per litre in the national Capital, alleging that the Modi government runs of the notion of “tax extortion”. Congress added that when “looters” govern a country, the masses have to suffer from inflation.“Your car may run on petrol or diesel, the Modi government runs on tax extortion,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.“From January 1 to July 7, the Modi government increased the prices of petrol 69 times. From April 2014 to June 2021, petrol and diesel witnessed an increase of excise duty from which the government shockingly looted ₹25 lakh crore from Indian people,” national spokesperson of the Congress Randeep Surjewala said at a press conference.He said that the “shameless” Modi government has been feeding its rich friends by “looting” from the pockets of the common masses.Also Read | Modi govt promotes ministers for attacking Rahul Gandhi: Cong spokesperson KheraWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “substantially reduce” taxes charged by the Central government on petrol and diesel to “check the overall inflationary trend” in the country. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Partha Chatterjee on Monday announced that the party will stage a sit-in protest against the hike in fuel prices in every block and town of the state on July 10 and 11, following all Covid-19 protocols.On Saturday, opposition leaders, including Congress’ Shashi Tharoor, TMC’s Derek O’Brien and Aam Aadmi Party’s Somnath Bharti took a dig at the government over the rising fuel prices. The leaders posted video footage from 1973 in which Jan Sangh leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee was seen arriving in Parliament in a bullock cart to “protest an increase in 7 paise in petrol prices”.As fuel prices rise, several BJP leaders have tried to justify the increase.Madhya Pradesh energy minister Pradhuman Singh Tomar advised people to cycle to the vegetable market as it will keep them healthy and end pollution. Talking to the media last week, Tomar asked, “Who uses petrol and diesel? Do we go to the vegetable market by cycle? It will keep us healthy and will end pollution. Is petrol and diesel necessary for our health?”Last month, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that though high fuel prices were a problem, government expenses were up due to Covid-19 relief measures, and “the Centre is saving money to spend on welfare schemes”.He also said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi must answer why fuel prices are high in Congress-ruled states like Punjab, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.Delhi is the new entrant in the list of cities where petrol prices crossed the ₹100-a-litre mark. As of July 7, the fuel pump rate has crossed the ₹100-a-litre mark in at least 16 states and Union Territories. These states and Union Territories include Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab, Ladakh, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir and Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-slams-govt-over-petrol-price-hike-calls-it-tax-extortionist-101625646019793.html

07-07-2021||India||Covaxin booster dose: What is it? What does govt say about this?||How long will two doses of vaccines protect you from Covid-19? There is no exact answer to this question as the jury is still out on this. Breakthrough infections or infections after one or two doses of vaccines have also been reported from several parts of the country. While a third booster shot may be the answer to the situation, the government on Tuesday said it will take time to come to a concrete conclusion about the requirement of booster dose while Bharat Biotech is carrying out the trial of its booster shot, which will be the third shot after the two-dose vaccination."Booster dose is in the stage of scientific ideation," Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, the Indian Council of Medical Research, said.What is the Covaxin booster dose?In April, Bharat Biotech, the makers of India's Covaxin, got permission from the Drug Controller General of India to conduct trials for a third shot which will be administered as a booster shot. The trial is going on and the first trial result is likely to come in August. The final results are expected by November 2021, reports said. The booster shot might become a yearly thing to keep the immune system to the optimum level.Also Read: List of European countries which recognise Covishield and CovaxinWhy might a booster shot become crucial?A booster shot might become crucial in the coming days to fight Covid-19 because emerging variants of the virus are likely to become dominant.Natural immunity versus vaccine immunityDr Bhargava on Tuesday explained that the timeline of vaccine efficacy is yet to be ascertained, while those who have been infected once by SARS-CoV-2 have antibodies for 7 to 12 months. "The application of the booster shot will depend on the knowledge of the efficacy of the vaccine. It is well known that natural antibodies after infection remain for 7-12 months. But the jury is still out to decide how long vaccine-generated antibodies remain effective. Then we can talk about booster shot," Dr Bhargava said. Covaxin's phase 3 trial results are out, which needs to be followed up by probing how long the effect stays, Dr Bhargava said.Will it be only for people who took the 1st and the 2nd dose of Covaxin?This is not yet known but in general, booster shots are standalone shots. Sputnik V too has also said it will offer a booster shot to fight against variants.What has govt said on the booster shot?Joint secretary of the Union health minister Lav Agarwal said the immediate challenge is to ve vaccinate priority groups at the earliest. "The immediate challenge is to vaccinate the priority age groups; to address vaccine hesitancy. A booster shot is more in a research state. Based on further research, if it comes to a state where booster shots need to be administered in a form of a programme, we will bring that to your notice," Lav Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-booster-dose-what-is-it-what-does-govt-say-about-this-101625644184446.html

The new strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus has been detected in 30 countries till now.The variant is reported to have originated from Peru where it is the dominant strain, according the local media reports.

Currently, we are identifying specific location in the reserve that has least obstacles such as tree leaves where it would be held,” said Manoj Kumar, deputy director, PTR.According to forest department officials, PTR has found mention on darksitesfinder.com, an open online global platform that identifies dark sites on the planet which are considered ideal for the photography of celestial bodies due to less light pollution at such spots.Also Read | Tiger T-65 found dead at Rajasthan’s Ranthambore reserve“The dark sites hold significance as the visibility of the sky from such locations is better than other places during the night, largely because they are away from the cities where the glow of the lights, reduces sky visibility. These dark sites are ideal for astrophotographers to click pictures. The darksitesfinder website uses satellite images to identify dark sites. In India, PTR and Indravati area in Maharashtra have been identified as the darkest sites,” said Kumar.The PTR forest in Latehar district is spread over1129.93 square kilometres including 414.8 sqkm of core area and 715.85 sqkm of buffer area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darkest-site-in-the-country-palamu-tiger-reserve-set-to-begin-astrophotography-101625642358870.html

"Waves are more of a post-facto analysis of what is happening in the system. Waves are the interaction between the virus and the human, Waves will come, the virus will be mutated, people will develop immunity and the impact of a wave will depend on all these factors," Agarwal said on Tuesday."The first challenge is that we have not yet closed the second wave. And the next challenge is human behaviour -- by the time a possible future wave comes at all, how much we can mitigate the impact of it through our behaviour, by maintaining social distancing, by adhering to containment rules etc., is the challenge," Agarwal said, adding that instead of looking at a possible wave, more focus should be on immediate local-level action. "If we see Covid-19 cases are increasing at any particular area, we should be able to contain the spread of the infection by imposing immediate restrictions," the secretary said."Instead of saying X study told this, Y study told this, what is critical is containing the infection whenever there is any surge in any part of the country," Agarwal said.Though the Covid-19 situation has improved across the country with daily Covid-19 cases falling sharply, northeast states are reporting a higher number of infections. At present, there are 73 districts in the country which are reporting more than a 10 per cent test positivity rate.Director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research Dr Balram Bhargava said, "Close watch on the test positivity rate should be maintained. This helped us during the second wave as well. The moment the case positivity rate reaches beyond 10 per cent, those places need to be investigated and contained."The threat of a third wave of Covid-19 is looming large in India as several other countries are under the grip of a resurging third wave. Respiratory infections come in waves and that is why the scientific community in India is also certain that the advent of the third wave is just a matter of time. While a Reuters poll predicted that the third wave of the pandemic will come by October, SBI Research has claimed that the cases will start rising by August. However, the impact of the third wave will be lesser as many Indians will be protected by vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-challenge-govt-reacts-to-sbi-s-august-prediction-of-covid-19-3rd-wave-101625639956144.html

Swamy’s last visited the village in December 2019. His family said they wanted him to return home permanently or live in one of the nearby guest houses for Jesuit priests considering his old age and ill-health. They were scared about his safety amid arrests of human rights activists. “But, he (Swamy) was fearless,” said the activist’s grandnephew Benito Prabhu, who was the last family member to meet Swamy in February 2020.Swamy, who worked for tribal rights in Jharkhand for five decades, was awaiting trial when he died in a Mumbai hospital on Monday. He was 84. Swamy was shifted to a private hospital in Mumbai in May after his health started deteriorating. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where he tested positive for Covid-19 on May 30. On Sunday, he developed breathing difficulties and was put on a ventilator before he died.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Swamy under an anti-terror law in October 2020 for allegedly conspiring to foment violence at Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018. The village was rocked by caste clashes during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war by Dalits.Prabhu said Swamy told him as long as he is alive, he will continue to fight. “He also did tell me that the authorities were somehow trying to frame him after police raided his house in Ranchi in 2018.” Prabhu said during Swamy’s last trip to the village in December 2019, the activist told him he was neither connected to the case nor linked with the 15 activists arrested for allegedly fomenting the violence including Sudha Bharadwaj. “He met Bharadwaj once,” said Prabhu.The family hoped Swamy would get bail after his arrest given his health condition. “As far back as I can remember, he had Parkinson’s disease,” said Prabhu. “He could only drink with his sipper or with someone’s help by using a straw in a tumbler. He struggled a lot while eating...”In November, Swamy, who also suffered several other ailments, asked NIA to provide him with a sipper and straw, saying he cannot hold a glass as his hands are unsteady due to Parkinson’s. The NIA asked for four weeks to respond to the request.Prabhu said they learnt about Swamy’s passing on TV before receiving official confirmation. Relatives and villagers have been thronging his ancestral home since the news of his death broke. Not many knew of Swamy’s family. “Even my friends and colleagues have been posting on Twitter that he has no family,” said Prabhu.Many in his villager did not know much about a quiet Swamy until his arrest. After graduating from a Trichy college, Swamy left India to complete his study to become a priest in the Philippines. He returned to India in 1971 and the villagers welcomed him in a procession as per the custom for new priests.Born on April 26, 1937, Swamy had five other siblings, two of whom have also died. He lost his father at a very young age. Swamy’s older brother, TPL Irudayaswamy, 89, looked after the family as he took up farming after their father’s death. “He (Swamy) was self-reliant and reserved since he was a child,” said Irudayaswamy. “He spoke very less. He was devoted to the church and his studies. Later, he was completely devoted to the struggles of the tribals. He felt so much pain for them...,” said Irudayaswamy, who lives in their ancestral house built in 1890 with his wife, their children, and grandchildren.The family said wherever Swamy spoke, at the local church during mass or at family gatherings, he only spoke of tribals to whom he had dedicated his life’s work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swamy-family-remembers-him-as-fearless-man-dedicated-to-tribal-rights-101625639659490.html

07-07-2021||India||Study links Ayurvedic herb Giloy to liver disease, Centre calls it 'misleading'||The Union ministry of Ayush, tasked with the purpose of researching indigenous alternative medicine systems in India, on Wednesday took note of a media report linking the Gilroy herb to liver damage and debunked it as "completely misleading". This comes after several media publications published a study which said patients who took ayurvedic medications -- especially the herbal immunity booster imbued with Giloy (Tinospora Cordifolia) -- reported liver injuries last year.The study was published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, a peer-reviewed journal of the Indian National Association for the study of the liver. It mentioned that the use of the herb Tinospora Cordifolia (TC), commonly known as Giloy or Guduchi, resulted in liver failure in six patients in Mumbai.Debunking the study as "completely misleading", the central government on Wednesday said that its authors "failed in placing all needful details of the cases in a systematic format." Relating Giloy or TC to liver damage, the government said, would be "misleading" and "disastrous" indigenous medicinal system of India. Pointing out that the herb Guduchi or Giloy has been used in Ayurveda for a long time, the Union ministry of Ayush said that the efficacy of TC in managing various disorders is "well-established".The Ayush ministry in India deals with seven traditional medicinal systems in India, marked in its moniker 'AYUSH' - Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy. The ministry said that it went through the aforementioned study and found out that the authors of the study had not analysed the contents of the herb that was consumed by the patients. It would have been better, the ministry said in an official release, if the authors had consulted the opinion of a botanist or Ayurveda expert before penning the study. This is because the accountability lies with the authors to ascertain that the herb consumed by the patients is TC and not any other herb, it said."In fact, there are many studies that point out that identifying the herb not correctly could lead to wrong results. A similar-looking herb Tinospora Crispa might have a negative effect on the liver. So, before labeling a herb such as Giloy, with such toxic nature, the authors should have tried to correctly identify the plants, following the standard guidelines, which they did not," the ministry said.The Ayush ministry also pointed out several other "flaws" in the study. Neither does the study make it clear what dosage the patients had taken, nor does it shed any light on whether they took this herb with other medicines. All of these could theoretically lead to medical complications due to a wrong dosage and not for some inherent fault of the herb, the ministry indicated. The study did not take into account the past or present medical records of the patients as well, it said, adding that such publications based on "incomplete information" will open only serve to defame and misinform the public regarding the "age-old practice" of Ayurveda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-links-ayurvedic-herb-giloy-to-liver-disease-centre-calls-it-misleading-101625634527007.html
07-07-2021||India||Explained: What is avascular necrosis or bone death, a new post-Covid complication?||Many patients recovering from Covid-19 have complained of joint pain which has started worrying doctors that this bone death, medically known as avascular necrosis, could be another devastating post-covid complication like mucormycosis. There has been no government data regarding this as an emerging trend, but hospitals in Mumbai and Delhi have confirmed such cases.What is bone death or avascular necrosis?As suggested by the name, this condition denotes the death of the bone tissue due to lack of blood supply. If there is a dislocated joint or a broken bone, it can interrupt the blood flow.Watch: Senior doctor explains new post-Covid complicationWhat is the cause of bone death?According to doctors the overuse of steroids during the treatment of Covid-19 is the suspect behind this unnatural bone damage. Steroidsmmake bones soft and then cartilage reduced blood supply. While avascular necrosis might have many reasons, the cases being reported now are induced by steroids.SymptomsPersistent hip pain, joint pain.When can it happen?It will not happen immediately, as doctors have said. It may take 3 months to one year time. But if you have not been treated with steroids during your Covid-19 treatment, then you may not have any reason to worry. Also, a very high dose of steroids may lead to this malfunction.TreatmentMedical treatment for three to six weeks is recommended. If the pain persists, then patients are advised to undergo an MRI which will detect whether it is a case of bone death or not. Surgery is required at a very advanced stage, doctors have said.Dr Ishwar Bohra, Senior consultant, Joint replacement Surgeon, Centre for orthopaedics, BLK institute for Bone, joint replacement told ANI, "Bone death is not new, but now is being seen as a post-Covid-19 effect. Like other post-Covid sufferings, recently we are seeing in the bone and joint segment avascular necrosis of the femoral head because lots of steroids use in the Covid treatment. The hip and shoulder are the areas which should not be ignored, if there is pain."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-what-is-avascular-necrosis-or-bone-death-a-new-post-covid-complication-101625635599078.html

A day after the occasion, the Dalai Lama thanked all those who extended their wishes.Among the people who sent Dalai Lama their greetings on the occasion was US House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Secretary of State Antony Blinken.In a video message on Twitter, Pelosi said, "It is an honor to join the Tibetan people and so many friends of Tibet to send warm birthday wishes to His Holiness The Dalai Lama." She also recommitted to the cause of Tibet freedom on behalf of the United States. "It is an opportunity for all people to recommit to ensuring the Tibetan people can practice their religion, speak their language and celebrate their culture freely without interference or intimidation from Beijing. May his birthday bring happiness, health and security to all," Pelosi said.Blinken wrote the Dalai Lama "inspires us all to live each day with humility, compassion, and understanding. Here’s to many more years," in his wishes on Twitter.Ned Price, the official spokesperson of the US State Department, also joined Tibetans to wish the Dalai Lama and wrote, "His messages of peace, equality, and compassion serve as an inspiration to us all."In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his greetings as he spoke on the call with the Dalai Lama. He wished him a long and healthy life. Various Union ministers and chief ministers including Pema Khandu (Arunachal Pradesh), Prem Singh Tamang (Sikkim) and Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi) also sent their greetings.The festivities for the 14th Dalai Lama's birthday had to be curtailed due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

07-07-2021||India||Jaishankar leaves for Russia via Tehran, agenda is Taliban in Afghanistan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will reshuffle his Cabinet today but it is business as usual for the government with External Affairs Minister (EAS Jaishankar leaving for a bilateral visit to Moscow via Tehran with developments in Afghanistan top of the agenda. The EAM will be making a fuel stop in Iran on the sidelines of which there could be an official meeting with the government in Tehran.According to sources based in Moscow, the EAM will be holding a bilateral meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to cement ties as well as prepare for President Vladimir Putin’s forthcoming visit to India for the annual summit. While the EAM will have a first hand account of the Biden-Putin June 16 meeting in Geneva, the topic of concern will be the rise of Taliban in Afghanistan and its impact on the Indian sub-continent and volatile Central Asia. The EAM will also be co-chairing a joint commission meeting with Russian Deputy PM to deepen economic cooperation.The EAM, who returned from the G-20 foreign ministers meeting in Italy on July 2, found India’s G-20 partners keenly interested in economic recovery of the country post second wave of Covid-19. They, however, were confident that India will be able to overcome the pandemic through rapid vaccination of the masses. Fact is that EAM Jaishankar found the mood of G-20 partners towards India under Modi was far more positive than the doomsday predictors within the country.The G-20 ministerial was preceded by the EAM paying a bilateral visit to Greece, which has always supported India in the UN and has been a close ally. Jaishankar’s visit coincided with bilateral naval exercises in Mediterranean between Indian and Greek Navy. While Jaishankar made it a point to visit Greece for its support, there was a subtle message for Turkey from India that the two can play. Turkey under Erdogan has joined hands with Pakistan by conjuring up past memories of Ottoman revival and has taken position against India.The EAM’s visit to Moscow will also be constructive as India and Russia are both for stabilisation of Afghanistan, after the withdrawal of US-NATO forces. While the Taliban have launched an offensive against Ashraf Ghani government in Kabul, India will neither evacuate its citizens or its diplomats from the country which is hurtling towards civil war. Moscow too is concerned about the rise of Taliban as it directly impacts the security of Central Asia and beyond. This is one area where even Tehran is on the same page as rise in Taliban atrocities could mean a flood of Afghan refugees in Zahedan region of Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-leaves-for-russia-via-tehran-agenda-is-taliban-in-afghanistan-101625633349076.html

According to Malaysian health ministry, it has spread to 30 countries so far, including the UK.The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated lambda as 'variant of interest'.Six cases of Lambda have been identified in the UK till date, and all have been linked to overseas travel. The earliest documented sample was reported in Peru.Tracking coronavirus variantsAccording to WHO, the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has changed over time. Some of these changes impact the virus' properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines and therapeutic medicines, the global health body said.WHO has formed a network of health experts across the world to monitor and assess the evolution of Sars-CoV-2. Significant amino acid substitutions are identified and countries informed about changes that may be needed to respond to the variant to prevent its spread.The lambda variantThe strain was first identified in Peru in December last year. Lambda is the dominant variant in the South American country with 81 per cent samples found to be carrying it.The lambda variant is usually associated with higher transmissibility and resistance to antibodies, but health experts have said that more data is needed to firmly establish this fact.In case of vaccines too, an early study in Peru claim that the lambda variant is able to easily escape the antibodies generated by CoronaVac vaccine developed by China. However, the study is yet to be peer reviewed.Lambda was designated as "variant of interest" by the WHO on June 14.Is lambda the only variant of interest?No. The WHO website has also listed Eta (B.1.525), Iota (B.1.526) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) as other variants of interest.Despite emerging in South America and spreading across 30 countries, lambda has not been declared a variant of interest by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lambda-variant-all-you-need-to-know-about-fast-spreading-strain-101625633364773.html

It is necessary to increase coverage of Covid-19 vaccines, regardless of the type of vaccines, to reduce mortality in current as well as future waves of Covid-19 epidemic,” said researchers in the study paper.Tamil Nadu Police department has been documenting vaccination of its members, and Covid-19 deaths during the second wave along with details of the date of hospitalization and vaccination.Also Read | Centre to review Covid-19 situation in meet with northeast states todayThe data was used to estimate the incidence of deaths due to Covid-19 among vaccinated and unvaccinated police personnel for the study. The incidence of mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals was compared to calculate the relative risk of mortality associated with Covid-19 vaccination, according to the study.There are 117,524 police personnel working with department of police in Tamil Nadu. Between February 1 and May 14 this year, 32,792 received one dose, 67,673 received two doses while 17,059 did not receive any Covid-19 vaccine doses.The study finds that 31 Covid-19 deaths were reported among these police personnel between April 13 and May 14, of which four had taken two doses of the vaccine, seven had taken one dose and the rest 20 were unvaccinated.The incidence of Covid-19 deaths among the vaccinated with zero, one and two doses was 1.17, 0.21 and 0.06 per 1,000 police personnel respectively.Compared to unvaccinated individuals, the relative risk of death due to Covid-19 among those receiving one and two doses was 0.18 and 0.05 respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing deaths with one and two doses was 82% and 95% respectively.The Centre also released data of a similar study done by PGI Chandigarh on protection that vaccines have provided in vaccinated police personnel in Punjab.“It was a simple study that showed in 4,868 police personnel when no vaccine dose was given, 15 deaths took place, and incidence was three per 1,000. In 35,856 police personnel, who took one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, there were nine deaths, and incidence was 0.25 per 1,000. About 42,720 police personnel who took two vaccine doses, two deaths happened and the incidence was 0.05 per 1000,”said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during the health ministry briefing on Covid updates on July 2.“Vaccine protection from death due to Covid-19, when we do the math, comes to about 92% after one dose, and 98% in those who took two doses. Therefore, it is clearly shown that progression to severe disease is reduced, and serious disease gets almost eliminated and risk of death is also significantly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-doses-of-vaccine-give-95-protection-against-covid-death-icmr-study-101625628257936.html

"From tomorrow, Germany is removing the entry ban and easing travel rules for five countries where Delta variant is widespread, including India," Lindner said in his tweet.The changes were done after Germany reclassified India as "high-incidence areas," downgraded from the 'virus variant countries' listing.India saw an explosion in daily Covid-19 cases as it battled the second Covid-19 wave in April-May.

07-07-2021||India||Lessons from Uttarakhand crisis? Bengal set to revive legislative council||The West Bengal assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution supporting an ad hoc committee report that favoured creation of a legislative council. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has slammed the move calling it "backdoor politics" to help party leaders get elected as lawmakers despite having lost the assembly polls.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee lost the recently-held assembly election against Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram and has to get elected to the state legislature in order to retain the post.The development in being viewed as a bid by the Bengal government to prevent an Uttarakhand like situation in the state where Tirath Singh Rawat had to resign as chief minister, according to Hindustan Times' sister publication Live Hindustan.Banerjee has six months to get elected. She lost by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes in Nandigram and is likely to contest the by-election from Bhowanipore. But there are concerns that the Election Commission may refuse to hold the by-election due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation, according to Live Hindustan. It had deferred the by-polls after the April-May elections in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Puducherry.Meanwhile, the resolution on creation of a legislative council in West Bengal was moved by state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee under Rule 169 of the Procedures of Conduct of Business of the House. Voting was duly held, with 196 of the 265 members present in the house supporting the council's creation and 69 opposing it.Opposing the move, the BJP argued that the move would put pressure on the state exchequer. "Most of the states either don't have an upper house or have already abolished it. The real reason behind the TMC planning is to ensure backdoor entry for those leaders who failed to win assembly elections," leader of the opposition in West Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari was quoted as saying by news agency PTI."The state, on the one hand, is saying it doesn't have funds, but the creation of this Legislative council will put additional pressure of ₹90-100 crores every year," he further said.Adhikari added that the the resolution won't be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha where the BJP has the majority.Opposing the resolution, lone Indian Secular Front (ISF) MLA Naushad Siddiqui also echoed similar sentiments citing "pressure" on the exchequer of the state.West Bengal Legislative Council was set up in 1952 and abolished in 1969 during the time of the United Front government.The resolution would need a nod from the Governor, and after that, a bill has to be passed in Parliament. If passed, the bill will be sent for President's assent so that a Legislative Council can be created. Presently, six states - Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar - have a Legislative Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lessons-from-uttarakhand-crisis-bengal-set-to-revive-legislative-council-101625623730582.html

The Union ministry of home affairs called a virtual meeting on Wednesday, according to officials familiar with the development, where home secretary Ajay Bhalla will be discussing the Covid-19 situation with officials from Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, and Manipur.Responsible for more than 62% of the country's 77 districts with high Covid-19 case positivity rates, the northeast region is now at the focus of the central government's attempts to tackle the coronavirus disease pandemic. Central teams, based on whose assessment the government will suggest remedial measures, were earlier sent to those states showing an increasing trend in infection. The two-member high-level team to these states consisted of a clinician and a public health expert.The teams were dispatched to six states on an immediate basis. They were expected to monitor the overall implementation of Covid-19 management, especially in testing, surveillance, and containment operations. Among these six states were Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, and Manipur -- all of which have shown a recent uptick in coronavirus cases.It is likely that the home ministry meet today will focus on the assessment conducted by these central teams and suggest remedial measures for the issues in pandemic management that the states are facing -- especially in the availability of hospital beds, ambulances, ventilators, and medical oxygen, as well as Covid-19 vaccination progress.As an ongoing effort to strengthen the efforts of various state governments in dealing with Covid-19 cases, the central government has in the past deputed control teams from time to time to visit various states and Union territories. These teams interact with the local authorities and get a "first-hand understanding" of the challenges and issues being faced by the administration, said an official release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-review-covid-19-situation-in-meet-with-northeast-states-today-101625620355665.html

07-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle expected today: Probable names and other developments||The Narendra Modi government is expected to reshuffle the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, bringing in some fresh faces and accommodating allies of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The swearing-in ceremony of new ministers may take place at 6pm today.Speculation about a cabinet reshuffle was triggered by meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda on Tuesday.Also Watch: What will new Team Modi look like after cabinet reshuffle?A clutch of BJP leaders and allies flew to Delhi, giving a hint about their possible inclusion in the cabinet. Among these leaders are Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane.Scindia, who left Congress and joined the BJP in March last year, was seen offering prayers at Ujjain's famous Mahakal temple before leaving for Delhi.Among the allies, the Janata Dal (United), Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Apna Dal are expected to find a place in the Union Cabinet. Though Bihar chief minister and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar is mum on number of berths his party will get, there are reports that JD(U) chief RCP Singh is headed to Delhi. LJP leader Chirag Paswan, who is fighting his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras over the control of the party, has said that he will move court if the latter is accommodated.The exercise was set in motion with the appointment of four new governors and shifting of four others on Tuesday. This will be the first overhaul of the cabinet since the Modi government came to power in 2019.The reshuffle is being done with an eye on next year's assembly polls in various states; the BJP also wants to shrug off the image that it is not being able to work with the allies. PM Modi held several meetings in the past few weeks with his ministers and chief ministers of poll-bound states like Uttar Pradesh's Yogi Adityanath.The Modi government currently has 53 ministers and its strength can go up to 81, or 15% of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha, which stands at 545.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-reshuffle-expected-today-probable-names-and-other-developments-101625616948476.html
07-07-2021||India||Centre to restore dearness allowance benefit for govt employees? Decision likely soon||Amid talks of a likely cabinet expansion of the Narendra Modi-led central government, a major decision regarding the Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) benefits of government employees as per the seventh pay commission guidelines may also be on its way soon, said officials familiar with the development. The Union cabinet meeting slated for 11am on Wednesday was expected to take the final call on restoring the DA and the DR benefits for central government employees and pensioners, respectively, reports indicated. However, the meeting was later cancelled by the government.Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) and Cabinet meetings that were scheduled today have been cancelled, the central government informed early on Wednesday morning. No written agenda was, however, set for the cabinet meeting, which was to be conducted virtually, via video-conferencing.Earlier, the administration had decided to restore the DA benefits for the central government employees and DR benefits for the central government pensioners following a meeting between the Union ministry of finance and the department of personnel and training (DoPT) on June 26. It was said that the DA and the DR benefits of the central government employees and pensioners, respectively, will be restored from September later this year. However, it was also said that the final call regarding the matter will reserve with the Union cabinet, which might make a decision soon in this regard in its next meeting.The Congress party, in the meanwhile, has urged the central government to hasten up its decision-making process and immediately restore the DA and the DR benefits. The grand old party has even accused the Modi government of being unfair towards government employees and pensioners, including armed forces personnel, regarding the payment of their due DA and DR benefits. Rahul Gandhi alleged that the government took to "looting" ₹37,500 crore from soldiers, government employees, and pensioners, adding that it is a "crime" amid such times of decreasing salaries and rising inflation.The dearness allowance benefits of the central government employees and the additional installment of the dearness relief benefits for central government pensioners were withheld by the finance ministry last year in January in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation in the country. However, now that the second wave of the pandemic is gradually receding, it is believed that the government may make the major decision to restore the DA and the DR benefits soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-restore-dearness-allowance-da-benefit-for-govt-employees-decision-likely-today-101625615140548.html
07-07-2021||India||Centre begins big reshuffle with Governors||The President named four new governors, including one of the NDA’s senior-most ministers Thaawarchand Gehlot, and shifted four others on Tuesday amid speculation of an imminent Cabinet reshuffle, setting in motion the Union government’s first major overhaul since it returned to power two years ago.The appointments came as senior leaders of the Bharatya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies flew into the Capital ahead of a possible Cabinet reshuffle, the first since Narendra Modi swept back to power with an increased majority in 2019.A Cabinet meeting is likely to be held at 11am on Wednesday and the swearing-in ceremony of new ministers may take place at 6pm, said people aware of developments.President Ram Nath Kovind appointed Union social justice minister Gehlot as the governor of Karnataka, former Gujarat minister Mangubhai Chhaganbhai Patel as the governor of Madhya Pradesh, BJP MP Hari Babu Kambhampati as the governor of Mizoram, and former Goa minister Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar as the governor of Himachal Pradesh.Also read: Cabinet expansion buzz as key leaders arrive in CapitalA communiqué from Rashtrapati Bhavan also said that Mizoram governor PS Sreedharan Pillai was transferred to Goa, Haryana governor Satyadev Narayan Arya to Tripura, Tripura governor Ramesh Bais to Jharkhand, and Himachal Pradesh governor Bandaru Dattatraya to Haryana.“The above appointments will take effect from the dates they assume charge of their respective offices,” said the statement from Rashtrapati Bhavan.Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala, and Jharkhand governor Draupadi Murmu were not given new roles.The changes indicated that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government was set to enter a new phase in its second stint, said people aware of developments, hinting that more restructuring may be seen in the party organisation and parliamentary board ahead of high-stakes election in five states next year.The much-anticipated reshuffle is also expected to see more allies being accommodated in the NDA government; currently, only the Republican Party of India is, and the BJP is keen to shrug of the image of not being able to work with allies. The parliamentary board has five vacancies with the exit of Gehlot.The Narendra Modi government currently has 21 Cabinet ministers, nine ministers of state with independent charge and 23 ministers of state.It can accommodate a total of 81 members in the council of ministers, which cannot exceed 15% of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha, which stands at 545.Currently, four ministers hold additional charges of five ministries.After the NDA returned to power in 2019 with 324 seats, the Prime Minister appointed 53 ministers from the BJP and four from allies, including Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Ramvilas Paswan and Anant Geete.But over the last two years, at least four positions in the council of ministers fell vacant due to the exit of the Shiv Sena and Akali Dal, the demise of ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Suresh Angadi, and now the appointment of Gehlot as governor.Gehlot, 73, was the government’s top Dalit leader and held the social justice portfolio since the NDA came to power in 2014. Gehlot’s elevation also means that the BJP will have to name a new leader in the Rajya Sabha.Observers underlined that Gehlot’s new role could possibly see him as a candidate for the Vice President’s election next year.Gehlot’s move to the Karnataka Raj Bhavan also created the fifth vacancy in the BJP’s highest decision-making body, the parliamentary board.Currently, the seats earlier filled by former Union ministers Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Ananth Kumar lie vacant. One other vacancy arose when M Venkaiah Naidu became the Vice President in 2017.Speculation about a cabinet reshuffle was first triggered by meetings between Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda on Tuesday.Prominent among leaders who flew into the Capital on Tuesday were Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane.Also read: Cabinet reshuffle soon. Sonowal, Rane may get berthsScindia was seen offering prayers at Ujjain’s famous Mahakal temple on Tuesday morning.“I was on a visit to Ujjain. After completing my visit here, I’m going to Delhi,” he told reporters.Janata Dal (United) leaders RCP Singh was also on his way to Delhi, said people aware of developments. The JD(U) didn’t find a place in the Cabinet in 2019.Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Pashupati Paras, brother of late Ram Vilas Paswan who is currently fighting over the control of the party with his nephew Chirag Paswan, is expected to find a place in the Cabinet.The newly appointed governors said they were looking forward to the responsibility.“President Kovind and PM Modi have shown faith in me and have appointed me as the Karnataka governor. I will live up to their expectation and do my job faithfully. I will try to resolve the issues within constitutional limits and with discussions,” Gehlot told news agency ANI.The Karnataka government has been roiled by infighting in recent weeks with many BJP leaders calling for the resignation of chief minister BS Yediyurappa. There have been reports that a change in the state’s leadership may be imminent, with one of Yediyurappa’s sons being accommodated at the Centre.Patel said he will try his best to fulfil his new role. “The BJP is a party which believes in taking along all communities. I thank President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and other leaders for giving me this new responsibility,” Patel told reporters at his residence in Navsari.Arlekar said that Prime Minister Modi informed him about the new responsibility on Monday. “On Tuesday, I was informed about my appointment as Himachal Pradesh governor by President Ram Nath Kovind. A notification has been issued,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-begins-big-reshuffle-with-governors-101625613763225.html
07-07-2021||India||PDP says it won’t meet Jammu-Kashmir delimitation panel||The Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) declined to meet the Delimitation Commission on Tuesday, even as leaders of other mainstream political parties in Kashmir met the members of the Centre’s panel hours after they arrived in Srinagar for a four-day tour.The commission – led by justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai – is in Jammu & Kashmir to interact with political parties and officials for “first hand” inputs on an exercise to carve out new constituencies in the Union Territory.The PDP said it decided to stay away from the exercise as it felt that the outcome of the process was already decided, aimed to take the power away from the people of J&K, and to realise the “political vision of a particular party”.Several parties, including the National Conference (NC), the People’s Conference (PC), the Congress, and the CPI(M) submitted separate memorandums to the visiting delegation, and urged it to allay apprehensions over the exercise by conducting it in a free and fair manner.“On the day PDP chose not to meet Delimitation Commission, ED sent a summon to my mother to appear in person for unknown charges. In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores,” Mufti tweeted on Tuesday. Her remarks came hours the Enforcement Directorate served a notice on Mufti’s mother, Gulshan Nazeer, asking her to appear at the agency’s office on July 14 in connection with a money laundering case.At a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the national capital on June 24, J&K leaders were told that elections could not precede the delimitation exercise as the 2019 Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act laid down the condition of carving out new constituencies for the polls.Besides leaders of political parties, the commission will hold talks with district officials and other stakeholders on the ongoing process of carving out the new constituencies. The leaders of CPI, Panthers Party, Bharatiya Janata Party, Apni Party and Bhajun Samaj Party also met the Delimitation Commission on Tuesday.Former Supreme Court judge Desai heads the commission that was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of J&K, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. The commission has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise. It will also carve constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the first time in Jammu & Kashmir.The commission arrived in Srinagar a day after the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a grouping of political major parties such as the NC and the PDP, said it was disappointed over the outcome of the all-party meeting with the Prime Minister.The alliance demanded the restoration of the region’s statehood before elections were held there. It also criticised the lack of “confidence-building measures”. The Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state as it effectively nullified Article 370 in August, 2019.A five-member NC delegation that met the commission told it that the exercise should have been done after the assembly elections, and termed it as an “unconstitutional exercise” based on the Reorganisation Act, which has been challenged in the Supreme Court.“We told them the entire Reorganisational Act is unconstitutional that has been already challenged in the Supreme Court. We also told them that people in J&K have lost faith on institutions so this should be done on transparent basis as people have lot of apprehensions and the craving out of the new constituencies should be done on the basis of population and nothing else,” said NC provisional president Nasir Aslam Wani, who was part of the delegation.The BJP delegation held a 30-minute interaction with the commission. “We told them the delimitation of assembly segments should be done on merit and due to huge population of Schedule Tribes, 9 to 10 assembly segments should be kept reserved for them. Also, we told them the previous delimitation had helped few political families of J&K which shouldn’t happen this time and villages of one district shouldn’t be put in another district during the process of redrawing the boundaries,” Sofi Yusuf, who led the delegation, said.On Wednesday, the commission will visit Pahalgam to hold meetings with officials and delegations from four districts of South Kashmir – Anantnag, Pulwama, Kulgam, and Shopian. In Srinagar, the panel will hold meetings related to Srinagar, Budgam, Ganderbal, Bandipore, Baramulla, and Kupwara districts.The commission will later travel to Kishtwar to hold discussions with officials of the Doda, Kishtwar, and Ramban districts. On July 9, the commission will meet delegations from Jammu, Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Udhampur, Samba and Reasi districts.Jammu & Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who led the Congress delegation, said that they asked the Delimitation Commission about their plan on redrawing of boundaries for creating new assembly segments. “The commission members told us that the process will be transparent based on the suggestions of different political parties. However, our view is that the process should have been done in 2026 along with the entire country with a new Census.”Peoples Conference spokesperson Adnan Ashraf said the party’s delegation told the commission that there were rumours that the aim of the delimitation exercise was to take away the power of the people in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-says-it-won-t-meet-jammu-kashmir-delimitation-panel-101625613336259.html
07-07-2021||India||Arctic sea ice loss triggering extreme Sept rains in India: Study||Summer sea ice loss in the Kara Sea region of the Arctic may be triggering extreme monsoon rainfall events in central India in the month of September, a new paper has suggested.The research, led by the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research under the ministry of earth sciences, has found that the frequency of extreme rainfall events (daily rainfall >150 mm) in central India in September displayed a consistently increasing trend with declining summer sea ice extent during the Early Twentieth Century Warming (ETCW, 1920–1940) period and recent warming since the 1980s.The trend was found to be stronger in the recent warming period after the 1980s, the paper, ‘A possible relation between Arctic sea ice and late season Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall extremes’, said.Since the beginning of the satellite records in 1979, the Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) has been declining at a rate of about 4.4% per decade in annual mean, the paper published in the journal Nature on June 22 said.While it is still unclear if this rapid sea ice decline can influence extreme weather events in the tropics, or the extreme rainfall events during monsoon in India, scientists from NCPOR have proposed that it may be causing a high-pressure area over Northwest Europe. The scientists have found that extreme rainfall events in late monsoon can be induced by the sea ice decline.The authors said that the upper level atmospheric circulation changes due to Arctic sea ice loss and very warm sea surface temperatures over the Arabian Sea could together contribute to increase in extreme monsoon rain in central India, particularly in the month of September.“As the sea ice reduces in the Barents-Kara Sea region of the Arctic Ocean, it allows more convection and upward air motion over the open ocean during summer. This air then descends at a further south location over northwest Europe and intensifies a deep anticyclonic atmospheric circulation. The associated meandering of the jet stream also contributes to it. This abnormal upper atmospheric disturbance is then further propagated towards subtropical Asia extending over the Indian landmass. The upper-level atmospheric circulation change along with an above-normal Arabian Sea surface temperature help in enhanced convection and moisture supply - resulting in extreme rainfall events during August-September,” said Sourav Chatterjee, lead author from NCPOR.In 2015, a paper by meteorologist TN Krishnamurti of Florida State University, proposed that the heat released in the atmosphere during extreme rainfall events over northwest India ultimately travels to the Canadian Arctic region causing significant sea ice loss in the Arctic.The effects of Arctic Sea ice changes on the mid-latitudes are still debated but it is often proposed that increase in mid-latitude extreme weather events is associated with Arctic Amplification induced loss in sea ice. Over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at twice the rate as the entire globe — this phenomenon is known as Arctic Amplification, according to the US’s National Snow and Ice Data Center.“We started by looking at over 100 years of observational records of summer monsoon rainfall and sea ice in the Arctic. During the two episodes of rapid sea ice decline in the Arctic Ocean (1920-1940 and 1980-present) the frequency of extreme rainfall events consistently increase. This motivated us to look at the relationship between extreme rainfall and sea ice in the Arctic. Earlier studies had shown the potential mid-latitude influences on the monsoon. We further investigated the possible impact of sea ice loss in this mid-latitude influence on the monsoon extremes,” Chatterjee said, underlining that impacts of such atmospheric circulation changes are most prominent over the west and central India, and parts of the west coast.“In summary, our results indicate since the 1980s, rapidly declining summer sea ice extent in the Kara Sea region exhibits a more robust relationship with the frequency of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall extremes, compared to mean ISMR intensity; extreme precipitation events in central India during the late phase of ISMR season can be explained by the combined effect of the upper atmospheric circulation anomalies resulting from reduced sea ice extent and low-level circulation anomalies over west-central India supported by warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the north-western Arabian Sea,” the paper said.“Changes in sea-ice extent in the Arctic influences large-scale atmospheric patterns, and it is possible that there is an impact on the monsoon too. While the causative mechanisms are not that clear, there is one factor that is definitive—the extreme rainfall events during the monsoon have increased three-fold in the recent decades. Since these extreme rains happen over a short spell of a few hours to few days over a large area, chances of floods are high—which means that we need to work on flood warning systems across the country,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, India Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). Roxy’s paper published in Nature journal in 2017 concluded that there was a threefold rise in extreme rain along the west coast and central India during 1950 to 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arctic-sea-ice-loss-triggering-extreme-sept-rains-in-india-study-101625612783763.html
07-07-2021||India||CBSE may allow its schools to adopt other boards too||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is considering allowing affiliated schools to also be affiliated with other boards of education in the same campus, in an attempt to benefit students as well as schools, officials familiar with the matter said.Under the current by-laws of CBSE, schools affiliated with it cannot have any other affiliations in the same campus.If implemented, this means CBSE schools will be able to offer more options to students. The Council for The Indian School Certificate Examiniations or CISCE already allows this, with some popular CISCE affiliated schools offering popular IB (International Baccalaureate) or the International General Certificate of Secondary Education options.A proposal to the effect was presented during a meeting held on June 30, the officials cited in the first instance said on condition of anonymity. One official who attended the meeting, said: “It has been proposed that the schools will have to take a no-objection certificate from CBSE for obtaining the affiliation from other education boards in addition to their existing affiliation with CBSE.”Another official, who also attended the meeting, added: “If implemented, separate faculty for teaching students from different boards will be arranged by the schools. The management and the principal can be common for the students enrolled under multiple boards.”CBSE is yet to release any official notification in this regard.According to CBSE affiliation by-laws 2018, a school affiliated with the board “is not allowed to have dual affiliation” i.e simultaneous affiliation with two boards “with the same set of infrastructure and land”. This effectively rules out doing this on the same campus -- and schools that wish to do so need to invest in a completely different campus.The principals of several CBSE schools in Delhi said that having dual affiliation would be an “advantage”. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said: “With two education boards allowed in one school, students and staff can benefit from shared learnings, collaborative practices, and professional development. Also, it will create more opportunities and options for students and parents. Schools and stakeholders will ultimately benefit from knowledge and innovation spillover.”Terming the idea of having multiple boards “exciting”, Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said: “However, it is yet to see how practical it would be for a school to have multiple boards. If the staff, students, and administration would be able to adjust… But it will help students who switch between the boards after class 10. They will not have to change their school if it offers more than one board.”The move may be crucial for public schools in the Capital since the Delhi government is soon going to launch its own education board. However, several principals of government schools said it may also create confusion. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, school head of the Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini’s Sector 8, said: “It will definitely give more opportunities to students but managing it will be a big challenge for schools.”CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi did not respond to requests for comment.A senior CBSE official who asked not to be named, said the idea was floated after requests from schools across the country. “We are yet to discuss several aspects and all the pros and cons before implementing this. The discussion around it has been started,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-may-allow-its-schools-to-adopt-other-boards-too-101625609462479.html
07-07-2021||India||Inoculate inmates with mental illness first: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Union government to consider vaccinating mental health establishment inmates against Covid-19 on priority, stressing how vulnerable this section of the population was because it could neither visit a hospital nor be transported to a medical facility.The bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah told the Centre to chalk out a plan for all states and Union territories to ensure all persons institutionalised in mental health establishments are vaccinated. “Vaccination drive (for Covid-19) must extend to inmates of all mental health establishments as they cannot go to hospitals or be transported. Else, there will be large number of deaths in these institutions,” the bench said.The court directed the department of social justice to take up this concern immediately with the ministry of health and family welfare so that “suitable instructions are given, and a plan is chalked out” to enable vaccination of all inmates of mental health establishments across the country.The order came on a contempt petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, pointing to the death of three inmates at a Maharashtra mental health facility and the urgent need of vaccinating the inmates. He also requested that the plan to be chalked out by the Centre should cover testing, tracing and vaccinating the inmates. There are roughly 13,000 inmates in 43 state-run mental health asylums and hospitals, Bansal said, adding that the number of such patients in private establishments is not known.On the death of three inmates, Bansal pointed out that it was due to a “blunder” by Maharashtra government to shift the mental asylum inmates, who had recovered, to beggar homes and old age homes (for inmates aged above 60). Maharashtra counsel Sachin Patil sought time to take instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inoculate-inmates-with-mental-illness-first-supreme-court-101625608985950.html
07-07-2021||India||Will follow any decision by Sonia Gandhi, says Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||Congress president Sonia Gandhi met with Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday to resolve the crisis facing the party in the state ahead of next year’s assembly elections. After the meeting, also attended by Congress Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge, the head of a three-member committee that looked at dissent and differences in the Punjab unit of the party, and presented the chief minister with a 18-point to-do list, Singh said they discussed the development of Punjab and “internal matters of the party” and that he would follow any decision taken by Gandhi.He also avoided commenting on Navjot Sidhu, the cricketer and TV personality who is his biggest detractor with the party, and who seemingly enjoys the patronage of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, both of whom separately met Gandhi ahead of her meeting with Singh. “I do not know anything about Sidhu,” Singh told reporters.His comments seemed to suggest that Gandhi will take a final call on what is to be done in Punjab, including on a possible position for Sidhu who is keen on becoming the chief of the local unit of the party ahead of next year’s elections, something Singh is opposed to.HT learns that an 18-point list was discussed at the hour-long meeting, and that Singh was told the party has to be united ahead of the election, and to be accessible to his party colleagues.The latest round of troubles for the CM started in April with the Punjab & Haryana high court quashing reports submitted by the Punjab Police in connection with the Kotkapura firing incidents dating back to 2015, and asking for the constitution of a new special investigation team to look into the issue. The firing, which resulted in the deaths of two people protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, is being investigated, and the new SIT has questioned then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal and his son and then home minister Sukhbir Badal in connection with the case.The chief minister’s detractors allege that he has been soft on the Badals, slow to implement the party’s poll promises, and too reliant on powerful bureaucrats.As the voices of dissent grew with some lawmakers joining the chorus, the Congress’s central leadership set up a three-member committee headed by Kharge to settle the discord. The committee met all the MLAs, Sidhu and the CM. Last week, Sidhu also met with Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.According to a person aware of developments, while the Captain’s leadership was not challenged, Gandhi told him ”to take Sidhu into confidence’.’ The party is keen that they go into polls next year with both the CM and Sidhu having made peace and exhibiting “a united face’’.It isn’t clear whether Sidhu, who has openly called Singh a “liar” and also targeted him over the power situation in the state and power supply agreements signed with private firms when the Akalis were in power, will be ready to go along.Sidhu was not available for a comment.It is also not clear whether Gandhi made any commitments to Singh on him being the party’s chief ministerial candidate in the elections. Sidhu left the BJP in 2016, almost joined the Aam Aadmi Party, then joined the Congress. Ahead of the latest controversy, the Congress seemed set to retain Punjab, although the damaging internal fight may have changed the equation now.“The Captain’s position has been deliberately undermined whereas Sidhu has been given such a long rope. The right way should have been to ask captain to take immediate actions to try to fulfill some promises like power sector reforms, employment generation. Sidhu gets unnecessary focus. AAP would not take him. So the only way for him to float his own party and then make alliances,’’ said Ashutosh Kumar, professor of political science in Panjab University.A senior Congressman seemed to think the meeting had achieved enough.“With this, we hope to have partially defused the situation,” he said.There was no official comment from the Congress Party on the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-follow-any-decision-by-sonia-gandhi-says-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-101625608013327.html
07-07-2021||India||Common exams for central govt jobs deferred over Covid-19||The first-ever common eligibility test (CET), which was to be held by the newly constituted National Recruitment Agency (NRA) by the end of this year, has been delayed due to the pandemic, Union minister for personnel, pensions, and grievances Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday.The test is to select candidates for non-gazetted posts in the central government and public sector banks, which is at present being done through separate examinations conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).“This unique initiative undertaken with the personal intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to screen and shortlist candidates for recruitment to central government jobs was scheduled to take off with the first such test before the end of this year but is likely to get delayed on account of the Covid pandemic,” Singh said at the launch of an e-book, Civil List-2021 of IAS officers. He, however, didn’t specify a date for the exam.He added that CET would bring “ease of recruitment” to young job aspirants and be a “great boon” to those who live in remote areas. “The NRA will be a multi-agency body which will conduct the common test to screen and shortlist candidates for Group B and C (non-technical) posts,” Singh said. “The most significant feature of this reform is that every district in the country will have at least one examination centre which would greatly enhance access to the candidates living in far-flung areas.”The minister also highlighted the bureaucratic reforms undertaken by the government since 2014, such as the decision to do away with the age-old practice of getting documents attested by a gazetted officer and replacing it with self-attestation and three-month central government stint as assistant secretaries for IAS officers at the beginning of their career.The government has also launched mission Karamyogi to help streamline the training and competence building of civil servants. At the apex of the scheme will be the Prime Minister’s HR Council that will consist of select Union ministers, chief ministers, international leaders, and civil servants. The council will determine the “right person for the right role” and decide assignments accordingly, the minister informed.It is a major transition for the bureaucracy, as civil servants’ training will now become a “continuous process”. A dashboard will also monitor and audit the capacity building scheme, and a report will be submitted annually to ascertain its success, the department of personnel and training had said while announcing the scheme last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/common-exams-for-central-govt-jobs-deferred-over-covid19-101625607419581.html

In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores.”Nazir, who is in her 70s, is the wife of late former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed. She has been asked to visit the ED zonal office in Srinagar on July 14 for the probe.According to news agency PTI, the case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is linked to the recovery of at least two diaries by the central agency following raids on an alleged associate of Mehbooba.The diaries contain details of some purported payments made from the chief minister’s discretionary fund in alleged contravention of rules. These funds are alleged to have been diverted during the PDP rule in the erstwhile state.A few lakh rupees from these funds are alleged to have been transferred into the accounts of Nazir and some others, officials told the news agency.Mehbooba was questioned by the central agency in March this year in connection with a separate money laundering case.The Delimitation Commission headed by Ranjana Prakash Desai, retired judge of Supreme Court, is on a four-day visit to the UT to meet political leaders and officials to chalk out new voting constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-mehbooba-mufti-s-mother-in-pmla-case-101625607292850.html
07-07-2021||India||Home secy chairs meet to review Jammu and Kashmir security||Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Tuesday held a high-level security meeting to review the security situation in the wake of the first-ever drone attack at an Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Jammu and Kashmir last month, people familiar with the development said. Tuesday’s meeting, aimed at firming up the counter-measures needed to neutralise the threat posed by small drones, or quadcopters, comes a day after the Union government sent a multi-agency team to Bengaluru for a special demonstration of the available anti-drone technology in the public and private sector, a government official said on condition of anonymity.The Union home ministry hasn’t put out a statement on Bhalla’s meeting on Tuesday, which one official said, was part of the continuing effort by the security establishment to minimise the risk posed by the use of commercially available drones.Among those who were part of Tuesday’s crucial meeting were J&K police chief Dilbag Singh, additional director general J&K police Mukesh Singh, Intelligence Bureau director Aravind Kumar and Central Industrial Security Force director general Sudhir Saxena.Initial probe into the June 27 incident, in which two drones flew over the IAF base and dropped explosives, have led security agencies to suspect the role of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. A second official familiar with the matter said the two drones came from a village in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-secy-chairs-meet-to-review-jammu-and-kashmir-security-101625605530964.html
07-07-2021||India||Centre sets up separate ministry of cooperation||The Union government created a new ministry of cooperation on Tuesday to provide a separate administrative, legal and policy framework for strengthening the cooperative movement in India.The announcement came a day before a possible cabinet expansion, the first since Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned to power in 2019 with an increased majority.“In a historic move, a separate ‘ministry of co-operation’ has been created by the Modi government for realizing the vision of ‘Sahkar se Samriddhi’…it will help deepen co-operatives as a true people based movement reaching up to the grassroots,” said a statement by the cabinet secretariat.The new ministry will work to streamline processes for ‘ease of doing business’ for cooperatives and enable development of multi-state co-operatives (MSCS), added the statement.“The central government has signaled its deep commitment to community based developmental partnership. Creation of a separate ministry for cooperation also fulfils the budget announcement made by the finance minister,” said the statement.In the past, the government has renamed several ministries to expand their work profile. In 2014, the ministry of environment was named as the ministry of environment, forests and climate change. Similarly the ambit of the ministry of animal husbandry was expanded to include fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying. Last year, the ministry of human resource development was renamed as the ministry of education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sets-up-separate-ministry-of-cooperation-101625605211458.html
07-07-2021||India||India’s Morepen Labs begin manufacturing test batches of Sputnik V||India’s pharma major Morepen Laboratories has begun manufacturing test batches of the Russian-made anti coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V in India as part of efforts to enhance its production capacity in the country, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.Morepen and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund that is marketing Sputnik V globally, announced the production of the test batch of the vaccine in an exclusive facility in the state of Himachal Pradesh.“The first batch will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center for quality control. RDIF and Morepen Laboratories signed a cooperation agreement in June 2021 and are actively implementing the technology transfer,” said Morepen Laboratories in a statement issued on Tuesday.Sputnik V was the third vaccine to be granted an emergency use authorization in India on April 12, 2021 after indigenously developed Covaxin and Covishield. US based pharma company Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine is the fourth vaccine that has been granted restricted emergency use permission in India.India is the leading production hub for Sputnik V with RDIF having signed agreements with other Indian pharmaceutical companies such as Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech for the production of the Covid-19 vaccine locally.In total, agreements with partners in India provide for production of more than 850 million doses of Sputnik V per year.“As the pandemic is yet far from over and new, more dangerous variants of coronavirus are being detected in various regions of the world, RDIF is increasing capacities for production of Sputnik V in India, one of the key hubs. Agreement with Morepen Laboratories provides for a larger amount of Sputnik V to be available both for India and our partners globally to speed up the vaccination with one of the best vaccines in the world,” said Kirill Dmitriev, ceo, RDIF, in a statement.To date, Sputnik V has been registered in 67 countries accounting for over 3.5 billion people. The data obtained by a number of regulators including in Argentina, Serbia, Bahrain, Hungary and Mexico demonstrates that Sputnik V is one of the safest and most effective vaccines against coronavirus.Sputnik V is based on the human adenoviral vectors platform, and uses two different vectors for the two shots in course of vaccination, and claims to provide immunity for longer duration than the vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots.“We are delighted to partner with RDIF for the prestigious project of Sputnik V production in India. This would be our privilege to work jointly on expanding the production base in India. We take this partnership as [a] starting point for a long term relationship with RDIF and its partner companies as we look forward to many more areas of common interest. Morepen’s commitment towards this project is [a] step forward towards entry into biosimilars and other biologics,” said Sushil Suri, chairman and managing director, Morepen Laboratories Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-morepen-labs-begin-manufacturing-test-batches-of-sputnik-v-101625605071644.html
07-07-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses nod for rath yatra outside Puri||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to allow rath yatras in cities other than Jagannath Puri in Odisha, observing that people should rather worship at home in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“You want to pray to the God. You can do it at home. I also wanted to go to Puri, but I have not been able to go in the last one-and-half years because of the pandemic. This is not the time. I pray at home,” remarked chief justice of India NV Ramana, while dismissing a clutch of applications to permit rath yatras at Baripada, Sasang, Nilagiri and Kendrapara in the state.The bench, headed by the CJI and also including justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, was categorical that the state government took a “considered decision” by not allowing rath yatras at any place other than Puri in order to ward off the spread of infection.“We will watch it (rath yatra) on television only. We also feel bad, but we cannot do anything in this situation. We can only hope and trust God will allow us these rituals next year,” said justice Ramana. The rath yatra of Lord Jagannath in Puri is an annual ritual scheduled for July 12.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, earlier suggested to the bench that symbolic yatras with limited number of participants could be permitted by the top court because some of the applicants were performing the rituals for centuries.“Yatra was allowed last year by this court for Lord Jagannath at Puri after putting certain conditions. Appropriate conditions can be imposed for this year too to ensure there are no public gatherings. This way, religious sentiments can be protected along with health of the people,” he said.But Odisha’s advocate general Ashok Parija resisted this suggestion, pointing out that the state administration will not be in a position to manage rath yatras across the state while imposing all restrictions and safeguards.“There are no questions of faith of people being affected in these times. Puri was under curfew last year when yatra was conducted after limiting the number of people who could pull the chariots. All those involved had to get their RT-PCR tests done. How will the state ensure all these conditions at several places? Puri is different from other places and that is why the state has allowed the yatra only for Puri this year,” said Parija.The bench found force in Parija’s arguments, as it asked the lawyers appearing for the applicants to refrain from pressing their applications. When some of the lawyers contended that the Covid situation at some places was better than Puri, and that they will take all precautions, the bench retorted: “You and I are not the people who can predict the Covid-19 situation. Please do not poke your knowledge into such matters. Let the government decide.”The bench then dismissed all the applications, upholding the Odisha government’s decision to allow rath yatra only at Puri.On June 10, the state government announced that the annual rath yatra in Puri will begin on July 12 and will take place without devotees. The government added that only fully vaccinated temple officials, or those who test negative for the coronavirus disease 48 hours before the festival will be allowed to pull the chariots.In June last year, the top court allowed the rath yatra after initially stopping it in view of the surge in coronavirus cases. Lifting the stay order, the court had permitted the ritual with stringent conditions, including curfew in the city and no public attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-nod-for-rath-yatra-outside-puri-101625604907789.html
07-07-2021||India||Gehlot’s exit leads to fifth vacancy in BJP parliamentary board||Union social justice and empowerment minister Thawarchand Gehlot’s elevation as Karnataka governor on Tuesday will create another vacancy in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s highest decision-making body, the parliamentary board.Gehlot, 73, who is also the leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, has been a member of the parliamentary board since 2006. The board currently has seven members, four short of its full strength of 11 members. Gehlot’s exit leads to the fifth vacancy.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was the last BJP leader to be inducted into the party’s top decision-making body in August 2014 when the then president, Amit Shah reconstituted the parliamentary board.Chouhan’s induction in 2014 retained the parliamentary board’s strength at 11 members till 2017 when parliamentary board member M Venkaiah Naidu went on to become the country’s Vice President. The board continued to function with 10 members, but more vacancies arose due to the passing away of three key party leaders over the following two years: Ananth Kumar in 2018, and Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj in 2019.Over the past year, there has been speculation that party president JP Nadda will reconfigure the board that has seven members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief JP Nadda. The other members of the top panel are Union home Minister Amit Shah, Union defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan.In addition, BL Santhosh is also a member of the top panel because he is the BJP general secretary (organisation), a post reserved for pracharaks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological fount of the BJP.This is probably the first time that the board has had so many vacancies for so long, said a BJP functionary familiar with the matter. “Apart from the national office bearers who were appointed in September 2020, the party is yet to form the national executive and the central election committee,” the party functionary said on condition of anonymity.The constitution also stipulates that one of the members will be the leader of the party in Parliament - Gehlot was named leader of the House in Rajya Sabha after Jaitley’s death - and another should be a general secretary in the party.The board has the power to supervise and regulate activities of the legislative and Parliamentary units of the party and guide in the formation of ministries. It also has the powers to take note of any breach of discipline by members, office bearers of state units and take necessary action. The board also has the authority to guide and regulate all organisational units below the national executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlots-exit-leads-to-fifth-vacancy-in-bjp-parliamentary-board-101625604656149.html
07-07-2021||India||As people flock to hills, govt warns against ‘revenge travellers’||A spurt in travel after lifting of Covid-19 restrictions — the government termed it “revenge travel” — has led to “frightening” scenes of overcrowding in hill stations that could lead to increased outbreaks of the infectious disease, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday.At the ministry’s briefing on the status of the Covid-19 situation, officials shared a series of images from tourists destinations and key cities to point out “gross violations” of Covid-appropriate behaviour, saying that this could potentially nullify the progress made so far.“Covid-appropriate behaviour is absolutely essential; the pictures that we have seen today are frightening, and we have to be very careful, responsible and cautious,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Some of the places that were highlighted in the briefing were Manali and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh; Laxmi Nagar and Sadar Bazar in Delhi; Dadar market in Mumbai (Maharashtra); and Mussoorie in Uttarakhand.“What we are seeing is called revenge travel after travel-related restrictions were relaxed. You can spot tourists without wearing a mask, not following the physical distancing rule even in overcrowded marketplaces, and all these leniencies will create an environment that will nullify all gains made so far in managing the viral disease in the country,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, health ministry. He warned that the challenge posed by the pandemic could be stiffer if Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed.Aggarwal said people must keep in mind that the easing of restrictions did not mean that the virus vanished. “The disease is very much there so it is important to adhere strictly to Covid-appropriate behaviour, as we did earlier, to avoid experiencing another wave,” Aggarwal said.Quoting from a survey of over 30,000 respondents, Aggarwal said close to 24% of those surveyed did not wear a mask; in 45% of the people, there was limited compliance wherein the mask was not worn properly, and barely 29% complied with the rules.With regard to social distancing norms, 63% did not follow them at all, while 25% didn’t follow safety measures while travelling. According to the survey, even in Covid-19 vaccination centres, about 6% of the attendees did not follow the necessary Covid-appropriate behaviour, Aggarwal said.“As long as we don’t fully comply, there will always be the fear of seeing a comeback of new cases in large numbers in future,” he said.On the rise in cases in the North-east, Bhargava said: “We are encouraging the northeastern states to do more testing... there is heavy testing going on there...” The northeastern states are reporting increased Covid-19 caseloads, with 47 of the 73 worst-affected districts in the country belonging to the region, according to government data. Arunachal Pradesh alone has high case positivity in 18 districts, followed by Rajasthan in 10, Manipur in nine, Kerala in seven and Meghalaya in six.Experts say that following Covid-appropriate behaviour is the only way to curb disease transmission in the long run. “Vaccinating the entire population will take a long time; therefore, people will have to make behavioural changes that have been laid out by experts to prevent the disease from spreading. Wearing of masks, hand hygiene and maintaining overall cleanliness and good sanitary conditions, physical distancing, etc., is a must along with vaccination,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-warns-against-revenge-travellers-101625604251278.html
07-07-2021||India||Cabinet expansion buzz as key leaders arrive in Capital||The elevation of union Minister for social Justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot to a gubernatorial position on Tuesday lent credence to the speculation that an expansion of the union council of ministers is on the cards. As did a clutch of leaders flying into Delhi. HT learns that an official announcement could come as early as Wednesday morning and the oath-taking ceremony be held in the evening.For several weeks there has been a buzz about a possible reshuffle in the council and the inclusion of more members from the Bharatiya Janata Party as well as from its allies such as the Lok Janshakti Party, Janata Dal (United), and Apna Dal. The expansion is expected to bring in fresh faces that will help the BJP address the criticism it faced for the systemic deficiencies that were exposed during the second wave of the corona pandemic, prepare for the upcoming set of assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha battle, and address the charge that it is not good with allies.There is also speculation that the party will include more faces from the poll bound states, particularly Uttar Pradesh where caste equations are still important determinants of electoral outcomes.The much awaited expansion comes close on the heels of the completion of the Modi’s government’s seven years in office. Currently, there are 21 cabinet ministers, nine ministers with independent charge, and 23 ministers of state in the union council of ministers. According to people aware of the details since the council can have up to 81 ministers, at least a dozen inclusions are expected.While the party and government functionaries remained tight lipped about the possible changes, the rush of people from outside Delhi to the National Capital led to conjectures about the possible candidates. Jyotiraditya Scindia flew in from Indore; former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal also arrived in the city; as did JDU leaders RCP Singh and Lalan Singh; and former Congressman and Maharashtra chief Minister Narayan Rane .Since the Council of ministers is expected to have more representation from states in the East, there is speculation that Santanu Thakur, an MP from West Bengal who represents the Mathua community and Nitish Pramanik also a member of Parliament who represents the Rajvanshi community are in reckoning.The inclusion of allies is being seen as the BJP’s efforts to cements ties with its partners.The LJP, which is in the middle of a family feud, is expected to make the cut. After the passing away of its chief Ram Vilas Paswan, the LJP is not represented in the council. Paswan’s son Chirag Paswan and his brother Pashupati Paras are locked in a bitter fight over the control of the party.The Shiromani Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena two of the oldest allies of the BJP broke ties with the party and pulled out their representatives from the council: while the Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant resigned in 2019, Shiromani Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal quit the government in 2020.A BJP functionary requesting anonymity said those who are tipped to be in the council of ministers have already received phone calls from party president JP Nadda and party general secretary organisation BL Santhosh.“Since 2014 the BJP has made a conscious decision to give younger people a chance so the likelihood of people in their 40s and 50s being inducted in the cabinet and the council of ministers is high. The party has already made a conscious decision of appointing people in their 50s as party functionaries such as state unit presidents, general secretaries etc,” said a party functionary.Political commentator Abhay Deshpande said the new team is being built with an eye on the 2024 general elections. “After the outcome of the West Bengal assembly elections and the second wave of the corona pandemic there was a dent in the government’s image. They have been making an effort to undergo an image makeover and are trying to fix relations with their allies; so the council of ministers will have a place for new faces. They will have to consider regional aspirations as well as the political situation emerging in states such as Maharashtra while finalising the names.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-expansion-buzz-as-key-leaders-arrive-in-capital-101625603782976.html

07-07-2021||India||International bodies express concern on Stan Swamy’s death||United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet and human rights officials of the US and European Union (EU) have expressed concern at the death of octogenarian Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, with some of them saying he had been imprisoned on “false” terrorism charges.The external affairs ministry responded to the criticism on Tuesday by saying “due process under law” was followed in Swamy’s case, and that India remains committed to promoting and protecting the human rights of all citizens.The UN high commissioner for human rights and other UN independent experts had repeatedly raised the cases of Swamy and 15 other human rights defenders associated with the Bhima Koregaon case with the Indian government over the past three years and sought their release from pre-trial detention, Bachelet’s spokesperson for Liz Throssell said.“In light of the continued, severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is even more urgent that States, including India, release every person detained without a sufficient legal basis, including those detained simply for expressing critical or dissenting views,” the spokesperson said in a statement.“We stress, once again, the High Commissioner’s call on the Government of India to ensure that no one is detained for exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, of peaceful assembly and of association,” Throssell said.Both Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, and Nadine Maenza, chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), contended that Swamy had been held on “false” charges of terrorism. They were joined by Eamon Gilmore, the EU special representative for human rights, in expressing concern at Swamy’s death.Swamy, 84, died in a Mumbai hospital on Monday. He was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in a raid at his non-governmental organisation Bagaicha, on the outskirts of Ranchi, on October 9 last year.He was charged with being a member of the banned Communist Party of India-Maoist and being involved in a conspiracy to instigate caste violence in Bhima Koregaon village near Pune in 2018. Swamy denied the charges.In its response, the external affairs ministry said Swamy was arrested and detained by NIA “following due process under law”, and his bail applications were rejected by courts because of the “specific nature of charges against him”. Authorities “act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights”, and all suh “actions are strictly in accordance with the law”, the ministry said.In view of Swamy’s poor health, Bombay high court allowed his treatment at a private hospital, where he received “all possible medical attention” since May 28. His health and treatment were closely monitored by courts, the ministry added.“India’s democratic and constitutional polity is complemented by an independent judiciary, a range of national and state level human rights commissions that monitor violations, a free media and a vibrant and vocal civil society. India remains committed to promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens,” the ministry added.The statement from the UN human rights chief said: “We are deeply saddened and disturbed by the death of 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy, a human rights defender and Jesuit priest, in Mumbai yesterday, following his arrest in October 2020 under India’s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).”It noted that Swamy had been held in pre-trial detention without bail since his arrest and charged with terror-related offences in relation to demonstrations dating back to 2018.“He was a long-standing activist, particularly on the rights of indigenous peoples and other marginalised groups. While in Mumbai’s Taloja Central Jail, his health deteriorated and he reportedly contracted Covid-19. His repeated applications for bail were rejected. He died as the Bombay High Court was considering an appeal against the rejection of his bail application,” the statement added.Bachelet has also raised concerns over the use of UAPA in relation to human rights defenders, a law Swamy had challenged in Indian courts days before he died.Lawlor expressed concern at Swamy’s death in a tweet, saying: “The news from #India today is devastating. Human Rights Defender & Jesuit priest Fr Stan Swamy has died in custody, nine months after his arrest on false charges of terrorism. Jailing HRDs is inexcusable.”Gilmore tweeted, “India: I am very saddened to hear that Fr #StanSwamy has passed away. A defender of indigenous peoples’ rights. He was held in detention for the past 9 months. The EU had been raising his case repeatedly with authorities.”Maenza too raised the issue of Swamy’s death on Twitter, saying: “Heartbreaking: death of Indian prisoner Father Stan Swamy after he got COVID. He was elderly priest & human rights activist imprisoned on false terrorism charges. @USCIRF spoke out against his arrest & when he was denied bail as his health deteriorated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-bodies-express-concern-on-stan-swamy-s-death-101625603141925.html
07-07-2021||India||200 farmers to protest outside Parliament from July 22: Samyukt Kisan Morcha||Farmers protesting three agricultural laws say that will begin demonstrating outside Parliament on July 22 as part of a new push to force the government to scrap a set of legislation enacted last year. Farm unions have been holding meetings to work out logistics and finalise strategies to intensify their agitation and coordinate movement of farmers from various states.According to a plan announced by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions spearheading the protests since November last year against the three laws, nearly 200 farmers will protest outside Parliament every day during the Monsoon session.The SKM also said that farm organisations and like-minded groups will hold countrywide protests against rising fuel prices on July 8.Parliament is set to convene on July 19 for its upcoming Monsoon session. Farm unions say they will soon dispatch a letter to all Opposition parties and lawmakers, urging them to raise the issue of the three farm laws during the entire session, said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait.Farmers on tractors are likely to file into the Capital on July 21 evening. Accommodation arrangements have been beefed up at all current protest sites, Dharmendra Singh of the BKU said.Thousands of farmers have pitched tents at five sites near Delhi’s borders -- Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and Shahjahanpur (on the Rajasthan-Haryana border) -- from where they have been carrying on their protests. They have also constructed a permanent weatherproof shelter for arriving farmers at the Tikri site, said Dharmendra Singh, a member of the BKU.The farmers’ march towards Parliament is sure to be resisted by police because demonstrations near Parliament are not allowed, setting the stage for a potential standoff.“It will be a peaceful protest. Nearly 200 protesters will demonstrate every day outside Parliament. The government is not interested in talking to farmers because the government isn’t being run by any party but by companies,” Rakesh Tikait, the leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said.On January 26, a rally taken out by farmers to celebrate Republic Day turned violent, as protesters clashed with policeman and breached Red Fort in the national capital. Farm unions had then called off a planned march to Parliament.Cultivators from various towns and villages in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have joined those already protesting in many of sites. A large convoy arrived from Pilibhit inUttar Pradesh before moving to various sites on Monday, DharmendraSingh said.“These farm laws are black laws. They must be taken back. Farmers will be very peaceful while protesting. The violence that broke out during the Republic Day in Delhi was a conspiracy to defame farmers,” said Joginder Singh Urgrahan of the BKU Ekta Ugrahan group, which represents a large section of farmers in Punjab.The farmers want three agricultural laws repealed, and say that the legislation will leave them at the mercy of large corporations and jeopardise their livelihoods.The laws, broadly, seek to minimise regulations in trade of farm produce, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of commodities for future sales, and set new national rules for contract farming.The government has said the laws would bring competition and widen farmers’ access to markets. Allowing firms to stock large quantities of food commodities will incentivise them to invest in supply and storage, the government has argued.Farmers say the laws will force them to sell to corporate giants with greater bargaining powers at poor prices instead of government-run markets, which offer assured prices for cereals.Unregulated markets will ultimately lead to a collapse of regulated markets that offer minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers say, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied this will ever happen. MSPs are benchmark prices the government offers for farm produce, aimed at signalling a floor rate for private traders.“The honourable agriculture minister has said that the government is willing to talk about all issues farmers may have except repeal of the laws. So our doors are open,” a farm ministry official, who was at the helm of previous rounds of talks between the government and farmers, said.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “The government wants to turn our annadatas (providers of food) into bonded labourers. Farmers are demanding their rights and the laws should be repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-farmers-to-protest-outside-parliament-from-july-22-samyukt-kisan-morcha-101625602957704.html

The proposed amendments enable the introduction of a broader age-related classification and seek to curb piracy in the industry.The proposed change in the Cinematograph Act has caused consternation in the film industry over the power to recall and review a film’s certification. The proposed changes led to 1400 filmmakers and artists including Anurag Kashyap, Shabana Azmi, and Farhan Akhtar writing an open letter to the ministry objecting to this kind of censorship.On Tuesday, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin backed demands to scrap the proposal, insisting that the draft bill seeks to restore the Union government’s revisionary powers “that were struck down by the Supreme Court two decades ago”.If the proposed amendments are cleared, then the government can ask CBFC to reconsider cinematic content on the basis of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-changes-to-cinematograph-act-misread-i-b-to-house-panel-101625602745994.html
07-07-2021||India||Centre asks SC to transfer petitions against new IT rules from 5 high courts||New Delhi: The Union government has approached the Supreme Court to transfer petitions filed against the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, in over five high courts to the apex court, people familiar with the development said.The petition is expected to come up for hearing later this week.At present, the challenge to the intermediary guidelines and a Digital Media Ethics Code introduced in February is pending consideration before the high courts of Delhi, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Kerala. A petition has also been filed before the Karnataka high court where notice is yet to be issued.“In all, four transfer petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court by the ministry of electronics and information technology. The transfer has been sought to avoid multiplicity of proceedings before various high courts and to ensure uniformity in the consideration of the rules under challenge,” a person familiar with the development said.The new rules apply to digital news media platforms, social media intermediaries and OTT platforms and bring digital media under a three-tier oversight mechanism. This will comprise a grievance officer responsible for dealing with complaints to take down indecent content within 24 hours of a complaint. The two remaining tiers of the oversight system comprise a self-regulatory body of experts headed by a former judge, and an inter-departmental committee headed by a senior bureaucrat of the information and broadcasting ministry.The first petition challenging the rules was filed in the Delhi high court by Foundation for Independent Journalism which runs the news website ‘The Wire’ in March this year. Later, the Quint Digital Media Limited which publishes The Quint also filed a petition and the same is under consideration before the Delhi High Court.Simultaneously, various high courts issued notices on petitions challenging the rules. Digital News Publishers Association along with a journalist filed a petition in Madras High Court, legal news website Live Law approached the Kerala high court, a journalist and an online news portal moved the Bombay high court while Calcutta high court issued notice on a PIL filed by one Sayanti Sengupta,.These petitions have largely claimed that the rules curtail and restrict the freedom of the Press in India and claim the conditions imposed under the Digital Media Ethics Code and guidelines are onerous and beyond the scope of the Information Technology Act 2000.The use of vague words such as “good taste” and “decency” in the ethics code are additional challenges to the rules which, according to many of the petitioners, give “pervasive control to state over published content”. The news websites argued that such a code provides a handle for the government to bring down content that doesn’t suit it.The rules, according to the Centre, are intended to provide speedy redressal of bringing down harmful content and allows users to demand removal of personally intimate pictures or videos within 24 hours. The functionaries are also bound under the rules to cooperate with the Government and investigating agencies for verification of identity, detection and prevention of crimes, and investigation or prosecution of offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-sc-to-transfer-petitions-against-new-it-rules-from-5-high-courts-101625602876698.html
07-07-2021||India||Bharadwaj says Pune judge who denied bail not of correct rank||The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to furnish records of the default bail plea of activist and lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, who was arrested in August 2018 in connection with the Elgar Parishad case, and has been lodged in Mumbai’s Byculla women’s prison since then.After Bharadwaj’s counsel Yug Chaudhry submitted that the judge who granted the 90-day extension of her custody to Pune Police in 2018 was not competent and that the order was illegal, the court adjourned the hearing till Wednesday so that the information about the judge could be verified by the court registry.The counsel told the court that if the contention was correct, not only Bharadwaj’s detention, but that of the eight other accused in the case – Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling and Mahesh Raut – would also be illegal.The division bench of justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar, while hearing Bharadwaj’s bail application, was informed by Choudhry that the judge who heard the application of Pune Police for the extension of Bharadwaj’s custody was not a designated special judge under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, and hence, could not hear matters pertaining to scheduled offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).Choudhry also submitted that based on the responses received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act from HC registry, it was found that judge KD Vadane, who had granted the 90-day extension of Bharadwaj’s detention on November 26, 2018, was only a district and additional sessions judge at Pune, though he had claimed to be a special judge. Choudhry submitted that Vadane had signed two orders, one as a special judge and the second as special UAPA judge.Citing the RTI response, Choudhry told the court that between January 2018 and July 2019, Vadane was not appointed as special judge under section 22 of NIA Act. Choudhry submitted that Vadane also could not have authorised the supplementary charge sheet filed by the Pune Police in February 2019.The court was then informed that the RTI responses showed that though there were other NIA judges at the sessions court in Pune, police had placed the matter before Vadane.Choudhry expressed his dismay and said, “This goes to the very heart of the judicial system. With utmost humility, the bedrock of judiciary is shaken when a non-designated judge calls himself a designated judge... And people are languishing in custody under his orders…”After hearing the submissions and on Choudhry’s insistence that the state should not be allowed to file a reply as it had not done so even after being given sufficient time, the court directed chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare to produce relevant records in relation to the petition.The court, which is likely to hear the matter on Thursday, said it would ask the HC registry to verify the information provided by the petitioner.Meanwhile, Gadling has filed an appeal against the rejection of his temporary bail application by the special NIA court last September. Gadling had sought bail to conduct the last rites of his mother, but he was denied the same. On Tuesday, Gadling’s lawyer, senior advocate Indira Jaising, informed the bench of justice Shinde that on the first death anniversary of the accused’s mother on August 13, he should be granted temporary bail. HC will hear the appeal on July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharadwaj-says-pune-judge-who-denied-bail-not-of-correct-rank-101625602457593.html
07-07-2021||India||Release all Bhima Koregaon accused, Opposition parties write to President||Leaders of 10 Opposition parties on Tuesday wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind expressing outrage at the death of activist and undertrial prisoner Stan Swamy, calling for the immediate release of all people accused in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case and other political prisoners.The letter came a day after the 84-year-old Jesuit priest died of a cardiac arrest at a time the Bombay high court was hearing his medical bail plea.Swamy was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last October for allegedly being a part of banned Maoist organisations and fomenting violence on January 1, 2018 at Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village.The leaders said they were writing to the President in “deep anguish” and called the cases against Swamy, including those under anti-terror laws, false.“We are urging your immediate intervention as the President of India to direct your government to act against those responsible for foisting false cases on him, his continued detention in jail and inhuman treatment. They must be held accountable,” the joint letter said.“It is now incumbent that all those jailed in the Bhima Koregaon case and other detenues under politically motivated cases, misusing draconian laws like UAPA [Unlawful Activities Prevention Act], sedition etc, be released forthwith,” the leaders added.The letter was signed by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, former prime minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee (Trinamool Congress), Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and his Jharkhand counterpart Hemant Soren (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha) have also signed the letter. Among the other signatories are D Raja (Communist Party of India), Sitaram Yechury (Communist Party of India-Marxist) and Tejashwi Yadav (Rashtriya Janata Dal).The leaders alleged that Swamy was denied treatment for various ailments including Parkinson’s disease.“Only after a nationwide campaign was conducted that even a sipper to drink liquids was made available to him in jail. The numerous appeals made to shift him out of the overcrowded Taloja jail that had seen a huge rise in Covid cases went unheeded. His appeals for bail and being sent home too were rejected. Thanks to the Bombay high court’s intervention he was admitted to a private hospital when his condition started deteriorating after he was infected with Covid. But it was too late to prevent his death in custody,” the letter added.Swamy was the oldest of 16 activists and lawyers arrested on charges of conspiring to foment violence at Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018. The village was rocked by caste clashes during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war by Dalits.He was arrested on October 8, 2020 by NIA, which alleged that the priest had Maoist connections and was working for frontal organisations of the banned CPI (Maoist). He was charged under the UAPA and was sent to Taloja jail. In his defence, Swamy said evidence against him was fabricated and that he never conspired to foment violence.Meanwhile, the BJP reacted to the letter saying that it is another attempt by the opposition to “play the politics.”BJP national spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said that opposition has always sided with the international organisations which are blatantly “anti-Modi” and this whole ecosystem of hate against PM involves global media as well.He added that Indian laws are “very strong” and all the institutions of the state are “taking care of constitutional rights of everybody.”Without naming Swamy, Agarwal added, “But opposition in all its actions and statements only talks about the human rights of those people who at one point in time seem to be involved in anti-national activities.”He added that the opposition “never talks” about human rights violations of the “nationalist people”. “This (letter) is all a part of the opposition’s clear-cut strategy against Modi government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/release-all-bhima-koregaon-accused-opposition-parties-write-to-president-101625602211856.html
07-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh minister rebuts forest dept on Lemru elephant reserve expansion||Raipur: A row has erupted in Chhattisgarh over a letter purportedly written by the forest department stating that Congress leaders including state health minister TS Singhdeo wants the area of Lemru elephant reserve to be reduced by one fourth with Singhdeo claiming his name was “wrongly” included in the letter.On June 26, forest department official KP Rajput wrote a letter to Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) stating that eight legislators including Singhdeo have urged the department not to extend the Lemru elephant reserve to 1995.48 square km from 450 square km due to public sentiment against the proposed expansion in Jashpur-Surguja region. The letter said the leaders were against any expansion of the reserve.Singhdeo rebutted the forest department claim in a letter to the forest department on July 2, insisting that he never sought reducing the area of the proposed elephant reserve. The Chhattisgarh government has been considering the extension of Lemru elephant reserve area. Activists want the entire catchment area of Hasdeo river to be included in the reserve. “It has come to my attention that a letter on my behalf seems to have been portraying that taking into the consideration the public’s sentiments, I have given consent to reduce the size of the Lemru Elephant Project to 450 sq km. However, this is totally untrue and misleading,” the minister said. He stressed that he had registered my consent to dedicate 1,995.48 sq km for the project on the condition that no villages of his constituency should fall within this area. “Though I was assured by the concerned authorities that no villages from Ambikapur constituency was within the purview of this project, some villagers registered their objection to me,” he said.The minister said villagers from Udaipur and Lakhanpur blocks claimed that they are being pressured by forest officials to consent to the expansion of the elephant reserve. “Upon receiving this complaint, I looked into the details of the project and found that the project’s area has been almost doubled to 3,827.64 from the initial proposal of 1995.48 sq km,” he said.“I have never proposed to reduce the size of Lemru elephant reserve to 450 sq km... Instead, I have advocated re-imposing the ‘No Go Zone’ as it was under the UPA government,” Singhdeo said.Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife ), Narisimha Rao PV, said the department has nothing to do with the communication. “As a department, we don’t come into picture. I don’t know why and on what ground the letter was written to me,” said Rao PV. KP Rajput, forest department official whose letter triggered the row, declined to speak on the issue. “I don’t want to comment,” he said. “Singhdeo has clarified his position that the Lemru elephant reserve area should be ​​1,995 sq km and never asked for reducing it to 450 sq km. In this situation, it is clear that the area of ​​Lemru reserve is planned to be reduced due to pressure from mining companies,” said Alok Shukla, convener, Chhattisgrah Bachaao Andolan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-minister-rebuts-forest-dept-on-lemru-elephant-reserve-expansion-101625601918732.html
07-07-2021||India||India says its Afghan missions still open; envoy briefs Shringla||India on Tuesday dismissed speculation about the closure of its embassy and two consulates in Afghanistan even as Afghan envoy Farid Mamundzay briefed foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on the fragile security situation in the troubled country.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Indian authorities were keeping a very close watch on the fluid situation in Afghanistan, especially against the backdrop of a massive surge in violence by the Afghan Taliban, to ensure that Indian officials and nationals were not put in harm’s way.Gains by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan have led to some countries closing their consulates in this region. Reports suggested some districts collapsed without a fight and that some 1,000 Afghan security personnel crossed the border to seek refuge in Tajikistan.Amid the uncertainty, the Indian embassy in Kabul ruled out the immediate closure of the Indian missions in Afghanistan. “Media reports on #India closing its Embassy & Consulates in [Afghanistan] are incorrect. @IndianEmbKabul, Consulates in Kandahar & Mazar are open, functioning. We DO HOWEVER continue to closely monitor the evolving security situation particularly around Kandahar & Mazar cities,” it tweeted.The Indian side is keen to not do anything that would send a wrong signal to the Afghan government or elements that have sought to use Afghanistan for anti-India actions, the people said, adding Centre would also keep a watch on the actions of other key players such as the US.In a separate development, Afghan ambassador Mamundzay briefed foreign secretary Shringla during a meeting in South Block. “Ambassador briefed FS on the security situation in Afghanistan. FS assured our Afghan friends of India’s long term commitment towards peace and prosperity in Afghanistan,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted.On June 29, India issued a detailed and specific security advisory for its nationals in Afghanistan following an escalation in terrorist attacks, warning that they should exercise utmost vigilance as they faced a “serious threat of kidnapping”. Indian nationals were strongly advised to avoid all non-essential movements.According to the external affairs ministry’s data, there are around 3,100 Indian nationals in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-its-afghan-missions-still-open-envoy-briefs-shringla-101625600371657.html
07-07-2021||India||Madras HC orders police protection for queer woman after threats||The Madras high court recently granted police protection to a queer woman belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community after a complaint of frequent life threats from the family over sexual orientation. The bench comprising Justice M Nirmal Kumar followed the guidelines laid down by the Madras high court earlier in a historic judgment delivered by justice Anand Venkatesh in June in the case of a lesbian couple seeking protection. It included guidelines for police not to harass the community on account of their parents filing ‘missing complaints’, which happened in the current case. According to the counsel, the petitioner left home on April 17, fearing for her life and safety as she was subject to physical and verbal abuse. On April 22, her brother sent her an FIR filed against her for ‘woman missing’ over Whatsapp. “The petitioner is an adult, who consciously and deliberately left her native to escape from her abusing family members and is now living with her friend,” counsel submitted. “The petitioner’s apprehension is that they may resort to honour killing or adopt other tactics to cause grievous physical harm to her. Given the same, the petitioner has requested for police protection.” The counsel also submitted that immediately after the petitioner completed class 12, she was forcibly married at 17. “The petitioner, in course of time, realised that she was queer and could not stay in a heterosexual marriage. As a result, the petitioner and her husband fell apart, and nothing survives in the marriage,” the counsel said during the hearing. She later began living with her friend in her native village and eventually left the village. Her family was aware that she was living with a female friend. Her parents, according to the counsel, wanted to ensure that she is not alive, because she brought disrepute to the family.The court observed that the petitioner and her friend are “ conscious about their relationship.” “The respondent Police is directed not to cause any harassment and also give appropriate protection for the safety and life of the petitioner following the guidelines issued by this Court in W.P.No.7284 of 2021, dated 07.06.2021.” the court said in its orders. The orders were passed on June 25, which were made public on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-orders-police-protection-for-queer-woman-after-threats-101625598675700.html
07-07-2021||India||Amid row, CPI(M) denies tarnishing Mani’s image||:The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Tuesday denied the allegation that it tarnished the image of late Kerala Congress (Mani) leader K M Mani in the Supreme Court while hearing a petition on assembly violence, in which it suffered a setback. The KC (M), which is part of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), has now strongly protested over the reported remarks and asked the government to withdraw them immediately. While hearing the case on Monday, counsel for the Kerala government Ranjith Kumar reportedly said protests on the house floor was a natural one against a corrupt politician. While the LDF said the counsel’s words were twisted by a section of media, many Congress leaders said it was an insult to the late leader and asked the KC(M) to come out of the coalition. Later, the SC refused to quash the case and adjourned it for further hearing on July 15.“The counsel was referring to the corrupt regime of the UDF, not a particular leader. A section of the media deliberately twisted these words to create a smokescreen. We have already informed the Kerala Congress about this,” said party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. He said a section of the media has conspired with the opposition to drive a wedge between the CPI(M) and KC (M).Kerala Congress chairman Jose K Mani, son of K M Mani, said he’s satisfied with the explanation given by the LDF. “It seems counsel’s words were misinterpreted. The Congress-led UDF is trying to create a wedge in the ruling coalition,” he said Many party leaders admitted that they were upset with the remarks of the counsel. “We have already conveyed our protest and asked the government to withdraw these remarks,” said party general secretary Stephen George. He said the party chairman would explain it later even as Congress has stepped up pressure on the party. “We feel K M Mani is not corrupt, but the ruling party says he is. It is for the KC (M) to decide now,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan.The Kerala assembly had witnessed violent incidents in March 2015 after opposition LDF legislators prevented then finance minister K M Mani from presenting the state budget alleging his role in the bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee, and two legislators were hospitalised later. The session was live when the violence took place in the House. Speaker N Sakthan later filed a police complaint against six LDF legislators. Among them, V Sivankutty is the education minister in the current Pinarayi Vijayan ministry, and KT Jaleel is a sitting member. In his complaint, the Speaker said property worth ₹2.20 lakh got damaged in the melee, and they tried to manhandle treasury bench members and brought enough shame to the House. When the LDF came to the power in 2016, it tried to withdraw the case, but a local court first rejected it. Then, the government moved the High Court, which also turned down its plea. The government had invoked the privilege of legislators to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it, saying privilege was not a licence to carry out violent activities in the House. During a discussion in the assembly last year, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had blamed the Congress-led UDF for dragging an assembly issue to the court. Later, former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also joined the case as a party.After the death of K M Mani in 2019, his party split, and his son took the splinter faction to the LDF camp. A predominant Christian party, its foray into the LDF had helped it win many seats in the Christian heartland of central Travancore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-row-cpi-m-denies-tarnishing-mani-s-image-101625598615698.html
07-07-2021||India||Stalin seeks withdrawal of draft cinematograph bill||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday wrote to union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar, asking him to withdraw the Draft Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which the DMK leader said would infringe on the right to freedom of thought and weaken democracy. Stalin said the new draft has given rise to “serious apprehensions” not only among those in the film industry but also among all well-meaning sections of the society that cherish freedom of expression. It is unconstitutional, he said, to curb creative thinking of the film fraternity and impose conditions on how films are to be made. “Taking away the right to freedom of thought will only weaken our democracy, which has to be vibrant always irrespective of the parties in power,” Stalin said in his letter. “As you are aware, a vibrant democracy must provide adequate space for creative thinking and artistic freedom,” the chief minister said. “However, the proposed amendment to the Cinematograph Act seeks to restrict it by restoring the revisionary powers of the Union government that was struck down by the Supreme Court two decades ago.” Given that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) accords certification to the films if they meet all the criteria mentioned in the section 5(a) of the Cinematograph Act, Stalin said that it is “excessive to add more laws and Acts to throttle the freedom of a creative form in the 21st century.” As he has pointed out in his previous letters to union ministers over several issues, Stalin contended that this new legislation was intended to concentrate more power in the hands of the union government that goes against federal principles. He said that once CBFC certifies a film for public viewing, it comes within the domain of state governments. The draft amendment restoring the “revisional power” to the Centre after the CBFC certification is a misuse of “reasonable restriction” clause under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. “... it must be left to the states as law and order is a state subject,” he said. “But now, the Union government, by the proposed Act, tries to go against the spirit of cooperative federalism and transgress the powers of the state governments and its own CBFC. Incidentally, as a prelude to this amendment, the Film Certification Appellate Board, which was functioning as an appellate body against the CBFC, was dismantled.” He pointed out that certain provisions in the Bill are practically difficult to implement. He emphasised that CBFC be allowed to function with autonomy, “so that we remain as a progressive nation, and where creative thinking, that includes art, culture and filmmaking, blossom without fear or favour.” Earlier actor-politician Kamal Haasan and several celebrities from the Tamil film fraternity had opposed the new Bill after the union information broadcasting ministry had sought public opinion before July 2. “Cinema, media and the literati cannot afford to be the three iconic monkeys of India,” Haasan had tweeted on June 28. “Seeing, hearing and speaking of impending evil is the only medication against attempts to injure and debilitate democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-seeks-withdrawal-of-draft-cinematograph-bill-101625598556359.html
07-07-2021||India||Another jumbo succumbs to herpes virus in Kerala||Another elephant died of herpes virus at Kerala’s Kottur elephant rehabilitation centre on Tuesday, officials said, after a calf’s death last week. Two calves have been infected, prompting officials to quarantine other animals and their keepers to check the spread of the disease at the centre. EEHV, or elephant endotheliotropic herpes virus, can infect a wide range of animals including Asian elephants and cause sores and fever blisters. On June 28, Sreekutty, a 19-month-old calf, was the first to succumb to the disease at the centre, which houses 16 elephants including 10 calves. Later the State Institute of Animal Diseases in Palode confirmed the presence of the virus. Forest officials said an epidemiology study was underway to find out the source of the infection. The forest department has also constituted an expert team under Dr Jacob Alexander, Thiruvananthapuram zoo veterinary surgeon, and Dr T Rajeev, veterinary hospital assistant director. “We are keeping a close watch on the situation. Experts are camping at the centre to contain the spread of the virus and save lives of other elephants, ” state animal husbandry minister J Chinchu Rani said. Officials said animals and keepers, who have been quarantined, were being administered anti-viral drugs. A major tourist attraction, the centre has been closed for visitors for over a year now because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier, two mahouts and two other workers at the centre were tested positive for Covid-19. They have since recovered. Authorities are planning to develop Kottur, 35 km away from the state capital, into a mini “jumbo township” with an elephant museum, mahout training centre, a super-speciality hospital, a retirement home and crematorium for pachyderms on the lines of Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage in Sri Lanka. Once fully operational, the elephants will be set free in 65 hectares of forestland surrounded by trenches, said officials. Usually abandoned and injured animals are admitted to the centre. The forest department can also bring captive elephants, which are often ill-treated and overworked by their owners, and admit them there. According to the last elephant census, the state has 507 captive jumbos, including 59 at Sree Krishna temple in Guruvayur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-jumbo-succumbs-to-herpes-virus-in-kerala-101625598555716.html
07-07-2021||India||Thawarchand Gehlot appointed as K’taka governor||Bengaluru Amid buzz of Cabinet reshuffle, Union minister for Social Justice & Empowerment, Thawarchand Gehlot, on Tuesday was appointed as the governor of Karnataka, relieving Vajubhai Vala who has been the head of the state since September 1 2014.The appointment of Gehlot comes along with change of heads of other states across the country as approved by President Ramnath Kovind on Tuesday, according to a statement by the Press Information Bureau.“I extend my warm welcome to Shri Thawarchand Gehlot Ji as the new Governor of Karnataka. The state will benefit from Gehlotji’s long experience in public life & commitment to social justice. I thank Governor Shri Vajubhai Vala Ji for his contribution to Karnataka,” BS Yediyurappa, the chief minister tweeted on Tuesday.Opposition leader and member of the Congress party Siddaramaiah also welcomed Gehlot as the new governor. “Many congratulations to Union Minister Shri. #ThawarchandGehlot for being appointed as Governor of Karnataka. I wish him success in the new role and hope he works earnestly to uphold the Constitutional values,” Siddaramaih. He, however, did not mention anything about Vajubhai Vala.“Congratulations to Sri @TCGehlot on being appointed as the Governor of Karnataka.My best wishes to the outgoing Governor Sri Vajubhai Vala for his future endeavours,” DK Shivakumar, the state Congress president said in a post on Twitter.Vala had taken over from K Rosaiah, the then Governor of Tamil Nadu, who was given additional charge of Karnataka after H.R. Bhardwaj’s five-year tenure came to an end in June 2014.Vala has presided as head of the state during one of the most defining political times of the southern state during which there were four chief ministers in a span of seven years.Siddaramaiah was chief minister from 2013-18 when Vala took office. However, after the elections, Vala had invited Yediyurappa and the Bharatiya Janata Party with 104 out of the 224 assembly seats to form the government on May 17, 2018 since it was the single largest party despite it being short of the majority of 113. More importantly, the JD(S)-Congress had already submitted their formal alliance that gave them the majority.But the controversy did not end there as Vala gave Yediyurappa 15 days to prove his majority despite the latter only seeking seven days.The Congress and JD(S) took the matter to the Supreme Court and a three judge bench, in a midnight hearing, reduced the time to prove majority by the evening of May 20.Yediyurappa, who could not mobilise the numbers, stepped down from power after just two days and on the floor of the house admitted to having approached legislators from the Congress and JD(S) to switch over.Three days later on May 23, HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) was sworn in as chief minister after the Congress stitched up an alliance with their old rivals to keep the BJP out.In the 14 months that followed, the Karnataka Raj Bhavan or official residence of the Governor, became the biggest platform for the politics that played out after the coalition was nearly wiped out in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in which the BJP won an unprecedented 25 out of the 28 seats.The mass resignations followed from within the coalition government amid allegations that Yediyurappa and the BJP were luring legislators from Congress and JD(S) to defect for personal gain.Much of the resignation drama was played out in the Raj Bhavan which eventually helped Yediyurappa being sworn in as chief minister for a record fourth time on 26 July 2019.Vala had also been at the helm when contentious laws like the anti-cattle slaughter were mooted by the Yediyurappa-led government as well as for the amendment of the Lokayukta act among others.He leaves at a time when the talk of Yediyurappa being replaced by the BJP is gathering steam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thawarchand-gehlot-appointed-as-k-taka-governor-101625598495757.html
07-07-2021||India||Farmer run over by deputy CM’s car succumbs to injuries, case filed||Bengaluru: A car owned by Karnataka deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi allegedly ran over a 56-year-old farmer in Hungund in Bagalkote district on Monday. The family members of the victim Kudleppa Boli claimed that the minister’s son Chidanand Savadi was driving the car. According to police, the accident took place when Boli was returning home on his bike on Monday evening. District Superintendent of Police Lokesh Jagalasar said that police have seized the car and a case has been registered against the driver who was present at the location of the accident. However, Mangalappa, son-in-law of the victim, alleged that Chidanand was driving the car and accused Savadi’s son of not taking his injured father-in-law to the hospital on time. “My uncle sustained injuries in his head and back. He was lying there. They should have made some arrangements on finding his lying there, but they did nothing,” he told the media. In response to the allegation, the Deputy CM said that his son stopped driving 10 years ago, and Hanumanth (driver) was driving the vehicle. Chidanand claimed that he along with his friends had gone to Anjanadri hill for ‘darshan’ and were on the way to Athani. Chidanand told reporters that he was in his friend’s car while Hanumanth was driving his car when a biker suddenly appeared in front of the vehicle and the driver lost control of it and hit him. He said his driver later apprised him of what happened, following which he (Chidanand) made arrangements to admit the injured to the hospital and informed the police. “By the time I returned, there was no one on the spot. I went to the hospital to meet the victim, where I got the information that he has succumbed to injuries. I also tried to meet his family members but could not. I pray to God to give strength to the kin to bear the loss. I will meet them after the final rites are performed. I will extend every possible help to them,” he told the media.

07-07-2021||India||CM battles challenges from Lingayat groups||Bengaluru BS Yediyurappa, who was believed to be the tallest leader of the Lingayats, one of the biggest caste groups in the state, is now being bracketed into a representative of one of the sub-sects of the community that could make it harder for him to depend on a group that have so far backed him collectively. The Panchamasali sect, a land-owning farmer group and the biggest sub-sect within the Lingayats are now proposing for one of their own to be considered for a top post, if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) do replace Yediyurappa. “If by chance there is any replacement (of chief minister), give one of our own an opportunity,” Sri Basava Jaya Mruthyunjaya Swami, the seer of the Kudalasangama Panchamasali Peeta said on Monday.The seer, among other leaders from the community like Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the BJP legislator from Bijapur city, had held demonstrations for better reservation opportunities for the sub-sect. This demand was followed by other dominant communities like Vokkaligas, Kurubas and Valmikis among others to also sought similar changes in reservation status earlier this year.Mruthyunjaya Swami said that there was dissent brewing within the Yediyurappa administration and cited age-related inability as one of the reasons for the problems within the government and its performance. The seer also threatened to revive the stir for reservation and added that negligence to their earlier demands had resulted in the loss of seats in the April 17 bypolls, threatening to assert themselves politically.The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa is clinging to his chair as the BJP awaits for an opportunity to strike a deal with the chief minister to step down nearly two years before the state goes to polls in 2023.The BJP is wary that any harsh action against Yediyurappa could result in a repeat of 2013 when the latters exit brought down the saffron outfit’s only government in southern India.The rift within the community has led to Yediyurappa being referred to as a as a Banajiga, another sub-sect who are traditionally traders, as a way of emphasizing the distinction.Though the Lingayats backed him in 2013 but he was successful in bringing down the BJP which he exited, only to rejoin them months after the election.The BJP at the centre may have an inclination to push for Hindutva as against the caste-dominated political equations in Karnataka, which analysts and experts said, will not be easy.People aware of the developments said that the chief minister has sought from the central leadership an opportunity to complete his term while also seeking to placate his sons, one of who (BY Raghavendra) is among the probables to be inducted into Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet at the centre.“If the (BJP) high command does want to replace (Yediyurappa) then we also have many of our own who are enthusiastic and experienced. Give us also an opportunity if you are planning a leadership change,” Vijayanand Kashappanavar, ex-MLA and national president of the Akhila Bharatha Lingayata Panchamasali Mahasabha told Hindustan Times on Tuesday.In 2008, Yediyurappa stormed into power after he was denied the top chair by his coalition partner, HD Kumaraswamy of the Janata Dal (Secular), as the Lingayat community firmly stood behind a person they believed was wronged by a member of the other dominant community: the Vokkaligas.“That issue then was Lingayat versus Gowda (Vokkaliga) and this man (Yediyurappa) very successfully converted his personal problem as social and community problem,” said another person who is an expert on the caste, requesting not to be named. At the heart of such mobilisation are Mathas or monasteries, which are powerful entities in Karnataka and almost all caste-groups now have some presence as the spiritual headquarters of particular communities. Though there are some of the Mathas or their head pontiffs who openly support or endorse political opinions, others do it more tactfully in the shadows, people aware of the workings of such establishments said.Karnataka’s complex caste-based politics has largely been dominated by Lingayats and Vokkaligas, who together account for majority of the people who became chief ministers so far in the state’s history.Analysts pointed out that most of the Lingayat chief ministers in the state’s history since it became Karnataka, were Banajigas and possibly just two were Panchamasali.“In the last 15 years there has been a rift within the Lingayat community which has been created mostly by political leaders,” said a north-Karnataka based analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst cited above said that out of the Panchacharya (or the five main seats of the Lingayats), the Panchamasali had asked for one of them to be headed by a member of their sub-sect which was denied, leading them to form one peetha or chair of their own.Though Basavanna, the 12th century reformer, had wanted a casteless society, there are at least 100 sub-sects within the Lingayat--or the form it has taken--and practiced today, experts said.There have been attempts to portray Yatnal and Murugesh Nirani, the minister for mines and geology, as possible replacements for Yediyurappa as they belong to the Panchamasali.“The groups (castes) back leaders not just for being born into these communities but are with those in power. Yediyurappa did not become a leader because he had the backing of the Lingayats but got their support as he became more and more powerful,” a senior leader of the BJP said, requesting not to be named.However, the leader also said that Yediyurappa was now on “bonus time” as every unwritten rule of the BJP was broken for the 78-year-old since 2018. “This cannot be spun off as injustice as he (Yediyurappa) as the BJP has given him top positions” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-battles-challenges-from-lingayat-groups-101625598316951.html
07-07-2021||India||Will move court if Paras is given Cabinet berth on LJP quota: Chirag||Amid speculations of Pashupati Kumar Paras securing a berth in the Union cabinet expansion, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Tuesday said that he has already informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the suspension of five party MPs and that he would go to court if his uncle was inducted on the party quota.“If any of them gets included in the Cabinet from the party’s quota, I will certainly have an objection to it and I may have to take legal recourse. If anyone is made minister as an independent or from some other party, I have no issue, as it is entirely the prerogative of the Prime Minister. But as far as the LJP is concerned, the party Constitution allows me to be the president and the matter is before the Election Commission (EC) as well as the Lok Sabha Speaker,” he told reporters at his residence in Patna.“I have already written to PM Modi as well as the EC in this regard. A common practice is that the party president is consulted if anyone from the party has to be included in the cabinet,” he added.Chirag, who is locked in a power tussle with the Paras-led faction, ever since the party split on June 17, said his party continued to be with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre. In the 2019 elections, LJP had won six seats as an NDA member.The MP from Jamui seat, who launched his ‘Ashirvad Yatra’ from Hajipur on Monday to mark the the birth anniversary of his father and party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, accused his uncle of engineering the split in the LJP to become a minister at the behest of chief minister Nitish Kumar. “It is ironic that Nitish Kumar always tried to insult my father, but my uncle chose to sit in his lap even at the cost of the family and party, which gave him everything,” Chirag said. The LJP leader said he had chosen the difficult path for himself as this was the lesson his father taught. “I am not eager to become a minister, as my first objective is to build the party as a viable alternative in Bihar. Even when my father was around, attempts were made to break the party, but LJP continued its march. It will continue its march and I am overwhelmed with the response of the people for my Ashirvad Yatra the very first day,” he added. A faction of the LJP headed by Hajipur MP Paras last month removed his estranged nephew Paswan as the party chief, prompting Paswan’s loyalists to respond by stripping five rebel parliamentarians of the party’s primary membership. The party, which has six MPs but no MLAs, plunged into a crisis after five lawmakers rebelled against Paswan’s leadership and chose Paras as the new leader of the parliamentary party.Chirag later met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and urged him to reconsider his decision to recognise Paras as the parliamentary party leader, saying it was against the party’s constitution. He also said that the party will consider taking the legal route if his demand was not considered by the Lok Sabha Speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-move-court-if-paras-is-given-cabinet-berth-on-ljp-quota-chirag-101625597835672.html

In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores.” Nazir, who is in her 70s, is the wife of late former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed. She has been asked to visit the ED zonal office in Srinagar on July 14 for the probe. According to news agency PTI, the case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is linked to the recovery of at least two diaries by the central agency following raids on an alleged associate of Mehbooba.The diaries contain details of some purported payments made from the chief minister’s discretionary fund in alleged contravention of rules. These funds are alleged to have been diverted during the PDP rule in the erstwhile state.A few lakh rupees from these funds are alleged to have been transferred into the accounts of Nazir and some others, officials told the news agency. Mehbooba was questioned by the central agency in March this year in connection with a separate money laundering case.The Delimitation Commission headed by Ranjana Prakash Desai, retired judge of Supreme Court, is on a four-day visit to the UT to meet political leaders and officials to chalk out new voting constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-mufti-s-mother-in-pmla-case-101625597775772.html
07-07-2021||India||Kerala’s spiritual healer wanted to free woman from parent’s custody. SC says no||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down the plea of a 53-year-old spiritual healer in Kerala to free a 21-year-old woman from the custody of her parents claiming that they were in a spiritual live-in relationship for over two years.The self-proclaimed healer, Kailas Natarajan, a doctor by profession, wanted the top court to apply the law laid down by it in March 2018 where an adult woman, Hadiya was allowed to go with her husband, Shafin Jahan, who she married despite opposition by her parents. In the landmark ruling, the Supreme Court held that “parental love or concern cannot be allowed to fluster the right of choice of an adult in choosing a man to whom she gets married.”Before the top court, senior advocate Gopal Shankaranaraynan appearing for Natarajan submitted that the petitioner does not seek the custody of the woman but being an adult, she should be permitted to take a decision of her choice. He claimed to be in what he described as a spiritual live-in relationship with the woman for two-and-a-half years.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana declined.“This is not a case where we can permit the girl to go with the petitioner (Natarajan). The girl is in a very fragile state of mind. This man is married, has two children and once was charged under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act (on the complaint of abuse by a 14-year-old). Facts in this case are such that it does not inspire confidence in giving custody to the petitioner who has doubtful antecedents.”Natarajan earlier petitioned the Kerala high court as well. But the high court also rejected his request on January 20 this year after interacting with the girl, The judges found her to be vulnerable and incapable of taking decisions. She exhibited signs of mental disturbance in demanding to stay with the petitioner. It was her depression that led her parents to approach the petitioner and seek cure. However, on the pretext of counseling her in solitude, Natarajan developed intimacy and claimed that she was his spiritual live-in-partner, although they never stayed together.The court was conscious that such incidents where families are fighting spiritual gurus in court for custody of their child are not new. “You know the environment of our gurujis and swamis,” the bench remarked, recounting a recent public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a couple from Andhra Pradesh who were concerned that their daughter, who had studied abroad, was in a similar situation involving a spiritual guru.There were other reasons too that made the court suspect the petitioner’s antecedents. He was separated from his wife and children, claimed to be a teacher of Vedic Yogashastra but was accused of misbehaving with a 14-year-old girl who came to his house for psychiatric treatment. Even the petitioner’s mother disapproved of his activities in the name of spirituality. Her statement given to the Kerala police was recorded by the high court in its judgment.These grounds made the top court place full trust and confidence on the high court’s interaction with the girl and arrive at a conclusion that the custody of the girl with parents was not illegal and in her best interest.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy said that in India, unlike the West, parents tend to cover up mental problems of children. The judges referred to an identical case reported from the US a week ago without identifying the personality. Senior lawyer Shankarnaraynan told the court that the case was of American pop star Britney Spears. Due to her erratic behaviour, a local court in the US made her father in-charge of managing his daughter’s wealth and estate. “There the laws are different, culture is different. Unless and until a person consents, no treatment can be given,” said the bench.In order to be satisfied about the 21-year-old woman’s welfare, the bench directed her to be produced before the District Judge after a month and a compliance report to be submitted to the court on her condition along with details of treatment given to her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-spiritual-healer-wanted-to-free-woman-from-parent-s-custody-sc-says-no-101625597716511.html
07-07-2021||India||Centre warns against ‘revenge travellers’||New Delhi: A spurt in travel after lifting of Covid-19 restrictions — the government termed it “revenge travel” — has led to “frightening” scenes of overcrowding in hill stations that could lead to increased outbreaks of the infectious disease, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday.At the ministry’s briefing on the status of the Covid-19 situation, officials shared a series of images from tourists destinations and key cities to point out “gross violations” of Covid-appropriate behaviour, saying that this could potentially nullify the progress made so far.“Covid-appropriate behaviour is absolutely essential; the pictures that we have seen today are frightening, and we have to be very careful, responsible and cautious,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Some of the places that were highlighted in the briefing were Manali and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh; Laxmi Nagar and Sadar Bazar in Delhi; Dadar market in Mumbai (Maharashtra); and Mussoorie in Uttarakhand.“What we are seeing is called revenge travel after travel-related restrictions were relaxed. You can spot tourists without wearing a mask, not following the physical distancing rule even in overcrowded marketplaces, and all these leniencies will create an environment that will nullify all gains made so far in managing the viral disease in the country,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, health ministry. He warned that the challenge posed by the pandemic could be stiffer if Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed.Aggarwal said people must keep in mind that the easing of restrictions did not mean that the virus vanished. “The disease is very much there so it is important to adhere strictly to Covid-appropriate behaviour, as we did earlier, to avoid experiencing another wave,” Aggarwal said.Quoting from a survey of over 30,000 respondents, Aggarwal said close to 24% of those surveyed did not wear a mask; in 45% of the people, there was limited compliance wherein the mask was not worn properly, and barely 29% complied with the rules.With regard to social distancing norms, 63% did not follow them at all, while 25% didn’t follow safety measures while travelling. According to the survey, even in Covid-19 vaccination centres, about 6% of the attendees did not follow the necessary Covid-appropriate behaviour, Aggarwal said.“As long as we don’t fully comply, there will always be the fear of seeing a comeback of new cases in large numbers in future,” he said.On the rise in cases in the North-east, Bhargava said: “We are encouraging the northeastern states to do more testing... there is heavy testing going on there...” The northeastern states are reporting increased Covid-19 caseloads, with 47 of the 73 worst-affected districts in the country belonging to the region, according to government data. Arunachal Pradesh alone has high case positivity in 18 districts, followed by Rajasthan in 10, Manipur in nine, Kerala in seven and Meghalaya in six.Experts say that following Covid-appropriate behaviour is the only way to curb disease transmission in the long run. “Vaccinating the entire population will take a long time; therefore, people will have to make behavioural changes that have been laid out by experts to prevent the disease from spreading. Wearing of masks, hand hygiene and maintaining overall cleanliness and good sanitary conditions, physical distancing, etc., is a must along with vaccination,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-warns-against-revenge-travellers-101625597595689.html
07-07-2021||India||Denied entry to SG’s house: TMC leader||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kunal Ghosh on Tuesday claimed that he tried to enter the residence of Solicitor General of India, Tushar Mehta, in New Delhi but was denied entry without an appointment, to find gaps in a statement issued by the senior lawyer last week on his meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Nandigram in West Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari. Adhikari is an accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case that the Central Bureau of Investigation has been investigating. Mehta, the Union government’s second highest law officer, is representing the CBI in the case in the Calcutta high court and Supreme Court. “The security guards did not allow me to enter and told me that without an appointment, I cannot enter (SG’s house). This is the norm. So, how can Adhikari enter the residence with his armed guards when he is an accused in a CBI case? This means he had a prior appointment. This proves that he was trying to influence the case,” Ghosh told reporters.While both Mehta and Adhikari have denied meeting each other at the SG’s residence in Delhi on July 1, TMC national general secretary and nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Abhishek Banerjee, demanded that the SG reveal CCTV footage to substantiate his claim.Mehta last week had said in a statement that Adhikari had come to his residence-cum-office, in Delhi at 3 pm on July 1 but left without any meeting as he was preoccupied. The TMC has already sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the removal of the SG for alleged misconduct and impropriety. On Monday, a two-member delegation of TMC parliamentarians met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum in this regard.Calling it a tactic to divert attention from real issues, Bharatiya Janata Party state chief Jay Prakash Majumdar said: “The TMC is trying to divert the attention of the people from major issues. The SG knows his job and his jurisdictions. Ghosh has said that Adhikari has been named by the prime accused in the Saradha chit fund case and needs to be interrogated. When Ghosh was arrested a few years ago, he had named Mamata Banerjee in the case. That also needs to be probed,” he said.The SG was not available for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/denied-entry-to-sg-s-house-tmc-leader-101625597475761.html
07-07-2021||India||Common exams for central govt jobs deferred over Covid||The first-ever common eligibility test (CET), which was to be held by the newly constituted National Recruitment Agency (NRA) by the end of this year, has been delayed due to the pandemic, Union minister for personnel, pensions, and grievances Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday. The test is to select candidates for non-gazetted posts in the central government and public sector banks, which is at present being done through separate examinations conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).“This unique initiative undertaken with the personal intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to screen and shortlist candidates for recruitment to central government jobs was scheduled to take off with the first such test before the end of this year but is likely to get delayed on account of the Covid pandemic,” Singh said at the launch of an e-book, Civil List-2021 of IAS officers. He, however, didn’t specify a date for the exam. He added that CET would bring “ease of recruitment” to young job aspirants and be a “great boon” to those who live in remote areas. “The NRA will be a multi-agency body which will conduct the common test to screen and shortlist candidates for Group B and C (non-technical) posts,” Singh said. “The most significant feature of this reform is that every district in the country will have at least one examination centre which would greatly enhance access to the candidates living in far-flung areas.” The minister also highlighted the bureaucratic reforms undertaken by the government since 2014, such as the decision to do away with the age-old practice of getting documents attested by a gazetted officer and replacing it with self-attestation and three-month central government stint as assistant secretaries for IAS officers at the beginning of their career.The government has also launched mission Karamyogi to help streamline the training and competence building of civil servants. At the apex of the scheme will be the Prime Minister’s HR Council that will consist of select Union ministers, chief ministers, international leaders, and civil servants. The council will determine the “right person for the right role” and decide assignments accordingly, the minister informed. It is a major transition for the bureaucracy, as civil servants’ training will now become a “continuous process”. A dashboard will also monitor and audit the capacity building scheme, and a report will be submitted annually to ascertain its success, the department of personnel and training had said while announcing the scheme last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/common-exams-for-central-govt-jobs-deferred-over-covid-101625597296784.html
07-07-2021||India||Twitter can’t take forever to comply: HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday warned Twitter, saying the social media intermediary “will be in trouble” if it doesn’t comply with the new Information Technology Rules and appoint a resident grievance officers without any delay.“If Twitter thinks that they can take as much time as it wants in our country, then I will not permit that. You should have taken some firm steps to appoint the officer,” justice Rekha Palli said.The court granted time till Thursday for Twitter to specify a time frame by which it can appoint the grievance redressal officers after the company’s counsel sought some more time to contact the company’s executives in San Francisco.“Get clear instructions, or you will be in trouble,” said the judge, adding that the Union government is free to take any action against Twitter for not complying with the rules.The judge also pulled up Twitter, represented by senior advocate Sajjan Poovaya, for “misleading” the court and giving a “wrong impression” on the appointment of a regular grievance officer.“You never told me that it was an interim officer you appointed. Your counter [affidavit] gives the whole story which is very interesting. When a senior counsel makes a statement, I take it seriously,” she remarked.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Union government, told the court that despite the lapse of 42 days since the deadline of May 25 (when the new rules came into force), Twitter is yet to appoint the grievance redressal officers.“While the company is free to do business in India, its attitude cocks a snook at the digital sovereignty of the country... 42 days and no compliance and we have done nothing. Facebook has removed three crore (30 million) [pieces of] content. Google removed 3 lakh [pieces of] content. Twitter could have done better,” said the ASG. His reference is to recent compliance reports of the two companies that indicated the number of pieces of content taken down by the platform itself (for violation of its rules) or based on a complaint. On Monday, the Union government, in an affidavit, told the high court that Twitter has lost its immunity from criminal prosecution -- this is given to intermediaries -- for content on its platform due to its failure to appoint a grievance redressal officer under the new Information Technology rules.Submitting an affidavit in response to a petition by a lawyer, the government said that Twitter and other social media intermediaries were given a “sufficient” period of three months from February 25 to comply with the due diligence norm in order to avail of protection from prosecutions in cases of obnoxious and offensive content posted by a third party.To be sure, whether Twitter continues to enjoy this safe harbour protection is a matter that will be decided by the courts, not by the IT ministry or any other arm of the government. Twitter on Saturday told the high court that the three months timeline fixed by the Centre to appoint such officers under the new IT rules is “directional” but “not mandatory”. The social media intermediary had also told the court that it is in the “final stage” of appointing officers for grievance redressal.Under the new digital rules introduced on February 25, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter have to put in place a three-tier grievance redressal system and appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person, and resident grievance officer. The deadline for this was May 25. The new guidelines also require these companies to identify within 36 hours the originator of a flagged message as well as to regulate their content, and adopt measures such as tracing individual (offensive) messages and voluntary user verification. WhatsApp has separately approached the Delhi high court over the traceability issue. Proceedings before the high court on Tuesday commenced with senior advocate Poovaya telling the court that his submissions on the appointment of a resident grievance officer on May 31 were premised on instructions he received from the company.He informed the court that even this interim resident grievance officer, who was actually a lawyer, tendered his resignation on June 21 and that the company is in the process of appointing a new one.He added said that his clients are not in compliance with the IT rules as a result. To this, the judge said, “What do you mean you are in the process? The rules are binding on you…It’s been more than two weeks since the person resigned... You have misled the court and gave a wrong impression. You never said that it was an interim officer that you were appointing. But be that as it may, if he went away on June 21, the least that Twitter was expected to do was to appoint a fresh officer in these 14 days before the matter was coming up.” The court was hearing a plea by advocate Amit Acharya, who, through his counsel Akash Vajpai, contended that since no resident grievance officer has been appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform, he could not take action against two alleged offensive tweets by Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mohua Moitra and journalist Swati Chaturvedi.When the ASG pointed out that Twitter is in breach of the rules, the court said that it has already made it clear that Twitter will have to comply with the rules and asked the intermediary to give details of the efforts made for the compliance of the other provisions of the IT rules.“I don’t know whether I can ask for the details but let us see what progress is being made…The steps should be known to everyone,” the judge remarked, posting the matter for July 8.Twitter has been criticised by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for labelling tweets by one of its spokespersons “manipulated media” and has been questioned by the Delhi Police on the basis for doing so. The tweet in question pointed to a media outreach and social campaign document (a toolkit) that was purportedly put together by the Congress to target the government for its handling of Covid and the Central Vista project. The Congress has claimed the toolkit was forged.Twitter has also been summoned by the Ghaziabad Police over its role in amplifying a video that allegedly misrepresented an attack on an elderly Muslim man as a hate crime, and it also faces a bunch of police complaints about a wrong map of India on its website.Twitter has previously said it was committed to India as a vital market, but criticised the new IT rules and regulations that it said “inhibit free, open public conversation”.It has also raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several instances of confrontation between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by BJP leaders as “manipulated media”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-can-t-take-forever-to-comply-hc-101625596755621.html
07-07-2021||India||PDP says it won’t meet J&K delimitation panel||Srinagar: The Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) declined to meet the Delimitation Commission on Tuesday, even as leaders of other mainstream political parties in Kashmir met the members of the Centre’s panel hours after they arrived in Srinagar for a four-day tour.The commission – led by justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai – is in Jammu & Kashmir to interact with political parties and officials for “first hand” inputs on an exercise to carve out new constituencies in the Union territory.The PDP said it decided to stay away from the exercise as it felt that the outcome of the process was already decided, aimed to take the power away from the people of J&K, and to realise the “political vision of a particular party”.Several parties, including the National Conference (NC), the People’s Conference (PC), the Congress, and the CPI(M) submitted separate memorandums to the visiting delegation, and urged it to allay apprehensions over the exercise by conducting it in a free and fair manner.“On the day PDP chose not to meet Delimitation Commission, ED sent a summon to my mother to appear in person for unknown charges. In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores,” Mufti tweeted on Tuesday. Her remarks came hours the Enforcement Directorate served a notice on Mufti’s mother, Gulshan Nazeer, asking her to appear at the agency’s office on July 14 in connection with a money-laundering case.At a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the national capital on June 24, J&K leaders were told that elections could not precede the delimitation exercise as the 2019 Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act laid down the condition of carving out new constituencies for the polls.Besides leaders of political parties, the commission will hold talks with district officials and other stakeholders on the ongoing process of carving out the new constituencies. The leaders of CPI, Panthers Party, Bharatiya Janata Party, Apni Party and Bhajun Samaj Party also met the Delimitation Commission on Tuesday.Former Supreme Court judge Desai heads the commission that was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of J&K, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. The commission has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise. It will also carve constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the first time in Jammu & Kashmir.The commission arrived in Srinagar a day after the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a grouping of political major parties such as the NC and PDP, said it was disappointed over the outcome of the all-party meeting with the Prime Minister. The alliance demanded the restoration of the region’s statehood before elections were held there. It also criticised the lack of “confidence-building measures”. The Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state as it effectively nullified Article 370 in August, 2019.A five-member NC delegation that met the commission told it that the exercise should have been done after the assembly elections, and termed it as an “unconstitutional exercise” based on the Reorganisation Act, which has been challenged in the Supreme Court.“We told them the entire Reorganisational Act is unconstitutional that has been already challenged in the Supreme Court. We also told them that people in J&K have lost faith on institutions so this should be done on transparent basis as people have lot of apprehensions and the craving out of the new constituencies should be done on the basis of population and nothing else,” said NC provisional president Nasir Aslam Wani, who was part of the delegation.The BJP delegation held a 30-minute interaction with the commission. “We told them the delimitation of assembly segments should be done on merit and due to huge population of Schedule Tribes, 9 to 10 assembly segments should be kept reserved for them. Also, we told them the previous delimitation had helped few political families of J&K which shouldn’t happen this time and villages of one district shouldn’t be put in another district during the process of redrawing the boundaries,” Sofi Yusuf, who led the delegation, said.On Wednesday, the commission will visit Pahalgam to hold meetings with officials and delegations from four districts of South Kashmir – Anantnag, Pulwama, Kulgam, and Shopian. In Srinagar, the panel will hold meetings related to Srinagar, Budgam, Ganderbal, Bandipore, Baramulla, and Kupwara districts.The commission will later travel to Kishtwar to hold discussions with officials of the Doda, Kishtwar, and Ramban districts. On July 9, the commission will meet delegations from Jammu, Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Udhampur, Samba and Reasi districts.Jammu & Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who led the Congress delegation, said that they asked the Delimitation Commission about their plan on redrawing of boundaries for creating new assembly segments.“The commission members told us that the process will be transparent based on the suggestions of different political parties. However, our view is that the process should have been done in 2026 along with the entire country with a new Census.”Mir said that the Congress delegation conveyed to them this was a wrong process initiated by the Centre on the basis of August 5, 2019 move. “We didn’t give any suggestions to them as this process, we feel, is not legal.”Peoples Conference spokesperson Adnan Ashraf said the party’s delegation told the commission that there were rumours that the aim of the delimitation exercise was to take away the power of the people in Kashmir.In a letter to the panel, PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura said that with the abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A on August 5,2019 “unconstitutionally” , the people of J&K were “humiliated and demeaned”.“The Reorganisation Act being a product of the same process, we are of the considered opinion that the Delimitation Commission lacks legal and constitution mandate in the first place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-says-it-won-t-meet-j-k-delimitation-panel-101625596575638.html
07-07-2021||India||200 farmers to protest outside Parliament from July 22: SKM||New Delhi: Farmers protesting three agricultural laws say that will begin demonstrating outside Parliament on July 22 as part of a new push to force the government to scrap a set of legislation enacted last year. Farm unions have been holding meetings to work out logistics and finalise strategies to intensify their agitation and coordinate movement of farmers from various states. According to a plan announced by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions spearheading the protests since November last year against the three laws, nearly 200 farmers will protest outside Parliament every day during the Monsoon session. The SKM also said that farm organisations and like-minded groups will hold countrywide protests against rising fuel prices on July 8. Parliament is set to convene on July 19 for its upcoming Monsoon session. Farm unions say they will soon dispatch a letter to all Opposition parties and lawmakers, urging them to raise the issue of the three farm laws during the entire session, said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait. Farmers on tractors are likely to file into the Capital on July 21 evening. Accommodation arrangements have been beefed up at all current protest sites, Dharmendra Singh of the BKU said.Thousands of farmers have pitched tents at five sites near Delhi’s borders -- Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and Shahjahanpur (on the Rajasthan-Haryana border) -- from where they have been carrying on their protests. They have also constructed a permanent weatherproof shelter for arriving farmers at the Tikri site, said Dharmendra Singh, a member of the BKU. The farmers’ march towards Parliament is sure to be resisted by police because demonstrations near Parliament are not allowed, setting the stage for a potential standoff. “It will be a peaceful protest. Nearly 200 protesters will demonstrate every day outside Parliament. The government is not interested in talking to farmers because the government isn’t being run by any party but by companies,” Rakesh Tikait, the leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said. On January 26, a rally taken out by farmers to celebrate Republic Day turned violent, as protesters clashed with policeman and breached Red Fort in the national capital. Farm unions had then called off a planned march to Parliament. Cultivators from various towns and villages in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have joined those already protesting in many of sites. A large convoy arrived from Pilibhit inUttar Pradesh before moving to various sites on Monday, DharmendraSingh said. “These farm laws are black laws. They must be taken back. Farmers will be very peaceful while protesting. The violence that broke out during the Republic Day in Delhi was a conspiracy to defame farmers,” said Joginder Singh Urgrahan of the BKU Ekta Ugrahan group, which represents a large section of farmers in Punjab. The farmers want three agricultural laws repealed, and say that the legislation will leave them at the mercy of large corporations and jeopardise their livelihoods. The laws, broadly, seek to minimise regulations in trade of farm produce, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of commodities for future sales, and set new national rules for contract farming. The government has said the laws would bring competition and widen farmers’ access to markets. Allowing firms to stock large quantities of food commodities will incentivise them to invest in supply and storage, the government has argued. Farmers say the laws will force them to sell to corporate giants with greater bargaining powers at poor prices instead of government-run markets, which offer assured prices for cereals. Unregulated markets will ultimately lead to a collapse of regulated markets that offer minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers say, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied this will ever happen. MSPs are benchmark prices the government offers for farm produce, aimed at signalling a floor rate for private traders.“The honourable agriculture minister has said that the government is willing to talk about all issues farmers may have except repeal of the laws. So our doors are open,” a farm ministry official, who was at the helm of previous rounds of talks between the government and farmers, said. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “The government wants to turn our annadatas (providers of food) into bonded labourers. Farmers are demanding their rights and the laws should be repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-farmers-to-protest-outside-parliament-from-july-22-skm-101625596337345.html
07-07-2021||India||Release all Bhima Koregaon accused, Oppn parties write to Prez||New Delhi: Leaders of 10 Opposition parties on Tuesday wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind expressing outrage at the death of activist and undertrial prisoner Stan Swamy, calling for the immediate release of all people accused in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case and other political prisoners. The letter came a day after the 84-year-old Jesuit priest died of a cardiac arrest at a time the Bombay high court was hearing his medical bail plea. Swamy was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last October for allegedly being a part of banned Maoist organisations and fomenting violence on January 1, 2018 at Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village. The leaders said they were writing to the President in “deep anguish” and called the cases against Swamy, including those under anti-terror laws, false.“We are urging your immediate intervention as the President of India to direct your government to act against those responsible for foisting false cases on him, his continued detention in jail and inhuman treatment. They must be held accountable,” the joint letter said. “It is now incumbent that all those jailed in the Bhima Koregaon case and other detenues under politically motivated cases, misusing draconian laws like UAPA [Unlawful Activities Prevention Act], sedition etc, be released forthwith,” the leaders added.The letter was signed by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, former prime minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee (Trinamool Congress), Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and his Jharkhand counterpart Hemant Soren (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha) have also signed the letter. Among the other signatories are D Raja (Communist Party of India), Sitaram Yechury (Communist Party of India-Marxist) and Tejashwi Yadav (Rashtriya Janata Dal).The leaders alleged that Swamy was denied treatment for various ailments including Parkinson’s disease.“Only after a nationwide campaign was conducted that even a sipper to drink liquids was made available to him in jail. The numerous appeals made to shift him out of the overcrowded Taloja jail that had seen a huge rise in Covid cases went unheeded. His appeals for bail and being sent home too were rejected. Thanks to the Bombay high court’s intervention he was admitted to a private hospital when his condition started deteriorating after he was infected with Covid. But it was too late to prevent his death in custody,” the letter added.Swamy was the oldest of 16 activists and lawyers arrested on charges of conspiring to foment violence at Bhima Koregaon village in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018. The village was rocked by caste clashes during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war by Dalits.He was arrested on October 8, 2020 by NIA, which alleged that the priest had Maoist connections and was working for frontal organisations of the banned CPI (Maoist). He was charged under the UAPA and was sent to Taloja jail. In his defence, Swamy said evidence against him was fabricated and that he never conspired to foment violence.Meanwhile, the BJP reacted to the letter saying that it is another attempt by the opposition to “play the politics.”BJP national spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said that opposition has always sided with the international organisations which are blatantly “anti-Modi” and this whole ecosystem of hate against PM involves global media as well.He added that Indian laws are “very strong” and all the institutions of the state are “taking care of constitutional rights of everybody.”Without naming Swamy, Agarwal added, “But opposition in all its actions and statements only talks about the human rights of those people who at one point in time seem to be involved in anti-national activities.”He added that the opposition “never talks” about human rights violations of the “nationalist people”. “This (letter) is all a part of the opposition’s clear-cut strategy against Modi government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/release-all-bhima-koregaon-accused-oppn-parties-write-to-prez-101625596275641.html

Police officers stumbled upon the racket when they were probing a complaint by a Bhopal-based businessman who said he invested ₹1 crore in a company dealing with spices on the advice of a woman he met in February through a dating site.Yogesh Chaudhary, MP’s additional director general of police, said the businessman was told to deposit the money in four bank accounts. “During investigation, it was found that the accused used to open bank accounts of fake companies in the nationalized banks. They used to target businessmen and asked them to deposit money in these accounts for investment. They used to convert the money into cryptocurrency with the help of agents, who were not aware of the fraud, and later sent to Pakistan through an international crypto exchange,” Chaudhary said.Police identified the four persons arrested by MP’s Cyber Crime Cell as Avik Kedia, a chartered accountant from Gurugram, Dolly Makhija, a company secretary and businessmen Vikki Makhija from Delhi and Dilip Patel from Gujarat.Chaudhary claimed the accused have carried out transactions worth ₹50 crore.He added that three people including an unidentified Chinese national were also involved in the fraud.The police officer, however, did not elaborate about the Pakistani agent, insisting that they were still questioning the four suspects.Police have seized 60 digital signatures of directors of shell companies, three laptops, four pen drivers, a mobile phone, crypto trading statements, documents related to fake firms, Aadhaar and PAN cards of different people and four cheque books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bizman-invested-rs-1-cr-on-advice-of-woman-he-met-on-dating-site-4-arrested-101625596218580.html
07-07-2021||India||From 17 to zero: Goa is India’s first state to eradicate rabies deaths||On May 17, animal husbandry director Agostinho Mesquita issued a notification declaring Goa a “rabies-controlled” state. For Murugan Appupillai, the India Education Director of Mission Rabies, it was a day he was long waiting for. In 2014, when Mission Rabies, a UK-based charity, first began a pilot project to vaccinate stray dogs in the state, Goa had recorded 17 human deaths due to rabies. The last human death due to rabies was recorded in September 2017. No fresh case of rabies in humans has since been recorded, making Goa the first in the country to be declared a rabies-controlled state. It is on its way to becoming the country’s first rabies-free state.“We cannot yet call ourselves a rabies-free state because there are still some cases of dogs being detected with rabies especially in the border talukas of Goa, but we are getting there,” Appupillai said.Mission Rabies, in its first year of operation in Goa, vaccinated 20,400 and sterilised around 20,000 dogs, proving it was possible with greater manpower and dedication to vaccinate over 70% of them in the state. With the government agreeing to collaborate and fund the project to make Goa a rabies-free state, the non-profit organisation embarked on a mission to vaccinate 70% of the state’s dog population, including stray canines. It vaccinated over 100,000 dogs each year for three years in a row.The government notified a special scheme under which it bore the cost of the entire programme. This included purchases of syringes and rabies test kits, lab charges, the salaries of the drivers, dog catchers, and other expenditure heads. The government spent over ₹1.65 crore over three years on the scheme.“We recruited volunteers and trained them. A team visited a locality and caught as many dogs as possible. The next day a second team would visit the same locality and try to catch the dogs that were missed the first time,” said Appupillai.Also Read | When a demolition drive destroys a villageJaigar O’Neill of Mission Rabies said, in a blog post, “Over 500 vets from 16 different countries arrived in India to volunteer alongside local vets, animal handlers, and skilled dog catchers. Working together, we caught and vaccinated as many dogs as we could. Over 63,000 vaccinated dogs in 30 days.”Under Mission Rabies, 540,593 rabies vaccinations were administered to dogs. Nearly a million people were educated about dog bite prevention. 24-hour rabies surveillance, including an emergency hotline, rapid response team, and a support team, were set up for dog bite victims.“The reason why rabies was not tackled earlier was that it is a neglected disease. Rabies is not a new disease. In fact, it goes back to more than 3,000 years ago. India is the global hotspot for rabies with more than 20,000 rabies deaths each year which is the highest recorded by any country annually. It is a shame for India more so because a vaccine is available and has been available for more than 100 years since the days of Louis Pasteur,” Appupillai said.“In the western world, it has already mostly been eliminated but in India, it is endemic because nothing was done methodically.”There is no reason to celebrate just yet. While there may be no cases of humans dying of rabies, but dogs continue to contract the disease. “The number of (recorded) rabies cases in dogs were just seven a year when the pandemic...struck. In neighbouring Maharashtra, where the (Covid-19) lockdown was in force for several months, and restaurants were closed there has been a migration of dogs from across the border in search of food and they are mixing with local dogs,” Appupillai saidAs a result, the surveillance teams of Mission Rabies noticed a rise in cases of rabies among dogs. Over the last year, 24 cases of rabies among canines were found, more than three times the previous year’s seven recorded cases.Also Read | As Reliance promises leap into clean energy, green economics becomes mainstreamAs cases began to rise, Mission Rabies began revaccinating dogs in the border talukas to prevent a recurrence of the disease and keep the virus under check.In June 2021 (last month), 30 necropsies (autopsies on animals) were performed, and two dogs were confirmed positive for rabies. Although one of the positive dogs was from Maharashtra, the other dog was from Mollem in Dharbandora (Goa). The vaccination teams are now undertaking intensive vaccination across Dharbandora.“We have to ensure that more than 70% of the dogs are vaccinated as beyond that herd immunity kicks in and the virus remains in check,” Appupillai . He added their “maintenance” project needs to be continued to ensure that the gains over the last few years are not squandered.He hoped that more states will be willing to come forward to replicate the project. So far, only Bengaluru city officials have asked for a similar exercise.But with Goa becoming the first state to eradicate rabies, Appupillai expects things will change.O’Neill said the people of Goa will take pride in what their state has managed to achieve and take action to support rabies control. “Other states will see that Goa has made rabies control possible in India and be encouraged to do the same. This change in Goa is a momentous moment in the fight against rabies, in India and across the world. However, there is still a lot of work to do to stop rabies from re-emerging in Goa and declare it rabies-free.”Signages have now been installed across Goa informing both visitors and locals that Goa is a rabies controlled state. “More boards will be placed on beaches and at prominent tourist sites over the coming weeks. To mark Goa as a rabies controlled area, all pets entering the state are now required to be vaccinated against rabies,” Appupillai said.Chief minister Pramod Sawant too congratulated Mission Rabies.“We have now achieved 5,40,593 vaccinations against rabies in dogs and educated nearly one million people in dog bite prevention across Goa as well as we have set up 24-hours rabies surveillance involving an emergency hotline and rapid response team for dog bite victims,” Sawant said. “We are happy to say that in the last three years we do not have a single case of rabies in Goa.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-17-to-zero-goa-is-india-first-state-to-eradicate-rabies-deaths-101625565254674.html

07-07-2021||Today's||The Afghan endgame: The US retreats, Taliban returns||With the last batch of American soldiers returning home from Bagram Air Base, once the symbol of the United States (US)’s presence in Afghanistan, on July 2, the longest war in the America’s history is drawing to an end. However, around 650 soldiers will stay back with the limited mission of protecting the US embassy and Kabul’s international airport.In order to allay fears that the US is abandoning Afghanistan, President Joe Biden hosted an Oval Office meeting on June 25 with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, Abdullah Abdullah.While Biden’s conversation may have been reassuring for the two beleaguered Afghan leaders, most people knew that it could well be the last time a US president would be hosting a pro-American Afghan president at the White House.Afghanistan’s situation today is precarious. The Taliban, already in the country, assisted by those streaming in from Pakistan, have captured broad swathes of territory with little resistance from Afghan government troops. On the weekend after President Biden’s announcement, the Taliban swept through a series of districts in northern Afghanistan and more than 1,000 Afghan government troops fled across the border.Some intelligence reports now predict a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan within six months to two years of the US departure. The consequences of this could be disastrous for the people of Afghanistan and peace in the region.Under Taliban rule, many of the gains made during the past two decades, especially in the areas of literacy and women’s empowerment, might be wiped away. It is also questionable whether the Taliban will deliver on the counterterrorism guarantees it has made.Why is this turnaround on Afghanistan taking place? The primary reasons include the US mindset on Afghanistan, the positions of the players in the region, and the nature of Afghanistan itself.The US entered Afghanistan after 9/11 to destroy the Taliban and in pursuit of Osama bin Laden. Outside of that primary purpose, the mission has been extremely muddled and increasingly expensive in terms of money and lives. It has claimed 2,400 American troops and 3,800 private soldiers employed by the US military, with costs running into billions of dollars.Whatever domestic support was there to begin with for the war, has shrunk over time with the majority of Americans today opposed to US involvement in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama reduced troop presence considerably between 2012 and 2016. President Donald Trump announced a full pullout by May 1, 2021, if the Taliban met the commitments it made in the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan on February 29, 2020. President Biden sealed the deal by beating the September 11, 2021, deadline that he had set for withdrawal.Nations in the region and those invested or interested in Afghanistan have seen the writing on the wall regarding its future.New Delhi, which has long been a significant player in Afghanistan, has been preparing for the US withdrawal and the potential fall of Kabul. Many have linked the Indian government’s recent talks with Kashmiri leaders to the US withdrawal and a potential return of the Taliban to Kabul.India is not the only country in the region concerned about the Taliban’s rise. Iran, China, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and the Gulf states, some of which bankrolled the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, all have skin in the Afghan game. Like India, it is reported that Russia, Iran, China and others have held negotiations with the Taliban.One country, as before, will play an outsized role in relations with Afghanistan going forward and that is its neighbour and longtime benefactor of the Taliban, Pakistan. Islamabad’s influence on the Taliban may have dwindled over the decades, but Pakistan is thought to still hold considerable sway over the militia.Afghanistan has been in an almost endless state of conflict and civil war since 1978. The US presence in this latest war brought about a modicum of stability beginning in 2001 but at a heavy cost. Over the past two decades, more than 66,000 Afghan soldiers and 100,000 civilians have died, and over 2.7 million rendered homeless.There is no simple answer to what lies ahead. It appears likely, however, that in the near-term, the Taliban will gain control of much of the country, except for Kabul which is well-fortified and protected by the US and a selected international presence. However, the US embassy in Kabul already has an “emergency action plan” in place and arrangements are being made for the evacuation of thousands of Afghan interpreters who assisted the US during this war.The Taliban has been emboldened by the American withdrawal and the prospects for a negotiated peace for Afghanistan have grown exceedingly dim.In spite of this, it should be remembered that hope dies last. Peace talks must be pursued. Peace must be given a chance. It is the last and best hope for Afghanistan and its beleaguered people.Frank F Islam is an entrepreneur, civic leader, and thought leader based in Washington DCThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-afghan-endgame-the-us-retreats-taliban-returns-101625668220231.html
07-07-2021||Today's||The killer drones are here. Get ready||In the Terminator movies, a relentless super-robot tracked and attempted to kill human targets. A few decades later, killer robots are openly sold and deployed in the field of battle. These killer robots — flying drones — are cheaper and probably a lot less discriminating than the movie models. The Chinese-made drones that Pakistani terrorists used to attack the Indian Air Force station in Jammu were destructive enough, but a newer generation of drones poses a greater threat. The Turkish-made Kargu-2 model of killer drone can allegedly autonomously track and kill specific targets on the basis of facial recognition and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A United Nations report claims that that model has been used to mount autonomous attacks on human targets. These drones hunted down retreating military convoys and attacked them indiscriminately, without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munitions, a true “fire, forget and find” capability.The arrival and rapid proliferation of killer drones is no surprise. For decades, consumer technology has been outpacing military adoption of advanced technologies. Because a drone is essentially a smartphone with rotors attached, today’s affordable consumer drones are a product of the rapid development of smartphone technologies. Making access to the third dimension essentially free and creating commercial opportunities, drones can now deliver groceries and medical supplies to your doorstep.But endowing drones with human-like cognitive abilities, through AI, will make powerful targeted weapons available to rogue militaries, terrorists, and rampaging teenagers, at a fraction of the cost of the fancy drones that the United States (US) government flies. And unless we take steps to stop this, instructions to turn cheap off-the-shelf drones into automated killers will be posted on the internet.To date, AI has struggled to provide an accurate identification of objects and faces in the field. It is easily confused when an image is slightly modified by adding text. An image-recognition system that was trained to identify an apple as a fruit was tricked into identifying an apple as an iPod, simply by taping to the apple a piece of paper with the word “iPod” printed on it. Protesters in Hong Kong have used paint on their faces to confound the government facial-recognition efforts. Environmental factors, such as fog, rain, snow, and bright light, too can dramatically reduce the accuracy of AI-using recognition systems.This may allow forces to adopt relatively simple countermeasures to confound current drone recognition systems, but to actors who already place a low value on collateral damage and innocent victims, such accuracy is a lesser concern than it is to human rights activists and others concerned about the loss of innocent lives.The effectiveness of drones in zeroing in on targets enables their deployment as new weapons of mass destruction. A swarm of drones bearing explosives and dive-bombing a sports event or any densely populated urban area could kill numerous people and would be hard to stop.Various companies are now selling drone countermeasure systems with different strategies to stop rogue flying objects, and advanced militaries have already deployed electronic countermeasures to interrupt the control systems of drones. But, so far, shooting down even one drone remains a challenge. Israel recently demonstrated an impressive flying laser that can vaporise drones, but shooting down an entire swarm of them is well beyond our capabilities. And simply blocking communication to the drones is not enough; it may be critical to be able to safely bring them to earth in order to avert random chaos and harm.To a group intent on causing significant damage, autonomous drones open a field of possibilities. Imagine attacks on 100 different locations on a single day; the effects of the Mumbai or World Trade Center terrorist attacks would pale in comparison.India is reportedly looking to procure Israeli anti-drone SMASH 2000 Plus systems, among the most advanced defensive weapons in the world. But even these are obsolete technologies: They can’t protect the country from swarms of drones or from attacks launched within cities.Asymmetrical warfare disproportionately benefits the forces of chaos rather than the forces of liberty. We require a global moratorium on killer robots of all kinds, including unmanned aerial vehicles. But this is not likely to happen because countries making this new wave of autonomous flying weapons are marketing their wares heavily. The US and China have both refused to back calls for a ban on the development and production of fully autonomous weapons, and so are providing a cover of tacit, putative legitimacy for weapons-makers and governments deploying the drones in the field.In order to be able to establish a defence against such possibilities, India must put its own scientists and innovators on war-footing. India has the skill and doesn’t need to look abroad; even Indian teenagers can assemble drones and write sophisticated AI systems. The Defence Research and Development Organisation has some systems in development, but the government should dramatically increase funding in research and startups and have its military, industry, and academia work together. It should make the development of defensive technologies a national priority, just as China has in developing destructive weapons and surveillance systems.In anticipating the Covid-19 pandemic, India was complacent. We have long known about the dangers of genetic engineering and the possibility of lab accidents, yet did not halt China’s reckless research or prepare bio-defences against it. Yes, the rest of the world was equally complacent. But in failing to anticipate the development of artificially intelligent killer drones, that mitigating circumstance will offer no help and no excuse.Vivek Wadhwa is the author of From Incremental to Exponential: How Large Companies Can See the Future and Rethink Innovation, and The Driver in the Driverless Car: How Our Technology Choices Will Create the FutureThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-killer-drones-are-here-get-ready-101625667800097.html
07-07-2021||Today's||In order to delay the next wave, a dynamic unlock strategy is key||As the second wave ebbs, bazaars are witnessing crowds, and holiday destinations, especially hill stations, are overwhelmed by visitors. While restrictions needed to be eased, many states appear to have acted in haste, opening too much too quickly. This approach is in contrast with that of other countries such as the United Kingdom (UK), which prepared a detailed, granular opening up strategy, implemented over many months.The timing and intensity of the next wave are dependent upon a combination of four factors — immunity after natural infection, people’s adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviours (CAB), vaccination coverage, and the emergence of new variants and their transmissibility. If people adhere to CAB and vaccination rapidly scales up, the next wave can be delayed and managed.As governments continue to ease restrictions and as citizens leap back into the world, they must remember that the virus is still around; new variants are more transmissible; vaccination coverage is low; and the opening up strategy has to be science-based and graded. This can have the following components.Also Read: Scientifically Speaking | Investigating immunity levels from Covid-19 vaccinesOne, since we now know that the virus transmits through air (in addition to droplets), any strategy must be based on opening outdoor spaces first and then drafting and implementing a detailed strategy to open indoor spaces. The owners of indoor establishments should be encouraged and facilitated to improve ventilation in their shops. The government may allow such indoor establishments to operate partially from the outdoor space. This principle needs to be reiterated since some governments haven’t recognised that the airborne nature of the disease requires an emphasis on the outdoors.Two, increase monitoring to track adherence to CAB. Professional agencies can be involved in real-time data collection, and academic institutions should analyse this data. This analysis should be used for a calibrated and evidence-based opening up as well as to design targeted communication strategies for the adoption of CAB.Three, learn from other relevant settings. Bangladesh effectively used the NORM approach to increase mask-use in public places, where NORM stands for No cost (or free) distribution of masks; Offering Information about CAB; Reinforcing messages at public places and markets; and Modelling of behaviour by community leaders. Shopkeepers and resident welfare associations in urban areas and panchayats in rural areas should be actively engaged in the process.Four, a granular strategy essentially means that in a manner similar to the creation of micro-containment zones (for residential areas) in the initial months of the pandemic, a dynamic micro-social behaviour determined strategy is needed to implement localised restrictions. If data reveals that any market or public area is crowded and adherence to CAB is low, there must be monitoring and action by engaging with the market association. The number of people allowed to enter such market areas should be controlled, and possibly temporary restrictions should be implemented. This has to be a participatory and consultative process between market associations and the government, but with self-monitoring by shop-owners.The vaccination status of individuals should be used to facilitate the opening up of activities. This should be accompanied with targeted communication campaigns to tackle vaccine hesitancy and facilitate free vaccination of people involved in public dealings.The test positivity rate and the number of active cases cannot be the only parameters to open up. People’s behaviour and scientific learnings should be the basis of an unlock strategy, with flexibility for adoption in the local context. It should also be implemented in a decentralised manner, especially through ward-level administrative units.Unlock is not merely the removal of Covid-19-related restrictions but a strategy, between two waves of the pandemic, to slow down and halt virus transmission. If designed and implemented well, it can prove useful in increasing adherence to CAB and, hence, buy time to vaccinate more people.Chandrakant Lahariya, a physician-epidemiologist, is a public policy and health systems expert and co-author of Till We Win: India’s Fight Against The COVID-19 Pandemic The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-order-to-delay-the-next-wave-a-dynamic-unlock-strategy-is-key-101625662160307.html
07-07-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | Investigating immunity levels from Covid-19 vaccines||Imagine that it is 2022. Having received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine a year ago, you are sitting in a doctor’s office waiting for a blood test to check how much immune protection you have against Sars-CoV-2.Creating a test that estimates the amount of immunity requires having what immunologists call correlates of immune protection — biomarkers that serve as measures of the ability to prevent infection or symptomatic Covid-19.Having biomarkers that correlate with vaccine effectiveness will allow researchers to check if immunity declines over time in vaccinated populations. It will also allow some people to be prioritised for booster shots, without the need to offer precious extra doses to others who do not need them.The frontrunners for such biomarkers are specific antibodies that the body generates after vaccination or after clearing the virus after natural infection. High levels of these neutralising antibodies give us the clearest path to determining the “strength” of immunity.Also Read | Lambda variant: All you need to know about fast spreading strainCorrelates of protection also help in predicting the effectiveness of approved vaccines against new variants without the need for full-fledged efficacy trials. It lets researchers rapidly determine if candidate vaccines show promise by comparing them to already approved vaccines.Over a year into the pandemic, we know that running large-scale efficacy trials takes time. Covaxin reported phase III trial results more than six months after emergency approval. A smaller phase III trial with immune responses correlated to efficacy will be useful in approving future vaccines instead of costly and time-consuming field trials.Now, there are multiple lines of evidence that neutralising antibodies that bind to the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 and specifically the receptor-binding domain part of it correlate with immunity. These studies also provide the first range of antibody concentrations that might provide reasonable protection with vaccines. There are neutralising antibodies levels above which vaccines are effective.A two-dose vaccine helps maintain a high level of neutralising antibodies. Research has shown that a third dose of the same vaccine may help to boost antibody levels to earlier amounts, should the need arise. Currently, a third dose is not advised for any of the variants (except in rare cases of those who have weak immune responses due to solid tumours). Three different approaches point to neutralising antibody levels correlating with immune protection. One approach published in Nature Medicine on May 17 by Triccas and colleagues, plotted a mathematical correlation between the amount of neutralising antibodies and the reported vaccine efficacy from clinical trials.Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax elicited the strongest antibody responses and the most protection, while AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson generated weaker antibody responses and less protection. The researchers predicted from neutralising antibody levels that Covaxin might demonstrate an efficacy of around 80%. This turned out to be quite accurate since an efficacy of 78% from phase III trials was reported on July 3.A second approach is to conduct experiments on non-human primates. An advantage of this approach is that these animals are biologically similar to humans and can be “challenged” with a high-dose of Sara-CoV-2 to test for levels of protection after vaccination, something which is considered unethical to do in humans.A preprint posted on BioRxiv on April 23 by Barney Graham’s team found that spike-protein-specific antibodies are correlates of protection in primates. The levels of these antibodies after receiving the Moderna vaccine predicted the amount of protection.Protection after exposure in primates provides an estimate for the strength of neutralising antibodies needed to prevent Covid-19 in people too. Reassuringly, even small amounts of neutralising antibodies were effective at protecting against Sars-CoV-2.A third approach is to compare biomarkers in people who received the vaccine and were protected against those who still had breakthrough infection or symptomatic disease. Some vaccinated people are infected since none of the vaccines are 100% effective in preventing infection or symptomatic Covid-19. The goal here is to compare the two sets of people and see if the levels of neutralising antibodies in a person is a good predictor of protection from breakthrough cases.Data from the Oxford vaccine group examined neutralising antibody levels 28 days after the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Preliminary results, which were posted on medRxiv on June 24, show that high levels of spike-protein and receptor-binding domain specific neutralising antibodies correlate with a lower chance of symptomatic Covid-19. However, correlation with asymptomatic infection was not established.How should we interpret these three studies on neutralising antibodies? Antibodies are only one arm of the immune system and there are redundancies in immunity: T cells have substantial contribution in protection against Covid-19. They can step in to offer protection when antibody levels decline or variants emerge that evade antibody recognition.It helps to think of immune protection as a sliding scale from ideal scenario of preventing infection altogether, to asymptomatic infection, to symptomatic Covid-19 progressing in the order of mild, moderate, and severe disease requiring hospitalisation. Complete protection would result in no infection or symptoms. Incomplete protection would reduce the severity of disease.Strong levels of neutralising antibodies that bind well to virus help prevent infection and replication in the body. However, a combination of antibody and T cells can prevent severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation. Loss of antibodies or the inability to make them might not reduce protection against serious disease. Even after infection, antibody levels wane after an acute immune response phase. However, memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells can help the immune system kickstart a rapid response on re-exposure to the virus.High levels of spike-protein-specific antibodies seem to be a good predictor of strong immune protection. But it isn’t clear that low levels correspond with loss of protection in all cases. For example, neutralising antibodies after the first dose of either Moderna or Pfizer vaccine are low, in contrast with real-world protection in either scenario.Still, the preliminary data are encouraging. Earlier this month, Nature ran a story that the United Kingdom might approve an inactivated Sars-CoV-2 vaccine by Valneva if it elicits more antibodies in a 4,000 participant trial than that obtained after vaccination with two doses of AstraZeneca.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From FictionThese are his personal views||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/scientifically-speaking-investigating-immunity-levels-from-covid-19-vaccines-101625639238542.html
