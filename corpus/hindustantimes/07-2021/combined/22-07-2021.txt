Other hill stations too recorded extremely heavy rain (above 204.5mm over the course of a day), with Matheran (in Raigad district) notching up 331mm of rain and Lonavala (in Pune district) clocking a total 313mm of rain.The downpour led to severe flooding or waterlogging in parts of Ratnagiri, Raigad, Satara and Kohlapur, and had been foreseen by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) a day prior. These districts had been placed under a ‘red’ category storm warning alert, indicating a high possibility of severe weather. IMD had particularly warned of “extremely heavy rainfall likely at isolated places in ghat areas.”“Friday and Saturday are days to watch in these districts, even though they have been placed under an orange category alert. We expect that the intensity of rains will start decreasing from Friday, but doppler radar images from Thursday evening showed very intense rain bands over the western ghats and there is a chance of further heavy spells during the night,” said a spokesperson with IMD’s Pune office on Thursday.Dr J R Kulkarni, a retired meteorologist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, said, “The intensity of the rain would have been compounded by the orographic effect of the western ghats. Since the Mahabaleshwar area is also the source of the Krishna river and feeds a lot of the channels that flow toward the windward side of the ghats, the runoff would have, no doubt, driven flooding in some of the low-lying areas along the west coast, as well as on the leeward side in places like Satara and Kohlapur.”Kulkarni added that 480mm of rain in a day for Mahabaleshwar is alarming, and certainly bears a strong signature of climate change, but at the same time is not surprising or unusual for the area. He, along with other independent meteorologists HT spoke with, said that forecasting the distribution and intensity of rains in the Western Ghats is far trickier owing to the landscape than in coastal areas. “You see the same problem in the Himalayan foothills, for example. 480mm of rain in a single day in a place like Mahabaleshwar is indeed very hard to predict,” added Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher with the University of Reading, UK. With the average total rainfall (from June 1) standing at 2032.7mm, the Konkan and Goa meteorological sub-division are currently the wettest in the entire country, in absolute terms. The rainfall amount is 45% above the normal up to July 22, which is 1402.7mm. Just this month alone, Konkan and Goa have together recorded an average rainfall amount 1191.9mm, which is 60% above the normal up to July 22, which comes to 747.2mm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-480mm-mahabaleshwar-gets-highest-daily-july-rainfall-101626977880694.html

22-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Floods and landslides hit outstation, local trains||As heavy rains lashed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Konkan, both suburban and outstation trains were disrupted. While the Mumbai-Nashik route was affected due to landslides in the Kasara ghat section, the Konkan Railway was disrupted due to floods in Ratnagiri and Raigad districts. Though Mumbai local trains did face some problems early morning, the situation was normalised as the day progressed. Rains caused massive damage in terms of track washouts as well as waterlogging on the Central Railway (CR) network. There were disruptions at 21 locations. Throughout the day, 35 trains were diverted, 51 were terminated and 48 were cancelled.The heavy showers in the Bhor and Thul ghats on Central Railway routes of Titwala-Igatpuri and Ambarnath-Lonavala bore the brunt as a boulder fell on the tracks. There were also track washouts, waterlogging, tree fallings as well as damage to signal posts and overhead equipment (OHE). This affected the train services on this route. The CR administration ensured that no trains are held up in between stations and regulated the trains at the stations like Kasara, Igatpuri, Badlapur and Khadavali.Buses were arranged for stranded passengers in Kasara and Igatpuri to transport them to Kalyan. Around 75 buses from Igatpuri transported 4,835 passengers to Kalyan, while 29 buses at Kasara transported 1,249 passengers to Kalyan.In Shahapur, around 100 state transport buses were sent to help stranded passengers of mail trains on the Khadavli-Kasara railway route. At Umbarmali railway station, around 2,500- 3,000 passengers who were stranded on mail trains due to waterlogging on railway tracks, were safely moved through buses.Due to heavy rain, the water level of the Vasishti river bridge between Chiplun and Kamathe stations in the Ratnagiri region rose above the danger level. Due to this, the passenger train services in the sector were suspended.In Mumbai, there was a point failure between Churchgate and Marine Lines station on both slow and fast trains track at 6:12am, due to which, they were diverted on other lines. Normalcy was resumed at 7:26am.The Karmali-CSMT and CSMT-Karnani Tejas Express were cancelled. In addition, the CR also rescheduled the outstation trains of Lokmanya Tilak-Thiruvanthapuram Central Daily-Special as well as Lokmanya Tilak-Manguluru Central Daily-Special by a few hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-floods-and-landslides-hit-outstation-local-trains-101626977641325.html
22-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Modak Sagar and Tansa lake overflow||The Modak Sagar and Tansa lakes began to overflow on Thursday morning, becoming the third and fourth lakes among the seven, that provides water to Mumbai, to overflow this monsoon. The Tulsi lake was the first one to overflow this monsoon, on July 16, followed by the Vihar lake that overflowed on July 18. The Modak Sagar lake overflowed at 3.24am on Thursday, while Tansa lake overflowed at 5.48am. On Thursday, the cumulative water available in the seven lakes that provide water to Mumbai was at 53.86%, up from 33.22% on Tuesday morning. In comparison, on the same day last year, the seven lakes had 28.77% useful water content. On the same day in 2019, Mumbai’s lakes had 53.76% useful water content. As of Thursday, there is enough drinking water to last the city for over 180 days, with a total water stock of 779,568 million litres (ML). BMC provides the city with a total of 3850 ML drinking water per day. Less than a week ago, on Friday, lake levels in Mumbai were at 17%, prompting BMC’s hydraulics department to consider imposing a water cut for the city. The upper Vaitarna lake, which had 0% useful water content until Tuesday went up to 4% useful water content on Thursday morning, as it received 225mm rainfall in the 24 hours until 6am on Thursday, adding 2.07 metres to its water content. Of the total water capacity of Bhatsa, which is 717,037 ML, around 575,700 ML is allotted to BMC for use in the city. Presently, Bhatsa has 368,184 ML useful water, or 51.35% useful water content of its total capacity. Middle Vaitarna has 47.7% useful water content and 92,342 ML water at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-modak-sagar-and-tansa-lake-overflow-101626977580766.html
22-07-2021||Noida||Unique ID of potholes helps officials assess work of contractors||A special software that assigns a unique identification number to each pothole cropping up on city roads is helping officials of the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) to track the number of times patchworks are being carried out in a certain road and demand accountability from the contractors undertaking the work. The system, created under GNIDA’s OneMap Geographic Information System (GIS), helps officials virtually see which road has the maximum patchwork. OneMap is an online integrated and detailed map of Greater Noida that contains details of all utility services, such as sewer lines, electricity cables, internet wires and drains, as well as housing and industrial units and other important civic facilities.The authority’s CEO, Narendra Bhooshan, said, “Officials are closely monitoring on OneMap the number of times contractors are carrying out patchworks on potholes. Once the patchwork is done, the contractor gives it a unique identification number, just like an Aadhaar card, uploads its photograph as well as the geographical coordinates on OneMap. The unique ID gives details about the pothole, its size, its date and its location. Officials can see the photograph of the patchwork and all its details by accessing the ID on OneMap.” “The system ensures transparency and brings accountability,” said Bhooshan adding that in order to make contractors liable for the quality of work they undertake, they will be assessed by the number of times patchworks are done on the road made by them at the end of their contract. “The unique ID has separate codes for each contractor, which will show how many times a contractor had to undertake repairs after making the road. If the road is repaired over 10 or 20 times (the exact criteria is yet to be decided), the contractors will be blacklisted. The contractors will be given a credit rating depending on the work they have done, which will decide if their contract will be renewed or not,” said the CEO. Bhooshan added the junior engineers of the authority will also go on ground to check whether the dimensions given by the contractor are correct and only after verification will their payments be processed. The number of potholes is expected to increase manifold now that the monsoon is here. Anurag Kulshrestha, advisor to Gautam Budh Nagar’s road safety cell and president of TRAX--an NGO working towards road safety, said for four-wheelers, potholes can flatten tires and damage wheels but they can prove to be fatal for two-wheelers. “To ensure safety, it is essential to have quality roads. The height of the area beside the roads should be lower than that of the road so that water can drain out safely. However, such a practice is not followed and potholes keep coming up again and again,” said Kulshrestha.Meanwhile, complaints about potholes are pouring in on the GNIDA’s mobile app ‘Mitra’. These complaints are also notified to the contractor. “Once a resident raises a complaint about a pothole in the Mitra app, the contractor has to complete the patchwork within a certain number of days. Our engineers too keep conducting surveys and notify contractors about potholes that need repairs,” said Bhooshan.He added that a system is being developed to connect the Mitra app with OneMap so that complaints and their solutions can all be accessed on one portal. Currently, OneMap’s beta version is live on the GNIDA’s website and a mobile app of the same was rolled out earlier this month for citizens. However, the map’s official launch is due in August.“The OneMap’s beta version is live on the website for about a year now but it is still in the works. The feature for providing ID and uploading patchwork coordinates and pictures on the map was started in January this year for some parts of Greater Noida and is yet to be rolled out for the whole city,” said Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/unique-id-of-potholes-helps-officials-assess-work-of-contractors-101626977340658.html
22-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Lone power theft police station has four officers to solve 3,350 cases||Two years ago in September, the Uttar Pradesh government opened a dedicated anti-power theft police station in each district to relieve the district police of the burden of solving power pilferage cases. And while the lone such station in Gautam Budh Nagar, in Sector 63, has lightened the load on the district police, it may very well fold under the weight of the cases it now shoulders-- the responsibility of solving 3,350 power theft cases with just four officers. Anita Upadhyay, the circle officer of the police station, said currently, there are 19 employees at the police station. Besides her, there is one inspector, two sub-inspectors, nine head constables, four constables and two computer operators. “The sanctioned strength of sub-inspectors for the anti-power theft police station is five. As a result, the responsibility of submitting the charge-sheets lies with only two sub-inspectors,” she said. Upadhyay said over 5,000 cases of power theft have been registered there since its inception. “Of these, we have submitted the final report in nearly 1,600 cases, after recovering ₹1.76 crore from the offenders. In 300 other cases, where the accused didn’t appear to clear their dues or fines, we have submitted the charge-sheet before different courts in the district. Our sub-inspectors are working hard to dispose of the remaining cases but it’s tough considering the huge caseload,” said the circle officer, adding that most of the pending cases are from last year or the current year. “We’ve sent the requisition for more officers, particularly sub-inspectors, to the state headquarters and hope that they are posted soon. It is apparent that after the Covid-19 outbreak, our enforcement and investigation has slowed down. However, the pendency in investigation is mainly due to delay in the assessment of revenue by the power divisions, late submission of reports about the revenue realised and the compounding amount paid by the offender by the sub division/division to the investigating officer. In some cases, the offenders are not informed about the FIR registered against them by the enforcement teams. As a result, (s)he does not pay the penalty till (s)he is informed about the FIR,” said Upadhyay. When contacted, Virendra Nath Singh, the Noida divisional chief engineer of Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said since 1986, enforcement squads were constituted, comprising police personnel on deputation to the power corporation, which worked on detecting and preventing power thefts. “The cases, registered by these squads and the corporation’s own enforcement teams were investigated by the local police station. But now, the dedicated police station has been helping the enforcement wings of the distribution companies (discoms) to get the FIRs registered promptly. The monitoring of FIRs and investigations by the officers of the anti-power theft police station has helped us detect and prevent electricity pilferages more effectively,” said Singh. He further said a close followup of the investigations has led to timely disposal of cases. ”On receipt of payment of the compounding amount and the assessed revenue, the final report is filed by the investigating officer. This has resulted in a quantum leap in the number of final reports filed. Only contested cases of revenue assessment lead to the filing of the charge sheets, as the penalty would not be paid. The phenomenal increase in penalty collection has contributed significantly to the exchequer of the discoms,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-lone-power-theft-police-station-has-four-officers-to-solve-3-350-cases-101626977280676.html

22-07-2021||Noida||‘Only farmers with verified credentials will join protest at Jantar Mantar’||As the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three new farm laws launched an agitation on Thursday at the Jantar Mantar, farmer leaders at the UP Gate site said that they have made elaborate arrangements so that no unverified person moves to the protest site in New Delhi. The farmer leaders are treading cautiously this time as their tractor march on January 26 this year ended up in incidents of violence. The Delhi Police had registered FIRs against several farmer leaders in connection with the violence while the latter maintained that the trouble creators during the tractor march were outsiders. “We are sending only those people to the Jantar Mantar whose credentials are verified. Such people in different groups will move to the Jantar Mantar in a bus from Singhu Border and return in the evening the same day. We have adopted a more disciplined approach to our protest,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, UP Gate site spokesperson of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of different farmer organisations.The contingents of 200 farmers each will reach the Jantar Mantar to protest against the agri laws and hold their own “Kisan Sansad” on each of the working day of the Parliament until the Monsoon session ends, the SKM said in a statement on Thursday. The session is likely to conclude on August 13.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that the farmers have been strictly told that no one other than those verified will move out of the UP Gate site for the protest at the Jantar Mantar. “We have also decided that only three members from one organisation will go to Delhi and one of these three will be a farmer leader. This means that for every two protesting farmers, we will have one leader who will ensure that they strictly follow the route and other norms,” said Dharmendra Malik, national media coordinator for the BKU. On Thursday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait was among the members of the first group of farmers that left for Singhu Border to join the protest at the Jantar Mantar. “Our panchayat in Delhi is named as ‘Kisan Sansad’. Our people carrying their identity cards will take part in the protest at Jantar Mantar,” Tikait said at the UP Gate site before leaving for Singhu Border. The farmers are protesting at the UP Gate site since November 26 last year, demanding rollback of the new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. Last year, the Parliament passed three laws -- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. While the government said these laws would be beneficial to the agriculture sector, farmers say that they would severely affect their livelihood. The farmer leaders and the representatives of the government have held 11 rounds of talks but the stalemate continues. The last time the two parties held talks was on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/only-farmers-with-verified-credentials-will-join-protest-at-jantar-mantar-101626975185291.html
22-07-2021||Gurugram||1,146 million litres per day of rainwater retained in Aravallis||The district was able to retain 1,146 million litres per day (MLD) of water in the Aravalli region from the heavy spell of rain that lashed the city on Monday, officials from Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said. The information was shared during a residents’ advisory council meeting held in the city on Thursday. The water was collected in an area of around 600 hectares in the Aravallis from rainfall of over 200mm received between Sunday and Tuesday. Subhash Yadav, head of the urban environment division, GMDA, said, “With our efforts to arrest rainwater in the forests itself and ensure it does not run off into the stormwater drain, around 1146 MLD of water has been retained in the Aravallis. Our teams visited the areas today (Thursday), where check dams were made and saw that this water has already percolated down in the soil.” The GMDA’s chief executive officer also asked officials to determine the total amount of water retained in the whole GMDA area during these two days of heavy rain. On July 18-19, the city received 185mm of rainfall according to the India Meteorological Department, which is almost 39% of the total rainfall it receives in the monsoon. Officials from IMD said that Gurugram received 88mm of surplus rainfall compared to the seasonal average, from June 1 till 22, which is 243mm. Officials said that 1,146MLD of water is equivalent to a four to five-day water supply for the entire city. Suresh Chahal, joint chief executive officer of GMDA, said, “This time, we have been able to catch the rain efficiently. For the first time, we have been able to retain so much water in the Aravallis, which is equal to almost five days of water consumption of Gurugram. This made sure that there was negligible waterlogging on Golf Course Road and also that the groundwater table is recharged.” Sharing further details from the meeting, Chahal said that residents raised issues of flooding in Sector 9 and Sector 4, where improvements are needed. “The chief executive officer has asked officials to check the areas of concern suggested by the residents and issued blank orders that whoever will be deployed for repair work at any location, from either GMDA or Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, will have to take it up despite (any difference in) jurisdiction,” said Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/1146-million-litres-per-day-of-rainwater-retained-in-aravallis-101626975184736.html

Upon inquiring, he found the information on their whereabouts to be unsatisfactory and suspended them with immediate effect.An executive engineer on deputation to the MCG was also relieved of his duties and sent back to his home department by Vij because he was not resolving matters raised by MCG councillors. Further, he also directed MCG officials to deduct the two-hour salary of an official in the MCG’s account branch, whose work was found unsatisfactory.Vij also directed officials to file an FIR in a case related to fake work-satisfactory certificates generated by MCG officials for the alleged embezzlement of crores of funds last year.For all local projects, a work-satisfactory certificate is sought from the ward councillor upon completion of work, based on which funds are issued to the MCG’s contractor. In November last year, the MCG came across at least 12 allegedly fake certificates issued by 10 councillors, whose signatures were found to be illegally replicated.“The department functioning requires improvement and rationalisation of the staff. The office does not maintain any movement register. Suspension orders were given for two SDOs as they were not present in the office,” said Vij, while addressing the media.Vij directed MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja to make an attendance and movement register of all the officers and employees.He also raised the matter of severe waterlogging following heavy rains on Monday, which flooded four underpasses, homes and offices, and also caused road collapses. He directed all MCG officer officials to submit a report to their respective heads on the work they carried out to mitigate waterlogging at their own capacity.Following the inspection, while interacting with the media, Vij said that a committee would be formed to prepare a plan that will find a permanent solution to the problem of waterlogging in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-officials-face-suspensions-salary-cuts-in-surprise-check-by-home-minister-101626975183602.html

Officials said that no ill bird was found during their checks and that poultry products were safe to consume, provided they are cooked at 70°C for 30 minutes.“Health teams on Thursday visited 16 villages in a radius of 10 kilometres, covering a population of 46, 177. There is no suspected case of bird flu found in the area. Animal husbandry department reported no signs and symptoms of any kind of disease or illness in the birds,” stated a letter issued submitted by the district officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), to the state health department. A resident of Bihari market in Chakkarpur died due to a respiratory tract infection at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi on July 11. It is likely to be the country’s first death due to bird flu.“As a precautionary measure, a survey has been conducted in Chakkarpur and the areas around it. The 18 poultry farms in the city that were checked by our teams show no case of infected birds. It is safe to consume properly cooked chicken, eggs and poultry products provided they are cooked at 70°C for 30 minutes,” said Dr Punita Gahlawat, deputy director, animal husbandry department. According to Gahlawat, even before the suspected bird flu death, random inspection and sampling were being done at poultry farms. Gurugram’s deputy commissioner, Yash Garg, also appealed to citizens to give information on dead birds to the animal husbandry department, according to a statement issued by the district health department. An advisory was issued to the poultry farm owners, stating that people who handle live poultry should use gloves and mask to avoid direct contact with raw meat. Human infections with avian influenza A viruses occur due to contact with infected poultry, surfaces, faeces or objects contaminated by their droppings.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), symptoms of H5N1 infection includes fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Other early symptoms may include abdominal pain, chest pain and diarrhoea. The infection can progress quickly to severe respiratory illness like difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and neurologic changes of altered mental status or seizures. Across the globe, there have been 862 cases of laboratory-confirmed H5N1 infections, of which 455 succumbed to the infection. According to a May 21 bulletin by the WHO, it accounts for the case fatality ratio (CFR) at nearly 53%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/poultry-in-gurugram-safe-for-consumption-say-officials-after-conducting-checks-101626975182105.html

The police said that the victims were returning to Faridabad after unloading electrical goods in Manesar, when the incident took place.“When we reached village Ghata near Sector 56, a white i20 car crossed us and intercepted the truck. A man in his late 20s got down, opened the truck door and pulled me out. Before I could understand the situation, another man pulled the co-driver out. They snatched ₹5,000, two mobile phones and assaulted us,” said Brijesh Kumar, a resident of Baharia in Allahabad of Uttar Pradesh, who works as a driver with a logistics transport company in Faridabad.Kumar said they threatened them with dire consequences and after 10 minutes, they left the spot in their car towards Gurugram.

In the absence of planned development, residents say haphazard parking on the roadside is leading to traffic congestion, especially during the evening rush hour.With the exception of Sector 72, sectors 73 to 79 have group housing societies and an approximate population of two lakh residents, officials said. Needless to say, the local markets in these sectors as well as numerous fruit and vegetable markets, especially the one at the junction of sectors 76 and 77, receive a high footfall throughout the week. But residents say parking is yet to be regularised outside these market areas.They said vehicles are often left parked on the road near the markets, especially near the fruit and vegetable market in sector 76-77, causing traffic congestion during the evening rush hour. “There is no signage or board there specifying where one should park. Near markets, especially the mandi, people often park on the road, obstructing traffic flow. It’s high time that the parking along these markets are regularised,” said Amit Gupta, resident, Prateek Westeria, Sector 77.The major areas that see irregular parking include the markets of Sector 76, Amrapali main road, sectors 74-75 market, the fruit and vegetable makers at sector 76-77, and the market on the road along the Civitech central in Sector 77, among others.“Since parking is unregulated, people park as per their convenience, leaving no space for vehicles moving on the road. We have seen the police imposing fines on a few car drivers at times, but that’s not helping much,” said Sachin Goyal, resident of JM Orchid, Sector 76.“Now that there are some traffic lights functional in the area, officials must work on parking as well. Most of the time, it is difficult to find a parking space and in case you do find space, there would be some other car parked right behind yours. Be it on Amrapali main road, the Sector 76 market, or the vegetable market, the situation is the same everywhere,” said Punit Sharma, resident, Aditya Urban Casa, Sector 77. According to a Noida authority official, who asked not to be named, there are no authorised parkings in these sectors as the need for these had not arisen so far.“There is no authorised parking in the 7x sectors because these are still developing sectors. The mandi from where most of the parking issues are reported stands on land that was not acquired by the authority; hence, authority could make no parking provision. As for the other markets, beside most of them there are high-rises with ample parking space and so there was no need for a separate space. But the situation is changing now. The issues would be dealt with as and when these sectors are fully developed. We are working on resolving these issues,” said Mukesh Kumar Vaish, project engineer, work circle 6, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-7x-sectors-grapple-with-parking-issues-outside-markets-101626975000434.html

It will remain open till September 30, after which it will be closed for scrutiny and processing,” a senior official of Scheduled Tribe /Scheduled Caste/Other Backward Classes department said.The development comes close on the heels of a protest held by B.Ed students outside the Governor ‘s house last week. The agitating students alleged that they missed out on the scholarships in the past academic session, as the state government had closed the portal even as counselling procedure for admissions was still on.“The admission process was delayed due to the pandemic. The portal was closed in February when only one round of counselling for admission in B.Ed colleges was completed,” a B.Ed student Jeewan Kumar from Hazaribagh said.Officials, however, denied the charges. They claimed that the department has provided scholarship to around 16,000 more students in the academic session 2020-21 as compared to the previous year.“It is not true. Every year, the portal is opened for a fixed tenure. It has to be closed at a certain date or else the process of scrutiny and disposal of scholarship would not get completed in time. In 2020-21 session, scholarship was provided to 2,93,389 students as against money provided to 2,77,972 students in 2019-20 session,” said a department official.The department of ST/SC/OBC welfare provides different amounts of scholarships for eligible students across different grades. B.Ed students get scholarship of ₹35,000-38,000 per annum for the course.At ₹234.10 crore, the total money disbursed under the scheme was however lesser in 2020-21 as against ₹273.02 crore in the 2019-20 academic session. The official said the lower disbursement was due to closure of hostels due to Covid-19 pandemic last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ekalyan-portal-to-open-again-as-j-khand-students-complain-of-missing-out-on-scholarship-101626971340070.html

The 72-hour trial operation of this unit was done in March. Bihar, which gets an average daily 4,000-5,000 MW power from Central sectors, would now get an additional 559 MW of electricity, which is 84.8% of the total power generated from this unit. Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Sikkim would share the remaining power from this unit, said NTPC spokesman Vishwanath Chandan. Bihar will draw roughly 1,122 MW power from the two NPGC units each of 660MW. The 660 MW unit-1 of the plant became commercially viable on September 6, 2019. The third unit (660 MW) is expected to be commissioned within the next six months as its construction, testing and optimisation activities were at an advanced stage, Chandan said.

They can simply upload their documents on the portal for registration.”“Besides, a database can be maintained regarding the number of students enrolled in private schools under Right to Education Act (RTE), 2009. It will help the department to keep records, like the total number of private schools in the state, how many students enrolled in private schools and how many schools are entitled to RTE funds”, he added.Additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said, “Under the new system, private school management can visit the website edu-online.bihar.gov.in and apply for obtaining recognition of NOC. In case of any technical error, applicants can call on helpline number 7004070073 and 739000010.” Middle and high schools likely to reopen in AugustMiddle and high schools in the state are likely to reopen in the second week of August if the Covid-19 situation remained stable, said Chaudhary.He said that a final decision in this regard would be taken after the review meeting of the crisis management group.“If the pandemic situation remains favourable, middle and high schools will be allowed to partially resume physical classes in the next phase of unlocking after August 6”, he said.Bihar government allowed reopening of higher educational institutions including varsities, colleges and senior secondary schools with 50% strength from July 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-education-dept-launches-e-portal-for-pvt-schools-accreditation-101626971160043.html

The court allowed the police’s prayer and granted his transit remand till July 25,” a lawyer involved in the case said, adding that the Jammu and Kashmir police have alleged that Javed procured six pistols from Munger and supplied them to a terrorist through Arman.According to ATS officials, on February 6 this year, the Jammu police had arrested one Hidaitullah Malik for suspected terror links. Later, his alleged handlers, Suhail Bashir and Kazi Washim, both were arrested from Chandigarh. Suhail was studying as a nursing assistant at an institute in Chandigarh where Javed’s brother Mustaq also studied.ATS sources said six pistols of 7.65 mm, said to be manufactured in Munger, were smuggled to terrorists.Munger in Bihar is notorious for illegal gun factories. Located around 100 kms from Patna, the town has been in news for manufacturing, assembling, repairing and selling all kinds of weapons, from small arms to AK-47 and AK-57 assault rifles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/2nd-arrest-from-saran-village-for-links-to-j-k-terrorists-munger-on-radar-again-101626971040025.html
22-07-2021||Patna||Vaccine trial in Bihar: After first dose, no major side effect in children||Covaxin, India’s indigenous vaccine against coronavirus, could get emergency certification for use in children earliest in September as no anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction, or major adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), has been reported in children so far during the phase II/III clinical trials of the vaccine, feel experts. “Pain at the site of the injection is the most common AEFI, with no anaphylaxis reported so far during the clinical trial of the vaccine in children of 2-18 years age group,” said a senior doctor associated with the trial who did not wish to be identified, quoting a secrecy clause in it. One can expect the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to grant emergency certification for use of Covaxin in children earliest in September. It is perceived that the regulator has to wait for a minimum of 56 days after completion of the first dose of vaccine, achieved across the seven research centres in India on July 9, said the doctor. Dr Sanjay Rai, principal investigator of the Covaxin trial on children at AIIMS-Delhi, also professor, department of community, and president of the Indian Public Health Association, however, differed on the need to vaccinate children at this stage. “Global evidence suggests that Covid-19 is a very mild disease in children and a majority of them pass off as asymptomatic cases. Around 60% seroprevalence (serology test for antibodies) has been found in children, as per a recent ICMR survey. This means around 27 crore of the 45 crore children in India, less than 18 years of age, have already been infected and went unnoticed. The mortality rate of children to the pandemic has also been low. This has to be assessed against vaccine-associated deaths before deciding to inoculate children. I don’t see any benefit of vaccinating children against Covid-19 at this stage,” said Dr Rai. Dr CM Singh, the principal investigator of the trial at AIIMS-Patna, its medical superintendent and professor and head, department of community and family medicine, also felt that children should not be a priority group for vaccination against Covid-19, especially when the vaccine is scarce for adults. “World-wide evidence suggest that children have been least affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality. Despite being equally infected by the virus during the first and second waves of the pandemic, their hospitalisation was less. However, this should not be construed that the development of a vaccine system for children should stop. It has to be put in place besides strengthening infrastructure for paediatric healthcare There is certainly no need to panic about vaccinating children at this stage,” said Dr Singh. Trial protocol suggests checking antibodies at 0, 28, 56, 118 and 208 days of vaccination. However, experts feel that natural antibody is better than vaccination. As part of the clinical trial, a second dose of the vaccine has been administered to children in 12-18 years and 6-12 years age groups at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Singh said. The AIIMS-Patna had selected 53 children for the clinical trial of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine. It divided the children into three sub-categories, selecting four in the 2-6 year age group; 21 in 6-12 years of age; and 28 in 12-18 year age bracket, added Dr Singh. Altogether 525 children, with 175 in each of the three age groups, were shortlisted for the trial pan India. AIIMS-Patna is one of the research sites for Covaxin’s clinical trials in children. The others are AIIMS-Delhi; ESI Hospital, Basaidarapur (Delhi); Prakhar Hospital, Kanpur; Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, Mysuru, Pranaam Hospital, Hyderabad; and Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vaccine-trial-in-bihar-after-first-dose-no-major-side-effect-in-children-101626970980032.html
22-07-2021||Bangalore||In Karnataka, woman taken to hospital in nearby village on 'makeshift stretcher'||Residents of a village in Kempalikoppa in Sagar taluk of Karnataka's Sivamogga district were forced to carry a 45-year-old woman to a hospital in a nearby village as their village does not have a medical facility or transport connectivity, according to a report in Udayavani. The patient, Rathnamma, who complained of severe stomach pain, was taken to hospital amid heavy rain.In the absence of any transport connectivity, a few young villagers prepared a makeshift stretcher out of her charpoy, and carried her to Kalagali village, at a distance of three kilometres. However, the youngsters made sure Rathnamma was fully covered with waterproof material.Rathnamma's condition worsened by the time they reached Bellur bus stand in Kalagali. As of now, she is stable and improving, according to Udayavani.A youth from the neighbouring village, Huliballi, recorded the incident and shared its video on social media, which went viral. In the past, several similar situations went unnoticed. In this case, the viral video brought this incident into the public domain, with details leaving the civil society "shocked."Villagers from the interior areas of the Shivamogga district have often complained about the lack of facilities. The Karnataka government, too, has provided funds for developing roads and power network under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. However, due to stringent rules of the forest department, electricity lines could not be laid in forest areas, as well as in tribal areas.The forest department, however, has a version in its defense. The department, Udayavani points out in its report, is bound by the rules which were enacted in the "interest of the safety of wildlife." Also, there are several other issues affecting the development of roads and power supply networks in human habitations deep in the forests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/in-karnataka-woman-taken-to-hospital-in-nearby-village-on-makeshift-stretcher-101626967295848.html

From next month, the power department app will have the facility for applying online for a change in meter, bill correction, change in sanctioned load, change in name or address, change in category and permanent disconnection. “Incorrect bills should be monitored by the MD and feedback should be taken from consumers,” added the minister. Consumers paying bills regularly would be felicitated, said the minister. The minister directed officials to ensure that there was no tripping problem in all areas. “This summer, over 25,000 mw power is being supplied during the peak and this demand may go up to 28,000 mw next year. Hence preparations should be made from now,” said Sharma. The minister directed the MD and directors to go out in the field to take stock of the problems. He also asked officials to do night patrolling. “Try to get pending bills paid for at least three months. Disconnection is not the correct solution. Transmission loss should be identified where ever high and should be brought below 15% at the feeder level,” said Sharma. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/provide-power-related-services-via-apps-says-up-energy-minister-101626969900012.html

22-07-2021||Delhi||'Unusually large' liver abscess found in 14 Covid-19 recovered patients in Delhi||As many as 14 patients who recovered from Covid-19 were diagnosed with “unusually large” and multiple liver abscesses as post-disease complications in the past two months, authorities at Delhi’s Ganga Ram Hospital said on Thursday.Of the 14 patients, eight had received steroids during the course of their Covid-19 treatment, while one succumbed to the post-disease complication following massive bleeding, doctors said.Dr Anil Arora, the chairman at the Institute of Liver Gastroenterology and Pancreaticobiliary Sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, the hospital received 10 men and four women between 28 and 74 years with liver abscesses in the past two months.“What we found unusual was that within 22 days of the recovery from Covid-19, patients who were otherwise immunocompetent had large areas of both lobes of their liver filled with pus at multiple locations, requiring drainage and hospitalisation,” Dr Arora added.According to doctors, poor nutrition and use of steroids could have resulted in the pus formation and the abscesses.The sole deceased suffered from massive bleeding after the abscess in the abdominal cavity ruptured. “All the remaining patients are stable and have now been discharged,” Dr Arora informed.Last month, five cases of Cytomegalovirus (CVM) related rectal bleeding among patients who recovered from Covid-19 were reported in Ganga Ram Hospital. These patients had complained of bleeding in stool discharge followed by abdominal pain, officials said.In a statement released at that time, the hospital said that the patients of CMV infection were otherwise immunocompetent.What causes formation of liver abscesses?Doctors at Ganga Ram Hospital said that liver abscess – pus formation in liver — is usually caused by a parasite called ‘entamoeba histolytica’, which is transmitted via contaminated water and food.Following the occurrence of the infection, the parasite may get carried by the bloodstream from a patient’s intestines to the liver, thereby causing liver abscess.What was the nature of the post-Covid complications in the 14 patients?According to Dr Arora, of the eight patients who were treated with steroids while infected with Covid-19, six had multiple large abscesses in both lobes of the liver – the largest being 19cm in size.“Three patients, who had blood during stool discharge, showed ulcers in the large intestine, which were detected by colonoscopy,” he added.What could have caused the liver abscesses?Suppression of immunity by Covid-19 besides usage of steroids to treat the disease are probably some factors that caused the formation of liver abscesses in the 14 patients, Dr Arora said.He added that “low index of suspicion for liver abscess and delay in treatment in patients recuperating from coronavirus infection,” could have also contributed to the condition.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unusually-large-liver-abscess-found-in-14-covid-19-recovered-patients-in-delhi-101626968223278.html

22-07-2021||Delhi||Aam ke daam: Anything for the love of mangoes!||How far have you gone to get your favourite mango? By far, we mean not literally, but in monetary terms. How about as high as ₹1500/kg? On National Mango Day, today, some city based popular personalities share honest confessions about having indulged in their fave variety of the ‘king of fruits’, at quite high prices.‘Bought Ratnagiri Alphonso for ₹1,350’Former model Amanpreet Wahi says she earlier used to eat mangoes of all varieties, “whichever was available in the fridge”. But things changed post Covid-19. “I’m much more at home now, so the stress is on healthy eating and healthy cooking! Since I want to buy the best quality fruits and vegetables available, all these come in my house from a cute organic farm shop. My favourite mango is the premium dussehri, priced usually at ₹160 a kilo. And the lowest I ever bought was ₹60 a kilo. But the most expensive mangoes I’ve even bought are the Ratnagiri Alphonso, a pack of 12 for ₹1,350,” says Wahi who is a true mango lover at heart! ‘Chausa, little pricier at ₹150/kg’For artist Sanjay Bhattacharyya, there’s nothing more delicious than a chausa! “Among all the fruits, mangoes are my favourite, especially the chausa. The sweetness of this particular type is amazing. But, unfortunately these mangoes are like cruel lovers because they just vanish along with the season! In childhood, we use to buy good quality mangoes at ₹8 to 10, and even climb mango trees to eat a mango. But alas, those days are gone. Today we get mangoes only in the market, and I’m sure the next generation will think that mangoes grow within the market itself,” says Bhattacharyya recalling, “The lowest price I ever paid for a mango was ₹80 per kg, for langra. But chausa priced at ₹150/kg is little pricier I feel. But it’s worth when I put them in the fridge and enjoy them chilled in the hot weather. ”Kesar at ₹150 vs Alphonso at ₹1,500Author Manju Kapoor can never forget how she had to shell out a hefty price for her favourite fruit, and found and alternative. “Right at the beginning of this season, we paid ₹1,500 for a dozen Alphonso. Gradually the price came down, but not as down as it usually comes. And because of the pandemic, we ended up buying mangoes online, quite a lot. So the lowest I would have paid in these days would be ₹100 for a kilo of chausa, which is one of my favourite varieties. And in between there was ₹150 a kilo for kesar, which was a discovery for me this year. It’s a most wonderful mango that tasted a lot like Alphonso, but without that crazy price tag.” All smiles even at ₹400/kg!Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan is all smiles at just the mention of mangoes. She says, “The costliest I’ve purchased, or rather my dear husband has purchased, mangoes for was around ₹400 per kg, and the minimum we bought it at was ₹200 per kg. This year, we had a surfeit of mangoes since our farm’s mango tree has given us a lot of dussehri. Also, a friend of mine sent me crates full of langda and malda. It’s only in autumn or winters, that is non season for our mango trees, that we purchase mangoes. Depending on which market one goes to, the price varies.”Highest purchase ₹500/kgPhotographer Aditya Arya says, “I like all kinds of mangoes. When I was young, all the family members used to spend summers at my grandparents house in Roorkee, and there were a dozen of mango trees and each kid used to get a tree, to eat as much they could. Those summer holidays I miss the most. Today, I’m myself growing a special mango called Mallika! But when it comes to buying from the market, I remember the lowest I ever paid was ₹10/kg and the highest has been ₹500/kg.” Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aam-ke-daam-anything-for-the-love-of-mangoes-101626965582550.html

22-07-2021||Delhi||Rains, not so romantic for the homeless: NGOs come to the rescue||With the rain gods finally smiling, most Delhiites have been elated to witness the summer heat make way for the monsoon, after a long wait. But with this mercy comes the dreadful time for the homeless in the city. One such homeless denizen, Anita, used to sleep near the railway tracks along with her two young daughters, until recently. “Bohot tension hoti thi bacchon ki... sara sara din baarish mein bheegne se beemar na pad jayein (I was extremely worried about my kids falling sick due to continuously getting drenched in the rain).” For those surviving on the streets, rains have spelt a major problem in the Covid times. Many are forced to meet challenges such as access to hygienic food and water, a clean place to sleep, and the constant fight to prevent any infections that can lower their immunity. And in this difficult journey, fortunately these homeless are being supported by some Delhi-NCR based NGOs. Anita, who recently got a bed at a shelter, says she feels much safer now. “Hume vaccine ki pehli dose bhi lag gayi hai toh Covid-19 ka darr thoda kum hua hai,” says Anita. And Babboo Singh, a migrant labourer who stays at a shelter at Roshanara Road, says, “We know many who sleep on the footpaths and at bus stands to escape the deluge. I’m grateful that I have been taken in at the shelter, where basic amenities such as food and drinking water are all available.” “We have over 2,000 homeless people staying in our shelters at the moment. And the number may rise with the rains. For their safety, we have to maintain absolute hygiene,” informs Santosh Jha, from Safe Approach NGO, which is running 45 shelters in the city in areas such as at Paharganj and Mangolpuri. Not just sanitisation, but also encountering hunger amid the pandemic is on the agenda of these good Samaritans. “Many, especially the migrants and daily wage labourers, lost their jobs during the pandemic. We’ve been distributing food to them every day, as well as to those residing in the shelters,” says Sanjay Kumar, from Ashray Adhikar Abhiyan, which provides for the needs of the homeless at 12 shelters across Delhi. Kumar adds, “We are working on behavioural changes with the homeless, imparting knowledge of how to maintain hygiene, distributing masks as well as getting them vaccinated. Most of the shelters are pucca buildings and some are portacabins. Because of the rains, there is a concern of waterlogging in some areas, and we have informed the officials at Municipal Corporation Delhi, to clean the clogged drains.” Working hard to ensure proper facilities during the monsoon, Jha adds, “Amid the pandemic, we are operating on 60% capacity in each shelter, in order to maintain social distancing protocols. Also, we are regularly sanitising the premises. To avoid overcrowding, we are arranging alternative living arrangements at other shelters for the poor who are coming to us.” Another NGO, Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM) is managing 67 shelters across Delhi, while ensuring the safety of the homeless during the monsoon. Ratan Kapoor from one of its shelters at Sarai Kale Khan, says, “We are not letting rainwater stagnate, regularly cleaning the premises. All shelters are being checked for water leakages because right now our efforts are also focussed at avoiding any outbreak of dengue. The safety of the homeless residing in shelters is our responsibility, and we are doing all we can to ensure they stay safe.” Kudos to these noble souls doing their bit.

Monitor the level of rivers round the clock. Sharda river in Paliakalan, Saryu in Barabanki, and Kuano in Gonda are flowing a bit above the danger mark. The National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF), the State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF), and disaster management teams should be in active mode 24x7. Arrange boats, relief material and associated things. There should not be any delay in carrying out relief work in flood and excess rain-affected areas. All affected families should be provided immediate relief,” Yogi said at the high-level Covid-19 review meeting.Yogi said that the state’s aggressive ‘trace, test, treat, and vaccinate’ policy had helped a great deal in preventing the spread of Covid infection in UP. “The state, which is the most populous in the country, is doing 2.5 to 3 lakh tests each day and the positivity rate is a mere 0.02%. Till July 21, UP has administered 4.20 crore doses of Covid vaccine,” he said.He highlighted: “For the past several days, not a single district in the state reported cases in double digit. Currently, UP’s active Covid case count is 1,028. In the last 24 hours, 2.34 lakh tests were done, of which only 53 tested positive for Covid while 56 patients recovered.

22-07-2021||Patna||JD(U), RJD on same page against Centre’s move to skip caste census among OBCs||The Central government’s decision to not hold caste-based census except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the population census 2021 is being strongly opposed by ruling Janata Dal (United) and opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar. These two have hinted at launching a stir in favour of a caste-based enumeration of population. Two days back, Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai told parliament that caste-wise enumeration of population will not be done except in the case of SCs and STs during Census, an exercise undertaken every 10 years, which got delayed in 2021 due to the Covid pandemic. “We are disappointed and pained by this decision. Caste-wise enumeration is necessary as it would only help in identifying the backwardness in economically and socially weaker groups among backward classes and extend them benefits of welfare schemes. We will press hard for it and not sit silently,” said K C Tyagi, national general secretary of the JD(U). Tyagi said his party, a constituent in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in Bihar, will discuss the matter at the party’s national executive meeting in New Delhi on July 31st and is likely to pass a resolution seeking a caste census. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar will be attending the national executive meeting where we will discuss this matter. We will also bring a resolution to press for a caste-based census,” he added. Tyagi also underlined that there was divergence on key issues among NDA constituents in the absence of a common minimum programmeIncidentally, leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday appeared to be on the same page with the JD(U) as he termed Centre’s decision “unjustified”. RJD insiders said the party is planning to start an agitation to press for caste-based census in coming weeks. Tejashwi, who is in New Delhi for the past few days, said that RJD had long campaigned for caste census as a tool to extend benefits of welfare schemes to the backward classes and asked if it will be possible to allocate funds to welfare schemes targeting the backward classes if their population was not known. “If in census, there can be count of animals, cycles, scooters and enumeration of population practicing different religions, why can’t there be a count of backward classes in each religious group? It would only take one additional column in the census sheet for [this] enumeration. There will be no additional load on the public exchequer,” Tejashwi said, to buttress his point. He said it was difficult to understand why Centre was not keen on caste-based census when the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in alliance with JD(U) in the NDA government in Bihar, had supported the resolution for a caste-based census passed in both Houses of Bihar assembly.Nawal Kishore Choudhary, a political analyst, feels the rejection of caste-based census by the Centre will have wide political ramification in state polity.He said the issue provides an opportunity to the RJD to unify backward classes putting pressure on the JD(U), which seeks to champion the cause of the backward classes and it will also test JD(U)’s ties with the BJP. “Caste census is an important agenda for regional outfits like the JD(U) and the RJD which have played identity politics [in the] post Mandal era since the 1990s. Now, there could be demand from the rank and file in the JD(U) for caste census. The party also has to see its equations with the BJP. So, there is pressure on it. The JD(U) has taken a different stand on population control legislation recently,” he said. From the 1990s onward, post implementation of Mandal commission report on job reservations, state’s politics has revolved on polarising backward classes, with ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad playing social justice card during his party’s tenure in power till 2005. Since then Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has consolidated his support base among backward classes by wooing extremely backward classes (EBCs) and also categorizing all 22 sub-castes among scheduled castes as Maha Dalits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-rjd-on-same-page-against-centre-s-move-to-skip-caste-census-among-obcs-101626955139233.html

We are not aware of these things,” news agency ANI quoted the deputy CM as saying.When asked about chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s remarks about JP Nadda’s decision expected on July 25, Ashwathnarayan said that he was not aware of the context in which the CM made those remarks. “I don't know in what context the CM made that statement. We need to hear from him,” the deputy CM said.Earlier in the day, Yediyurappa said that he would abide by any decision the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) high command would make. He also said that an event would be organised on July 26 to mark the completion of two years of his government in Karnataka.Also read | BJP leader Sadananda Gowda says ‘no chance’ for leadership change in Karnataka“Based on the instructions that the central leaders will give me on July 25, I will begin my work from July 26.

It is not appropriate. I appeal for cooperation and refrain from indulging in such things,” he said. Meanwhile, Yediyurappa’s comments were largely perceived as hints of him possibly quitting the state’s top post.Many in the BJP, including state in-charge Arun Singh, have regularly denied about a leadership change in Karnataka ever since such speculations arose. Notably, Singh was asked by reporters in Delhi on Thursday about the party’s Karnataka unit and he said, “We will sit together someday and discuss,” a news report by PTI showed. “All our party workers, ministers and legislators are united and there are no differences of any kind,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-question-of-leadership-change-karnataka-deputy-cm-ashwathnarayan-on-replacing-bs-yediyurappa-101626951060187.html

These enclosures – measuring 160 to 180 square metres – have been built per the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and boast a state-of-the-art ‘closed glass viewing’ enclosure. The open-to-air enclosures have been built using toxin-free glass fibre reinforced concrete (GRC), keeping in mind the cats’ comfort. This is the same material that is in use in zoos around the world.Sharing further details, Dr Rajkumar Jadhav, director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre, said, “At present, the zoo has three species of cats, with 10 jungle cats, but we will be having two on public display and two leopards (male and female). We have built 20 cages, with three cages each for the cats and four for the Shekru.”The three enclosures were inaugurated by Raj Thackeray, president, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS); along with Murlidhar Mohol, mayor; Hemant Rasne, chairman, standing committee; Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner; Vasant More, corporator; Ashok Ghorpade, gardens superintendent; and Dr Jadhav.Upon visiting the Shekru enclosure, Thackeray said, “The Shekru is the cutest looking squirrel and was the only one to stop the expressway from being completed until it got its ‘endangered species status.”The CZA plans to conserve 72 endangered wildlife species across India and as part of this plan, various zoos across the country have been categorised as wildlife conservation and breeding centres.The Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre has also put forth a proposal to the CZA for exclusive ex-situ or in-captivity breeding and conservation of rusty-spotted cats which are rare with very few found in captivity. “We have submitted our proposal based on the success of the Shekru breeding and conservation programme. There is not enough study on this species and we are lagging in terms of research about this cat,” said Dr Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-rajiv-gandhi-zoo-gets-new-leopard-cats-shekru-complex-101626951119078.html

Addressing a press conference after opening the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) office in Bathinda, Cheema said to settle political scores with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Sidhu is busy seeking support of Congress legislators. Also read: Sidhu to be crowned as Punjab Congress chief on FridayHe said the AAP hailed Sidhu when he raised issues of misgovernance by the Amarinder Singh-led government. “But now to unsettle Amarinder politically, Sidhu is visiting residences of those Congress leaders whose names figure in liquor and natural resources mafia. Since his appointment, Sidhu has not raised any burning issue of Punjab but is busy garnering the support of the corrupt to belittle Amarinder,” he said. Cheema, however, refrained from taking the name of any Congress leader while making the allegation. He said Punjab is under a debt of ₹3 lakh crore out of which more than ₹90,000 crore was recorded under the present state government since 2017. “Overlooking people’s issues, Amarinder is repeatedly issuing statements that Sidhu should seek an apology from him. The state Congress president has said several times that his party failed to keep all key promises made in the run-up to the 2017 assembly polls. Sidhu and the CM should tender an unconditional public apology for their party’s failure to perform in the last four-and-half years,” said Cheema. Gearing up for polls To a question, Cheema said the party has yet to start identifying candidates for next year’s elections. “The party is not in hurry to announce candidatures but our volunteers are in election mode. The AAP will finalise names after a survey to find fit candidates in all segments. We will soon announce halqa in-charges and it has been decided that these leaders will not contest the elections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/busy-settling-scores-with-capt-sidhu-s-forgotten-punjab-aap-101626950759037.html

They forced him out of his vehicle and assaulted him with bamboo sticks and iron rods before fleeing the scene. From the CCTV footage, the police traced the movements of the accused. “We tracked their movement through the footage from 35 different cameras till we found footage that had captured their faces.

We started seeking information about his movements from informants,” police inspector Sanjay Patil, Kapurbawdi police station said. The minor was picked up for inquiry on Wednesday. After questioning him, police identified the other two accused: a minor, and Govind Chavan (21). The police said that about a fortnight before the assault, Khan had an argument with the three accused over a petty issue.”Khan allegedly assaulted the minor and made him apologise in front of everyone else.

22-07-2021||Chandigarh||CM Amarinder Singh to attend Sidhu's elevation ceremony tomorrow||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has decided to attend newly appointed Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu's elevation event on Friday. The two leaders have been at loggerheads over the past few months and with Assembly election scheduled to be held next year, the central leadership had been struggling to resolve the months-long feud. The CM's media advisor, Raveen Thukral, said Singh has invited all state Congress MLAs, MPs and senior party functionaries at Punjab Bhawan for tea at 10am on Friday. "They will all then go to Punjab Congress Bhawan together from there for the installation of the new PPCC team," Thukral wrote on Twitter.Earlier, it was reported Sidhu had sent an invite for the event to Singh that was signed by about 65 party MLAs.The party’s working president, Kuljit Singh Nagra, said former Uttarakhand chief minister and Congree in-charge of Punjab’s affairs Harish Rawat has said he would come to the programme."As soon as other leaders of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) give any confirmation on their attending the event, we'll tell you," Nagra was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. “We'll meet the CM at 3pm today (Thursday) and give him an invitation,” he had said.Rawat later said the Congress will unitedly welcome the new president on Friday under Singh's leadership. Sidhu, who will replace veteran leader Sunil Jakhar, will formally take charge at a function on Friday.The tiff between Sidhu and Singh turned uglier ever since the Amritsar (East) MLA attacked the CM over the Guru Granth Sahib desecration cases.According to reports, Singh was against Sidhu’s elevation as Congress' Punjab unit chief. Thukral had said the chief minister will not meet Sidhu until he publicly apologises for the derogatory remarks on social media against him.The cricketer-turned-politician was appointed as the new president of the party's Punjab unit on Sunday by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. She also appointed four working presidents, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel and Kuljit Singh Nagra, to assist Sidhu in the run-up to the next Assembly elections scheduled to be held next year.On Wednesday, nearly 60 Congress MLAs had gathered at Sidhu’s residence in Amritsar in what was seen as a show of strength. The MLAs at Sidhu's residence said the party is united and that there is no need for offering any apology. The Congress has 80 MLAs in the Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-to-take-charge-as-punjab-congress-chief-tomorrow-cm-singh-invited-101626947798202.html

22-07-2021||Chandigarh||Black and white gang keeps the colours of Nature alive||A few patches of green are left in the concrete jungles that our cities have turned into. Fortunately, our part of Amritsar can boast of an open space, comprising a football field, a basketball court and a hockey ground. School and college students, soldiers from the nearby cantonment and walkers throng the playing field every morning to exercise and train. Coaches keep a vigil on sportspersons and athletes and monitor their progress as they push them hard to better their performance. Once the gruelling practice session is over, the players are offered juices, bananas and milk to supplement their routine diet by the local sports authorities. Players relish the energy-boosting drink after sweating it out on the field but don’t spare a thought before littering the ground with empty tetra packs of juices, plastic straws, polythene pouches of milk, shards of glass and egg shells. Though the men responsible for the ground’s upkeep do their best to maintain the area, their efforts almost always fall short of the pace with which the non-biodegradable waste keeps piling up. Recently, a track and field tournament was held at the ground in which schools of the district participated. Once the meet was over, the ground was left littered with empty cartons, polythene bags and plastic bottles. Unable to clear the amount of garbage generated, the sweepers took the easy way out and swept the garbage to one part of the ground. With one-third of the ground under garbage cover, players and athletes chose to restrict their area of activity rather than clear the litter. We, the morning walkers, also decided to turn a blind eye to the sorry state of affairs, until a shard of glass tore through the sports shoes and a deep wound was inflicted on the foot of my doctor friend. His wound had to be sutured and he could not come to the ground for a fortnight. After a fortnight when he arrived, he had a bundle of black bags and surgical gloves on the carrier of his bicycle. Before I could ask about the bags, my friend said, “Today, we will operate on the ground and get rid of the litter that bugs it.” Everyone nodded and without much ado, we donned the surgical gloves, grabbed a bag each and bent down to pick up the empty bottles and plastic waste. Seeing us clean the ground, football players halted their game, athletes stopped in their tracks and girls practising gymnastics paused to ponder. Soon, they all came rushing towards us to join the cleanliness campaign. They almost snatched the bags of trash from our hands and started collecting unwanted items from the ground. Within minutes, the campaign started by five had transformed into a wave of 50 enthusiasts, lifting every bit of plastic, paper and glass from the ground. Within half an hour, we managed to collect 10 bags full of trash from the playing area. The next morning when we reached the ground, the players welcomed us with a warm smile. The boxing coach applauded our efforts with a firm handshake said, “The black and white gang is the need of the hour to keep our streets, villages and cities clean and green.” Before we could comprehend the reason behind the queer name given to our group, he was quick to elaborate that black stood for the bags and white for the gloves we carried. Since then, our black and white gang, supported by the players, devotes half an hour every Thursday to keep the colours of Mother Nature alive and vivid. rajivsharma.rs201067@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-and-white-gang-keeps-the-colours-of-nature-alive-101626944984721.html

It has been dipping to as low as 10,000 doses.The number of doses administered shot up in Delhi after June 21 and crossed the 200,000-mark on three days as the government was able to use up the doses in stock for those above the age of 45. Prior to June 21, free doses provided were restricted for those above 45. The doses for those in the 18-45 age group were purchased by the state government at a differential pricing.In June, the government stopped the use of Covaxin for the first dose across all government and even private centres following a shortage of vaccines for administering second doses. Those in the 18-45 age group, who received Covaxin shots, were eligible for their second dose in June after completing the four-week gap.The government resumed using 20% Covaxin doses for the first dose in mid-July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covishield-at-govt-vaccination-centres-in-delhi-to-be-reserved-for-second-dose-101626944084693.html

The seven-layered structure has evinced the interest of the archeology enthusiasts in the state.Korkai, finding mention in Sangam literature for its pearl fishery, was the ancient port city of early Pandyas. At present, it is a small village in Srivaikuntam taluk of Tuticorin district. It is believed that the ancient city once situated at the banks of River Thamirabarani ended up inland, six kilometres away from the sea, due to river sedimentation and the sea receding.In addition to the existing excavation works, Tamil Nadu state archeology department has commenced excavation work at three places in the state including Korkai. In the region, excavation trenches are dug at Korkai, Sivagalai, and Adichanallur. The excavation work started on February 26 after the state government sanctioned ₹29 lakh.The archeologists dug 17 trenches at Korkai from where cast iron material, glass beads, and signs of industrial activities were found. The recent addition is the seven-layered brick structure indicating that it was a settlement area of the ancient civilization.Between 1968 and 69, the Tamil Nadu government took out archeological research at Korkai and surrounding areas. It was the first time the state government took out such archaeological excavation works after the state archeology department was formed. Past research established that Korkai was an archeologically significant place with 2,800 years of history, archeologists say. The literature and archeological evidence suggest that Korkai was involved in the export and import of goods with other ports of ancient civilizations.It could be noted that the department recently unearthed a sword possibly dating back to 2,500 years and a large clay pot that could be a burial urn at Krishnagiri district’s Mayiladumparai where the excavation works are currently underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2000yearold-brick-structure-unearthed-in-tamil-nadu-s-korkai-101626940912716.html

The sit-in, called 'Kisan Panchayat', will start near Parliament in a renewed push to pressure the government to repeal the laws.Track Live UpdatesA large posse of policemen and Rapid Action Force (RAF) have been deployed at the site of the protest and heavy barricading put in place. The police have already enveloped parts of the national capital - like Singhu, Tikri and other places where farmers gave been protesting - under triple-layered security cover."We have placed preventive arrangements to avoid the entry of any miscreant at the Tikri border. The arrangement has been put in place as they (farmers) haven't received permission to hold protest here," Parvinder Singh, DCP (Outer District), was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Delhi Police on Wednesday permitted farmers to hold the demonstration after they took an undertaking from the protesters that they would not march towards Parliament. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has allowed the protest to go on from 11am to 5pm, and permitted only 200 protesters per day who have to follow Covid-19 protocols. The permission has been granted from July 22 to August 9.On Thursday, 200 protesters will gather at Jantar Mantar, a large Mughal-era observatory in central New Delhi that has witnessed countless protests in recent decades.The farmers are getting ready to reach the venue in buses from the Singhu border (near Haryana).

The session will end in early August.Tens of thousands of farmers have camped out on major highways leading to New Delhi for more nearly eight months.The farmers took out a tractor rally on January 26 (Republic Day) in Delhi during which the angry protesters clashed with police after driving their vehicles into security barriers. More than 80 police officers were injured across the city.The farmers are demanding the withdrawal of the laws which they say favour large private retailers who, prior to the new laws, were not permitted to procure farm goods outside government-regulated wholesale grain markets.The government says the laws, introduced in September 2020, will unshackle farmers from having to sell their produce only at regulated wholesale markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmer-protest-from-11am-area-around-jantar-mantar-turns-into-a-fortress-101626928293324.html

Weather analysts at IMD said that though July is likely to see more rain, more rainfall in the Capital occurs during August only. “This is because the monsoon trough and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, the two primary conditions for rainfall, are more favourable during this time for Delhi. This is why the ‘normal’ monsoon rainfall count in the city for this month is higher (247.7mm) than July (210mm),” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dealhi-weather-hot-and-humid-day-likely-today-says-imd-101626923323336.html

By Thursday morning, the city would receive 2,000 mm rains, reports said. While the city received moderate rainfall, suburbs witnessed downpours leading to disruption in local services between Umbermali railway station and Kasara, between Igatpuria and Khardi, news agency ANI reported.Heavy rains battered Mumbai since Saturday night which led to landslides, waterlogged roads and railway tracks. The intensity of the rain has been coming down though the city is under red alert for today as well. The weekend's rainfall caused by a monster thunderstorm over Mumbai and suburbs was different from what the city has been receiving on Tuesday and Wednesday as these showers have been caused by strong westerly winds.

In addition to the trough, there is an east-west shear zone cutting across Maharashtra. Both the factors combined will keep Mumbai and suburbs in the rain zone for the time being, but no freak weather incident is predicted as of now. As per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation data, Mumbai recorded 68.72 mm of rain, eastern suburbs 58.75 mm and western suburbs 58.24 mm of rain in 10 hours since 8am on Wednesday morning. The intensity of rainfall dipped in the afternoon but increased again at night.According to IMD prediction, Mumbai is not likely to receive heavy rainfall now and the intensity is likely to be reduced gradually.

Mayor Balkar Sandhu on Wednesday said three sewer treatment plants are being upgraded in Balloke, Bhattian and Jamalpur under the ₹650 crore project to rejuvenate the Budha Nullah — a rivulet that passes through the district — and storm sewer lines are being installed wherever possible, the mayor said. So far, 10% sewer lines have been installed across the city. “We have already installed storm sewer lines at Rani Jhansi Road and Old GT road near the Clock Tower. Water accumulation was largely witnessed due to incessant and heavy rainfall, but the accumulated water drained out relatively sooner as we had the drain lines, sewers and road gullies cleaned ahead of monsoon. Old drains were also cleaned out to expedite the process. There are few other chronic points such as the road outside Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, and Talab Bazaar. We are working on finding a solution to the problem,” said Sandhu. “In the past, sewers of villages outside MC limits have also been joined with the MC lines for a fee, but it has put a burden on the infrastructure. The sewer lines also choke after heavy rainfall due to low capacity of STPs,” said the mayor. Reminder to NHAI A reminder has been sent to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to resolve waterlogging at Ferozepur Road, Chandigarh Road, and Sherpur Chowk among other areas. Authorities have been asked to clean the drains along highways, the mayor said. Rain water harvestingDirecting officials to focus on rain water harvesting, Sandhu said he will table a resolution in the next meeting of the finance and contracts committee (F and CC) for installation of grass-paver tiles in the city to allow water seepage. Also, the building branch officials will be directed to ensure rain water harvesting systems in the buildings, where it is mandatory to install the system as per norms fixed by the local bodies department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-install-storm-sewers-to-tackle-waterlogging-ludhiana-mayor-101626897941955.html

The city has been struggling to enforce a complete ban on plastic carry bags since 2016. Asked if this time would be any different, Sandhu said, “Special teams will be formed to carry out intensive drives to restrain the use and trade of plastic carry bags in the city. Violators will be slapped with hefty fines.” On July 14, the MC general house had approved a resolution to ban single-use plastic. While appealing residents to adopt alternatives such cloth bags, the mayor said the MC had cleaned the sewer lines before the arrival of monsoon, but the lines got choked regardless due to plastic carry bags which clogged the drains. The mayor said, “The matter was also highlighted by shopkeepers near the Clock Tower when municipal corporation commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and I had gone for an inspection. I will also ask Punjab Pollution Control Board officials to check manufacturing of banned carry bags.”Though the state government had imposed a complete ban on plastic carry bags in April 2016, the use and trade of plastic bags goes unabated in absence of proper checks. An official, requesting anonymity, said the MC has had trouble enforcing the ban due to political interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mayor-announces-ban-on-plastic-carry-bags-from-august-1-101626897702287.html

The key accused, Naman Sukhadiya, who was arrested in Gujarat last week, had said that a UK-based handler provided them with the phone numbers of targets in exchange for a 40% cut per fraud. The police are in the process of issuing a lookout circular for the handler’s extradition and have encashed cryptocurrency worth ₹60 lakh.Posing as officials from Her Majesty Revenue & Customs, the UK’s tax, payments and customs authority, the accused would call citizens of the United States of America and Canada through an internet-based calling application and tell them that their identity had been used to carry out tax or insurance frauds in their country and a criminal case was being filed against them. When the victims invariably asked them for a way to nullify the charges, they were told to transfer some money to a UK-based account through hawala or cryptocurrency. Additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “The accused were expanding their racket to other countries, including Australia. The cryptocurrency has been made case property after being granted special permission by a local court.” It has been learnt that another key operator, Lakhan, was about to handover the call centre to Somal Sood, the owner of the building where the call centre was operating. Cops are also looking into Sood’s assets and business transactions. The police will request the ministry of external affairs to reach out to countries where the fraudsters were active to get a written statement from victims.Officials, requesting anonymity, say the Punjab Police was going to scale up the operation as they have found more such fake call centres operating in Mohali. On June 30, the racket was busted after a raid on the call centre on Pakhowal Road. The building was owned by Sood, who allegedly has strong contacts with politicians and in the police department. Subsequently, raids were carried out in Mohali, Delhi and Gujarat to arrest all gang members. Initially, the call centre was operated by Gujarat-based techies.Besides cryptocurrency, police have seized cash and property worth ₹1.52 crore from the gang, besides recovering ₹27 lakh hawala money and freezing ₹39.8 lakh in the accused’s bank accounts. Around 516g gold worth ₹17 lakh, 12 laptops, 26 mobile phones and two cars have been seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/callcentre-scam-ludhiana-cops-to-push-for-extradition-of-gang-s-uk-based-handler-101626897281056.html

Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and in-charge of Punjab affairs, is expected to arrive here for Sidhu’s coronation as the representative of party’s high command. The event, likely to be a low-key affair, will be held at the party’s Chandigarh headquarter, and the outgoing president Sunil Jakhar will also be a part of it. No invite has been received by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh so far for the event, said sources. “It’s an important event and it is the duty of every Congressman to attend it. In the past too, invitations were never sent to anyone in the party for such an event,” said cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. The minister, once considered as the right-hand man of Captain, has now distanced himself from the CM and thrown his weight behind Sidhu.Bajwa was also seen with Sidhu, along with his three other cabinet colleagues ----- Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Charanjit Singh Channi --- at the Golden Temple on Wednesday. More than 40 Congress MLAs, out of 80, were also present there. Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra who has been appointed as one of the four working president, said Rawat has asked everyone to attend the event. “It’s going to be a big show and we will put up a united face of the Congress,” said a working president, who didn’t want to be quoted. Amarinder, who had opposed state unit’s top post for Sidhu, has already announced that he would not meet the newly appointed president till he publicly apologises for his derogatory social media attacks against him. Reportedly, Sidhu is in no mood to budge and so far no attempt has been made to reach out to the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-to-be-crowned-as-as-punjab-congress-chief-on-friday-101626896747089.html

Also, no protocol was followed by the supporters of the Congress leader at his residence and during his visit to the Golden Temple, the Durgiana Temple and the Ram Tirath Temple along with other leaders. Hardly anyone was seen wearing masks or maintaining social distancing when the ruling party MLAs, ministers and other leaders gathered at the residence of the Amritsar East legislator. Even photographs of the gathering were released by Sidhu’s office. The situation turned worse at the Golden Temple which was already witnessing a heavy rush of devotees who were standing in long queues. A large number of police, security personnel and mediapersons added to the chaos. “If those in government violate the norms like this, how can they expect compliance from the public?” asked a Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) office-bearer present at the shrine. Administration officials refused to comment on the mass violation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-norms-go-for-a-toss-at-navjot-sidhu-s-roadshow-in-amritsar-101626896084093.html

22-07-2021||Chandigarh||HP environmentalists seek implementation of Forest Rights Act||Environmentalists in Himachal Pradesh have asked members of the high-powered committee on land laws to speed up the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The panel, which has six different subcommittees headed by MLAs, was formed in September last year with the mandate to review the land laws in the state. The committee was constituted citing a large number of land ownership-related conflict cases pending in the high court that were becoming a cause of concern for the government. Prakash Bhandari of Himdhara Collective said, “The root of this problem dates back to the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which ended up blocking all possibilities of fair and just resolution and regularisation of najayaz kabzas which were indeed legitimate occupations of people facilitated by various state laws like the Nautor Rules. Further, there was a blanket notification issued by the government of Himachal in 1952 that declared all wasteland as forest land.” He added, “The intention of the 1952 notification and Forest Conservation Act may have been to protect forests, but there was a need to follow the process of forest settlement under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, providing a fair opportunity to people with existing rights on the land. But this process was not followed in the years to come.” Declaring lands as ‘forests’ without providing a fair chance to communities who have been dependent on these ancestral lands for generations has been termed “historical Injustice” in the preamble of the Forest Rights Act 2006, he said. The submission made by Himdhara Collective highlights that the Act provides a historical opportunity for the state to clean up both revenue and forest settlement records in a fair manner. “In Himachal, which has a population of more than 1.5 lakh families of gaddis and gujjars, medicinal plant collectors who are directly dependent on forest land for livelihood and 1.65 lakh families who have applied under 2002 encroachment regularisation policy of Himachal government and several thousands, they had been cited as najayaz kabza in revenue and forest records. There is hardly any forest land in the state where local communities do not have forest usage and dependence for livelihood needs,” the submission states. “The Act has been implemented selectively for diversion of forest land for village development activities. Till now, 2,000 cases have been sanctioned by the government under this provision. However, the very few are aware that the main provision of the act is the recognition of Individual Forest Rights (habitation and farm activities) and Community Forest Rights (fodder, fuelwood, medicinal plants, grazing rights). So far, only 35 community rights titles; and 129 individual forest rights have been accorded under the Act in Himachal,” he added. Myths and misconceptionOne of the main reasons of the poor implementation of the law in Himachal is misinformation and lack of awareness about the law within the political machinery. “The Ministry of Tribal Affairs, the nodal agency for implementation of this law, has offered repeated clarifications on the applicability of the Act and eligibility of Himachalis for individual and community forest rights. But be it high-level officials or line officials, who are to recommend the claims, they continue to carry many misconceptions about the act,” said Manshi Asher of Himdhara Collective. “It is only through strengthening the forest-based livelihood of communities dependent on it that conservation can be ensured,” Asher added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-environmentalists-seek-implementation-of-forest-rights-act-101626895722680.html
22-07-2021||Chandigarh||Transfer policy should not be taken lightly: Himachal HC||Taking strong exception to the transfer of employees being made by the state government on the recommendations of extra-constitutional authorities, the high court of Himachal Pradesh has directed the chief secretary to take appropriate action in the matter and implement the directions issued by the court. A division bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a writ petition filed by one Vipender Kalta, challenging his transfer order. The petitioner has alleged that the transfer has neither been made in public interest nor administrative exigency, rather the same has been made on the basis of a DO Note and therefore the same is not legally tenable. While allowing the petition, the court observed that the recommendations to transfer the petitioner has been mooted by an extra-constitutional authority, which has no role in the functioning and business of the administration, therefore, the impugned transfer of the petitioner cannot be sustained. The court observed that the government is the best judge to decide how to distribute and utilise the services of its employees, however, this power must be exercised honestly, bona fide and reasonably and in public interest. The bench said that courts and tribunals are not expected to interdict the working of the administrative system by transferring the officers to the proper place, however, it becomes necessary for the court to interfere when it notices gross irregularities being committed by the government in the matters of transfer. The court observed that it’s time to turn the searchlight on the state government and remind it that the transfer policy should not be taken lightly or made a mockery or a tool to transfer government employees on the whims and fancies of the politicians. The court observed that the government, being an ideal employer, has a bounden duty to strictly safeguard the interest of its employees against the machinations of politicians. The public servants need to discharge their functions without fear or favour and they need not toe the line drawn by the politicians. The court said that government should not encourage such extra-constitutional authorities to interfere with the administration and governance of the state, or else, there is every likelihood of there being a complete breakdown of rule of law. The court also observed that since the docket of the court is full of cases related to transfers of employees, the government should implement online transfer in its departments, boards, corporations, having over 500 employees by framing an online transfer policy and directions to this effect have already been issued by the court in various writ petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/transfer-policy-should-not-be-taken-lightly-himachal-hc-101626895721522.html
22-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sophia Duleep Singh in the running for UK’s Hidden Heroes statues campaign||Sophia Duleep Singh, daughter of the last ruler of the Sikh empire Maharaja Duleep Singh, is among the historical figures in the running for a “Hidden Heroes” campaign calling for more diversity in new commemorative monuments across the UK.Princess Sophia, the goddaughter of Queen Victoria, was among the leading suffragettes who fought for women’s right to vote in 1900s Britain. Now, Britain’s first Sikh female parliamentarian Preet Kaur Gill has nominated her as a candidate for a new memorial to represent the diversity of the country.“The last few years, we have seen our country more polarised. As an MP, I want to use my voice to bring people together and to build cohesion in the UK,” said Gill.“I am backing the Hidden Heroes campaign because we have so many of our achievements to celebrate and the stories of more under-represented groups can help build pride and a shared narrative of what Britain is today,” she said.The “Hidden Heroes” campaign has been created to build on the diversity of public monuments, statues and art, because fewer than 3% of the statues in the UK are of non-royal women, with other categories hardly represented.“We need more statues, not less. Let’s celebrate people whose values we can all be inspired by and who tell the story of this wonderfully diverse nation,” said Zehra Zaida, campaigner and founder of the “Hidden Heroes” campaign as part of her wider “We Too Built Britain” initiative.“Symbolism in representation has a role to play in cohesion and bringing people together under shared values,” she said.The initiative, to coincide with the ongoing South Asian Heritage Month in the UK, calls on members of Parliament from every constituency to ask local people to nominate their “Hidden Heroes”.Some might be figures that history has somewhat neglected, others might be more local heroes with inspirational stories.Tom Tugendhat, parliamentarian and chair of the UK Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, has long supported the campaign to better memorialise the women spies of the World War II Special Operations Executive (SOE), including Indian-origin SOE agent Noor Inayat Khan.“Britain has always brought together people from different cultures and backgrounds. It’s what has made us strong and adaptable over centuries. We need to celebrate our community with all its differences,” said Tugendhat.The We Too Built Britain campaign, which has attracted cross-party political support as well as celebrity and grassroots backing, was set up with the aim of improving the diversity of representation across legal tender. It led to UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak launching a new “Diversity Built Britain” 50 pence coin series last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sophia-duleep-singh-in-the-running-for-uk-s-hidden-heroes-statues-campaign-101626895361726.html
22-07-2021||Chandigarh||BJP itself behind attack on mayor, senior leader in Chandigarh: Congress||Upping the ante against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the recent imposition of prohibitory orders on mass assembly across the city, the Congress has blamed thesaffron fold itself for the attack on the city mayor and a senior BJP leader at the Sector 48 motor market on July 17.Speaking at a press conference in Sector 27 here on Wednesday, Congress city chief Subhash Chawla said, “If an honest investigation is done by the police, it will show that it was the BJP that perpetrated the attack.” Chawla alleged that the attack was carried out to justify the imposition of Section 144 prohibitory orders in the entire city: “Just four months before the municipal corporation (MC) elections, the BJP is attempting to scuttle our protests.”Slamming the UT administration, Chawla said, “The administration is working entirely under the pressure of the BJP that blamed the police for the attack. So for hiding its own shortcomings, the administration has imposed a blanket ban on protests. We request the administration to withdraw these orders at the earliest.”This is the latest in a war of words between the two major political parties after city mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and senior BJP leader Sanjay Tandon had a narrow escape when their vehicles were attacked with rods and stones allegedly by anti-farm-laws protesters in Sector 48. On their part, the BJP leaders alleged that Congress party workers were present at the protest when the incident took place. BJP has also highlighted a viral video from a night before the incident alleging it included Congress workers calling for attacks on BJP leaders.Stating that the Congress would continue with its protests, Chawla said, “We will find new ways to protest, use social media and mainstream media for it.”Party’s chief spokesperson HS Lucky said, “Against our earlier protests, BJP had got multiple FIRs registered against our party workers.”Stating that the BJP was trying to hide its own failures, Congress councillor and leader of opposition in MC Devinder Singh Babla said, “People are still getting hiked water bills and overcharged garbage collection bills. If hiked bills are issued next month too, I will sit on a fast against the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-itself-behind-attack-on-mayor-senior-leader-in-chandigarh-congress-101626894943269.html
22-07-2021||Chandigarh||Rising water level in Ghaggar worries farmers in Moonak||The water level in Ghaggar is continuously rising in Sangrur district, leaving farmers in the Moonak area worried.The water level in the river was 742 feet on Wednesday evening, just six feet below the danger mark. Farmers said the water level was increasing and it has created cracks at one point in the Moonak area. The local administration sent its teams and MGNREGA workers to strengthen the banks.Amrik Singh, a farmer from Moonak, said that he has been fighting for the strengthening of banks of Ghaggar since 2011 but locals have to face worries every year as the successive governments failed to find a permanent solution of the problem.“When I visited my farm fields today, I noticed that the water was damaging the banks of the river. I made a video and sent it to sub-divisional magistrate and other district administration officials,” said Amrik Singh, who owns 15 acres of land.Pargat Singh, a farmer from Surjan Bhaini village, said the water from fields is drained out with the help of pipes into the Ghaggar, but it weakens the banks and creates cracks. “There should be a permanent solution to the problem and repairs of banks should be done before monsoon,” added Pargat, who owns 32 acres of land near Ghaggar.Moonak tehsildar Surinder Singh said he along with a team of the revenue department visited the site between Moonak and Tohana where a crack developed and it was being repaired by MGNREGA workers. “The labour spent the entire day in strengthening the banks. We are also using machines for the same,” he added.Moonak SDM Aakash Bansal said a team of army had also inspected the banks of Ghaggar a day ago. All the weak points are being strengthened and a team was also sent to fill the crack which developed on Wednesday.In 2019, a breach of over 150-ft was reported in Ghaggar river at Phulad village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rising-water-level-in-ghaggar-worries-farmers-in-moonak-101626894941503.html

22-07-2021||Chandigarh||Since Covid outbreak, industrial production in Mohali down by 40%||Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the industry in Mohali has taken a severe hit with the overall production gone down by 40%.The industrialists account the losses to a failure to procure raw material during the first and the second wave. Besides, the reverse migration of the workforce led to further losses, 30% of whom are yet to come back from their native states. Moreover, due to power and other issues, around 50 units have been shifted to neighbouring states.There are around 13,000 micro, small and medium enterprises and 49 major industrial houses in the district employing 1.3 lakh workers.The president of Mohali Industries Association (MIA), Yogesh Sagar, said, “For the past 15 months, the industry has suffered heavily. We were not getting semi-finished products due to the restrictions in other states. Also, 30% of our workforce is yet to come back, which has resulted in the production going down by around 40%.”He further said, due to certain issues and power problems, around 50 units have been shifts to neighbouring states and most of them in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, he added.Vivek Kapoor, the vice-president of MIA, said due to shut down, manufacturers were not able to sell final products and also there is an acute shortage of steel due to decline in the supply and very high prices in the domestic market, he said.He further said, “The production had also gone down due to the non-availability of oxygen cylinders for manufacturing specially during the second wave. This has led to production going down by 40-50% in most of the units. Though things are coming back to track, it will take some time.”Around 10 industries became operational in Mohali in 1978, growing to about 10,000 units, including manufacturing and IT/service industry. The Industrial Area is divided into different phases: Phases 1 to 4 fall under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA), Phase 7, 8A, and 8B under the Punjab Small Industries Export Corporation Limited (PSIEC), and Phase 9 under Punjab Infotech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/since-covid-outbreak-industrial-production-in-mohali-down-by-40-101626894763200.html

In a first, 16 departments, including agencies like Society for Promotion of IT Chandigarh (SPIC), Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL), Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) and municipal corporation (MC), have submitted a list of 33 “priority” works with UT adviser Dharam Pal, while committing to complete these within 100 days. If not completed, Pal warned, “Responsibility will be fixed for the delays and action taken. We will monitor the progress every month.” Most of these projects have been hanging fire for long. For instance, CHB has committed to launch the IT Park Housing Scheme on priority. The project has been in the planning stage for a couple of years now and the launch date has been pushed repeatedly, pending several requisite approvals. Similarly, CSCL’s much-touted public bicycle sharing project has missed several deadlines. Under criticism due to hardships faced by residents in accessing their land records, the Deputy Commissioner’s Office has listed upgrade and digitisation of land records. The UT engineering department has committed to complete the buildings of Government Primary School in Dhanas and Government High School in Raipur Kalan and Raipur Kalan, Phase 3. Education department will also make four schools operational, including two government model senior secondary schools in Raipur Kalan and Maloya; and two high schools in Makhan Majra and Sector 12. The city will get six new community centres in Sectors 20, 21, 30, 35, 38 and Mauli Jagran within the 100-day deadline, the engineering department has stated. The forest and wildlife department will establish a Bird Park for Exotic Birds at Nagar Van. A new oxygen pipeline will be laid at GMCH, Sector 32, and two PSA plants, one each at GMCH-32 and at GMCH South Campus Hospital, Sector 48, will also be installed. Taking note of the delay in completion of several projects, Pal had given a week’s time to the departments to submit their priority lists. “Completion of these projects requires constant monitoring. For that we needed a list with deadlines. Unless there are genuine reasons, action will be taken if the projects stay pending after 100 days,” the adviser said. “The preparation of the list and 100-day road map itself has given the departments incentive to complete the long-pending works, added Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/100day-deadline-chandigarh-depts-ready-list-of-works-told-to-get-cracking-101626894643125.html

Entomology expert at the PAU Dr Vijay Kumar said the crop has reached the stage where the attack is apprehended. “According to a survey conducted by the university, so far whitefly population in cotton has not reached economic threshold level (ETL), so the farmers need not fear,” he added. This kharif season cotton is grown over 3.11 lakh hectares in the state, particularly the districts of south-west Punjab. “Some insects of pink bollworm and whitelfly were noticed in the fields of Bathinda and Mansa districts but there is no fear so far, but the farmers should be alert,” suggested director agriculture SS Sidhu. Last year, cotton was grown over 2.51 lakh hectares in the state. It needs mention that 99% of cotton is BT variety and is resistant to American bollworm and tobacco bollworm but not to whitefly and pink bollworm. Dr Kumar asked farmers to spray agrochemicals as recommended by the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/monitor-cotton-crop-for-whitefly-pink-bollworm-attack-pau-101626894341426.html

From there, Chautala addressed the farmers.The INLD patriarch said the Opposition MPs will gherao the Parliament on Thursday in protest against Centre’s three farm laws. He urged them to create a situation which will force the Union government led by BJP to repeal these laws.“The BJP government will be forced by the public to repeal the three farm laws. These laws were brought to the benefit of a few corporate players. There is much needed demand of time to form a third front to uproot the Modi government from the Centre.

Congress had wanted to withdraw support,” he said.“Many allies of the Congress including Sitaram Yechury, Jayalalitha, Chandrababu Naidu, and Mamata Banerjee have complained that their phones were tapped during the UPA rule,” Khattar added.The CM said during the UPA rule, former Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had accused the then Union home minister P Chidambaram of phone tapping.There’s a list of 9,000 people whose phones were tapped during the UPA rule, Khattar said.‘MY NUMBER COULD ALSO BE ON SURVEILLANCE’He went a step further to say that even his mobile number could be under surveillance by a spying company.“But that does not mean that we (the government) have any role in it. In fact, we could also be the victim. There are so many agencies that do snooping,” he said.“Even my mobile number could be on the database which is the source of media reports. Those 50,000 mobile numbers released worldwide could have been the targets. But there is no proof as to who targeted these numbers, which company did it, and whether the spyware actually worked on these numbers,” Khattar said.The CM said NSO Group, which manufactured the Pegasus spyware, also sells it to private agencies besides governments. “I have spent 10 hours studying this issue and have official information on the matter,” Khattar said.BRIEFING A DAY AFTER PARLIAMENT DISRUPTEDThe CM’s remarks came a day after the Parliament proceedings were disrupted over the issue with the Opposition demanded urgent debates on the issue.The disruptions followed the global investigative consortium reporting that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and election strategist Prashant Kishore besides two sitting Union ministers and journalists were among people potentially targeted by the Israeli phone hacking software, Pegasus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pegasus-spyware-khattar-questions-amnesty-international-s-credibility-101626893867660.html

A complainant in the matter was lodged by a 34-year-old resident of Bhairavnagar in Dhanori, Pune. The man was buying a puppy of golden retriever breed based on a post on a social media platform. The account holder asked for ₹9,000 and then told the man that the puppy was no more. However, he refused to return the money as well, according to the complainant. A case under Sections 419 (personation) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66(c) and 66(c) of Information Technology Act was registered at Vishrantwadi police station.

22-07-2021||Lucknow||UP cabinet okays proposals for rural jobs, improve Ayodhya’s road infrastructure||LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath cabinet cleared 29 proposals at its meeting on Wednesday, some of them aimed at boosting religious tourism by upgrading the road network in Ayodhya and Mathura while generating employment especially in rural Uttar Pradesh (UP) where the ruling BJP recently swept the rural panchayat polls for the first time.A 42-kilometre by-pass project, directly connecting Kaushambi to Prayagraj, too was cleared to improve connectivity with Kaushambi, where several archaeological remains of Buddhist period have been found and which, the Yogi government wants to develop on par with other prominent Buddhist circuit sites like Sarnath, Kushinagar, Kapilvastu and Shravasti. UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the government has also decided to create about 1.6 lakh jobs, two in each of the 58,189 gram panchayats in the state by appointing a computer operator and assistant who would work from panchayat bhawans or rural secretariat buildings to be constructed at gram panchayats where such infrastructure doesn’t exist at the moment. At present, rural secretariat buildings exist in 33,577 panchayats and those requiring repair or renovation too would be identified.The government hasn’t clarified how much the two staffers would be paid. The minister hinted it could be ₹6,000 per month. “I think this is what has been broadly suggested,” Sidharth Nath Singh said while briefing reporters about the 29 proposals cleared by the cabinet chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the Lok Bhawan on Wednesday evening. Besides, the government will also recruit 6,000 people against sanctioned posts of village panchayat officers and village development officers. As of now, only 10,000 of the 16,000 sanctioned posts are manned.“It will be mandatory to employ local people to work in these rural secretariats as this would aid the objective of boosting village economy through job creation,” Singh said. “The chief minister has set a six-month deadline for completing this process in rural UP,” Sidharth Nath said. The deadline is timed just ahead of the UP polls early next year. The state government has already rolled out ‘Mission employment’ in the state under which all vacancies in the government departments are being filled. Before the cabinet meeting Adityanath had handed over recruitment letters to 130 youths who were appointed as excise inspectors. 40 lakh more to get free medical insuranceThe state government has decided to include 40 lakh antyodaya ration card holders, essentially the unemployed, women and elderly, under the mukhyamantri arogya yojana, the chief minister’s free medical insurance scheme that provides for up to ₹5 lakh free insurance cover and is modelled to cover those left out of a similar scheme announced by the Centre. Mathura road widening project curtailedA road widening project in Mathura has been curtailed from a four-lane to a two-lane road due to environmental concerns, the state government indicated. “An 82 kilometre long, four-lane project for which ₹505.72 crore was sanctioned and was aimed at decongesting Kosi, Nandgaon, Barsana, Govardhan route has now been changed to two lane one as the project meant 12,982 trees would have had to be felled,” Sidharth Nath said.“As per existing norms, this would have had to be compensated by carrying out ten times more plantation. To do that you also require enough land and hence keeping environmental concerns in mind, it has been decided to downgrade the four-lane road widening project in Mathura into a two-lane one,” Sidharth Nath said. “Trees would still be felled but comparatively a lot fewer as the downgraded road widening project would now require 1,966 trees to be felled.”The road widening project has been undertaken to facilitate movement of international tourists to places in Mathura that are associated with Lord Krishna’s childhood and are a part of what the minister described as “baal leela of Krishna.” Ayodhya in focusThree road widening projects in or around Ayodhya were cleared by the state cabinet.“A grand temple is coming up at Ayodhya. We expect global tourist footfall to increase and hence a major push to better road infrastructure has been undertaken,” Sidharth Nath said. The road widening projects include the Ayodhya-Akbarpur-Baskhari route. This project is aimed at easing traffic congestion in Azamgarh, Mau, Varanasi and Ballia route, officials associated with the project said. After the cabinet meeting, the chief minister sat through a presentation by departments of tourism and culture on the proposed spiritual theme park at Ayodhya, culture policy and upgradation of Vindhyavasini temple project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cabinet-okays-proposals-for-rural-jobs-improve-ayodhya-s-road-infrastructure-101626893202479.html

22-07-2021||Pune||Same ATM robbers made one failed attempt three days ago in Pune||PUNE: The men suspected in the ATM explosion and theft case in Chakan are also reported to have made a failed attempt in an ATM in Ranjangaon on July 18, according to Pimpri-Chinchwad police officials. The method of theft has been found in several parts of the country few years ago - Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana, according to the police. The men used a vehicle which was stolen from the same area few days before the theft, according to Sudhir Hiremath, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pimpri Chinchwad police. The Pimpri Chinchwad police have recorded a total of 11 ATM thefts in 2021 so far. “Most of the attempts are by single person and therefore unsuccessful. Of the seven cases, we have detected 3-4. Of the successful attempts In the past month alone, there have been multiple cases where attempts have been made to either uproot or break open ATMs in Pune city, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Pune rural police jurisdictions. While there have been successful attempts in the past, the past cases have only come to show that it takes planning and brut mechanical force to be able to break open the score. The Pune rural police had found a stolen ATM hours after it was stolen from Jejuri industrial area in the month of May. The machine had been abandoned in a secluded spot around 3-4km away from the ATM center. Reason? The thieves were not able to cut open through the cash vault of the machine. There have been multiple cases where machines were found abandoned or the machine was left in the ATM center as the thieves could not successfully damage the covering. On the night intervening July 10 and July 11, the doors of an ATM center along Pune-Solapur road were broken open in Uruli Kanchan. The machine was also found with dents in it but the insides were left intact. This was perceived by the Pune city police as a failed attempt. On the same night, the Pune city police night patrol team in Kharadi arrested two men who were unsuccessfully trying to open an ATM machine. Same was the case in the early hours of July 1, when Pimpri Chinchwad police found an ATM in Ganeshnagar area of Talwade with signs of unsuccessful tampering. The Pune rural police had arrested two members of a gang which had tried to uproot an ATM but failed in Shirur on July 7. It only comes to prove that getting inside the ATM’s cash vault is a difficult task.

22-07-2021||Pune||Dosage shortage sees fall in inoculation numbers in Pune||Pune: After a lukewarm response, private centres cut down on vaccination centres in Pune while government centres are also not getting adequate doses. This has led to a drop in inoculation in the city. On the vaccination drive, Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said that when private hospitals were given permission to start inoculation, around 2,000 beneficiaries received the jab each day. “Now there has been a drop in inoculation. From the last week of July, we are expecting to see more people coming for vaccination. As the 84-day time period of first dose beneficiaries for the age group 18 to 45 years will be over, more beneficiaries are likely to come to private centres for their second dose,” said Kelkar. Dr Roshan Palresha, consultant, emergency medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune said that the government and manufacturing companies should send regular supply of vaccines. “Government and manufacturing companies should look into the production and supply problems to ensure maximum inoculation,” said Dr Palresha. Stock of Covishield vaccines was over in the district for the last two days. Since Tuesday, no vaccination centre were administering Covishield vaccine. In Pune city around six centers were administering only Covaxin to beneficiaries, first and second dose. Dr Sachin Edke, district Immunisation officer, on Wednesday said that a total of 62,000 doses of Covishield were sent for Pune district on Wednesday. “Out of these, Pune rural will get 27,000 doses, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will get 21,000 doses and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will get 14,000 doses,” said Edke He added that on Wednesday, the district also received 12,620 doses of Covaxin. “Pune rural will get 5,620 doses, PMC 4,000 doses and PCMC 3,000 doses,” said Dr Edke. As per PMC officials, Pune city will have 53 government centres for administering Covishield on Thursday as the supply for Covishield has arrived. “There will be on spot registration for 20 per cent beneficiaries whereas rest will need to book an online appointment for their first and second dose of Covishield. Beneficiaries who have received their first dose before April 28 will be eligible for their second dose and can register through Co-WIN application,” said an official notification issued by the PMC.Vaccine counts July 20, 2021 Total beneficiaries inoculated in Pune district-- % Government—8,323--38.76 Private—13,147--61.23 Total—21,470--100 July 1, 2021 Total beneficiaries inoculated in Pune district-- % Government—6,696--18.90 Private--28,726--81.10 Total--35,422--100 June 22, 2021 Total beneficiaries inoculated in Pune district-- % Government—41,520--59.40 Private—27,860--40.10 Total--69,380--100 *Source: District health department||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dosage-shortage-sees-fall-in-inoculation-numbers-in-pune-101626892360806.html
22-07-2021||Delhi||Heat and humidity return to Delhi, more rain only from July 23, says IMD||After two days of heavy rainfall, heat and humidity made a comeback in Delhi on Wednesday, making it uncomfortable to remain outdoors during the daytime. India Meteorological Department (IMD) said heavy rain is likely to resume again from July 23.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 34.7 degrees Celsius (°C). The minimum temperature was 22.4°C, which was five degrees below the season’s normal.“The rainfall activity is likely to pick up again on July 23. Moderate showers are expected till July 26,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He said though July is likely to see more rain, the capital gets most of its yearly rainfall in August. “This is because the monsoon trough and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, the two primary conditions for rainfall, are more favourable during that time for Delhi,” said Srivastava.IMD recordings show that parts of Delhi received trace rainfall late Wednesday. Scientists said that patchy rain is expected to continue in some parts but conditions are likely to be humid on Thursday.Even though the monsoon arrival in Delhi-NCR was delayed this time, the city, as on July 21, has made up its rainfall deficit and is currently surplus by nearly 27%, thanks mainly to the high intensity rain between July 18 and July 20, weather analysts said.The IMD in early June had forecasted that the south-west monsoon would reach north-west India, including Delhi, by June 15, which would have been the earliest monsoon ever for the region. But that date, as well as several others put forward by the IMD, turned out to be wrong as the monsoon took a break before finally making an official entry on July 13 -- a delay of 16 days from its usual onset.Met officials said despite the delayed arrival, July is likely to record “normal to above normal” rainfall.“We have around 10 more days to go in July and it is expected that we will see a normal to above normal rainfall this month. The rainfall deficit for the season was made up by the intense rain on Monday and Tuesday,” said a senior Met official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/heat-and-humidity-return-to-delhi-more-rain-only-from-july-23-says-imd-101626891701449.html
22-07-2021||Other||Delhi govt draws up home education plan for out-of-school children with special needs||Five years ago when Kanta Bhardwaj, a 33-year-old resident of Hamidpur, was told that her son would never be on par with other children, she said she left the hospital feeling “hopeless.” Her eleven-year-old was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. While Bhardwaj tried to teach him alphabets and numbers in the subsequent years, she said it has been challenging for them.“Earlier this year, the state education department reached out to us to enrol our child for their home-based education plan. Interacting with the resource person has helped us in many ways. The teacher shared resource material that keeps our child engaged and also spoke to us about how we can teach him or interact with him,” she said.Last year, the directorate of education’s (DoE) inclusive education branch rolled out a home-based education plan for 251 of the 649 children with special needs, who are not enrolled in formal schooling due to their disability or other reasons. The department allotted resource persons to each child and was responsible for screening the children for 21 disabilities as given in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. The special educators also conducted skill-based and academic assessments to develop individualized education plan as per the needs and requirements of the children between January-February this year.Following a fresh round of survey that is set to end this month, the department is now planning to extend the programme to all out-of-school children with special needs so that those who cannot come to school can continue home-based education.A senior official in the inclusive education branch of the education department said it is the first time that the department has rolled out such a plan. “The idea is to help these children learn basic tasks and routine activities such as brushing, eating, wearing clothes, and using washroom, and then focus on basic reading and writing. The concerned resource persons will also help enrol these children in government or open schools based on their learning levels and upon completion of the intervention. We also plan to help these children learn some skills or vocation if they express the desire and inclination to do so.”While the resource persons are expected to do fortnightly visits to these families, parents HT spoke to said that the lockdown impacted the process.Saurabh Kumar (18), a resident of Amrit Vihar in Burari, said the resource person assigned to his 15-year-old sister, who has celebral palsy, paid only a few visits since January due to the second wave of Covid-19 but kept in touch with the family through calls and text messages.“My sister has attended school only till the age of nine. When she started getting fits more frequently, the private school she was enrolled in said they could no longer handle it. I tried teaching her but she was easily irritable and refused to learn. The resource person we were assigned in January this year shared a list of activities that we could do with her,” said Kumar.The department has been handing out flashcards to identify fruits, vegetables, and modes of transport, therapeutic clay, and spongy balls to improve fine-motor skills, picture books and colouring books to improve visual sense, and even different textures of cloth or paper to improve their tactile sense under the programme.Bharat Bhushan, who has been the point-person for five such children in the north district, said, “Each child is different and so they require a specialised learning plan. We have children suffering from intellectual disability to cerebral palsy to quadriplegia or monoplegia. These children mostly come from families where there isn’t much awareness of the different disabilities.”“We also help the family understand how they need to approach daily tasks, do exercises with children to improve their muscles and speech exercises to improve their communication,” said Bharat.Family members of children with special needs enrolled in the home-education plan said the intervention has led to minor changes in their wards in the past few months. “Due to cerebral palsy, my sister’s body is weak and she cannot walk easily. That has changed. Now, she is motivated to get out of bed and do tasks assigned to her for the day. She can now identify colours, can speak more clearly, and can wear clothes with little help,” said Kumar.Bhardwaj too cited the same. “My son now takes interest in activities. I am now teaching him how to form sentences while speaking. This gives us hope because our child loves to play and do all the naughty things that any 11-year-old does. I will do everything we are asked to if it improves my child’s life,” she said.However, Anita Ghai, dean of School of Human Studies at Ambedkar University and a disability rights activist, said home-based learning plans could only work if they are done in a blended mode. “Limiting these children to home will restrict their development of the self. Even if the severity of certain disabilities does not allow children to come out of their homes and learn, a module has to be developed where there is some element of interaction with the society to ensure that disability is understood in an epistemological way. If my parents had kept me in the house, I would not have reached where I am today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delh-govt-draws-up-home-education-plan-for-out-of-school-children-with-special-needs-101626891700664.html
22-07-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP lock horns over distribution of dry ration||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) have refused dry ration to students enrolled in primary schools who failed to attend online classes. The BJP said the allegations are “false”.Physical classes are currently suspended in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic and families of students enrolled in primary schools across the country are entitled to dry ration as a substitute for midday meal as part of a central government scheme.“Despite government reports stating that 40-45% of students are unable to take online classes due to lack of infrastructure, the BJP-ruled MCDs have refuse to give ration to those who did not attend online classes. It is shameful that the BJP-ruled MCDs are not giving midday meal ration to... children who failed to attend online classes because their parents can’t afford Android phones,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.Pathak further said, “Many children from very poor families study in MCD schools. It is a sin to rob their midday meal ration. In the last one and a half years, the BJP managed the midday meal scheme and engaged in corruption. This ration does not belong to you. I request with folded hands to the BJP’s top leaders to distribute the midday meal ration to all the children.”Praveen Shankar Kapoor, spokesperson of Delhi-BJP, said: “The allegations are false. The MCDs have introduced no such provision that denies dry ration to students who fail to attend online classes. We fail to understand the logic behind such lies...It seems the AAP’s only purpose is to malign MCDs.”While the AAP is in charge of the government in Delhi, the BJP rules the three MCDs.

22-07-2021||Delhi||Connaught Place shop owners struggle to get permission for basic repairs||Traders from Connaught Place are demanding relaxation in norms for permission to carry out basic repair and maintenance work in their shops and restaurants in the heritage market, claiming that it sometimes takes over three months to get the approval from the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) for the same.As the buildings in Connaught Place market, which was constructed in 1933, are notified as Grade II heritage structures, NDMC officials said HCC’s permission is mandatory even for basic maintenance and internal repairs, including painting the premises and relaying floor or wall tiles.“To do the basic repairs such as painting, re-flooring, wood works or changing the wiring or fix the damage due to seepage or leakage, we have to take permission from NDMC and HCC. The process is cumbersome and takes months to get the approval... Why can’t the process be simpler and faster?” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA).The NDTA, which represents traders from Connaught Place market, has been raising the issue for the last two years.The market association said that HCC’s November 9, 2020, direction to NDMC to not forward applications where there is a dispute regarding ownership of the building or between the landlord and tenant -- “to avoid HCC getting involved in litigation” -- has made it virtually impossible to carry out necessary repairs.Manpreet Singh, owner of Zen restaurant in Connaught Place’s B-block, pointed out that a large number of restaurants and shops in the heritage market are run by tenants.Singh, who is also the treasurer of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said, “There are over 50 restaurants operating in Connaught Place. It is difficult for tenants to get permission from landlords for repair and maintenance. It is a heritage building and requires frequent repair and maintenance. The norms for it should be relaxed.”Last year, the NDTA wrote to the HCC, calling its decision “contrary to the rules and byelaws”. “If the landlord doesn’t carry out repairs and the tenant is also not allowed to do the same, the property and its condition will deteriorate,” said Bhargava.Though HCC officials did not respond to requests seeking comment, the minutes of an HCC meeting held on January 11 this year puts the onus on NDMC: “In view of the issues raised by the NDTA and as ownership related issue falls within the jurisdiction of the concerned local body i.e. NDMC in this case, they may adopt an appropriate system to prevent involvement of the HCC in ownership related disputes.”NDTA members said that since then the issue has been in a limbo.“The Prime Minister talks about ease of doing business, but traders feel harassed due to stringent norms even for basic repairs and maintenance of their establishment,” said Bhargava.Traders said that in some cases, like whitewashing or painting of the premises, the owners end up spending more money on the process of getting an approval than on the actual repair or maintenance work.“One of the reasons why I have not renovated my restaurant is the lengthy process involved in obtaining permission. The process even involves roping in an architect to upload the documents and drawing. We end up spending more money than the actual repair cost,” said Singh.When contacted, a senior NDMC official aware of the development said, “In some cases, the process takes time as there are deficiencies in the documents uploaded by the traders. According to HCC norms, a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the landlord is a must. We are just following HCC’s decision to not send applications where there is a dispute over ownership or NOC is not there.”Author, historian and heritage expert Swapna Liddle said that the colonial-era business district needs a proper maintenance plan and guidelines on the type of repairs allowed. “This is a huge block of buildings which are similar in characteristics. A plan or comprehensive guidelines on the list of things which are allowed should be put in place with respect to Connaught Place. For important structures like Connaught Place, a management plan should be prepared like we have it for Rashtrapati Bhavan. So that if any work has to be done within the scope of the management plan, people should be allowed to do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/connaught-place-shop-owners-struggle-to-get-permission-for-basic-repairs-101626891461217.html
22-07-2021||Delhi||Homeless man’s disappearance from North Delhi leaves cops guessing||For the last one month, an unattended cycle-rickshaw with some rotis staling on its seat, an old mattress covered by a mosquito net tied to the rickshaw’s frame, and some dirty clothes hanging on the iron railing of the adjacent park near Sewa Kutir Complex in north Delhi’s Kingsway Camp, are the only signs of a 40-year-old man whose disappearance over a month ago has left the police and locals searching for answers.The man, identified as Ram Prasad, better known as Rakesh, has been missing since June 21, a day after he was allegedly attacked and injured by a blind man and was admitted to Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital by a security guard and some employees of the Sewa Kutir Complex, which comes under the social welfare department and also has a boys hostel for blind. He was later shifted to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) from where he went missing on June 21. A social welfare department official said Rakesh died at RML and was cremated by the police but neither the police or others who knew him were aware of this.At the Sewa Kutir Complex, Rakesh’s belongings lie unattended and rusting near the entry gate of the campus, bearing a sore sight for the many who knew him.The employees of the Sewa Kutir complex, local shopkeepers and some residents who go for a morning or evening walk daily said that Rakesh had been staying on the campus for nearly 20 years and earned his livelihood as a rickshaw puller. He mostly ferried blind residents of the hostel from one place to another, and many remember him as the one feeding stray dogs every morning and evening.“All his items are getting damaged in the rain and heat. Neither the police nor the officials of Sewa Kutir have made any efforts to preserve his belongings or do anything to find him. I become upset whenever I visit the campus and see the rickshaw and other items lying untouched,” said a government officer, who lives nearby.Upender Yadav, who belongs to Rakesh’s hometown in Bihar’s Madhubani and works at Sewa Kutir, said, “We visited the hospitals a couple of times but could not find him. His absence and unattended belongings make us feel sad. I just pray that he is alive. The police should do something to find him.”Recalling the incident of June 20, Prabhat, the security guard who was on night duty at the complex, said that he was having his dinner in the guard room when he heard a scream for help at around 11.30pm. He said he found a blind man, who had been living in the hostel for the blind on the campus at the time, allegedly attacking Rakesh with a sharp or blunt object.“Some blind men living in the hostel also reached there and they all caught the attacker. I informed the police control room about the attack. We rushed Rakesh to Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital and gave the blind man’s custody to the police at the Mukherjee Nagar police station. I don’t know what happened after that. All I know is that Rakesh went missing from RML hospital and has not returned yet,” said Prabhat.In the hospital’s and police’s records, Rakesh, was declared as LAMA, a term used to refer to patients who leave (hospitals) against medical advice. The police, which was informed about the crime, have not even registered a first information report (FIR).When contacted, deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said, “When our team went to record the victim’s statement, he was not in a state to give one. Later, the victim disappeared from RML hospital during treatment and did not come back to file a complaint or record his statement. He was declared a LAMA in the hospital’s medical record. Since, the victim’s statement or complaint could not be recorded, no case was registered and we had to shift the blind man to a shelter home run by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in outer Delhi.”RML hospital officials were unable to give details pertaining to Rakesh’s treatment till the time of going to press.When contacted, chief probation officer (CPO) of the social welfare department Mahesh Sharma said that they have launched an enquiry. “We have learnt that Rakesh died at RML hospital and his body was cremated by the police. To authenticate this, we will be speaking to all the police personnel associated with the incident. Also, the blind man was an ex-resident of our hostel and had left it in 2015. However, he used to visit the hostel to meet some residents. Rakesh was not staying in any shelter home inside the complex. We also have learnt that the actual owner of the rickshaw is someone else. Why the owner has not removed the rickshaw till date and how it was allowed inside the premises is also being looked into,” said CPO Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/homeless-man-s-disappearance-from-north-delhi-leaves-cops-guessing-101626891460617.html
22-07-2021||Delhi||Shorter, more intense rain spells a flood worry for Delhi||Over the last decade, the Capital has been receiving shorter and more intense spells of rain, scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, a change in monsoon patterns that is the primary reason behind increasing instances of urban flooding and flash floods in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).Rainfall data maintained by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune shows that in the 1980s and 1990s, in July, Delhi used to record 15-20 rainy days on an average, which in the last decade has reduced to eight to 10 days. Met officials concurred, and said that rainfall in the Capital used to be distributed more uniformly, but it is now seen in short and more intense episodes.An example of this can be seen in this year’s monsoon pattern.Despite a slow start to the monsoon, the Capital, with just five days of heavy rains has managed to record a rainfall surplus of 27% so far. Till July 17, Delhi rainfall was at a deficit of 51%. The usual date for monsoon arrival in Delhi is June 27, but the onset this year was 16 days late, and the Capital received its first monsoon shower on July 13.After the onset, the city has got rain on only five days. In these days alone, 248.2mm rainfall has been recorded, as against the usual 192.9mm.The hourly rainfall recordings between July 18 (8.30am) to July 19 (8.30am) at the Safdarjung observatory showed 69.6mm rainfall, while the Palam weather station received 99.3mm rains, Lodhi Road 62mm, the Ridge 58mm, and Aya Nagar 51.6mm.Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary of the Union ministry of earth sciences, also said that the rain spells in Delhi were getting shorter, but more intense.“The number of rainy days is decreasing, but when it rains, it rains very heavily for short periods. This is a pattern that we have been observing not just in Delhi but in many metro cities. When this happens, instances of flash floods in cities increase because rainfall that was supposed to have spread across say, a week, is now being received in a day,” Rajeevan said.Flash floods are a sudden flood of water caused by heavy rainfall in a region. Over the last two days, when Delhi and NCR recorded intense showers, the Capital, and satellite towns such as Gurugram saw massive flooding that led to roads, footpaths, underpasses and even residential and office buildings being inundated.In Delhi’s Pul Prahladpur a 27-year-old drowned in flooded underpass, and a nine-year old boy died after drowning in a rain-water filled pit in outer Delhi’s Metro Vihar on Monday.To be sure, one big reason for this is lack of maintenance and cleaning or de-silting by the various agencies of the Delhi and Gurugram administration.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private forecaster, attributed the change in monsoon patterns to the climate crisis.“Earlier, rains in Delhi continued for three or four days. And this rain used to be from altostratus clouds, but this type of cloud has almost stopped forming in the tropics now,” said Palawat.“Air temperatures are increasing because of the climate crisis and global warming. When this happens, the moisture-carrying capacity of the air also increases. This leads to the formation of intense clouds, called convective clouds, which are capable of producing heavy thunderstorms and rainfall in shorter periods,” he added.Forecasters said that, in the coming years, such short, intense spells are likely to increase and cities must prepare for increased urban flooding.“There is no doubt that such instances will only increase in the coming years. IMD has recently come up with a flash floods warning system and scientists are experimenting with advancing the technology further. However, we can keep giving warnings, but there should also be a plan to act upon these warnings. Cities should be prepared on how, within a span of three to four hours, we can respond to flash floods, evacuate public places etc,” Rajeevan said.Urban planning experts also stressed on the need to redesign cities keeping this scenario in mind.Sewa Ram, professor (transport planning) at the School of Planning and Architecture, said that flooding during heavy showers is unavoidable on concretised surfaces, which water cannot percolate through. So, the way forward has to be to find innovative ways to design roads and drainages.“The trend of urban floods is not new anymore. We must go back to the drawing board, study our roads and drainage systems and come up with ways in which water stagnation reduces. Old drainage systems must be redone, so that they can flush out more water,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rain-spells-getting-shorter-and-intense-delhi-must-prepare-for-more-flash-floods-episodes-weather-scientists-101626891400684.html
22-07-2021||Delhi||Oxygen mess gets political again: Sisodia lashes out at Centre||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday accused the Centre of “lying” in Parliament that no deaths were caused due to a shortage of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19 infections in the country.The comment pertains to the Union health ministry’s statement in Parliament that no state reported any fatality due to oxygen shortage, which triggered criticism from several political leaders – Sisodia first criticised the stand in a statement on Tuesday.In response, the Bharatiya Janata Party blamed state governments, including the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, for not declaring any of the deaths were linked to oxygen shortage, and contended that the Centre’s reply was simply based on data from the states.Addressing a digital press conference on Wednesday, Sisodia said, “The Centre blatantly and shamelessly lied to the Parliament on Tuesday. There was a genuine oxygen crisis across the country between April 15 and May 10. During this period, there was utter oxygen mismanagement by the Centre because of which, there was chaos in hospitals. The Centre is now lying to hide its mistakes. It changed its oxygen distribution policy after April 13, which led to a total disaster. The Centre will have to take responsibility for this.”The Centre, Sisodia added, started rationing supplies to states on April 13 based on demand, case load and so on. It also rearranged plants from where states were to get their oxygen supplies. Delhi, for instance, was allocated plants in distant states like West Bengal and Odisha apart from a few that were in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the deputy chief minister said.The crisis in Delhi reached the Delhi high court as well as the Supreme Court, before judicial orders were made to enhance Delhi’s supplies.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra cited a Delhi government submission to a court to point out that the authorities in the city had denied such deaths took place, even as hospital administrators blamed flaws in the recording mechanism for lack of data on the issue.“The Centre says that health is a state subject. It says that it just collects the data, it doesn’t generate it. None of them said that a death occurred in their state and Union Territory due to shortage of oxygen, there is no data for that. Did the Centre generate this data? No,” said Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson.Experts said the problem was there was no mechanism to record oxygen deaths.“This is all a political gimmick. There is no mechanism to report deaths due to oxygen shortage,” said a senior doctor from Batra Hospital, asking not to be named.Dr Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of Batra hospital, on May 1 said in the Delhi high court: “We have lost lives,” when asked about the oxygen crisis. He refused to comment.“All Covid-19 deaths are reported to the state government in a pre-defined format. There is no mechanism to separately report a death due to oxygen shortage. There was a report that the Delhi government set up a six-member committee, but the hospital has received no communication from them,” said an official from a large private hospital in the city.The committee being referred to was the panel constituted by the Delhi government to survey deaths due to lack of oxygen so that the families of the deceased can be compensated – the exercise was halted after the Lieutenant Governor rejected the scheme.Calls to three of the six committee members by HT went unanswered.One of the members answered the call and said: “The committee met only once and the scope of the work was discussed during the meeting. There hasn’t been any communication from the committee to hospitals so far. After the initial meeting, there hasn’t been any communication on whether and when the next meeting would be held.”Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain accused the Union government of impeding in the exercise to determine the number of people who died due to the oxygen crisis. “The Centre will soon say there was no Covid-19. If there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen, then why were hospitals going to high court for shortages? This is completely false. We had formed an audit committee for oxygen to provide compensation to victims, which was stopped by the Centre through LG. The Centre is rubbing salt on wounds. We’ll appeal the LG to allow us to run the committee,” Jain said.One of the most high-profile cases of possible deaths to oxygen shortage was in Delhi’s Jaipur golden hospital, where 20 mostly critical Covid-19 patients died due to oxygen shortage in the night between April 23 and 24. A Delhi government committee on May 5 later told the Delhi high court that that the deaths, due to “respiratory failure”, were not because of oxygen shortage.Addressing a question on this, Sisodia said: “We have told the high court that the Centre is not allowing us to make a committee which is to investigate all such deaths... If you ask us today, we have no data of deaths that happened due to oxygen shortage. We will be able to get such a number only if the Centre allows us to form the committee.”Family members of those that died during this period criticised the governments.Erick Massey, whose mother Delphin Massey (61) died in Jaipur Golden Hospital on the night the hospital ran out of oxygen supply, said: “Both Centre and Delhi government are shrugging off the responsibility. If the hospital went on record to say over 20 people died due to oxygen shortage then what other proof do they need? Delhi government tried to suppress it but why did the central government not initiate any probe into it when everything is in the open?”Jagjyot Singh, whose mother Sarabjit Kaur (58) also died in Jaipur Golden hospital the same night, said: “People died due to negligence of the governments. Now the same governments are insulting the dead by not acknowledging that they died because of oxygen shortage. The patients died of cardiac arrest, lungs collapse, etc because the hospitals could not provide them oxygen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-mess-gets-political-again-sisodia-lashes-out-at-centre-101626891340626.html
22-07-2021||Noida||Covid: Noida, Gzb gear up to restrict entry of travellers from high-risk states||Noida and Ghaziabad district authorities are putting in pace to implement an Uttar Pradesh government advisory to screen people travelling from states having a weekly Covid positivity rate of 3% or more from July 24. Such travellers will be required to carry a negative RT-PCR report not older than four days, or a vaccination certificate indicating that they had been administered both doses.Government officials said the measure were to prevent or delay a possible third wave of Covid-19. Uttar Pradesh has been recovering from the second wave that struck it in April-May. According to the state control room figures released on Wednesday, the state has only 1,093 active cases with 31 in Noida and 30 in Ghaziabad.“We have directed our health department to chalk out a strategy at the earliest. We will rely on around 600 surveillance teams, called ‘Nigrani Samitis’, active in their respective areas in the district,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. “Since we do not have any major railway station or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs), a majority of travellers from other state come to Noida by roads. It is not possible to stop all vehicles at Noida’s UP borders. So, these Nigrani Samitis will help us out with information about such travellers.”The official website of the director general medical health, UP, stated that travellers coming to Uttar Pradesh from high Covid positivity states of Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha or Andhra Pradesh between July 24 to July 31 must make one of the two documents available at the point of entry into Uttar Pradesh.Government officials said that the website will be regularly updated with the list of high Covid positivity states in the coming weeks.In Ghaziabad, the district officials said that people arrive through various modes like metro trains, railway trains or at ISBTs and road.“So, we will have teams deployed at each deboarding points to check for such travellers. Likewise, we are also writing to different government departments, hotels and will even seek the help of residents welfare associations (RWAs) to provide us with information about such travellers. Hospitals will also be asked to furnish such information,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer of Ghaziabad, adding that the district too had 360 Nigrani Samitis.UP share its borders with Uttarakhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Delhi.Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Ghaziabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association, agreed with the state government’s measures.“The step will help prevent inflow of infection into the state and even other Covid variants which may be more severe. The use of proper enforcement and resources is must. If travellers see any laxity, the entire purpose of the system will be defeated. Further, there should be no relaxations for any VIPs or politicians or other such persons,” said Dr Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-crisis-noida-ghaziabad-gear-up-to-restrict-entry-of-travellers-from-high-risk-states-101626889001173.html
22-07-2021||Noida||Mercury rises by 9°C, rains likely over weekend in Noida||Sudden rise of nine degrees Celsius (°C) in mercury, coupled with high humidity levels, made outdoors uncomfortable for the residents on Wednesday, as the rains eluded the city yet again.The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which earlier expected light rains on Wednesday followed by moderate to heavy showers towards the weekend, now expects only light rains between Friday (July 23) and Sunday (July 25).On Wednesday, IMD recorded maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida at 35.5°C and 23.6°C against 26.6°C and 25.6°C a day earlier.“Noida and adjoining areas may witness light rains on weekends. The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 35°C on Thursday. Humidity levels may remain high,” said an IMD official.So far, Noida has recorded very light to light rainfall since July 13, when IMD announced the arrival of monsoon in the National Capital Region. On Tuesday, the city recorded only 0.5mm of rainfall during the morning hours, while it saw 2.5mm of rain, the maximum this season, in the evening.The humidity levels have been oscillating between 64% and 100% in the city, the officials said.“The region is likely to go dry for the next two days as the monsoon trough lines have shifted towards the North. There are chances of only light rain between July 23 and 25. It will, however, be patchy and not like the region had seen over past few days. The mercury may also rise further,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures on Wednesday were recorded at 34.7°C, the season’s average, and 22.4°C, five notches below the season’s average, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-rises-by-9-c-rains-likely-over-weekend-in-noida-101626888881059.html
22-07-2021||Pune||Usage of banned plastic carry bags increases in Pune||The recent study by SWaCH and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) supported waste pickers cooperative reports increased use of plastics, including banned carry bags. The waste pickers cooperative daily collects and segregates waste within the civic limits. The report finds that the usage of plastic carry bags has increased in the city especially after relaxation of lockdown norms despite the state government’s guidelines on ban on plastics bags and other related products. These banned carry bags are being generously used by roadside food stalls and vegetables vendors. The Maharashtra government had in March 2018 issued a notification banning the manufacture, sale and use of single-use plastic bags. It also banned an array of plastic products, including cutlery, straws and containers. The ban imposes a penalty between ₹5,000 and ₹25,000 for those violating the rules. At present, PMC is taking action on carry bags with a thickness of less than 50 microns. According to the study, the city generates around 2,100 tonnes of garbage daily in which the plastic share is around 12 per cent. It touches 15 per cent during festivals. Waste from over 1,000 households, featuring a mix of low, middle and high-income households, was studied for the audit. The waste was first sorted into categories by material type – plastic, paper, metal, glass, sanitary waste, wet waste, etc. Plastic waste was further sorted by type into PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE, PP, PS, O, thermocol, rubber, wires etc. Study highlighted “lack of political and administrative will (Centre, state and local bodies) to enforce plastic ban during economic slowdown. There is Increased concerns of hygiene leading to use of disposable plastic items – masks, gloves, plastic bags. Groceries being packed in 50 microns clear plastic bags. “Certain categories of plastic bags – non-woven PP bags have proliferated the market despite being banned especially at liquor stores.” Dr Ketki Ghatge, assistant medical officer of health, PMC solid waste management department said, “We are carrying out action on plastic material as per the state government directives. We impose, seize banned plastic materials and collect fine from shopkeepers, manufacturers for using and selling ban plastic materials. Nowadays, vegetables vendors and food stalls are using plastic carrybags with a thickness of less than 50 microns. Now, we have decided to intensify the action. The circular will be issue soon.” Plastic waste contains milk bags, oil bags, food bags, yoghurt containers, plastic glasses, cooking oil canisters laminate tubes (toothpaste, medicines), carry bags (all micron thickness) blister packing, bubble wraps, shampoo powder bottles, empty sachets, detergent bags, wrappers cassettes, CD covers, plastic flowers, buckets among other things. City’s plastic waste: Growing menace SWaCH-PMC’s report on daily waste collection and segregation shows an increase in use of plastic, including banned plastic carry bags. Dry waste: 25% of total waste Plastic waste: 25% of dry waste or 6% of total Non-recyclable plastic waste: 39% of plastic waste Recyclable plastic waste: 61% of plastic waste AUDIT FINDINGS Multi-layered plastics was the most common type of plastic, forming 44% of total plastic waste, followed by single layered LDPE (27%). 76% of all plastic waste was food packaging. Sanitary napkins and diapers (not part of audit) made mostly of plastic are 2.5% of all waste in the city (40–50 tonnes per day) – almost equal in weight to all the non-recycled plastic as of now not recycled. Current issues:Plastic waste liners used extensively (sold at traffic stops) Multilayered packaging (chips, sachets etc) increased consumption Increase in food delivery during pandemic lockdowns – hard plastic containers, and flexible plastic bags/pouches – containing sauces, curries, mayonnaise etc. which renders the plastic waste non-recyclable Increased concerns of hygiene leading to use of disposable plastic items – masks, gloves, plastic bags. Lack of enforcement Lack of political and administrative will (Centre, state and local bodies) to enforce plastic ban during economic slowdown Single/multi-use masks – surgical and N95s made out of plastic which are not recycled.

22-07-2021||Pune||After Patole’s call on civic polls, Congress prepares to go solo in Pune||PUNE: Anticipating fewer seats in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena in municipal corporation elections, the Congress has started preparations to contest the civic elections solo with the support of local leaders. The party has started preparations following announcement by state unit chief Nana Patole to contest the polls alone. “If Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) contests the civic elections together, it is clear that NCP will offer few seats to the Congress Party. If the Congress contests less seats, it is clear that its elected members would be less,” said a senior party leader from Pune requesting anonymity. His remarks came two days after Prithviraj Chavan held a meeting with local leaders taking stock for the upcoming elections. The same leader said, “If we consider Pune Municipal Corporation, total seats are 161 and the Congress won second position at hardly 30 places. It means if there would be an alliance, the NCP and the Shiv Sena will offer hardly 40 seats to the party to contest. If there are a total 170 seats and the Congress would get hardly 40 seats, which means the party had no representation in most parts of the city. Currently the 164-member PMC has BJP (99), NCP (42), Congress (11), Shiv Sena (10) and MNS 2 seats. Recently, Congress state unit president Patole sought to contest the local self- government elections on its own, much to the unease of other two partners – NCP and Sena. Patole said, “We will contest municipal and Zilla Parishad elections separately, but will take a call at the local level.” Earlier this week, Patole met party leader Rahul Gandhi and he too supported the former’s stand. Congress leader Mohan Joshi said, “We have already started preparations in Pune city to contest alone. We have even appointed leaders at assembly constituency level. However, post elections, there may be a chance we strike an alliance. We would ensure that our stand would not help the Bharatiya Janata Party.” Former city unit president Abhay Chhajed said, “If the Congress would contest elections separately, it will help the party to increase its base. We can get candidates in each ward and will get party workers in that area which is missing now. But elections are far away. Usually, alliance decisions happen a month before the election, but if we start preparations from now, it would help to create a mass base.” Another Congress leader Arvind Shinde also supported the stand. He said, “The state unit president Nana Patole’s stand is welcomed by party workers. It would definitely help to increase the party base.” Another Congress leader Sanjay Balgude said, “If we go for alliance, it is clear that the Congress would get less seats to contest. There are some formulas for seat sharing and it is mainly on sitting and runner-up seats. Party president Nana Patole’s stand is right which will help the party to garner more base at the grassroots level. If we do alliance, it is clear that we would not have the representation in the alliance partners wards.``||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-patole-s-call-on-civic-polls-cong-prepares-to-go-solo-in-pune-101626874719644.html

22-07-2021||Pune||No unusual spike in cases from ‘Delta plus areas’ in the state||Pune: Amidst fears that the ‘Delta plus’ variant of the coronavirus could be more transmissible, the state health department has observed no spike in Covid-19 cases from the pockets where it was reported last month in the state. The cases of ‘Delta plus’ variants of the virus have been reported from Ratnagiri, Jalgaon, Mumbai, Palghar, Thane, and Sindhudurg. According to the state health officials, over the period of a month, the total tally of the reported cases of this variant has reached only to 23. “23 cases of ‘Delta plus’ have been identified so far in the state. Initially in June, 21 cases were identified and before 10 days 2 cases were reported from Mumbai. We are doing regular testing. A spike in ‘Delta plus’ cases has not been observed. The unusual spike in caseload is not being reported in the areas from which ‘Delta plus’ cases were identified,” said Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer. The new variant mutated in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India. The Maharashtra state administration has tied up the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) for the genome sequencing of Covid-19’s positive samples from each district every month. The highest number of ‘Delta plus’ cases at nine were reported from Ratnagiri district, where the weekly positivity rate (July 13-July 20) is 6.1% and higher than the state average of 4%. According to the state health officials, no fresh cases of ‘Delta plus’ have been recorded in the district. “We have collected more samples from the areas where ‘Delta plus’ was reported. But this variant has not been found in those samples. The unusual spike in caseload is not being reported in the areas from which ‘Delta plus’ cases were identified. Recently, two cases were reported from Mumbai, but as we have noticed no unusual spike have been recorded from there,” said Awate. Citing ‘Delta plus’ a variant of concern Maharashtra government had rolled back its Level 5 restrictions unlock policy and imposed Level 3 as a baseline for the curbs on June 25. On being asked about when the state may have further relaxations, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the curve of Covid cases has to go further down. “The objective behind the current Level 3 restrictions is to avoid crowding. Currently, the state has been reporting positive cases between 6,000-7,000. The recovery rate is almost double the number of infections. The curve in Maharashtra has been plateaued since last month, but it is neither going up nor going down. If the curve goes down further then we can surely ease the curbs. If we observe the trend of declining in the daily cases then relaxations could be in order. But it is not happening. So, these cautionary steps are taken,” Tope said in an interview with a Marathi news channel. Tope also asked the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to issue the guidelines to states for the relaxation policy from the Covid induced curbs. “Entire country has been working according to the protocols set by ICMR and Maharashtra is not an exception to it. ICMR should give us protocols and suggestions about further relaxations based on its observations from the SERO survey. Central teams visited 10 districts. They were told to avoid crowding, more testing, tracking, and observance of the norms. Our actions are in conformity with the guidelines given by the Centre. So, I request ICMR to give us guidelines on this. We will take action accordingly,” said Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-unusual-spike-in-cases-from-delta-plus-areas-in-the-state-101626872800777.html

The villagers were allegedly warned against supporting police and developmental works by the rebels, they added. “After the intervention and pressure of the media and local tribal leaders, the Maoists released the villagers who had reached their village Kunded, on Tuesday night. All of them are safe,” inspector general of police (IGP) (Bastar range) Sunderaj P said.The IGP added that the statement of the 11 villagers will be recorded to ascertain the reason behind their abduction.According to Sunderaj P, seven persons had initially gone missing after attending a social gathering on July 18. A day later, four others, including a village head, had reportedly gone to hold talks with the rebels on the abduction but did not return. According to people familiar with the matter, the rebels suspected the seven villagers had appeared for a police recruitment test, and hence, may have taken them into captivity. Located in the southern tip of Chhattisgarh bordering Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, Sukma district is part of the 1,200 sq km belt in Chhattisgarh that is considered to be a stronghold of the Maoist movement. For years, the authorities have been trying to execute development projects in these areas but often face resistance from the Maoists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maoists-release-11-people-from-captivity-in-chhattisgarh-s-sukma-101626868780128.html
22-07-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Pune’s first “native” restaurant fails to attract patrons, inspires future eateries||“Pune Bhojanagruha”, the first “native” restaurant in Maharashtra, opened its doors to its patrons in June 1881. The cultural and religious desire to insulate commercial dealings and food transactions had created several hurdles in the commercial prospering of the nineteenth-century cities governed by the Raj. The opening of “Pune Bhojanagruha” tried to solve the problem, principally faced by travelling merchants, pilgrims, and students, of obtaining food prepared outside the domestic hearth. As mentioned in this column last week, it is quite clear from the advertisements published in 1881-82 in the newspaper “Kesari” that “Pune Bhojanagruha” was situated in Tukaram Patwekari’s wada, opposite Dhamdhere wada in Budhwar chowk. The small lane where Dhamdhere wada was situated used to be (and still is) known as Dhamdhere bol. This lane near the Dagadusheth Ganpati temple is now known for Srikrishna theatre. Budhwar chowk was the most important commercial hub in the city when “Bhojanagruha” came into existence. Farasakhana police station is situated in the same chowk today. Because of its proximity to Shaniwarwada and Nanawada, most of the businesses were carried out from Budhwar chowk since the early nineteenth century. Raviwar Peth, the jewellery hub of Pune, was not situated very far away from the chowk. Kotwal Chawadi, the seat of Pune’s Kotwal, was nearby too. Most of the schools in Pune were in the same vicinity. These factors made Dhamdhere bol an ideal location for the “Bhojanagruha”. The proprietors of the restaurant would have hoped to attract the businessmen, travellers, students, and the elites of Pune to partake their meals at the eatery. But it did not function there for long. Seetaram Ramchandra Gaekwad, in his book “Pune Shaharache Warnan” (The description of Pune city), published in 1886, writes about Chowdhary wada which was situated in Guruwar peth near the “Panch Howd” Mission. The locality was known for its slightly more cosmopolitan population and market. According to Gaekwad, Chowdhary wada housed “Punyache Boarding” (Pune’s Boarding House) “initially”. It is interesting to note that Gaekwad does not use the word “Bhojanagruha” to describe the eating house. It was not unusual at that time for the educated writers to use English words in their vernacular, in this case, Marathi, articles. English words were specifically used to express Western ideas, concepts, and philosophies. Gaekwad uses the English word “Boarding”, clearly hinting that this was a “Western” institution. At the same time, he makes it quite clear that it was the only restaurant in Pune city at the time. Gaekwad, in his book, also fails to mention the original location of the “Bhojanagruha”. He makes his readers believe that the restaurant started its operations in the Bhajekar wada, which was not true. In the 1880s, Chowdhary wada was owned by the illustrious Bhajekar (Chitale) family. The three Bhajekar brothers – Narayan, Mahadev alias Bapusaheb and Ramchandra lived there with their families. Bapusaheb, lawyer and playwright, was Vishnushastri Chiplunkar’s friend and classmate from Deccan College. The fact that Bhajekars chose to accommodate “Bhojanagruha” in their wada points at the close association Chiplunkar had with the eating house. The shifting of “Bhojanagaruha” from the original location in Budhwar peth to Guruwar peth hints at a few possibilities. It is likely that the eating house did not attract many customers in the initial days and that the venture failed to gain a profit. The letter written by one “Mr. Shoshak” in “Kesari” demonstrated the inhibitions people had about the restaurant. The clientele the restaurant would have attracted in Budhwar peth would have mostly been conservative and apprehensive towards the eatery. Guruwar peth was more liberal and tolerant, and the proprietors might have expected them to be more welcoming towards the restaurant. Unfortunately, “Bhojanagruha” seems to have faced difficulties at the new location too, because it then shifted to another location, not completely suitable for a restaurant. It is unclear when “Pune Bhojanagaruha” shifted from Bhajewar wada, Guruwar Peth, to Pethe wada in the Tambat (coppersmith) lane in Kasba peth. Originally owned by the Pethe family who was related to the Peshwas, the majestic three-storied mansion, whose drawing room once had gilded walls, was jointly owned by Mr. Potfode, Mr. Nizampurkar, Mr. Karde, Mr. Dakhve, and Mr. Kadu in the 1880s. Gaekwad mentions in his book that the locality was not a peaceful one. Several coppersmiths had their workshops in the lane and the noise was unbearable. One of the workshops was located in the Pethe wada itself. It is obvious that this location was not ideal for the “Bhojanagruha”. One can assume that the business failed to take off in Guruwar peth too, and the proprietors had to shift to a cheaper, more affordable location. They might also have hoped to attract different patronage than from Budhwar and Guruwar peths. Though equally conservative, Kasba peth had a working-class population, which the “Bhojanagruha” might have hoped to attract. The shifting of the “Bhojanagruha” from the elite Budhwar peth, to a more cosmopolitan Guruwar peth, and then to Kasba peth tells us about the response, it received from Pune. The unwelcoming attitude on display resulted in the shutting down of “Bhojanagruha” sometime in 1884, three years after it began its operations. “Pune Bhojanagruha” was an important milestone in the journey of Pune from a town to a city. Irrespective of the response it generated, one has to acknowledge that it paved the path for more restaurants to run their businesses in Pune. And for that, we have to thank Narayan Ramchandra, the proprietor of “Pune Bhojanagruha”, Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, Bapusaheb Bhajekar and many others who tried their best to make this venture a success. More about them the next week. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

Activists believe the approval was granted despite no increase in demand for coal.An official familiar with the matter said the nod for the auction was given at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “...Barra coal block, which is in Raigarh district, has been exempted from the auction,” the official said, wishing not to be named.Agricultureminister and government spokesperson Ravindra Chaubey said Barra was exempted from the auction in view of the presence of a major human settlement in the area. Chaubey added that the decision to remove Barra coal block from the list was taken at the request of public representatives and ministers. “The activists have the right to express their views but, in this case, the Centre had asked for approval of the state government. The decision and jurisdiction are of the Union government and I believe the activists should pressurise the government in Delhi,” he said. As per official data, Chhattisgarh produces around 150 million tonnes of coal annually and has around 58,589 million tonnes of reserves. The 17 blocks, which are expected to generate around 8,000 million tonnes of coal, are located in Dharamjaigarh, Sarguja, Surajpur and Koriya forest divisions.According to MSTC Limited, the enterprise which is carrying out the auctions for the Centre, a large forest area is likely to be impacted in Chhattisgarh. In its website, the enterprise said the coal blocks involve between 15% to 40% of forest land. A tributary to the Atem, Mahan, Pajhar Nadi and Kelo rivers also flow through the area.Sudiep Shrivastava, an environmental lawyer, expressed concerns over the impact on the wildlife of the area. “...in some areas, even tigers are also found,” he said, adding that below 50% of the area around the blocks is forested but the landscape is crucial for wildlife.Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, an NGO, said the state government should have opposed commercial mining as Chhattisgarh is already facing consequences in the form of environmental destruction and displacements. He added that the state government will not get any special revenue because of low rates. “The auction is not for the country’s coal requirements but for corporate profits as 44 of the 70 previously allocated coal blocks (between 2015-20) are yet to start operations. New power plants are also not being established and the demand for coal is also not increasing. That is why this auction is also an exercise to eliminate Coal India (government-owned coal mining and refining corporation),” he said.In 2020, Shrivastava said, 38 coal blocks were selected for auction but 17 of them did not receive a single bid. “The blocks which were auctioned fetched 9% to 66% of the rates which translate into roughly ₹130 per tonne to ₹900 per tonne...This is much lower than the rates fetched in the 2015 auction when blocks were sold for over ₹3,000 per tonne.” He cited Coal India’s vision document and added that no more auction or allotment is needed as there are enough mines.Shrivastava said fresh auctioning would not fetch enough revenue and the state would lose its precious mineral wealth at throwaway prices. “If we allow more and more mines to be auctioned and opened up... the coal is not likely to be in much demand and would result in loss of revenue to the state. The farmers would have already lost land by then.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cgarh-okays-auction-of-17-coal-blocks-raises-concerns-about-impact-on-wildlife-101626864399791.html

22-07-2021||World||Should you be worried about 'breakthrough' Covid cases amid Delta surge? Here's what experts say||The reports of fully vaccinated people testing positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused concern for the authorities around the world who were depending on vaccination to contain the virus surge. While the ‘breakthrough’ Covid-19 cases raise questions about the efficacy of vaccines, especially against the highly contagious Delta variant, health experts have said that they are not a cause for alarm.What are breakthrough cases?When a fully vaccinated individual gets infected with coronavirus, it is termed a breakthrough case. UK health secretary Sajid Javid, some White House staffers, and athletes taking part in Tokyo Olympics testing for Covid-19 are examples of breakthrough cases.Covid-19 vaccines generate neutralising antibodies that work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen whenever the body is exposed to the virus. Recent studies have suggested that Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines have been highly effective against Sars-Cov-2.However, the same vaccines have shown reduced efficacy against the Delta variant which has been identified in at least 124 countries and is rapidly becoming the dominant variant across the world. But it is still good at protecting people from severe illness - a strong reason to get vaccinated.Why do breakthrough cases occur?Dr William Moss, a vaccine expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it’s difficult to determine the reason behind a particular breakthrough case but viral load could be a factor in such infections. Moss said that underlying health conditions or medications taken by them could make their immune system less responsive to the vaccines. He added that most people with breakthrough infections experience mild illness.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that vaccine breakthrough cases are expected since no vaccines are 100% effective. It also noted that a small percentage of fully vaccinated people will get sick, hospitalised and even die from Covid-19. While the current data, as per the CDC, suggest that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offer protection against most variants, however, they will cause some vaccine breakthrough cases.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/should-you-be-worried-about-breakthrough-covid-cases-here-s-what-experts-say-101626972479400.html
22-07-2021||World||Over half of Europe's adult population 'fully vaccinated' against Covid-19: EU||The European Union on Thursday said that over 200 million Europeans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which is more than 50% of the adult population. However, the EU was still short of the 70% vaccination target it had set for the summer this year.Dana Spinant, spokesperson for the European Commission, said, “As many as 54.7% of the adult population is fully vaccinated with either both doses or the single dose — in the case of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,” citing the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), news agency AFP reported. “We have 68.4% of adults in the EU who have already received their first dose,” Spinant further said.Meanwhile, the ECDC’s Covid-19 vaccine tracker showed that 437,842,446 doses have been distributed to the member states of the bloc. Of these, 371,127,468 doses have been administered by the EU states.The data also showed that 212,732,730 adults (above the age of 18) have received at least one dose of the vaccine while 167,310,628 adults have been fully immunised against the coronavirus disease in the EU.Also read | Covid Delta variant now in 124 countries, to dominate within months, says WHO“We are now among the regions of the world that have vaccinated the most, but it is important that this progress is distributed in a more balanced way so that there are no pockets where the virus can spread and mutate,” Spinant told reporters.Earlier this month, president of the European Commission (EC) Ursula von der Leyen said that enough vaccine doses have been delivered to the EU countries to achieve the target of fully inoculating 70% adults by the end of July.“Target achieved! We have delivered enough vaccines to EU countries to fully vaccinate at least 70% of EU adults still this month. COVID-19 is not yet defeated. But we are prepared to deliver more vaccines. We will only come out of this crisis together,” she had tweeted on July 10.Further, the European Commission chief also said that more than 200 million vaccine doses would be shared by Europe with low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.“Team Europe takes its responsibility in helping the world fight the virus, everywhere. Vaccination is key —that's why it is essential to ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide. We will be sharing more than 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with low and middle-income countries by the end of this year,” Ursula von der Leyen said, a press release from the EC showed.Earlier in May 2021, von der Leyen had committed at least 100 million doses to be distributed via the COVAX programme to the countries in need. However, in her latest announcement she said that the EU is on track to exceed this goal.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-half-of-adult-population-in-europe-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-eu-101626971535121.html
22-07-2021||World||Nasa Perseverance rover prepares to collect first Martian sample for Earth||After spending weeks in Jezero Crater, Nasa’s Perseverance rover is making final preparations to collect the first-ever Martian samples. The Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars on February 18, has been exploring a 4 square kilometre patch of the crater floor in search of a scientifically interesting target to collect Martian rocks.The US space agency said on Wednesday that the rover will require about 11 days to complete its first sampling with the help of the ‘Sampling and Caching System’. The rover will perform an imagery survey to help Nasa’s science team determine the exact location for collecting the sample. The mission is aimed at learning whether life ever existed on Mars.“The idea is to get valuable data on the rock we are about to sample by finding its geologic twin and performing detailed in-situ analysis,” said science campaign co-lead Vivian Sun, from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.The science team has identified the Jezero Crater as an ancient lakebed that gradually dried up as the climate on the Red Planet changed. Scientists have planned to collect rocks from Jezero Crater since evidence of life on Earth is often preserved in the mud and sand deposited at the bottom of the lake. The ongoing mission is the first leg of a relay race to return samples from Mars.Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at Nasa Headquarters, said in a statement that Neil Armstrong began a process that would rewrite what humanity knew about the Moon when he collected the first sample from the ‘Sea of Tranquility’ during the Apollo 11 mission.“I have every expectation that Perseverance’s first sample from Jezero Crater, and those that come after, will do the same for Mars. We are on the threshold of a new era of planetary science and discovery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-perseverance-rover-prepares-to-collect-first-martian-sample-for-earth-101626965639001.html

The data is very close to the findings of a similar survey done by the company back in 2018. However, the company also said that the number of customers who were exposed to such scams globally has come down in comparison with 2018 data.Findings from the survey were published in the Global Tech Support Scam Research 2021 report released by Microsoft on Thursday. YouGov, a market research firm, was commissioned by Microsoft to conduct the survey. The web-based survey was conducted between May 6 and May 17, across 16 countries in which 16,254 adult internet users were involved. The sample size from each country included internet users based on age, gender and region.Also read | US, allies accuse China of Microsoft Exchange hackIn India, tech support scams by unsolicited telephone calls witnessed the maximum increase since 2018. While it was 23% in the last survey, it grew to 31%, an increase of eight percentage points. Also, pop-up advertisements or windows, unsolicited emails, redirects to websites remained the other forms of the scam.The report showed that in India 31% people continued to respond to the scam and also lost money. It was 14% in 2018. Moreover, 48% people were tricked into continuing with the scam while this was recorded at 40% in the 2018 survey. The global average of the respondents who continued with the scam was 16%, the 2021 report also showed.Microsoft said that the high number of people being exposed to scams in India was likely due to customers believing that a company would initiate contact and being more trusting of such unsolicited contact. In addition to this, on average, ₹15,334 was lost by customers to the scams but 88% people who lost money were able to recover some amount back.Globally, “three out of five consumers have encountered a tech support scam in the last 12 months,” Microsoft said. In terms of age demographics, millennials (between 24 and 37 years old) and Gen Z (between 18 and 23 years old) were found to have the highest exposure to tech support scams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-survey-finds-69-people-in-india-encountered-tech-support-scams-in-past-12-months-101626958319837.html

Army personnel and firefighters continued to help citizens stranded without food and shelter.More cities in the province have been flooded and farmlands destroyed as the severe weather spread northwards closer to Hebei, a northern province near national capital, Beijing.Xinhua news agency reported direct economic losses of 1.22 billion yuan ($189 million) until Thursday.Torrential rain has affected about 3 million people in Henan province, severely impacting the capital city, Zhengzhou, where 12 people died in a flooded subway train carriage on Tuesday.376,000 RESIDENTS RELOCATEDA total of 376,000 residents have been relocated to safe places, said the provincial emergency management department.Global Times newspaper reported that “…electricity was still a luxury for some parts of the city as of Wednesday… A total of 468 out of 602 power lines haven’t been restored as of Wednesday night”.The province has seen widespread damage to crops.“Rainwater has damaged more than 215,200 hectares of crops, causing a direct economic loss of about 1.22 billion yuan,” the Xinhua report said.“Henan is one of China’s major crop production regions and contributed 10% of the country’s total harvests.”As the unprecedented rainstorm moved north on Thursday, more than 73,000 people were being evacuated from the city of Anyang, on Henan’s border with Hebei province. Anyang has been swamped by more than 600mm of rainfall since Monday, Xinhua reported.Hourly rainfall in Zhengzhou, at the centre of this round of heavy rainfall, has hit a record high for the Chinese mainland, according to meteorologists.Meanwhile, from 8am on Saturday to 8am on Wednesday, the accumulated precipitation in parts of Zhengzhou exceeded the city’s annual average of 641mm.FLOODED HOSPITALSXinhua reported that incessant rains have flooded and damaged many hospitals in Henan province with patients and medical staff stuck inside, waiting to be evacuated.It included the Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular hospital in the county of Zhongmu, under the jurisdiction of Zhengzhou.“We have 1,075 regular patients and 69 in severe conditions, and the number of family members is about 1,300,” said Gao Chuanyu, vice president of the hospital.“Most people will be brought to safety by rafts, but for critically ill patients, we need to use helicopters.”The Xinhua report said that at the entrance and inside the hospital registration hall, rescuers in yellow life vests use rafts to transport patients who are stuck inside.“The hospital was completely engulfed by floodwater,” said rescuer Chen Lixin. “There was no drinking water, no electricity, no internet connection, nothing.”FINANCIAL SUPPORTThe Chinese finance ministry has earmarked 100 million yuan ($15.42 million) of disaster relief funds for Henan.China’s state assets regulator on Thursday said that centrally administered state-owned enterprises have donated a total of 686 million yuan ($106 million) for disaster relief.China’s national meteorological centre has forecast that Henan will see more rain and it will likely abate on Friday.“Experts have warned of an extremely high risk of disasters caused by the continuous rainfall, calling for local governments to enhance prevention and control of floods and geological disasters and strengthen epidemic prevention work in advance,” Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-floods-death-toll-33-economic-loss-closing-on-200mn-101626956819468.html

In Henan’s capital Zhengzhou – home to 12 million people — as many as 12 people were killed after they were trapped for hours on a flooded subway line.In interviews with local media, and on social media, some survivors have now shared how water entered and caused disaster on the underground Line 5 of the Zhengzhou subway, CNN reported. Notably, the incident unfolded during the evening rush hour on Tuesday wherein several passengers were trapped after rising rainwater entered into the tunnel and seeped inside the trains.Survivors recount horrorIn a post on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, a woman said water began to seep into the carriage soon after it stopped between two stations. Subway staff had initially instructed passengers to leave the train and evacuate through the tunnel, but were soon told to head back due to gushing floodwater ahead, the CNN report added.However, when the commuters reached the subway cars, the water had already reached their waists – and it kept rising as more water entered the tunnel and the carriage through gaps between the subway car doors. “We tried to stand on seats as much as we could, but even then, the water reached our chests in the end,” CNN quoted her as writing on Weibo.She, however, added that the most “terrifying” thing was not the rising floodwater, but the “diminishing air in the carriage – as many seemed to have trouble breathing.” “I was really scared,” she wrote.At this time, she heard another woman providing her family with her bank details over the phone, and she wondered if she should follow suit, the CNN report added. She ended up sending a message to her mother, telling her that she “might not make it.” She spent the next two and half hours on the “brink of breakdown” while awaiting rescue.The woman, however, fainted later due to lack of oxygen and was awakened by a call from her mother, who informed that rescue was on the way. It was then that she heard footsteps atop the train as firefighters smashed open the windows to let fresh air in. Eventually, more rescuers arrived before the passengers were evacuated one after another – those who fainted first, followed by women.Strangely, the woman’s post on Weibo was later deleted and CNN said that they failed to verify her account as well.In another such experience recounted by a survivor, a woman told state-run China Youth Daily that she failed to control herself from weeping after noticing flood water seeping inside the train. Some other people around her also cried. Several others attempted to call an emergency number and even asked their family and friends to get help, but to no avail. She said that among the passengers were pregnant women, elderly people, and even children. By 9pm when the water inside the carriage reached their throats, people around her began gasping for air, retching and shaking, the CNN report stated.“I was really terrified at that time. When I saw the water rising above our heads outside the window, I was preparing myself to accept that I would never be able to get out,” CNN quoted her as saying to China Youth Daily.Her phone only had 30% battery left, and she closed all other apps and sent messages to her relatives and friends on WeChat. She asked her parents to send help till 9pm, but after that, she was primarily making arrangements for people to take care of things in the event she died.Floods in central China have made several other cities come to a standstill as well. Aerial views of the region after the floods hit showed cars piled up one over another in highways. The Chinese military has opened a dam to release the floodwater from Henan, however, they added that the death toll is likely to rise further, the Associated Press reported.According to CNN, officials said that over 6,000 firefighters and 2,000 military and paramilitary forces had been deployed across regions affected by the disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/was-awaiting-death-survivors-share-details-of-being-stuck-on-china-subway-flood-101626952639109.html
22-07-2021||World||'I’m sorry': Australian PM on slow vaccine rollout amid spike in Covid-19 cases||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday apologised to his country for the slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccination campaign, even as cases due to the virus outbreak continue to see a spike amid lockdown.Talking to reporters, Morrison said, “I’m sorry that we haven’t been able to achieve the marks that we had hoped for at the beginning of this year.”The country has been inoculating less than 150,000 Covid-19 vaccine jabs a day – much behind other developed countries.Two of the country’s largest states – New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria - logged sharp increases in the daily infection rates on Wednesday. While NSW, which houses Australia’s largest city Sydney, recorded 110 new cases – up from 78 on the preceding day - Victoria clocked 22 fresh cases. Sydney was put under lockdown on June 26, and the same will remain enforced until at least July 30. Meanwhile, Victoria is staring at an almost two-week lockdown.Speaking at a televised news conference on Wednesday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, “Had we not gone into a lockdown a few weeks ago, the 110 number today would undoubtedly have been thousands and thousands.”However, Berejiklian has urged the people of NSW to get vaccinated and “brace” amid anticipations that “case numbers will continue to go up before they start coming down”.She further stated that whether NSW will exit the lockdown by July 30 target cannot be confirmed until the following week due to rise in coronavirus cases.The Australian government has said that it will meet its target of vaccinating its adult population by the end of 2021 as millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, a third state – South Australia - began its first day of a week-long lockdown on Wednesday. Furthermore, NSW’s neighbouring state Queensland has closed its border with the former due to the spike in cases, thereby shutting off one of Australia’s most travelled routes.The highly virulent and transmissible Delta variant of Covid-19 has been confirmed in 124 countries now, including Australia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. First detected in India, the variant is “expected” to “rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant circulating lineage over the coming months,” the global health agency stated in its weekly epidemiological update.Notably, the Delta variant accounts for over 75 per cent of coronavirus cases in multiple nations, including Australia, South Africa, Great Britain, Russia, Singapore, and India, among others. The US health officials on Tuesday confirmed that the variant is responsible for nearly 83 per cent of the cases in the country.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/im-sorry-australian-pm-on-slow-vaccine-rollout-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101626942519140.html

Afghan local authorities in the northern province said on Wednesday that the Taliban are forcing the local people who live in areas under the group's control in Balkh province to pay them part of their income. They are also recruiting locals forcefully, local media reported."There are only about 20 Taliban fighters inside the district building compound and the police headquarters; the rest of them have taken up positions inside the villages to collect Zakat (charity)," Mohammad Yousuf, the acting district governor of Kaldar district, was reported saying by the news agency ANI.The number of Taliban fighters in the district is about 200 fighters, but they are looking to recruit more fighters from among the people, local media said in its report.The Taliban has also imposed taxes on the shops and local markets, which locals say that it "beyond their capacity" to pay. In case one fails to pay the money that the Taliban is harassing them, ANI reported quoting Mohammad Hashem Mansoori, a District Governor for Shortepa district in Balkh province.Due to this, business activity in the region has also been affected, it also reported. "The people have serious concerns, the business owners are very fearful because of the businesses," said Sifatullah, a resident in Hairatan, as per ANI.Meanwhile, security forces have assured them that they are fully prepared to defend the Afghan people and said that they will soon launch an "offensive" against the Taliban. "The morale of our forces is very high; they are fully prepared and have the strength to defend the city. Soon we will launch our offensive operations," said Khanullah Shuja, the commander of 209 Shaheen Army Corps.Insecurity has been growing in Afghanistan in recent weeks, largely spurred by fighting in its provinces as US-led foreign troops complete their withdrawal and the Taliban launch major offensives, taking districts and border crossings.More than 200 of the 419 district centres were under Taliban control as of this week, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had informed the media on Wednesday. While the insurgent group had not taken over any provincial capitals, they were putting pressure on the outskirts of half of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-tightens-grip-over-afghanistan-levies-high-taxes-recruits-forceful-101626933364872.html
22-07-2021||World||China rejects WHO proposal for second Covid-19 origin study||China on Thursday rejected the World Health Organization’s (WHO) plan for the second phase of the Covid-19 origin study, saying it is “shocked” by the proposal as it contains language that does not respect science.China opposes politicising the study into the origin of the virus, national health commission (NHC) vice minister Zeng Yixin said on Thursday.Beijing’s angry reaction comes after WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said last week that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the Covid-19 pandemic and a laboratory leak, adding that he had asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origin of the coronavirus.The first cases of the disease were identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before it triggered the worst pandemic in a century, killing and infecting millions and stalling the global economy.China has voiced strong opposition against international opinion, which believes a high-security bio lab in Wuhan was the source of the virus.There have also been a spate of articles, some offering very-plausible arguments on why the virus may have been engineered. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the pandemic has thus far infected at least 192.1mn people around the world, killed over 4.1mn while it has also ravaged economies. Zeng said China cannot accept the current version of the WHO plan because it has been compromised by political manipulation and disrespects scientific facts.Chinese state media quoted Zeng as saying the second phase of the proposed study has listed the hypothesis that China had violated lab regulations and leaked the virus as one of the major research objectives, and he was “very shocked” after reading the proposal.“We hope the WHO should carefully consider the advice by Chinese scientists, take investigating the origin of the Covid-19 virus as a scientific question free from political interference, and proactively and properly conduct sustained investigations into the origin of the virus in various countries,” he said.Zeng rejected that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had three infected workers, carried out gain-of-function research (which increases the virulence of virus), and engineered the virus. There was zero infection among staff and students at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said Yuan Zhiming, director of the National Biosafety Laboratory at the presser.In a departure from his earlier narrative, the WHO chief had said last week that getting access to raw data had been a challenge for the international team of scientists who travelled to China earlier this year to investigate the Covid-19 origin.According to an Associated Press report from Berlin, Tedros told reporters that the UN health agency based in Geneva is “actually asking China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for in the early days of the pandemic”.China has consistently been on the offensive in countering allegations on the Wuhan lab leak theory.On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that in less than five days, about 5 million Chinese have signed an open letter, asking the WHO to investigate the US’ Fort Detrick lab over Covid-19 origin instead.The rising numbers are a representation of the anger of the Chinese people at the political manipulation by some in the US on Covid-19 origin, Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angry-china-rejects-who-proposal-for-second-covid-19-origin-study-101626933165159.html

The US and others say that China has not been transparent about what happened in the early days of the pandemic. China accuses critics of politicizing an issue that should be left to scientists.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, acknowledged last week that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the pandemic and a leak from a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first detected in late 2019.Zeng said the Wuhan lab has no virus that can directly infect humans. He noted that a WHO-coordinated team of international experts who visited the lab earlier this year concluded that a lab leak was highly unlikely.Most experts believe the virus most likely jumped from animals to humans. The highly politicized debate centers on whether a lab leak is so unlikely that the theory should be ruled out as a possibility, or if it merits further study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-accept-who-s-plan-for-2nd-phase-of-covid-19-origins-study-china-101626931045839.html

Tens of thousands of people are reportedly being evacuated from the flood-hit province of Henan, one of the most heavily populated provinces in central China where heavy rains over the week have inundated key areas and destroyed crops.China's military has blasted open a dam to release the floodwater threatening the Henan province, the Associated Press reported, adding that the death toll is likely to climb further.The floods in China have resulted in direct economic losses worth 1.22 billion yuan ($189 million) so far, the Xinhua news agency reported. As of late Wednesday, more than 470,000 people and over 55,000 hectares of crops have been affected by the heavy downpours in Xinxiang, a small city north of the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, Xinhua added. The local government reportedly deployed more than 76,000 personnel, part of a search and rescue team.Among those who died were 12 people who could not be rescued from a subway in Zhengzhou when the floodwater drowned the trapped individuals in the narrow underpass. The fatal flooding prompted the government to order local authorities to immediately improve urban transit flood controls and emergency responses.More than 73,000 people were being evacuated from the city of Anyang, on Henan's border with Hebei province, after being swamped by more than 600 mm of rainfall since Monday, Xinhua reported.China has raised a red storm alert for four cities in the north of Henan -- Xinxiang, Anyang, Hebi, and Jiaozuo. The red alert is the highest state of storm alert in a four-tier colour-coded weather warning system followed by the country. The provincial weather bureau told state media it had issued a report warning of the coming torrential rains two days in advance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-floods-death-toll-goes-up-to-33-thousands-evacuated-from-henan-province-101626923266923.html

The forum is partly supported by the Canadian government and it is customary of the country’s defence minister to open the annual event.HFX Taipei will be held over a period of three days in the Taiwanese capital. In a statement, HFX president Peter van Praagh said, “HFX will celebrate the courage and achievements of one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies by holding a landmark international security forum in Taipei.”“All people who value democracy will immediately recognise the importance of showing solidarity with the Taiwanese people at this time,” he added.It is expected that President Tsai will receive her honour in Taipei which will ensure the Canadian government does not have to deal with the nettlesome issue of having to host the Taiwanese leader.The forum will be held, as usual, in November this year in Halifax. Relations between Canada and China remain cold since Beijing arrested two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, days after a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver in December 2018 for possible deportation to the US with relation to a case of alleged defrauding of a bank to sidestep sanctions against the Iranian regime. The trial continues in Canada while Ottawa has described the detention of the Canadians as “hostage diplomacy” and accused Beijing of holding sham trials for the two Michaels.The Taipei event will be held in association with Taiwan’s Institute for National Defence and Security Research or INDSR.The Halifax Forum has been branded “as the world’s leading security gathering for democracies”.HFX has taken a strong line against China and issued a 101-page handbook, titled “China vs Democracy: The Greatest Game”, prior to its November 2020 event. The handbook stated that the People’s Republic of China or PRC was “intent on undermining democracy abroad” including in India and focused on the significant role that the Quad or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue could play as a bulwark against Beijing’s expansionism. The Quad was formed in 2007 and comprises India, the United States, Australia and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-watch-taiwan-to-host-halifax-security-forum-event-in-2022-101626930823746.html
22-07-2021||World||India, Afghanistan criticise Pakistan’s handling of envoy’s daughter’s kidnapping||India on Thursday criticised Pakistan for dragging the country into the controversy over the abduction and assault of the Afghan envoy’s daughter in Islamabad last week and for denying the victim’s account of the “very shocking incident”. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi contended that India was forced to respond because Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had dragged the country into the matter. Ahmed has described the incident as a “conspiracy” linked to India’s external intelligence agency. Bagchi’s comments came hours after Afghanistan reiterated its deep concern over Ahmed’s claims that there is no evidence the Afghan envoy’s daughter was abducted in Islamabad and said such remarks could lead to greater mistrust between the two countries. “This is, of course, a very shocking incident. It involves two other countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and usually we’d not comment on it. However, since the interior minister of Pakistan has dragged India into it, I would only like to say that even by their standards, Pakistan’s denial of the victim’s account is stooping to a new low,” Bagchi told a regular news briefing. Also Read | Af min ‘concerned’ at Pak charge of Indian hand in envoy daughter’s abductionSelsela Alikhil, the 26-year-old daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hour and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on July 16. Two days later, the Afghan government recalled its envoy and senior diplomats from Islamabad over security concerns. Ahmed, who is close to Pakistan’s military establishment, told a news conference on Tuesday that an investigation into the incident had found no evidence of an abduction. “There is no case of kidnapping,” Ahmed said. The Afghan foreign ministry reiterated its concern at Ahmed’s remarks in a statement issued on Wednesday. Afghan foreign minister Mohammed Haneef Atmar had earlier conveyed similar concerns in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again expresses deep concern over the continuation of unprofessional remarks by Pakistan’s Interior Minister regarding the abduction of the daughter of our Ambassador in Islamabad,” the statement said. “While the investigation process has not been concluded and the perpetrators have not been arrested, the continuation of unilateral statements and unprofessional prejudgments will call the transparency of the investigation into question and result in increased mistrust,” it added. The statement pointed out that hospital reports had “endorsed the mental and physical torture” of Selsela Alikhil. “We expect unprofessional prejudgements to be avoided before the investigation comes to an end. Instead, we urge that all efforts should be geared towards obtaining evidence and completing the probe, as well as arresting and prosecuting the perpetrators,” it said. The Afghan foreign ministry said it is committed to full cooperation in the investigation process through the collaboration of delegations from both sides. “We hope to see the reasons behind the incident, and the investigation results soon finalized and announced based on the findings of the investigating teams of the two countries,” it added. Ahmed had also said on Tuesday that the incident was being used as a way to “defame” Pakistan. He added, “Pakistan will not back down from this case, even though there is a huge difference between her (claim) and our findings.” As fighting raged in Afghanistan with the Taliban, a war of words erupted last week and vice president Amrullah Saleh accused the Pakistani military of providing “close air support to Taliban in certain areas”. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has accused Pakistan of failing to prevent the influx of 10,000 terrorists and of not doing enough to nudge the Taliban to join peace talks to find a political settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-again-criticises-pak-minister-over-abduction-of-envoy-s-daughter-101626928604497.html
22-07-2021||World||Taliban victory not ‘foregone conclusion’, says top US general||The top US military leader on Wednesday expressed doubts if a Taliban victory is imminent in Afghanistan, contrary to a reported intelligence assessment.“There are a range of possible outcomes in Afghanistan,” General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said at a Pentagon news conference with secretary of defence Lloyd Austin. “A negative outcome, a Taliban automatic military takeover, is not a foregone conclusion.”“The Afghan security forces have the capacity to sufficiently fight and defend their country, and we will continue to support them where necessary in accordance with the guidance from the president and the secretary of defence.”Taliban forces have advanced rapidly in recent weeks to take control of the country, moving towards major urban centres. But despite a narrative that has gained currency of the imminent fall of Kabul, they have not taken yet any of the country’s 34 provincial capitals though they have taken district centres.The top American general put the Taliban progress in perspective, knowing perhaps how closely the rest of the world is watching, resigned to a Taliban victory.Asked why the Taliban with 75,000 military personnel appear to be winning against the Afghan military of 300,000 with 20 years of US training and support, General Milley said, “warfare is not just about numbers” but also about “will and leadership” to fight and prevail.Gen Milley went on to preview Afghan military strategy in perhaps the clearest terms yet. He started by putting in perspective the talk of Taliban progress, as a narrative propagated by the Taliban. “There clearly is a narrative out there that the Taliban are winning. In fact, they are propagating an inevitable victory on their behalf; they’re dominating a lot of the airwaves - that sort of thing.”Gen Milley said that roughly 212 or 213 district centres are in Taliban control. “That’s half of the 419 in all. And the Taliban haven’t captured yet any of the 34 provincial capitals. Although the Taliban are putting pressure on the outskirts of probably about half of them - 17 of them, in fact - and what they’re trying to do is isolate the major population centres,” he said, adding, “They’re trying to do the same thing to Kabul.”And although the Taliban may appear to have the momentum, the American general said the Afghans are being extremely tactical in their manoeuvres. “The Afghan security forces, are consolidating their forces,” Gen Milley said, adding, “So part of this is they’re giving up district centres in order to consolidate their forces because they’re taking an approach to protect the population, and most of the population lives in the provincial capitals and the capital city of Kabul.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-victory-not-foregone-conclusion-says-top-us-general-101626928483950.html

She will travel there after her stops in Tokyo and Seoul and Ulaanbaatar as well," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.In China, she will take part in meetings in Tianjin where she will meet with Chinese officials. China has confirmed an in-person meeting with state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi, he said."These discussions, as we've said, are part of an ongoing US effort to hold candid exchanges with PRC officials, designed to advance US interests and values and overall, to allow us to responsibly manage this incredibly consequential bilateral relationship," he added.Price said, "We said earlier this week, before we were in a position to confirm the trip, that the deputy would be prepared to travel if her engagement there would be substantive, constructive; if it were indeed to be a forum and a venue for us to accomplish what we seek to accomplish, and that is to advance US interests, to explore and to discuss how we can manage this relationship responsibly, and how we can address the competition... stiff competition that we welcome with the PRC."He said the US believes that this meeting has the potential to be substantive and constructive."In the context of relationships that are complex, that are challenging, that are dynamic, we believe it's important to maintain open lines of communication between high-level officials, and that includes in times of, as in the case with the PRC, sustained competition, even when the PRC is taking actions that challenge our interests, that challenge our values. And these are shared interests," Price said."These are shared values, And so, I think it's important in that context to note that the deputy will be travelling to the PRC, after having visited Japan, after having visited the Republic of Korea, after having visited Mongolia as well."She'll be travelling there, as we have said, from a position of strength, not unlike how Secretary Blinken met with Director Yang and other PRC officials in Anchorage on the way back from the Indo-Pacific region, where we had engaged in consultations with our Japanese and South Korean counterparts as well," he added.Sherman, Price said, intends for this engagement to show and to demonstrate to China what responsible and healthy competition can look like."We know this relationship is going to be competitive. We welcome that competition. We welcome that stiff competition. But we also want to make sure that the playing field is level, and importantly, that competition doesn't veer into conflict," he said."We want to make sure that this is a relationship that has guard rails there – where there are clearly defined parameters to the relationship as well. And we believe, again, that engaging in practical, substantive, and a direct manner, as we expect this visit will be, will help us achieve those goals," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deputy-secretary-of-state-to-visit-china-this-sunday-discuss-bilateral-ties-101626922756648.html

Making the requirement of this special Covid-19 pass mandatory is the first step in a new campaign against what the government calls a “stratospheric” rise in delta variant infections.The Covid-19 pass requirement took effect on Wednesday at cultural and tourist sites in France, following a government decree. At the Eiffel Tower, masked workers scanned QR codes on digital health passes and checked printed vaccines or test certificates.What is a Covid-19 pass?To get the special Covid-19 pass, visitors must show they are either fully vaccinated, have tested negative for the coronavirus, or recovered from Covid-19. As the new rule came into effect on Wednesday, tourists who came to the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris unprepared were seen lining up for quick virus tests at the site.French president Emmanuel Macron also wants to expand the Covid-19 pass requirement to all French restaurants and many other areas of public life, as well as requiring that all health workers get vaccine shots.Reactions to special pandemic passFrance's requirement of a special Covid-19 pass has triggered mixed reactions from various different walks of life. People opposed to vaccines and being asked to present passes showing their immunity status are growing increasingly vocal.A group of protesters attending an anti-pass demonstration in the Alpine city of Chambery broke away and entered the town hall, removing a portrait of French President Emmanuel Macron from a wall and taking it away.Also Read | Xavier Bertrand, ex-insurance salesman, takes on Emmanuel Macron in French presidential raceJohnny Nielsen, a Danish tourist traveling with his wife and two children, said, “In Denmark, you need the pass everywhere.” So while he questioned the usefulness of the French rules, he said that didn’t make them reconsider the family's travel plans.Government reactionThe French government wants to rush the expanded pass requirement bill through the Parliament as soon as possible despite the resistance in some quarters. More than 100,000 people have protested the measures around France over the weekend, and prime minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday that the government will seek approval from the constitutional court, which will also take time.Also Read | UK govt tightens quarantine rules for travellers returning from FranceThe solution is “vaccination, vaccination, vaccination,” Castex said on Wednesday over TF1 television, urging his compatriots to sign up for vaccine injections to avoid new lockdowns. Of France’s 18,000 new coronavirus cases reported Tuesday, 96% involved people who were unvaccinated, he said.Covid-19 in FranceFrance’s daily Covid-19 infections dropped sharply in the spring but have shot up again over the past two weeks. Some regions are re-imposing virus restrictions. The government is worried that pressure will grow on hospitals again in the coming weeks.France has registered more than 111,000 virus-related deaths. Overall 46% of the population is fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-makes-covid-19-pass-mandatory-for-visiting-eiffel-tower-other-sites-101626913552627.html
22-07-2021||World||Xavier Bertrand, ex-insurance salesman, takes on Emmanuel Macron in French presidential race||Xavier Bertrand, a "smalltown politician" and former insurance salesman, is now emerging as a potential dark horse in next year's presidential election in France and looking to topple Emmanuel Macron from his post. It was assumed by many that the upcoming polls would be a straight contest between Macron's La République en Marche (LREM) and far-right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally, but the meteoric rise of two-time minister Bertrand has complicated the scene, news agencies reported.Bertrand, the 56-year-old former health and labor minister, reckons he can topple the current president by casting himself as the anti-Macron candidate. Playing his working-class roots up, Bertrand is hoping to stoke the anger in provincial France over a feeling that the government favours Paris and helped stoke the Yellow Vests protests that marked Macron's third year in office.Also Read | French President Emmanuel Macron targeted in project Pegasus spyware case, claims Le Monde“Bertrand’s gamble is to win the support of the right, with a classical, traditional right-wing agenda,” while appearing as an outsider “to expand his reach to less well-off voters, including left-wing voters who dislike the president,” news agency Bloomberg quoted Remi Lefebvre, a political scientist in Lille, as saying.According to a report by Politico, Xavier Bertrand's "crushing victory" over Marine Le Pen's National Rally in a far-right bastion could prove to be rather concerning for the latter, since the electoral win proves that Le Pen's allies could be defeated by a conservative. This has directly shifted the spotlight towards Bertrand, whose bid for the presidency had failed to garner much attention until now, even though it was announced back in March this year.Bertrand, although his chances of winning slim in a projected neck-to-neck election between Macron and Le Pen next year in France, could still create enough problems by peeling off voters to prevent either of his two rivals from reaching the runoff round, the report noted.Also Read | Protests in France against Covid-19 'health pass' rulesAccording to a recent survey on the upcoming French presidential elections, Xavier Bertrand is projected to win 18% of the votes in the first round of the contest, while Le Pen and Macron are both expected to get around 25% votes.If Bertrand can overtake Le Pen to qualify for the runoff, it would transform the race and potentially put French president Emmanuel Macron, who has been shaping up for a scrap with the nationalist leader, on the back foot.Bertrand says he just wants to end “the mess” that Macron’s policies have created. Asked at the conference if he was worried about being pushed out by the two top contenders, Bertrand smiled and replied: “Do I look like the worried type?”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xavier-bertrand-ex-insurance-salesman-takes-on-emmanuel-macron-in-french-presidential-race-101626911148172.html

22-07-2021||World||Taliban seem to have 'strategic momentum' in Afghanistan: Top US general||The Taliban appear to have the "strategic momentum" in their sweeping offensives across Afghanistan, but their victory is far from assured, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley said Wednesday.Nearly 20 years after the US toppled the Taliban regime in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and with the withdrawal of US-led foreign forces all but complete, the resurgent militants now control about half of Afghanistan's roughly 400 districts.But they have none of the country's densely populated main cities, Milley told a press conference.With the militants putting pressure on around half of the country's provincial capitals, Afghan troops are "consolidating their forces" to protect those major urban centers, he added."They're taking an approach to protect the population, and most of the population lives in the provincial capitals and capital city of Kabul," Milley said."A Taliban automatic military takeover is not a foregone conclusion."The Taliban are surging across Afghanistan, snapping up territory, seizing border crossings and encircling cities.Their success has tested the morale of the Afghan army, already battered by years of shockingly high casualties and, more recently, the decision by US-led international troops to leave.Though the Afghan army has been trained by international forces, and estimates show it vastly outnumbers the Taliban's ranks, Milley said numbers are not all it takes to win a war."The two most important combat multipliers actually are will and leadership. And this is going to be a test now of the will and leadership of the Afghan people, the Afghan security forces and the government of Afghanistan," he said.US President Joe Biden has also said that a Taliban takeover is "not inevitable."But earlier this month he also warned that Afghans must come together against the insurgents, and admitted that it was "highly unlikely" that one unified government would end up controlling the entire country.- End game 'not yet written' -Milley's comments came hours after the Taliban said Wednesday they would fight only to defend themselves over the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, but stopped short of declaring a formal ceasefire.In recent years, the militants have declared a pause in fighting with government forces over Islamic holidays, offering a brief respite to Afghans who can visit family in relative safety.Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada said over the weekend that he "strenuously favors" a political settlement to end the war with the government in Kabul.But the hardline Islamist movement's push to capitalize on the last stages of the international withdrawal has left many Afghans sceptical.President Ashraf Ghani said Tuesday that the Taliban had proved "they have no will and intention for peace," with negotiations between the two warring sides achieving little.More than a dozen diplomatic missions in Kabul this week called for "an urgent end" to the Taliban's current offensive, saying it was at odds with claims they want to secure a political deal to end the conflict.Afghan civilians, who have long taken the brunt of the fighting since 2001, are also watching the Taliban advance in fear.Many -- especially women and minorities -- stand to lose hard-won rights and freedoms if the militants return to any form of power.Even if Kabul can hold them off, among the scenarios that civilians face is the prospect of a protracted and bloody civil war and the possibility of the country fracturing along ethnic lines.It was the chaos of the civil war in the 1990s that helped usher the Taliban to power.Milley said the chance of a negotiated political settlement is "still out there.""There's a possibility of a complete Taliban takeover or possibility of any number of other scenarios -- breakdowns, warlordism, all kinds of other scenarios out there," he said."We're monitoring very closely. I don't think the end game is yet written."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seem-to-have-strategic-momentum-in-afghanistan-top-us-general-101626898513980.html
22-07-2021||World||UK Covid restrictions could return after three weeks, scientists warn||Several coronavirus restrictions could be reintroduced in England after three weeks if hospital admission rises above expected levels, scientists advising the government on the pandemic have reportedly warned. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have warned the government to be prepared to reimpose restrictions amid record hospitalisations in nearly five months, reported inews.According to NHS England, 752 hospital admissions were reported on July 19, the day virtually all restrictions were removed in Britain. While hospitalisations are still well below the peak of the second Covid wave, the exponential rise in infections largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant is pushing the admissions towards worrying levels.The UK reported 44,104 new Covid-19 cases and 73 related deaths on Wednesday, taking the total infections over 5.56 million. Earlier this week, chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the hospitalisations were doubling roughly every three weeks. During a webinar hosted by the Science Museum, Whitty said that the country was not “out of the woods” by any means and the hospitalisations could escalate in the next couple of months."It doesn't take many doublings until we're in actually quite scary numbers again ... I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast," Whitty said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government removed coronavirus restrictions even as experts and scientists from around the world kept warning against the move. They said that Britain’s plan to kick off the final phase of the four-step roadmap out of the lockdown amid the third Covid wave could be a threat to the world.The Delta variant now accounts for more than 75% of Covid-19 cases in several countries including India, Australia, Britain, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Russia, and China among others, according to a weekly epidemiological update by the World Health Organization (WHO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-restrictions-could-return-after-three-weeks-scientists-warn-101626897540587.html

More than 500 people were evacuated from the subway system late on Tuesday. In all, about 200,000 people had to be relocated in the city because of the heavy rainfall.The highest-level emergency alert notice has been issued across the province.President Xi Jinping on Wednesday instructed authorities to deploy the PLA to rescue those stuck in inundated subways, hotels and public places. The PLA has deployed 3,000 personnel to help local authorities with flood control and evacuation efforts.As the scale of the disaster continued to emerge and the damage ran into tens of millions of dollars, the Chinese army said it averted the collapse of the stricken Yihetan dam around an hour from Zhengzhou city.On Wednesday morning, the PLA said blasting operations were carried out at the dam and troops had “successfully opened a new flood diversion opening”, AFP reported.“From 8pm on July 17 to 8pm on Tuesday [July 20], total precipitation of 617.1mm was recorded in Zhengzhou, close to the city’s average annual precipitation of 640.8mm, said the city’s meteorological bureau,” Xinhua news agency reported.The city registered 201.9mm of rainfall between 4pm and 5pm on Tuesday, a record hourly high for the Chinese mainland.The city broke its own single-day precipitation record, hitting its highest level since Zhengzhou’s weather station was established in 1951, the Xinhua report said.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/25-killed-as-record-rains-batter-china-101626894766124.html

22-07-2021||India||Centre slams claim of not distributing ventilators during peak second Covid wave||The Central government on Thursday dismissed a media report claiming it had kept 13,000 unused ventilators and did not deliver the same to states during the second wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. The Centre said a large number of the ventilators sent to the states have remained uninstalled and unused in their warehouses.The Centre's rebuttal was based on a report published in The Quint that said close to 13,000 (12,973) ventilators procured by the Centre were not distributed to the states. The article claimed to have accessed an RTI response received on July 8 from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.In a statement, the government said no ventilators have been kept in the inventory and not given to states that needed them. Every lot of ventilators which are ready for dispatch is being sent to states and Union territories promptly, it said.The statement said the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had placed an order for procurement of 58,850 ventilators at the beginning of the pandemic -- between March 27, 2020 and April 17. All these equipment were made in India, considering the fact that there was very little possibility of import due to a rise in global demand and restriction on export in manufacturing countries. The government said local manufacturers, who had limited capacity, were encouraged to ramp up production and it was done by sourcing technology and tying up with companies who could assist them in the matter.Based on the recommendations of the Empowered Group-III meant for ensuring adequate supply of essential medical devices, these procurement orders were placed by the Union government.“After the ventilator models were technically examined and validated by the Committee of Experts under the Director General of Health Services, these were recommended for supplies to the states/UTs. The supplies were made as per the demand received from States/ UTs. The demand from the states for ventilators received till September 2020 was addressed through supplies. Thereafter, negligible additional requirements were projected by the states. Till November, 2020, almost entire quantity of ventilators demanded by the states had been delivered i.e., 35,398 ventilators,” it said.“After November, till March 2021, additional supply of ventilators was only 996 since the additional demand for ventilators was only this much.” However, of this, a large number of ventilators remained un-installed in the states, it said. Considering the fact that states did not allocate them to the hospitals in view of no demand, the Union health secretary on April 4 wrote to a few states urging them expedite the installation of ventilators, and for projecting additional requirements of the same if any in view of the recent surge in cases. The Union Health Ministry then wrote multiple reminder mails to the states and UTs."Since there was no demand from the states, no supply schedule was given to the manufacturers. The manufacturers are required to assemble the ventilators based on the demand projected to them within the quantity of overall orders given to them. Every unit of ventilators are required to be assembled, calibrated, tested and quality checked and pre-dispatched inspected before the ventilator is actually supplied to states," the government further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-slams-claim-of-not-distributing-ventilators-during-peak-second-covid-wave-101626975617867.html

A senior leader said the one on one meetings allowed the leaders to speak their mind.“We had one on one meetings with him (Rahul Gandhi) where each one was given an opportunity to speak their minds. I told him what was best for the party and what the party needs to do going forward,” South Goa MP and former chief minister Francisco Sardinha told HT.Sardinha has in the recent past publicly called for the ouster of incumbent state party president Girish Chodankar saying that he was unable to unite the party and also oversaw party’s poor performance in the local body polls.“We discussed the political situation in Goa and the strategy to ensure Congress’ victory in the assembly elections,” party observer Dinesh Gundu Rao, said.Besides Sardinha, Leader of Opposition (LoP) Digambar Kamat, state Congress president Girish Chodankar, MLAs Aleixo Lourenco and Luizinho Faleiro, Ramakant Khalap a former union minister who has given the charge of the party’s coordination committee in the state, was also summoned to Delhi.Besides the leadership issue, the high command also sought inputs on possible alliances with other regional parties into the polls.“Thank you @RahulGandhi for your valuable advise (sic) and guidance. We will work unitedly to defeat the communal, unconstitutional and undemocratic forces in Goa in the upcoming assembly elections and ensure victory of @INCGoa,” Kamat tweeted after emerging from the meeting.The meeting comes barely days after the high command sent several central leaders to the state.

We believe that this is an important element towards economic recovery,” Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs, was quoted as saying on Thursday.The remarks came at a time when many people, especially students studying in universities in countries like China, Italy and others, struggled to travel back due to the ongoing restrictions.Also read | 'Delta variant continues to be dominant variant in new Covid cases': INSACOG“There have been some positive steps in this direction and we would hope that more countries take steps to normalise the movement of people from India,” Bagchi said, reiterating a demand that the ministry has been making with these nations ever since the number of daily new infections reduced following the deadly second wave of Covid-19 in India.Earlier in the month, the ministry made a similar statement and said it expected many countries to ease the travel restrictions for Indians as the Covid-19 situation had “vastly improved” then. “As we have said earlier, we hope that with the vastly improved Covid situation in India, countries would ease restrictions for travel from India. We have been taking up this issue with foreign partners wherever possible,” Bagchi said on July 8, while responding to a question about difficulties faced by Indian citizens travelling abroad. He had also highlighted meetings held by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and minister of state V Muraleedharan to resolve the issue.Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday extended its ban on international flights from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka owing to pandemic concerns.At the peak of the second wave, the number of daily new Covid-19 infections in India had increased alarmingly and over 4,00,000 cases were reported on a daily basis. The infections were driven in part by the Delta variant of Covid-19.On Thursday, the country registered over 41,000 new cases and 507 fatalities. So far, 3,12,57,720 cases and 4,18,987 deaths have been recorded in the country.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-hopes-more-nations-to-ease-movement-of-indians-as-covid-situation-improves-101626972257712.html

I welcome their homecoming,” Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted on Thursday.“We reiterate our commitment for all-round development of Bodoland and to protect the unique socio-cultural and political identity of Bodo people,” he added.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had announced a reward of ₹10 lakh on M Batha, who had been hiding in Arunachal Pradesh along with his cadres. All of them travelled on foot and police-escorted vehicles to the surrender ceremony.“Our organization NLFB has decided to come overground and join the mainstream for the best interest of the state and for upholding the peace and integrity of the region,” a press statement signed by NLFB president read.It added that the outfit is abjuring violence and putting a halt to their armed struggle for creation of a separate Bodoland state.Batha and his cadres were part of the 1,615 militants who surrendered in January last year after signing of the third Bodo peace pact between the Centre and four factions of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB).But Batha and his followers went back to the jungles after few months and formed NLFB. Details of the new outfit emerged in February this year after a large cache of arms meant for NLFB was seized in Assam.In a statement issued in March, the outfit had stated that formation of a separate state of Bodoland for people from the Bodo tribe was their main goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-23-members-of-newly-formed-bodo-militant-outfit-nlfb-surrender-101626972060665.html
22-07-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee attacks Centre over Pegasus snoop list before meeting PM Modi||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee sharpened attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government on Thursday over the Pegasus snoop list, ahead of her meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week. With the monsoon session going on, Banerjee is also likely to visit the parliament and meet several opposition leaders during her stay at the National capital. “...I had sought an appointment with the Prime Minister and he has given me time. I will also try to meet the President. This apart several political leaders have requested that they want to meet me. I would try to adjust and accommodate as far as possible in two to three days,” Banerjee said on Thursday while speaking to media persons. Mamata is scheduled to go to Delhi on Monday and is likely to return on Friday. This will be the first meeting between Modi and Mamata after the two met for 15 minutes in the aftermath of Cyclone Yaas. The centre-state relation then nosedived as the Union government recalled Alapan Bandyopadhyay, the then chief secretary of the state, for skipping the PM’s review meeting. With Pegasus snooping row rocking Parliament for the third consecutive day, Banerjee sharpened her attack against Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “If any big scam or scandal emerges when the parliament session is going on, it is the duty of the Prime Minister and Union home minister to give a statement to brief the parliament and inform the citizens of the country. But instead of doing that they are trying to bulldoze any voice that is being raised. No one will support this autocratic attitude,” she said while condemning the Income Tax raids on a media house. The TMC supremo has on multiple occasions in the past alleged that her phone was being tapped. On Thursday, she hinted that spyware could have been used to snoop and record a high-level meeting of her party before the recently concluded and bitterly fought assembly elections that led to her party defeating the BJP to return to power for the third consecutive term. “Ahead of the assembly elections, four of us, me, Abhishek Banerjee, Subrata Bakshi and Prashant Kishor were holding a meeting. The mobile phones were with us, even though we were not talking over the phone. The entire meeting was recorded. We came to now after PK got his phone audited. Can you imagine how dangerous it is?” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, Banerjee had accused the Central government of turning the country into a “surveillance state” and appealed to regional parties to come together to form an opposition front to defeat the BJP in 2024 general elections. “Everyone across the country should get united. Alone, I am no one. But together with you I would make 100. I would be plus one. We have to tell that the country can’t be run just by jumla baji (false promises) and julum baji (atrocities),” she said on Thursday. The BJP however mounted a counter attack saying that the TMC wants to divert attention from the NHRC’s report which has slammed the state government for post poll violence, which allegedly led to killing and rape of several BJP supporters. “The NHRC report has unmasked the government and all its lies are now out. In a bid to divert the attention, the TMC is now raising such allegations. But this won’t stand,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-attacks-centre-over-pegasus-snoop-list-before-meeting-pm-modi-101626970920595.html

If things go as planned, a Sputnik V manufacturing plant would be established in the state soon.“We have given two options — one greenfield project in Life Science Park, and, the second, for filling up of vials, which would be immediate. So, there are short-term and long-term projects," he was quoted as saying by ANI.Dr Ellangovan further explained that some modifications are currently being worked out regarding allotment of land. Once they materialised, large quantities of Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccines can be brought to Kerala and vials of the doses can be filled up from the same place. “With regard to the long-term plan of setting up Sputnik V vaccine manufacturing plant, the details are being worked out,” he further told ANI.Also Read | Sputnik V vaccine effective against new variants of coronavirus: StudyLast week, the Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Oxford AstraZeneca’s vaccine Covishield, announced a partnership with the RDIF to manufacture over 300 million doses of Sputnik V jabs in India – with the production set to commence in September this year.RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev told a virtual news meet that September will be a “key month” for increasing the production of Sputnik V vaccines in India as the SII and many other firms are likely to launch the production by then.The RDIF has also entered into a partnership with Dr Reddy’s Labs to market the first 250 million doses of the vaccine in India.The Sputnik V vaccine was launched on a soft pilot basis in India in May. The nationwide launch has now spread to more than 50 cities and towns across the country. The soft launch initially began in Telangana’s capital Hyderabad, and has now scaled up to Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Navi Mumbai, Patna, Pune, Lucknow, Ranchi, Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar, and Coimbatore, among others, a Dr Reddy’s Labs said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-plans-to-sign-agreement-with-rdif-to-fill-sputnik-v-vaccine-vials-101626969628270.html
22-07-2021||India||Members of Dalai Lama’s inner circle on Pegasus list||Phone numbers of key members of the inner circle of the Dalai Lama, including Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) chief Penpa Tsering, are among the potential targets selected by users of the Pegasus spyware, according to media reports on Thursday. The 86-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader himself doesn’t use a smartphone, but several persons close to him were among possible targets for surveillance, including his emissary in New Delhi Tempa Tsering, his private secretary Tenzin Taklha and his aide Chhimey Rigzen, Le Monde reported. About 20 Tibetan activists, politicians and religious leaders were part of the leaked database of 50,000 phone numbers that clients of the Israeli company NSO Group, the developer of Pegasus, selected for surveillance during 2017-19. The list also included the Gyalwang Karmapa, Ugyen Trinley Dorje, former CTA or Tibetan government-in-exile head Lobsang Sangay, whose number was added in mid-2018, Penpa Tsering, who was elected chief of the CTA in May this year, and Samdhong Rinpoche, the head of a trust tasked with overseeing the selection of the Dalai Lama’s successor, according to reports by The Guardian and Le Monde. Paris-based Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International gained access to the leaked list, which has been analysed by a consortium of 17 media outlets from across the globe. Both Le Monde and The Guardian reported their analysis indicated that the Tibetan leaders were selected as potential targets by an Indian security service or the Indian government. The Indian government has so far denied any wrong-doing and also not confirmed or denied whether it licensed the Pegasus spyware. There was no immediate response from Indian officials on the reports that Tibetan leaders were included in the list of potential targets for phone hacking. Le Monde reported that members of the Dalai Lama’s inner circle were first selected for possible surveillance from the end of November 2017, when former US president Barack Obama met the Tibetan spiritual leader in New Delhi. Sangay appeared on the list in mid-2018, when he was president of the CTA and had increased trips within India and abroad. However, the phones of the Tibetan leaders were not examined and it wasn’t possible to say whether they were infected by the spyware, which is capable of accessing all the contents of a phone, recovering geo-location data and turning it into an audio or video recorder. Referring to the inclusion of the Tibetans in the list, Le Monde reported: “It reveals, as never before, the suspicion of the Indian state vis-à-vis the Tibetan community, suspected of being infiltrated by Chinese spies, as well as its strategic importance at a time when the tension between the two most populous countries in Asia continues to increase.” It added that India has reasons to be wary, because as recently as August 2020, a Chinese national suspected of being a spy, who was paying Buddhist monks for information about the Dalai Lama’s bodyguard, was arrested in India. “India wants to make sure that Tibetans don’t strike a deal with the Chinese that involves the Dalai Lama going back to Tibet,” an unnamed former staffer with the CTA told The Guardian. China has launched a campaign to push the narrative that it will oversee the selection of the Dalai Lama’s successor and that India can have no role in this process. This has been rejected by the CTA, and the US passed a law in 2020 to sanction Chinese leaders who interfered with the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/members-of-dalai-lama-s-inner-circle-on-pegasus-list-101626969360453.html
22-07-2021||India||Madras HC gives nod to Stalin’s panel on NEET, dismisses BJP’s plea||The Madras high court on Tuesday dismissed Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plea challenging Tamil Nadu government’s decision to constitute a committee to study the impact of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on socially and economically backward medical aspirants. The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that by no stretch of imagination, the constitution of the commission can be seen as contrary to the orders of the Supreme Court or as a counter to any legislative action taken by the Union government.The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) constituted the committee headed by retired justice AK Rajan in June to study the impact of NEET, take in public suggestions and indicate alternative admission procedures and the legal steps to be undertaken to implement such fair and equitable methods. One of the election promises of the DMK is to abolish the NEET. The BJP’s Tamil Nadu general secretary, Karu Nagarajan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking to quash the committee.The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test is an all India pre-medical entrance test for students who wish to pursue undergraduate medical (MBBS), dental (BDS) and equivalent Ayush BAMS, BUMS, etc. courses in government and private institutions in India and also, for those intending to pursue primary medical qualification abroad.NEET is a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu since several medical aspirants have died by suicide. It has gone through several legal wrangles before it entered the state in 2017. Until then Tamil Nadu considered class 12 board exam marks for admissions into medical colleges. The move to abolish NEET is supported by all political parties in Tamil Nadu except the BJP, which is in alliance with the opposition led by the AIADMK.In an affidavit filed last week, the Centre said it was out of Tamil Nadu’s jurisdiction to constitute a panel and that it was a futile exercise. The petitioner and the Union government cited previous orders of the Supreme Court on the case of NEET to say that the panel is unconstitutional. The Union government argued that, according to provisions under the National Medical Commission Act, 2019 and the constitutional lists, the committee is neither requisite nor valid.However, the judges said there is nothing to prevent an elected government from studying the impact of NEET. “For all we know, the commission may come up with some material that the state government may use to persuade the Union to search for an alternative or modify the process to make it more inclusive for students belonging to the socially backward and economically weaker sections to participate therein with a better chance of success,” the court said in its orders. “The issuance of the notification does not exceed the authority of the state government. As long as the state government does not do anything to upset the procedure for admission to medical institutions as established by law, it does not call for any interference.”The court also observed that there could be another point of view on the way forward for Tamil Nadu students to compete with others in NEET by raising the standard of school education in the state. “It is a question of policy as to whether the bar has to be raised at the school level or the bar has to be lowered at the medical college admission level and such matters of policy are resolved by discussion and any attempt at mature resolution begins with lending the ear and being receptive to the other point of view,” the court said. TN chief minister MK Stalin welcomed the judgment saying the “important verdict is the starting point for the Tamil Nadu government’s determination and efforts.” He criticised the BJP for supporting the government’s stance with regards to NEET in the legislative assembly but subsequently filing a legal case.He said it was a “blow” to the BJP, and established the party’s “duplicity”. Since the NEET schedule for the year has already been announced for September, Stalin pointed out that the legal steps to be taken after the panel submits its report wouldn’t be over by then. “But we will ensure a situation where we would have ended the difficulties caused to our students due to NEET,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-gives-nod-to-stalin-s-panel-on-neet-dismisses-bjp-s-plea-101626968340472.html

22-07-2021||India||Baijal writes to Sisodia says L-G’s efforts for public welfare seen with bias||Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Thursday wrote to deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia criticising his letter accusing the L-G of encroaching upon the domain of the elected government by holding meetings with bureaucrats independently without involving concerned ministers on important matters. He also said that Sisodia should not have made the letter public and rather taken up concerns over administrative issues over a personal discussion.In his letter, Baijal said his recent meetings with bureaucrats involved issues such as Covid-19 management, implementation of schemes such as ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’, water supply and housing. He added that Sisodia’s letter did not specify any instance of “obstruction” and accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of looking at his efforts through a “biased lens”.“Several complicated administrative issues involve multiple departments and it is needless to say that [in] matters of public importance, the opinion of the elected government should be in favour of cooperation and harmony… Your letter does not mention any specific instance of obstruction caused to the decision of the elected government on any issue… It is unfortunate that my efforts with clean intent towards public welfare were seen through a biased lens and misinterpreted. In the end, I want to repeat that I shall continue fulfilling my constitutional responsibilities aimed at serving the people of Delhi,” said Baijal’s letter to Sisodia, written in Hindi, a copy of which HT has seen.He further said that some of the meetings with chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana regarding shortage of water supply in Delhi was chaired on request from Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Sisodia, in a letter to Baijal, sent on Saturday, had objected to the L-G holding meetings with bureaucrats and alleged that he instructed them on works that came under the purview of the elected government. Sisodia called the L-G’s actions “murder of democracy” and violative of the Supreme Court judgment.“Over the last few months, you have been calling prominent officials of the Delhi government to your office and issuing directions related to work of their departments. I have also come to know that you are issuing directions to the officials on subjects that come under the purview of the elected government, without even keeping the ministers in the loop, and later officials of the L-G secretariat are pressuring the bureaucrats to implement such orders,” Sisodia said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by HT.The deputy CM “humbly requested” Baijal to desist from such “activities”. “Under the Constitution, the Delhi LG can take decisions only on police, land and public order,” Sisodia said, citing the Supreme Court order of July 4, 2018, which said that the L-G should work with the aid and advice of the elected government.Baijal wrote back to Sisodia on Thursday claiming all his meetings were “within” his office’s “domain” and his efforts were being subjected to “wrongful allegations instead of due appreciation”.“These meetings are essential in the light of better coordination among multiple agencies and they are important in ensuring efficient implementation of welfare schemes and programmes. Such meetings aimed at fulfilment of responsibilities of this office towards ensuring public welfare are not new but never before have any objections been raised against them,” he wrote. He added that he had no hesitation in sharing details of the meetings held in the last three months.“There have been three review meetings of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) focussing on strategies and preparedness against potential waves of the Covid-19 pandemic in future. There have also been routine meetings of the DDMA on status of vaccination, compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, PSA oxygen plants in hospitals, facilities concerning supply of medical oxygen among hospitals, strength of healthcare and paramedic staff, sero-survey, relaxations concerning economic activities, strategies on micro containment, contact tracing and tests, and information and awareness campaigns. Stakeholders such as the National Disaster Management Authority, health and revenue departments, police and panels of experts have participated in these meetings… Are meetings organised to enhance coordination among them to ensure better Covid-19 management unconstitutional now?” Baijal asked in the letter.He also mentioned meetings held to review implementation of ONORC, welfare of street vendors, water supply, Delhi Master Plan and women security.“Delhi is also facing shortage of water and Delhi chief minister (Arvind Kejriwal) had himself asked me to personally discuss the water issue with chief ministers of neighbouring states Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. To address hardships faced by people due to shortage of water supply, three meetings were held which involved representatives of the environment department, urban development department and Delhi Jal Board,” the letter said.He asserted that all the aforementioned meetings were conducted through video conference facility and not necessarily through physical attendance of all stakeholders in Raj Niwas. “When decisions are to be taken, concerned officials and ministers are invited to attend these meetings…,” the letter argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baijal-writes-to-sisodia-says-l-g-s-efforts-for-public-welfare-seen-with-bias-101626967800449.html

22-07-2021||India||'Sab yaad rakha jaega': Rahul’s fresh jibe at Centre over oxygen shortage death||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the Centre on Thursday over its statement on “zero death reported” due to oxygen shortage by sharing a 44-second video on his Twitter profile with a one-liner caption that reads “Sab yaad rakha jaega” (Everything will be remembered).The curated video, which opens with the message “the truth about oxygen shortage”, shows several images and news articles from the time of the second wave of Covid-19, and the related deaths reported across states and Union territories (UTs) owing to lack of oxygen.सब याद रखा जाएगा।#OxygenShortage pic.twitter.com/I5ouDxz7IRRahul’s latest remark follows the one he made on Tuesday soon after Union minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, in response to Congress MP KC Venugopal’s question, told the Rajya Sabha that no deaths “due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by the states/UTs.”“It wasn’t just the lack of oxygen but also a severe lack of sensitivity and truth. It was then, still is today,” Rahul wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.Several opposition leaders apart from Rahul, including Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Delhi deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, criticised the Centre over its claim on oxygen shortage.However, many states have backed the claim as well, citing that no Covid-19 patients died in their states due to lack of oxygen.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra had on Wednesday said that it is the responsibility of the states and UTs to report on fatalities owing to oxygen shortage and that such data wasn’t shared with the Centre. “If the Opposition says the Centre has not put the correct data, then they should ask their own state governments what has gone wrong,” he added.Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu are among opposition-led states that have also denied any fatality among coronavirus patients due to oxygen shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sab-yaad-rakha-jaega-rahul-s-fresh-jibe-at-centre-over-oxygen-shortage-death-101626965524247.html
22-07-2021||India||Foreign secretary Shringla to visit UK during July 23-24||India’s foreign secretary Harsh Shringla will visit the UK during July 23-24 for a comprehensive review of bilateral relations, including the Roadmap 2030 to elevate ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership over the next decade. The Roadmap 2030 was adopted at a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson in May, when the two sides launched an Enhanced Trade Partnership for facilitating market access in specific sectors, and unveiled plans to finalise an interim trade deal by mid-2022 as a precursor to a free trade agreement. “During the visit, the foreign secretary will meet his counterparts and conduct a detailed review of bilateral relations with particular focus on the implementation of the Roadmap 2030. He will also discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday. The Roadmap 2030, he said, is aimed at elevating bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and guiding cooperation over the next 10 years in key areas such as trade, defence, security, climate, health and people-to-people relations. The Enhanced Trade Partnership is part of UK’s efforts to ramp up trade ties with countries across the world following its exit from the European Union (EU). It will see Britain open up its fisheries sector to more Indian players, facilitate more opportunities for nurses, recognise Indian seafarers’ certificates and enter into a joint dialogue on a social security agreement. In return, India lifted restrictions to enable British producers to export fruits to the country and improved access for medical devices through the acceptance of the UK Certificates of Free Sale. The two sides will also work towards reciprocal opening up of legal services. These actions are expected to generate some 25,000 new direct and indirect jobs in India. Shringla’s visit is also expected to be an opportunity for India and UK to review the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has launched a massive campaign to capture territory while refusing to engage in meaningful peace talks to find a political settlement. The UK has emerged as a key player in facilitating back channel contacts with the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-shringla-to-visit-uk-during-july-2324-101626965580109.html

The Centre had sent additional doses as per our request. As a result, we still have a stock of 15.18 lakh doses and around 2.5 lakh doses arrive almost every day,” news agency PTI quoted Patel as saying.The Gujarat government had in July asked the people working in the businesses of hotels, malls, shops, salons and restaurants to receive their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine before July 31.Also read | India’s Covid-19 vaccine coverage at 417 million doses so farPatel, who also holds the state’s health portfolio, referred to the previous order by the Gujarat home department and said that the special inoculation drive has been organised to vaccinate the traders and employees of commercial establishments.

22-07-2021||India||'We're independent of Twitter': Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari's submission in Karnataka high court||Twitter India managing director Manish Maheshwari on Thursday described it as an "independent entity," claiming that its parent company, Twitter Inc, "does not have a single share in it," according to news agency PTI. The submission was made by Maheshwari's legal counsel in the Karnataka high court during hearing by a single-judge bench on his plea against the Uttar Pradesh Police's notice to him seeking his personal appearance in connection with the video of an alleged hate crime in Loni in northern state's Ghaziabad.Also Read | Ghaziabad assault case: Karnataka HC to pronounce order on Twitter India MD's plea on July 22"Twitter Inc is a parent company. We have absolutely nothing to do with it. Twitter India is an independent organisation and independent institution," CV Nagesh, Maheshwari's counsel, responded on behalf of his client when asked by Justice G Narendra whether the social media giant could be called as a "parent company." Nagesh further described Twitter India as "only an affiliated company" of Twitter Inc. This prompted the judge to point out that there is no such thing as an "affiliated company." Justice Narendra further said that in normal terms, such a thing is called a "sister company" or "associate."Responding to the judge's observation, the counsel said, "Let me go on record that Twitter Inc does not hold a "single share" in Twitter India. That's why I'm submitting that it's a totally different entity." Nagesh also proposed to place a memo on record on Friday that Twitter Inc, headquartered in San Francisco in the United States, is "not even a shareholder."Arguing for the Ghaziabad Police, P Prasanna Kumar, its legal counsel, warned of "consequences" for submission by Maheshwari's team that they don't know "who Twitter India is." Further arguing that 99% of Twitter India's shares are with Twitter Inc, Kumar said that all of Maheshwari's colleagues have been representing Twitter India, as well as Twitter Inc, before agencies of the Union government, up to this day.On this, Nagesh went on to describe the shareholding pattern. "Twitter International Company, headquartered in Ireland, has 9999 shares, while Twitter Netherlands has one share. However, it is Twitter Inc which runs the platform," he explained.The Karnataka high court, which, on June 24, granted interim protection from arrest to the Bengaluru-based Maheshwari, was earlier scheduled to pronounce its judgment on July 13, which was further deferred to July 20, and then to July 22. The judgment is now expected to be pronounced on Friday. The Uttar Pradesh Police, on June 29 challenged in the Supreme Court the high court's order granting interim protection to Maheshwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-india-an-independent-entity-md-manish-maheshwari-submits-in-karnataka-high-court-101626962282498.html
22-07-2021||India||India again calls for early meeting of military commanders on LAC standoff||India on Thursday again called for the next round of talks between Indian and Chinese military commanders to be held “at the earliest” to discuss and resolve all remaining issues related to the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). There has been no forward movement since external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi met in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on July 14 and agreed that the meeting of military commanders should be organised as soon as possible. “The two leaders agreed that the next round of commander level talks should be convened at the earliest, wherein the two sides should discuss all the remaining issues and seek a mutually acceptable solution,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing. “There was also an understanding that both sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and neither side will take any unilateral action that could increase tension,” he said. Differences had emerged between the two sides following the meeting in Dushanbe. While Jaishankar said both sides should speedily resolve the remaining issues on the LAC since the standoff was negatively impacting bilateral ties, Wang contended that the situation in the border areas had de-escalated and the two countries should set aside the standoff to expand bilateral cooperation. Bagchi noted that Jaishankar had told the Chinese side that “both sides had agreed that a prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side and that it was visibly impacting the relationship in a negative manner”. Jaishankar also emphasised that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas has been the “foundation for the development of ties” since 1988. “Attempts to change the status quo last year, which also disregarded commitments under the 1993 and 1996 agreements, have inevitably affected ties. It was, therefore, in mutual interest that the two sides work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols,” Bagchi said. The Indian side has insisted that there has been lack of progress in disengagement and de-escalation of frontline troops following a limited drawdown on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February. Last month, India again blamed China’s actions of amassing troops in border areas and attempting to alter the status quo on the LAC for the standoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-calls-for-early-meeting-of-military-commanders-on-lacstandoff-101626964740113.html
22-07-2021||India||UNGA president-elect Abdulla Shahid says India central to his plans||President-elect of the UN General Assembly Abdulla Shahid, who is also foreign minister of the Maldives, said on Thursday that India will be central to his five-point plan for the world body, including reforming the United Nations and post-pandemic recovery.Shahid, who arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for a three-day visit, said in an interview that there was a need for greater cohesion in the UN and world community on terrorism, including a common definition for the scourge, so that terrorists know they have no place in a civilised society.India was among the first countries to back Shahid’s candidature for the post of president of the UN General Assembly and he unveiled a vision statement earlier this year for a “presidency of hope” with “five rays of hope” or priority themes – recovering from Covid-19, rebuilding sustainably, responding to the planet’s needs, respecting the rights of all, and reforming the UN.“I chose the theme ‘presidency of hope’ because of the difficult times that the world community has gone through during the past one-and-a-half years,” he said.“On all the five rays of hope, I need India to work with me...I’m counting on India to back my presidency of hope. All these five rays of hope are issues India has always attached great importance to internationally,” he added.Shahid further said: “When it comes to recovering from Covid-19, we need to address the issue of vaccine equity. India is one of the largest producers of vaccines...India has been an advocate for rebuilding sustainably. We launched the [UN] Decade of Action in 2020...We should not let Covid-19 take our focus from the Decade of Action. That is why I’m calling to reset the clock and to start rebuilding sustainably, build back better, build back greener, bluer, and make this a much more vibrant decade...and India can play a role.”Describing global efforts to tackle terrorism as part of pending issues linked to UN reforms, Shahid said the world body and the global community need to speak in one voice on the matter. “We need united political will to be demonstrated by completing the work that has been ongoing at the UN – the convention against terrorism...We have still not been able to reach a definition of terrorism,” he said.This work needs to be expedited to demonstrate unity in confronting terror at the political level so that terrorists know they have no place in civilised society, he added.Though Shahid’s visit to India is largely focused on his upcoming term at the UN, he said he would discuss bilateral relations and development cooperation with his Indian interlocutors. “I will be signing an MoU even during this visit on high impact community development projects, which are in great demand in the Maldives. I’m signing the MoU [on Friday]...,” he said.“The much larger projects that have been in the pipeline are about to be inaugurated. And I’m hoping that many of these projects will be inaugurated in the next month or so,” he said, adding the projects had made progress despite delays due to the pandemic.The Maldives has a key role in India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy and has benefited from large India-backed infrastructure projects worth $2 billion. It was the first country to receive made-in-India vaccines in January, and this was preceded by health and humanitarian aid in 2020, including 12 tonnes of medicines, and a soft loan of $250 million for budgetary support.Asked about concerns in the region about radicalism in the Maldives following the May 6 bombing in Male that seriously injured Speaker Mohamed Nasheed, Shahid said: “Only the investigations will reveal how far the roots of this attack are going. So I cannot comment on that. But the government is determined to make sure that we do a thorough investigation...assisted by foreign experts from Australian federal police, from the UK and also the US...So we’ll make sure that all culprits are brought before justice.”Responding to a question on the implications of differences within the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party over a bill to criminalise hate speech that was introduced after the attack on Nasheed, Shahid said a final call will be made by parliamentarians.“Like any bill that is submitted to the Parliament, this is a bill that the government initiated. But as in the past, the Parliament scrutinises the bill and the bill is now back in a committee. So I’m hopeful that as soon as the Parliament is back [from a recess on August16], they will attend to the bill,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unga-president-elect-abdulla-shahid-says-india-central-to-his-plans-101626963482046.html

The decision was taken with “an aim of addressing regional imbalances in higher education level and stimulating the society of Ladakh”, an unnamed government official quoted by PTI said.This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise made in the address to the nation on last Independence Day to set up a new university in Ladakh.“The Cabinet also approved the creation of one post of managing director for the corporation in the pay scale of ₹144,200- ₹218,200 level,” the government said in a press release. “The authorized share capital of the corporation will be ₹25 crore and recurring expenditure will be around ₹2.42 crore per year. It is a new establishment. Presently, there is no similar organization within the newly formed UT of Ladakh.”The government added that the approval has the potential to generate employment as the corporation will be undertaking various developmental activities. “The corporation will work for industry, tourism, transport and marketing of local products and handicraft. Corporation will also work as the main construction agency for infrastructure development in Ladakh,” the government said.The government said it will result in inclusive and integrated development of :Ladakh.“It [will] increase domestic production of goods and services and will facilitate their smooth supply. Thus, the approval will help in realizing the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” the statement read.The government has also approved a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for specialty steel in an initiative aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and exports and cutting down the import burden for the sector, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said. The scheme will be applicable for five years from 2023-24 to 2027-28.“With a budgetary outlay of ₹6,322 crores, the scheme is expected to bring in investment of approximately ₹40,000 crores and capacity addition of 25 metric tonne (MT) for speciality steel. The scheme will give employment to about 525,000 people, of which, 68,000 will be direct employment. Speciality steel has been chosen as the target segment because out of the 102 million tonnes steel produced in India in 2020-21, only 18 million tonnes of value added steel or speciality steel was produced in the country,” said the government statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-approves-central-university-development-corporation-in-ladakh-101626961679894.html

In a letter to Sisodia, Baijal said all the meetings called by him in the recent months were within the ambit of the constitutional provisions and responsibilities entrusted to the office of lieutenant governor.He said that the office of lieutenant governor has the highest regard towards the Constitution of India and the principles of democracy and is committed to abiding by Supreme Court judgment on the division of power."Whatever the reason might be, the letter should not have been made public due to the sensitivity related to the roles and responsibilities of constitutional authorities," Baijal wrote, adding that the deputy CM should have discussed the issue with him personally.HT had earlier reported on Sisodia's letter to Baijal in which the deputy CM had termed LG's actions “murder of democracy” and violative of the Supreme Court judgment. Sisodia had objected to the lieutenant governor issuing directions to Delhi government officials "on subjects that come under the purview of the elected government, without even keeping the ministers in the loop."Also Read | LG encroaching on Delhi govt’s turf, says SisodiaBaijal said even as some subjects have been kept out of the purview of the Delhi government, effective coordination and consultation with other departments are required for the execution of policies and schemes relating to reserved subjects."In your letter, no specific evidence or instance has been cited where guidance given by me in the meetings has in any manner obstructed the implementation of decisions taken by the elected government," he wrote.In his rebuttal to Sisodia, Baijal quoted the Supreme Court judgment in Govt. Of Nct Of Delhi vs Union Of India (2018) which says "[t]he methods and approach for the Governments of the Union and the States may sometimes be different but the ultimate goal and objective always remain the same and the governments at different levels should not lose sight of the ultimate objective.""It is unfortunate that a biased view was taken and wrong interpretations were made for the actions taken in the public interest with a clear intention," the lieutenant governor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-lg-calls-deputy-cm-s-allegations-baseless-101626959141471.html

The deceased was married to Mohammad Shabir some three years ago but Shabir sent her to her parents’ house after their relations turned sour. “However, on Wednesday, when she was grazing cattle in the nearby field in her parental village, Shabir along with his elder brother Abdul Majeed attacked her with a sharp edged weapon and killed her on the spot,” said the officer quoted above. He added that both brothers then fled the crime scene and hid in Reasi and Rajouri districts respectively.

The minister of state for external affairs and culture said the opposition was promoting such activities.“They are not farmers, they are hooligans... These are criminal acts. What happened on January 26 was also shameful criminal activities. The Opposition promoted such activities,” Lekhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Later, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait hit out at Lekhi said farmers are annadatas' (providers) and to call them such names is inappropriate. "Hooligans are the ones who have nothing. It is wrong to make such remarks for farmers. We are farmers, not hooligans. Farmers are 'anndatas' of the land," Tikait was quoted as saying.The farmers protesting for months along the borders of Delhi against three Central laws began their ‘Farmer Parliament’ on Thursday at the Jantar Mantar. Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal has given special permission for a demonstration by a maximum of 200 farmers at Jantar Mantar, a few metres from the Parliament Complex, till August 9, where the Monsoon Session is underway.A journalist, Nagendra, was reportedly attacked by a woman with a stick at the protest ground.

22-07-2021||India||Petition in SC for court-monitored probe into Pegasus scandal||Terming the Pegasus spying scandal a “serious attack” on Indian democracy, the judiciary and on the security of the country, a petition has been filed by a lawyer in the Supreme Court demanding a court-monitored investigation by a special investigation team (SIT) to identify those responsible for snooping on opposition leaders, activists, journalists and judges among a host of other persons.The petition filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma said, “The Pegasus scandal is a matter of grave concern and a serious attack upon Indian democracy, judiciary and country security. The widespread and unaccountable use of surveillance is morally disfiguring.” It is yet to be admitted. The petition has named Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a respondent along with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) without making the Union of India as a party. Sharma earlier approached the CBI for registering a first information report (FIR) into allegations of Pegasus spying but this was not done, the petition stated.Sharma, who is known for being the first to file petitions on major issues, made a two-fold demand to the top court. He sought a probe by a SIT under the supervision of the top court into the revelations and prosecute all accused persons who bought the Pegasus software and allegedly snooped on Indian citizens for criminal breach of trust (IPC Sections 408, 409), criminal conspiracy (IPC Section 120B), read with Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act 1923 (penalty for spying) and relevant provisions under the Information Technology Act 2000.Sharma, a serial petitioner has been previously reprimanded and fined by the court by the petitions, some of which have been dismissed in minutes. He further requested the top court to declare buying of Pegasus software for snooping to be “illegal” and violative of a person’s right to life and privacy protected under Article 21 and said, “Buying of Pegasus software without approval (of Parliament) contra to the Art. 266(3), 267(2) and 283(2) of the Constitution is a criminal breach of trust and also attracts Sections 408, 409 and 120-B of IPC.”Articles 266(3), 267(2), 283(2) provide that any amount to be spent or withdrawn out of the Consolidated Fund of India or the Contingency Fund maintained by states should be in accordance with law.The breach of privacy using Pegasus software engaged the attention of the Supreme Court in December 2019, almost a month after the names of 121 Indians whose phones were allegedly hacked using this software surfaced. The matter was brought to court by former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharak KN Govindacharya.A three-judge bench headed by then Chief Justice of India SA Bobde refused to go into the issue and allowed the petition to be withdrawn at the very first hearing on December 2, 2019. The petition sought a direction for a court-monitored probe by either National Investigation Agency or a special investigation team against WhatsApp, Facebook and NSO Group for violating right to privacy of Indian citizens. The petition even sought perjury proceedings to be initiated against WhatsApp for misleading the top court with its claim that the data of its users was fully encrypted and nobody, including WhatsApp, held the key to access it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-sc-for-court-monitored-probe-into-pegasus-scandal-101626954659447.html

22-07-2021||India||'Delta variant continues to be dominant variant in new Covid-19 cases': INSACOG||INSACOG, a consortium of government panels involved in the genome sequencing of the coronavirus, which was set up in December last year, has described the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the "dominant" lineage for new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) being reported from the across India, according to news agency PTI.The other variants of concern (VoC), INSACOG said, are "at a lower rate and declining."Also Read | Delta variant ‘primarily responsible’ for Covid-19 second wave, says govt expert"Delta remains the most rapidly rising lineage globally that is responsible for multiple outbreaks, including across southeast Asia, which shows the fastest growth in new cases globally," the consortium said about the variant, which was first detected in India last year, and is also denoted as the B.1.617.2 strain. It further described Delta as a variant, a new and more concerning variant than which in the Delta sub-lineage, "currently does not exist," according to evidence.On a recent study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), INSCAOG said it confirms most of the clinical cases in vaccine breakthrough were due to the Delta variant.

Britain has sent the 65,000-tonne carrier and its task group to the Indian Ocean as part of the country’s moves to enhance its profile in the Indo-Pacific and to foster defence ties with nations across the region. The task group is set to sail to the disputed South China Sea on the next leg of its deployment. The three-day annual Konkan exercise between the Indian and British navies, which began on Wednesday, will see warships from both sides conducting a range of multi-ship, air, sea and sub-surface maritime drills, as well as close quarter manoeuvring. Also Read | Royal Navy personnel on UK carrier shares family bond with Indian military“This enables both forces to advance their interoperability and cooperation ahead of further exercises when the [carrier strike group] returns to the Indian Ocean in the autumn. The combined forces equate to 10 ships, two submarines, approximately 20 aircraft and almost 4,000 personnel,” the British high commission said in a statement. “The joint endeavour provides tangible security to our friends and a credible deterrence to those who seek to undermine global security. An Indian warship will also exercise with the Royal Navy off the coast of the UK in August,” the statement added. The exercise is being conducted at a time when both the UK and India are in the midst of bolstering the capabilities of their navies with aircraft carriers, and UK carrier strike group is spearheading Britain’s joint expeditionary capability. HMS Queen Elizabeth is equipped with fifth generation F-35B Lightning multi-role aircraft, which are jointly manned by the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and US Marine Corps. The group includes six Royal Navy ships and a submarine, a US Navy destroyer, a frigate from the Netherlands and 32 aircraft, and is manned by 3,700 sailors, aviators and marines from the combined forces of the UK, US and the Netherlands. The UK’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, said: “This is a month that will see the Royal Navy and Indian Navy meet and work together in two oceans – beginning in the Indian Ocean as the UK carrier strike group arrives for the first of multiple UK-India exercises and events. “Later this summer, both will participate in a separate exercise in the Atlantic Ocean. The deployment is proof of the strength, energy and significance of the growing relationship between our navies.” Vice admiral Ben Key, Britain’s chief of joint operations, described the carrier strike group’s deployment as a “symbol of Global Britain in action” that showcased the UK’s commitment to India, the Indo-Pacific and confronting threats to international order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-conduct-naval-exercise-in-bay-of-bengal-101626952020556.html
22-07-2021||India||‘India, China most vulnerable to joint risks of climate change, air pollution’||India and China are among the world’s top five countries that are most vulnerable to climate change and air pollution with the capacity to deal with the risks, a first of its kind research assessing the combined risks of air pollution and climate change, said on Thursday.The world’s two fastest developing economies with 2.5 billion plus people have witnessed a spurt in particulate matter induced air pollution levels in the past two decades and have seen high risks due to climate change induced extreme rainfall, frequent cyclones and heat waves in recent past, the study says.“Deaths resulting from toxic pollution are highest where the distribution of toxic pollution is greatest and, critically, also where the impacts of climate change pose the greatest risk,” the study, Global distribution and coincidence of pollution, climate impacts, and health risk in the Anthropocene, said, in a specific reference to India and China.For more than 30 years, the scientists on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have assessed impacts of human induced climate change whereas bodies such as World Health Organisation have focused on health impacts of rising air pollution globally.Scientists at the University of Notre Dame found a “strong and statistically significant” link between the two environmental hazards and said the countries which are at most risk of climate change are also the countries with highest risks of toxic pollution.A vital difference between climate change and air pollution is that greenhouse gases that cause global warming are considered non-toxic whereas air pollutants such as particulate matter or nitrogen dioxide are toxic.“It is not surprising to find that these risks are highly correlated, but this study provides the data and analysis to inform policy, data and analysis that were previously lacking,” associate professor of Political Science at the university Debra Javeline said, in a statement.To make the study useful for policymakers, the authors ranked 177 countries on “Target”, a measure that combined a country’s climate impact risk, toxic pollution risk and its potential readiness to mitigate these risks. Most countries such as India and China, have high air pollution and green house gas (GHG) emissions. China is the world’s leading total GHG emitter and India is on track to join it at the top and they are two top ranked countries to emit toxic air pollution. Based on these criteria, the study ranked Singapore, Rwanda, China, India, Solomon Islands, Bhutan, Botswana, Georgia, the Republic of Korea and Thailand as top 10 countries. “The top one-third of countries at risk of toxic pollution and climate impacts represent more than two-thirds of the world’s population, highlighting the magnitude of the problem and unequal distribution of environmental risk,” researchers wrote in the paper published in peer-reviewed scientific journal PLOS One.Among those countries appearing at the bottom of the list are Equatorial Guinea, Iraq, Jordan, Central African Republic and Venezuela. “These (bottom of the table) nations are most likely to have outstanding governance issues that currently stand in the way of effectively addressing pollution and climate change,” the study said.On India and China, the two largest countries, together representing over 2.5 billion people, the study said they have relatively high Proportion Mortality ranks --- India ranked 5th and China 13th with 23.5% and 17.9% of annual deaths associated with toxic pollution, equalling 2.3 and 1.9 million premature deaths annually, respectively. The study also pointed out that the two countries have come up with national pollution reduction policies to reduce pollution deaths. In the case of China, it said, its National Plan on Air Pollution led to 40% reduction in pollution levels.“The improved air quality resulted in significant corresponding reductions in respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease mortality rates,” the study said, adding that there is strong potential for co-benefits from efforts focused on China and India in risk reduction for neighbouring countries and other countries at-risk of climate change more broadly.Anumita Roy Chowdhary of Centre for Science and Environment said the study interestingly provides broad parameters linking air pollution and climate change and provides insight on how tackling both with singular policy instruments can be co-beneficial. “We know that reducing air pollution helps in managing green house gas emissions and vice-versa. The study, however, analyses the capability of 180 countries to deal with twin environmental problems,” she said.University’s postdoctoral research associate Drew (Richard) Marcantonio said the idea of ranking (Target) is to highlight where action can be taken to reduce risk to human health and whether it can be done through incentives or sanctions. “A range of measures can be used to promote risk reduction such as trade incentives..., or other policy and regulatory enforcement mechanisms,” the study said, adding that it provides moral reflection to determine what actions should be taken and who should take them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-most-vulnerable-to-joint-risks-of-climate-change-air-pollution-101626951839200.html

A two-judge bench, comprising chief justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, also recalled WhatsApp's statement to it on July 9 clarifying it won't block accounts of those not accepting its privacy policy "for the time being."Also Read: WhatsApp will put policy on hold till data law is enacted"We said we will not block," senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for WhatsApp, reiterated during Thursday's hearing. However, senior advocate Vivek Sood, appearing for one of the petitioners, Harsha Gupta, argued the data can still be transferred according to the pre-2021 policy, calling for WhatsApp to make a statement stating it will not transfer the data.Advocate Manohar Lal, who appeared for the first petitioner, Chaitanya Rohilla, submitted to the court his client's concern did not pertain to the personal messages sent using the platform, but the meta data that is shared with Facebook. Meghan, a co-petitioner with two other persons, also raised issues with respect to privacy."All right, we're considering. There's no use of WhatsApp making statement again and against," the chief justice-headed bench observed, fixing August 27 as the date on which it will hear the pleas challenging the privacy policy.The high court, on July 9, had heard WhatsApp's plea challenging a probe into its privacy policy by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). During that hearing, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for WhatsApp, had submitted on behalf of its client, "Commitment is that I will do nothing till the Parliament's law comes in. If they allow it, I will have it. Either we fit or we don't."The pleas challenging the privacy policy claim it allows WhatsApp "full access" into a user's online activity without there being any supervision by the government. The charge has been dismissed by the messaging platform which has said "personal messages continue to be protected by end-to-end encryption."The proposed Data Protection Bill, meanwhile, seeks to regulate the use of an individual data by the government and private companies.

22-07-2021||India||Anti human trafficking Bill: Civil society recognises urgency, but has concerns||The draft anti-trafficking Bill, 2021, which is slated to be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament, has mostly elicited a positive response from activists and organisations working to combat the threat, with a few recommending additional measures to the Bill after the ministry of women and child development sought public feedback.The new Bill expands the scope of the powers of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and goes on to add transgender persons to the list of trafficked persons apart from women and children.It also widens the punishment for offences, with persons found guilty of trafficking liable for a minimum term of seven years, which can be extended to 10 years. The provision will have implications for cross-border offences as well. The persons convicted will also have to pay a fine of ₹1-5 lakh, the Bill has proposed. It will also allow the properties of convicts, bought using money from trafficking, to be forfeited. The Bill also mandates the creation of a three-tier monitoring system, a national, state and district level anti human trafficking committee.Also Read | Rights activists caution against child labour and trafficking during pandemicAs per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2019, the total number of child victims of trafficking increased from 2,837 in 2018 to 2,914 in 2019, registering a marginal growth of 2.8% during the year. The top six states reporting child trafficking (below 18 years) were Rajasthan (653), Delhi (536), Bihar (294), Odisha (202), and Kerala (179), and Madhya Pradesh (124).Social reformer Kailash Satyarthi has called for urgent passage of the Bill, citing the need for a strong anti-trafficking law. “A strong anti-trafficking law is the moral and constitutional responsibility of our elected leaders, and a necessary step toward nation-building and economic progress. As long as children are bought and sold at a lesser cost than cattle, no country can call itself civilised. Covid-19 has caused a rise in trafficking, especially of women and children. We cannot take this lightly. A law for prevention, timely investigation, punishment for traffickers, and the protection and rehabilitation of survivors is a matter of urgency,” he said.But others such as the non-governmental organisation (NGO) HAQ: Centre for Child Rights, and Coalition for an Inclusive Approach on the Trafficking Bill, have cautioned against the increased scope of the Bill, stating that it may lead to confusion and even abuse of certain provisions.“The Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021 (“Bill”) intends to prevent and counter trafficking in persons, especially women and children, to provide for care, protection, and rehabilitation to the victims, while respecting their rights, and creating a supportive legal, economic and social environment for them, and also to ensure prosecution of offenders,” HAQ: Centre for Child Rights has said in its submission to the ministry of women and child development on July 14.The key provisions and concernsWith respect to the NIA, the Bill states that it will tackle all trafficking cases, including inter-state and international ones.“The National Investigation Agency shall act as the national investigating and coordinating agency responsible for prevention and combating of trafficking in persons and other offences under this Act, as well as for investigation, prosecution and coordination in cases of trafficking in persons and other offences under this Act in accordance with the provisions of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008, including cases which are inter-state or international in nature or such other cases as may be assigned to it by the Central Government,” states the draft Bill.According to former director general of police, PM Nair, who was integral in setting up the government’s grassroots level anti human trafficking units (AHTUs), the expansion of the scope of NIA’s powers is welcome but a crucial gap that remains is the lack of rehabilitation, which remains beyond their remit. “NIA is an investigative body, it does not have a system of rehabilitation,” he said. “There needs to be a coordinated state level rehabilitation system that can accommodate those rescued, which can be supervised by the NIA.”Nair also added that a dedicated wing should be set up with the NIA that looks after cases of human trafficking in particular, similar to the special crimes wing. He lauded the inclusion of section 370 of the Indian Penal Code into the Bill, stating that it will help in greater coordination as there will be common law, which has more utility.But making NIA the sole authority to investigate the cases has not gone down well with everyone. The Coalition Coalition for an Inclusive Approach on the Trafficking Bill has challenged the provision stating it represents a threat to the federal structure of the constitution. “The proposal of NIA not only being the investigation agency, but also the applicability of the NIA Act to the investigation of offences under the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021 should be a wake-up call for all states in the Indian Union… the NIA now will have a legal basis to enter states and even begin investigations for trafficking without the consent of the concerned state. In a federal set-up, any expansion of the authority of the NIA beyond what is already scheduled in the NIA Act should be viewed with the utmost concern,” it has said in its submission.Another concern is Section 23 of the Bill, which explains what constitutes trafficking of persons, has also elicited a strong response from the community. The section notes that any person who “recruits, transports, transfers, harbours or receives another person; By means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of authority or of vulnerability, or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person”. It goes onto explain that “exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation including pornography, any act of physical exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or forced removal of organs, illegal clinical drug trials or illegal bio-medical research or the like.”Terming it anti-migrant workers, HAQ explains how the Bill can adversely affect labourers, adding that it conflates trafficking with forced labour and migration. “The proposed Bill conflates trafficking with forced labour and migration. Inclusion of the word “forced labour” in the Explanation 1 on “exploitation” in section 23 allows all migrant workers in the unorganised sector to be treated as forced labour.While this per se is not problematic and anybody who is subjected to forced labour should find recourse in law, the recruitment and movement for such labour, which is often a result of inducement and may also involve false promises and deceit, will bring them under the definition of trafficking as proposed in the Bill. The Bill further requires all persons perceived as “trafficked victims” to be rescued and rehabilitated, thus invariably implying that all migrant workers in the unorganised sector, who may be deemed as “forced labour” shall have to be rescued from their situation of work and institutionalised in the name of rehabilitation,” HAQ has said in its statement.The Coalition, too, has warned against the dangers of an overbroad response, stating that it negates the consent of those the Bill is supposed to protect. “The Bill adopts a definition of trafficking which defines victims as those who cannot consent, in effect negates the autonomy of the so-called victims. Even those who had been trafficked have the right to make decisions about their current and future life. By empowering authorities to place persons who are trafficked in custodial institutions without their consent,3 the Bill fundamentally erodes the notion of individual autonomy guaranteed under the Indian Constitution,” it has said.The three committees proposed by the Bill, says Nair, should instead be called authorities. “Committees come across as toothless, we need to establish a lexicon that gives them powers.”The Coalition has also stressed the need to adopt a more welfarist approach and not just a “criminalization impulse”. “The Bill is fundamentally motivated by a criminalising impulse. Issues which have to be seen within the lens of development are sought to be dealt with by criminal law. The state instead of taking on welfarist/developmentalist functions chooses to focus on incarcerating the poor,” it has highlighted.The way forward The Bill, which was passed in 2018 in the Lok Sabha but lapsed before it reached the Rajya Sabha was revised after the ministry received a suggestion from a spectrum of stakeholders. It will now be reintroduced in the lower House, and if cleared, will be sent to the upper House before it becomes an Act.While many remain concerned with certain provisions of the Bill, a push for its passage has been the focus for most of the organisations, which see it as a strengthening of the system to combat human trafficking.Jyoti Mathur, executive director of the Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, said that there are a lot of positive features in the Bill. “It’s high time we have a law which looks at trafficking in a comprehensive manner,” she said. “Although trafficking is covered under ITPA, under POCSO Act, and Indian Penal Code, among others. But it is not just about the criminal aspect of it but also about the rehabilitation aspect of it.”She added that trafficking is a continuous crime. “NIA’s scope being expanded is an advantage. Police investigation has seen delays and issues of jurisdiction in the past. NIA also has international jurisdiction. Making an amendment to their Act and adding trafficking under its ambit is a big step. It will keep traffickers from taking advantage of the gaps in the system,” she said.Mathur added that one must not get lost in the details as the Bill overall is more positive in nature. “In pursuit of perfection, we cannot delay the law,” she said. “There will always be something missing. The Bill in its current form has plenty of good features. We need to focus on that,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-human-trafficking-bill-civil-society-recognises-urgency-but-has-concerns-101626946485072.html
22-07-2021||India||Govt failed to properly probe post-poll violence complaints: Calcutta HC||The West Bengal government has failed to properly investigate complaints of alleged violence after the May-April assembly elections, the Calcutta high court observed on Thursday.“The proceedings have become adversarial because the state has failed to properly investigate,” a five-judge bench said while hearing public interest litigations related to the violence.The violence allegedly broke out hours after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) returned to power for a third time in May. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which hoped to wrest power from TMC, has blamed the ruling party for the violence. The TMC has insisted incidents of violence were reported when the law and order was under the Election Commission’s jurisdiction and that Banerjee dealt with them effectively after taking over.The court’s comments came days after a panel of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) set up following a high court order in June to look into violence blamed the state government for it. In a 50-page report submitted to the court last week, the panel slammed the state government saying the violence “shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus”. It recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the violence and that the trials related to it be conducted outside the state.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the West Bengal government, dismissed the report. “It is nothing but a politically motivated report. We do not give credence to the NHRC report,” he told the court.Mahesh Jethmalani, who appeared for the petitioners, said the state whose inaction has triggered the entire litigation wants to now investigate on its own. He called for a probe by an independent agency. “The state has been complicit in many instances.”The court directed the government to file its reply on the NHRC report by July 26. The matter would be heard again on July 28.The NHRC report said at least 1,934 police complaints were lodged in the state between May 2 and June 20. They included 29 complaints related to murder, 12 to rape and sexual assault, and 940 to loot and arson. It added out of the 9,304 people named as accused, less than 3% are currently in jail. “The situation in the state of West Bengal is a manifestation of the law of ruler, instead of rule of law...This was retributive violence by supporters of the ruling party against supporters of the main opposition party.”Banerjee dismissed the report last week, calling it misleading with distorted facts. “How many commissions and central agencies did the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) send to (BJP-ruled) Uttar Pradesh?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-failed-to-properly-probe-post-poll-violence-complaints-calcutta-hc-101626945764988.html

22-07-2021||India||Over 4 million ineligible people got PM-KISAN cash: Govt in Parliament||Nearly 4.2 million people not eligible for pay-outs under PM-KISAN, the Modi government’s cash-transfer scheme for farmers, received ₹2,900 crore in all since the scheme’s roll-out and steps will be taken to recover the amounts, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has stated in a Parliament reply. According to data cited in Tomar’s reply to an “unstarred” question in Lok Sabha, the Lower House, most states had ineligible beneficiaries. The largest numbers were in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Bihar. An unstarred question is one in which a written answer is provided. Under PM-KISAN, the government provides income support of ₹,6000 a year to every land-owning farmer with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of ₹2,000 -- once every four months. The scheme was launched on February 24, 2019. In the last instalment paid in May this year, the government disbursed over Rs19,000 crore to 90 million farm households. So far, the Union government has paid nearly ₹1.15 lakh crore. According to the scheme’s guidelines, the responsibility of identifying beneficiaries for PM-KISAN lies with the states. On May 21, 2020, HT had first reported that the Union agriculture ministry had asked the Assam government for a report and a probe into a potential fraud in PM-KISAN, which allowed non-farmers to get cash in the state. This prompted the state to temporarily halt payments. According to figures provided by Tomar in his written reply on July 20, the number of illegal beneficiaries in Assam stood at 83,5268, the highest in any state, accounting for about a fifth of total ineligible beneficiaries. Also Read | Kharif sowing so far lags last year’s by 11%Tamil Nadu, a state known for efficient bureaucracy, figures next with 72,2271 fraudulent beneficiaries. In Chhattisgarh, 58,289 ineligible people got cash benefits, the third-highest. In Punjab, the number of ineligible people was 56,2256, followed by Bihar with 52,178 illegal beneficiaries. “States have been asked to initiate criminal proceedings against people who fraudulently got into the system and to recover amounts disbursed to them,” an official with knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity. The amounts to be recovered from ineligible beneficiaries in some states run into hundreds of crores. Assam needs to recover ₹554 crore, while Uttar Pradesh must get back ₹258 crore (the state had 26,5321 ineligible beneficiaries). Bihar has to recover ₹425 crore, while Punjab needs to recover ₹437 crore. In India, the well-off or ineligible people often receive benefits they are not entitled to. According to the government’s Economic Survey 2015-16, the rich get “implicit” subsidies worth ₹1 lack crore, pointing to the need for better targeting of anti-poverty schemes. Under PM-KISAN, a beneficiary has to be “a farmer family comprising husband, wife and minor children who own cultivable land as per land records”. Non-farmers are automatically excluded. The exclusion guidelines say people who pay income tax or receive pension which is ₹10,000 or more after retiring from government service, former and current ministers, professionals and institutional land-owners are not eligible for the scheme. Aside from updated land-holding records, most states require farmers to provide at least four sets of other verified documents to be eligible for PM-KISAN handouts: the 12-digit biometric Aadhaar, phone number, bank details and with know-your-customer proof. These data points are “triangulated” (or cross-matched) through software designed into the public financial management system (PFMS), the platform that enables automatic transfer of cash into bank accounts. The PMFS platform is the backbone of direct benefit transfers. Despite this, over 4 million eligible people received nearly ₹2,900 crore cash under PM-KISAN. “But it is also because of multiple checks through advanced software and validation of beneficiaries through automated systems that these ineligible people got caught. Full details of such people are available and states will have to proceed against them as per law,” the official cited above said.

Farmers can also self-register through the PM-KISAN portal and common service centres, a network of public-services offices spread across the country. “The structure of the Scheme inherently comprises of (sic) mechanism for exclusion of errors on the basis of continuous verification and validation of data of beneficiaries by various authorities like Aadhaar/PFMS/Income Tax database. After successful verification and validation of data, the benefits are transferred to intended beneficiaries,” the minister’s reply stated Ineligible people can pose to be eligible farmers by forging documents, or with connivance of local-level officials and through concealment of income, the official cited above said. In Assam, it appeared that people who got counted in “include pensioners, non-farmers, income-tax payers” and that “names of more than one person from each family” are on the list, the HT’s report of May 21, 2020 had quoted Guwahati-based farm expert Pushpadhar Das as saying. The scheme’s central guidelines require authorities to undertake physical verification of beneficiaries too. A video-conference between federal and state officials is held every Tuesday to continuously monitor the scheme, according to Tomar. “The amounts withdrawn by ineligible are public money. Since the Centre entirely funds PM-KISAN, it should also take responsibility for this. States must punish conniving local officials,” said KS Mani, an agricultural economist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-4-million-ineligible-people-got-pm-kisan-cash-govt-in-parliament-101626943424601.html

They will then educate the staffers on how to keep the railway stations and trains safe for users of railway services from nuisance mongers and thefts.“The 'happy to help’ cards will be given to the passengers with contact numbers of the police officials in the area. This initiative will be spread all over the state in a phased manner”, Rao was quoted as saying by the portal. The passengers or railway users who are harassed by criminal elements can call or send a WhatsApp message to reach the police officials and can ask for their help.Police officials in Bengaluru Central, Yeshwanthpur, Cantonment, Bangarpete, Mandya, Hassan, and Arsikere have already printed their visiting cards and they will soon be distributed among the railway users. As many as 18 major railway stations will see this activity being implemented in the next few days, Rao said.According to the statistics of the police department, the crime rates in railway stations and coaches have come down substantially in the last three years.

These houses were associated with the operation of hotshots, the now-deleted streaming application. Reports said Mumbai police recovered 70 videos which were shot by Kundra's former personal assistant Umesh Kamat with the help of different production houses. The police team has also found 90 videos which were exclusively meant for the Hotshots app. Now, these smaller production houses will also come under the scanner.WhatsApp chats reveal Raj Kundra had plan B, lawyer says content not porn | 10 updatesThe complaint against Raj Kundra is not only making pornographic films in India, which is illegal under several provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the IT rules but also to lure people to feature in porn movies promising them roles in web series. Kundra's lawyer Abad Ponda, however, said the content of the app was vulgar, but not pornographic. Several other Bollywood personalities have claimed so.Raj Kundra is in police custody till July 23, but he has not revealed much during the questioning. Reports said Mumbai Police have written to various banks seeking details of the bank account of Kundra.After raiding his house and office, Police have found the server which will be sent for forensic analysis to confirm whether the content for the app was uploaded using the server.Mumbai Police have launched the probe into the case in February and after several arrests reached Raj Kundra. A report claimed Raj Kundra avoided arrest since February by bribing the Crime Branch officers.Raj Kundra has been running this business for two years though his Hotshots app was sold to a UK firm apparently to escape investigation in India. Police have revealed that the UK firm is owned by Kundra's brother-in-law and though the official ownership was transferred, Kundra used to manage the operations. Police have also revealed that Raj Kundra was planning to close Hotshots altogether and start a new streaming app. Kundra had also planned to take down some of the content from Hotshots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-recover-70-porn-videos-made-on-raj-kundra-s-order-reports-101626942352624.html

The police on Wednesday rescued the members of the family, which confined itself to a tent house for nearly 15 months in the state’s Kadali village due to fears of getting infected by Covid-19, news agency ANI reported on Thursday.“The family of Chuttugalla Benny, his wife, and two children, have been residing here. They were afraid of Corona and locked themselves in the house for almost the past 15 months. They confined themselves to the house and locked it from inside,” Kadali village’s sarpanch Choppala Gurunath told ANI.The issue came into light when a village volunteer visited the tent house to get the thumb impression of the family members for allowing a housing plot for them under a government scheme. Upon refusal of the family members to come out, the volunteer apprised village sarpanch and others about the situation.“Their matter came to light when our village volunteer went to their house to get their thumb impression as they were allotted a housing site. When he called them, they refused to come out by saying that they would die if they came out. The volunteer had informed us of the matter, and we rushed to this place,” village sarpanch Gurunath said, adding the family was immediately rushed to a government hospital with the help of police and villagers and is currently under treatment.Gurunath pointed out the family members even attended the nature calls (feeling the need to urinate or defecate) inside their tent house. They (family) would have died if they continued to stay inside for two or three more days.Andhra Pradesh has so far logged 1,946,749 cases and 13,197 deaths due to the Covid-19 disease. On Wednesday, the state reported 2,527 new cases, 2,412 recoveries and 19 deaths.

He said the project was discussed on Tuesday at the state Cabinet meeting. “...everyone agreed that 1,995 square kilometre area is to be dedicated for elephants under this project,” Baghel said on Wednesday.On July 3, a letter by the state forest department said ruling Congress lawmakers including minister TS Singh Deo want the area of the reserve to be reduced by one fourth. Deo said his name was wrongly included in the letter and added he never proposed to reduce the size.Chhattisgarh has been considering the extension of the reserve. Activists want the entire catchment area of the Hasdeo River to be included in the reserve. The previous Bharatiya Janata Party government proposed the reserve in 2005 spread over 450 square kilometres. The proposal was approved in 2007 but the project never took off.Baghel revived the plan and in 2020 sought to expand the proposed reserve to 1,995 square kilometres.Sudeip Shrivastava, an environmental lawyer, said the 1995 square kilometre area has been proposed to keep most of the Hasdeo Arand coal blocks out of its boundary. “Obviously, the coal blocks like Parsa, Kete Extension, Gidhmuri and Paturia Dand are out of the reserve. The main catchment of Hasdeo Bango Dam is at a huge risk and mining interest has prevailed over that of farmers and tribals,” said Shrivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/area-of-proposed-elephant-reserve-will-not-be-reduced-chhattisgarh-cm-baghel-101626935864128.html

Refuting such allegations, the government said that the guidelines laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in this regard are being followed and that the Union health ministry has always advised states to conduct death audits in their hospitals to report any cases of death that may have been missed."Given the robust and statute-based death registration system in India, while some cases could go undetected as per the principles of infectious disease and its management, missing out on the deaths is unlikely," the government said in an official press release. "This could also be seen in the case fatality rate, which, as of 31st December 2020, stood at 1.45% and even after an unexpected surge observed in the second wave in April-May 2021, the case fatality rate today stands at 1.34%."Highlighting the recent media reports alleging that India’s toll of excess deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic could be in millions, the government said that US and European countries’ age-specific infection fatality rates have been used to calculate excess deaths in India based on the seropositivity."The extrapolation of deaths has been done on an audacious assumption that the likelihood of any given infected person dying is the same across countries, dismissing the interplay between various direct and indirect factors such as race, ethnicity, the genomic constitution of a population, previous exposure levels to other diseases and the associated immunity developed in that population," the press release detailed, elaborating on the issues with these reports which quoted findings from recent studies.The seroprevalence studies, the government explained, also have another potential concern that the antibody titers may diminish over time, leading to underestimation of true prevalence and the corresponding overestimation of infection fatality rate.Moreover, these reports assume that all the excess mortality figures are Covid-19 deaths, which is incorrect. "Excess mortality is a term used to describe an all-cause mortality figure and attributing these deaths to Covid-19 is completely misleading," the release stated.Further explaining the method of reporting Covid-19 deaths in India, the central government said that the process follows a "bottom-up" approach, as opposed to a top-down system. Districts report the number of cases and deaths to the state governments and to the Union ministry on a continuous basis, the press release detailed, adding that the entire system is run according to guidelines laid down by the ICMR since as early as May last year.These ICMR guidelines are, in turn, issued as per ICD-10 codes recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for monitoring.Notably, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya refuted allegations of the ministry hiding Covid-19 deaths, in his statement at the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The central government only compiles and publishes data sent by the state governments, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-robust-system-govt-refutes-claims-of-undercounting-covid-19-deaths-101626933017457.html

The day is celebrated because the Tricolour was adopted in its present form during the meeting of Constituent Assembly on July 22, 1947."Best wishes to countrymen on #FlagAdoptionDay. On this day in 1947, the Indian Tricolour was adopted as #nationalflag. Our national flag is a symbol of peace, and exhorts us to move forward on the path of sacrifice, prosperity and development," Vardhan said in his tweet posted in Hindi.समस्त देशवासियों को #FlagAdoptionDay की हार्दिक बधाई व शुभकामनाएं!1947 में आज ही के दिन भारतीय तिरंगे को #nationalflag के रूप में अंगीकार किया गया था।शांति का प्रतीक हमारा राष्ट्रीय ध्वज त्याग, बलिदान और समृद्धि व विकास के पथ पर सदैव अग्रसर रहने की प्रेरणा देता है।@PMOIndia pic.twitter.com/XFJBCo6gPrThe Tricolour adopted on July 22, 1947, served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950 and that of the Republic of India thereafter, according to goverment website.The national flag, which is hoisted on Republic Day and other important events, is a horizontal Tricolor of deep saffron at the top, white in the middle and dark green at the bottom in equal proportion. The government-prescribed ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to three.In the centre of the white band is a navy blue wheel which represents the chakra. Its design is that of the wheel which appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka (called the Dharma Chakra). Its diameter approximates to the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes.Each colour of the flag has a meaning. The saffron represents strength and courage, the white indicates peace and truth with the Dharma Chakra, and green shows fertility, growth and auspiciousness.According to government website, the first national flag is said to have been hoisted on August 7, 1906, in the Parsee Bagan Square (Green Park) in Kolkata. The flag was composed of three horizontal strips of red, yellow and green.On January 26, 2002, the Indian flag code was modified and after several years of Independence, the citizens of India were finally allowed to hoist the Indian flag over their homes, offices and factories on any day, and not just national days, as was the case earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flag-adoption-day-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-indian-tricolour-101626933405568.html

After the court allowed the hospital to go ahead with the process, in what has been seen as a significant decision, the hospital on Wednesday said it has successfully collected the sperm from the patient. The court asked the hospital to conduct the process as soon as possible and so within hours of receiving the order on Tuesday, the hospital authorities collected the patient's sperm."The patient's family decided to carry out the procedure. But we needed the consent of the individual on whom the process is to be carried out. Since he is critical and cannot give his consent, we could do so only if the court allowed," Anil Nambiar, zonal director of the hospital said.The man, as submitted by his wife in teh court, was admitted to the critical care unit in the hospital since May 10 and his condition has been worsening by every day. With acute Covid-19 symptoms, his lungs have stopped functioning properly and the man is on the verge of dying. He is also suffering from multi-organ failure. As the family approached the hospital for sperm collection, the hospital authorities said it needed a court order in absence of a written consent letter from the patient.The court heard the case and noted in the order that "interim relief is granted in an extraordinary urgent situation" and it "shall be subject to the outcome of the petition".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-of-critical-covid-patient-wants-to-bear-child-court-okays-sperm-collection-101626929033635.html

The report sparked a political storm on the first day of the monsoon session which saw the IT minister defend the government.Rejected the reports that suggested India used Pegasus to hack phones of journalists, activists, Opposition leaders, and ministers, Vaishnaw called them nothing but an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”.Also Read | Protesting farmers to launch agitation at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar from todayHe also said it is not a coincidence that the Pegasus report appeared a day before the commencement of the Parliament session. “A highly sensational story was published by a web portal last night. Many over-the-top allegations were made around this story. The press reports appeared a day before the monsoon session of Parliament. This can’t be a coincidence,” Vaishnaw said.He said even the publisher of the report has stated that they cannot say if the numbers in the published list were under surveillance. “Without subjecting a phone to this technical analysis, it is not possible to conclusively state whether it witnessed an attack attempt or was successfully compromised,” he quoted the report to say.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The government has denied any involvement.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, which is headed by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, will hold a meeting on July 28 to discuss the revelations made by the Pegasus Project, according to a notice uploaded on the Lok Sabha website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-row-it-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-to-speak-in-parliament-today-101626928963896.html

The judgement will be pronounced by a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao.The court has already heard submissions of the telecom companies, and asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file a detailed response on behalf of Department of Telecom (DoT) on the application filed by Vodafone Idea and Airtel.The court had in September last year granted telecom companies a period of 10 years to clear their pending AGR dues to the central government with 10% payment every year. The deadline given to the company for first installment was March 31, 2021.But the matter came back to the court after the telcos did not submit the amount disputing the calculation done by the DoT and claiming that they have already submitted more than 10% of the amount.Vodafone India's lawyer Mukul Rohatgi said that the company has complied with the undertaking to pay and deposited ₹7,854 crore. The companies together claimed that they have deposited ₹18,400 crore.The companies have also accused the DoT of making arithmetical errors in calculations regarding the AGR dues and want the court to direct the telecom department to consider their submissions.Major telcos, including Vodafone-Idea and Bharti Airtel, owe substantial amounts to the Department of Telecom (DoT).The total liability on Vodafone-Idea is ₹58,254 crore, while Bharti Airtel has to pay ₹43,980 crore.The apex court in its judgment delivered on October 24, 2019, had upheld the interpretation given to the definition of AGR by the DoT and included revenues from various heads for calculation of the dues while imposing a cumulative burden of over 1.69 lakh crore on 16 telcos.The court now has to decide on the amount to be paid by the companies and issues raised by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-deliver-judgement-on-telcos-plea-on-agr-calculation-101626925221987.html

However, angry villagers eventually traced them to a neighbouring village and brought them back to Chiliyavant on Tuesday morning. The accused tied the duo to a tree and thrashed them with sticks," the DySP said.The victim in her complaint has claimed that the accused were angry because a local tradition bars marriage of man and woman from the same village, it was stated.

22-07-2021||India||Retrospective: July 22, Chandrayaan-2 and India's lunar ambitions||India's outer space ambitions owe a significant debt to July 22, an important date for the history of the country's scientific and technological feats. It was on this date back in 2019 that Chandrayaan-2, India's second lunar exploration mission, was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) from the Satish Dhawan space centre at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.Chandrayaan-2 was launched with the aim of mapping the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as locating and studying the surface of the Moon for the presence of water. The mission consisted of an orbiter, a lander (Vikram), and a rover (Pragyan). Ahead of its launch, the Chandrayaan-2 mission generated significant public interest and media coverage since it came 11 long years after Chandrayaan-1, India's first ambitious lunar probe under the same programme.Also Read | ISRO successfully tests engine for its manned Gaganyaan missionChandrayaan-2, if it were to be successful in its stated ambitions, would have made India the fourth country after the Soviet Union, the United States, and China to achieve a soft landing on the surface of the Moon and the first country to do so on the lunar dark surface. However, the lander crashed on September 6 when it deviated from its intended trajectory due to a software glitch, according to a failure analysis report submitted by Isro.Nevertheless, the Chandrayaan-2 mission was not a complete failure. Even though the lunar lander did not arrive on the surface of the Moon as intended, the spacecraft's orbiter operations remain functional. In an official statement, Isro had said that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, with its eight scientific instruments, will continue its seven-year mission to study the surface of the Moon.Also Read | Chandrayaan instrument gives outstanding science results on solar coronaJuly 22 continues to hold immense significance in the history of India's cosmic feats, as the lessons learned from this operation gave a boost to a new lunar exploration mission being studied for launch this year. Chandrayaan-3, India's new proposal in partnership with Japan, does not include plans for another orbiter but is instead looking to re-attempt the landing and launch a rover on the Moon's surface. The Chandrayaan-3 mission is looking at a tentative launch timeline for the first half of 2022, according to the latest reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retrospective-july-22-chandrayaan-2-and-india-s-lunar-ambitions-101626918696961.html

22-07-2021||India||Fewer shots given, officials say ‘Eid holiday’ confusion to blame||The Covid vaccination drive in Delhi, which showed signs of picking up pace with an uptick in shots on Tuesday, saw fewer vaccinations on Wednesday. Officials attributed this to the Eid holiday, and to people not being aware that vaccination centres were functioning.A total of 63,265 vaccine doses were administered through 729 centres on Wednesday, in comparison to almost 72,000 doses administered on Tuesday. On Monday, only 25,985 doses were administered in Delhi.“The impact of Eid can be seen on the vaccination numbers. Most people may not have known that vaccination centres were running even on the public holiday. Some centres in hospitals, however, remained closed today,” said a senior official from southwest district.In the last two weeks, the number of shots administered daily crossed the 100,000 mark only twice, and has dipped as low as 10,000.The pace of vaccination has been erratic, with the Delhi government attributing it to a shortage of vaccine doses.“At the beginning of the month, we were unofficially informed that the pace of the vaccination will remain slow because of a lack of doses. We cannot operate all our vaccination sites every day because we are getting fewer doses than we can administer,” said another official from South district.The number of vaccines administered shot up in Delhi after the Centre revised the vaccine procurement policy on June 21, taking up the responsibility of procurement of doses for all states.With a fresh stock of 85,810 Covishield doses on Tuesday, Delhi currently has 108,300 Covishield doses and around 184,000 doses of Covaxin. Only 20% of the Covaxin stock is being utilised for first dose takers to prevent a shortage for those coming in for their second dose.“So far, we have completely immunised less than 10% of our eligible population in India. This is not enough to stop the transmission of the infection in the community and thereby protect those at risk of developing severe disease from death. At least 40-50% of the eligible population has to be completely immunised to achieve that,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-shots-given-officials-say-eid-holiday-confusion-to-blame-101626898492698.html

His remarks come a day after an investigative consortium reported on Tuesday that phone numbers linked to a former Karnataka deputy chief minister and associates of two former CMs were potentially targeted for surveillance using Israeli spyware in 2019, prompting the Congress to blame the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the collapse of the state government at the time. “It is a conspiracy involving foreign press where these kinds of misinformation campaigns have been done against India.

Now, the eyes are set on India,” he told the media.

We have to reclaim the nation from this autocratic behaviour. Hacking into people’s phones and private lives, using that information for politics, at taxpayers’ expense… these things don’t happen in democracies,” he wrote. The Congress party on Tuesday had demanded a probe headed by the Supreme court judge into the alleged phone tapping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-allegation-an-international-conspiracy-to-malign-india-bommai-101626896926841.html
22-07-2021||India||Pegasus allegations: Phone tapping claims not new to K’taka politics||A political row may have erupted in the state after the Congress on Tuesday accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre of snooping into phones of leaders in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government in 2019 which resulted in the toppling of the government, but snooping in Karnataka politics is not new. The accusations were made after, an online news portal, The Wire, on Tuesday reported that phone numbers of former Congress deputy CM G Parameshwara, and personal secretaries of former CMs HD Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah were selected in 2019 as possible targets of Pegasus spyware, manufactured by Israeli firm NSO group. “In latest revelations, it is categorically substantiated that the snooping (use of Pegasus software) has been used to topple a democratically elected government. The timing of the snooping indicates that their main intention (of using the software) was to topple the government. At the point of time itself we had complained that our phones were under surveillance,” said KC Venugopal, who was the General Secretary of AICC in-charge of Karnataka during 2019. The BJP denied these allegations. Karnataka home minister Basvaraj Bommai said that the allegations were part of an international conspiracy to defame India. However, phone tapping is not new in Karnataka’s politics. The CBI is currently probing into the alleged illegal tapping of phones of politicians, their aides, bureaucrats and other officials during the tenure of former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. These phone tapping allegations had come to light when three audiotapes of conversations between Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao and someone called Faraz was released to the media in November 2019. It is alleged that these conversations were released by ADGP Alok Kumar, who was replaced by Rao as the police commissioner. A preliminary investigation by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) found that more than 185 persons, including senior MLAs, aides of politicians and top bureaucrats were under surveillance. On 30 August 2019, this case was handed over to the CBI. Playing down the allegations of using Pegasus spyware, Kumaraswamy on Tuesday while speaking to the media said, “ “Even the Income Tax department taps the phones of important people. So, I am not very worried about all this. This is not a new thing.” “I have not done any wrong activities or compromised the security of either the state or the country. It is not required for us to take all this seriously. Several governments have misused their office, not just the BJP but even the Congress has done this before. This has been done for at least 15-20 years now,” Kumaraswamy had said. The investigation has not reached a conclusion so far. In January, this year, the Congress party had accused the BJP government of covering up a CBI report on alleged illegal phone tapping. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson M Lakshman on January 10 had said that the agency is ready with a detailed report and has approached the state government to give its consent to file a chargesheet, but the government has kept it pending for over a month. The CBI didn’t respond to emails sent by the Hindustan Times on the status of the investigation. In 2017, even Congress was accused of tapping the phone of the opposition leaders. Leaders of the Congress and the BJP in Karnataka have been engaged in a war of words over allegations of phone tapping. While BJP leaders have alleged that the Congress-led state government has been listening to their phone conversations, the Congress has levelled the same allegations on the ruling party at the Centre. While the political blame game has sparked a public debate, neither political party has provided any evidence to support their claims. Neither have they approached any authority, including the courts, demanding a probe. Even though these phone tapping cases have not made much political impact, for Ramakrishna Hedge, who was chief minister of the state between 1983 to 1988, phone tapping accusations cost him the chief minister’s post. In 1988, Hegde was heading the Janata Party government while Veerappa Moily was in the opposition. The Janata Party made allegations against Moily, claiming he had approached some Janata Party MLAs to join them. It was later revealed that this discovery was made based on phone tapping authorized by Hegde. The Congress party took up this issue and Subramanian Swamy, who was with the Janata Party, and later defected, accused Hedge of illegal phone tapping of 51 politicians in Karnataka. Even though Hegde denied the allegations, the issue came up in Parliament, with Union minister of communications Bir Bahadur Singh telling the house that indeed phones were tapped in Karnataka and provided evidence for the same. Following this, on August 10, 1988, Hegde tendered his resignation and was succeeded by his party colleague SR Bommai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-allegations-phone-tapping-claims-not-new-to-k-taka-politics-101626896861063.html
22-07-2021||India||‘Enough is enough’: NSO Group says it now won’t reply to media inquiries||The NSO Group, a private Israeli cybersecurity firm that sells the spyware Pegasus, on Wednesday said that it will probe “any credible proof of misuse of its technologies” but added that it will no longer respond to any media inquires on the reports that alleged that phones of prominent personalities in India and across the world were targeted for surveillance using its platform.Terming the reports a “planned and well-orchestrated media campaign led by Forbidden Stories and pushed by special interest groups,” the company said: “ Enough is enough!... Due to the complete disregard of the facts, NSO is announcing it will no longer be responding to media inquiries on this matter and it will not play along with the malicious and slanderous campaign.” An investigation by a consortium of media houses has alleged that phone hacking software Pegasus was used to target potentially thousands of people around the world, including Indian journalists, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, political strategist Prashant Kishor and former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa. The NSO Group, however, said in the official statement that the “list is not a list of targets or potential targets of Pegasus”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enough-is-enough-nso-group-says-it-now-won-t-reply-to-media-inquiries-101626896231408.html
22-07-2021||India||AASU, Ulfa leaders also on Pegasus list||Phone numbers of All Assam Students Union chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya and leader of the pro-talks faction of the banned United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa), Anup Chetia, apart from a Manipur writer were potentially targeted for surveillance in 2018-19 using Israeli firm NSO’s Pegasus software, an investigative consortium reported on Wednesday.Bhattacharya’s phone number was included as a possible target for hacking by the software less than a month before the Union ministry of home affairs announced the reconstitution of a high-level committee to implement a clause of the Assam Accord on July 16, 2019, according to a report by online news portal The Wire, which is part of the 17-member media consortium.Bhattacharya, who was made a member in this committee, could not be reached for a comment. The agreement, signed by AASU and the central government in 1985, forms the basis for notifying March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date to grant citizenship in the state.Chetia said he wasn’t surprised that his name figured in this list. “As a former member of Ulfa, we once indulged in anti-India activities. So, I am not surprised that my name has come up in that list. I am sure my phones are being tracked all the time,” he said.The third person in the list, as reported by The Wire, has been identified as a Manipuri writer based in Delhi, Malem Ningthouja.Meanwhile, officials of companies linked to then global farm tech giant Monsanto were also selected as possible candidates for surveillance. The numbers of Mahyco Monsanto Biotech and Monsanto India officials were allegedly targeted in 2018, when the firms came under the scanner over alleged unauthorised sale of GM seeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aasu-ulfa-leaders-also-on-pegasus-list-101626896058999.html
22-07-2021||India||Raj Kundra planned to launch another app to circulate porn: Cops||Mumbai: Days after businessman and actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra was arrested, the Mumbai Police on Wednesday said that Kundra, his brother-in-law Pardeep Bakshi and their manager Umesh Kamat had plans to launch ‘Bollyfame’, a mobile application to circulate pornographic content from February 20 this year. However, the plan was dropped after Kamat’s arrest on February 7, police said. A crime branch officer said that according on the investigation so far, Kundra and his associates started working on a new app after Apple and Google stores removed some of the apps last year and Maharashtra cybercrime officers booked directors and owners of various over-the-top (OTT) platforms and websites for allegedly showing obscene content. The officer added that the accused even created a WhatsApp group in the name of the proposed application ‘Bollyfame’ and that Kundra had revealed his plans on the group to Kamat and others. As per Kamat’s statement to police, initially they wanted to launch the live streaming in January 2021, but it was postponed till February 20, the officer said. In his statement, Kamat also revealed that Kundra had told them that they would shut down the Hotshot app and remove the obscene contents to avoid the investigation, the officer added. The racket came to light after the property cell of the Mumbai police registered a case on February 4 based on the inputs about filming of porn at a bungalow in Madh Island. The cell raided the bungalow and arrested five persons, including two women who were caught in compromising position. Police claimed to have rescued a young woman, who was allegedly lured by an offer to act in a short film. During the investigation, police also found the alleged involvement of actor and model Gehana Vashisht. Police arrested Kamat after Vashisht revealed that he bought adult contents from her and sent them to the United Kingdom for uploading on Hotshot. Kamat led the police to Kundra. On Tuesday, the property cell inspected Kundra’s office in Andheri and seized the server and several other electronic equipment. Police said they are now scrutinising evidence seized from Kundra’s office including subscription hits, WhatsApp chats, agreement papers, emails and account details. The crime branch has so far frozen various bank accounts with deposits worth around ₹7.5 crore, including ₹3 crore in a bank account of wanted accused Yash Thakur, a native of Madhya Pradesh, currently residing in Singapore. The officer said he was running the app Neuflik. Another police officer said the groups mainly targeted young women coming from outside to the city to try their luck in the film and television industry. Police officers said taking advantage of their desperation and helplessness, the accused allegedly lured them by offering roles in short films or web series. Initially, they would ask them to perform some “bold” scenes, but eventually either offer them more money to act in porn films or threaten them with the help of agreements, if they refused to budge. The officers said the gang has exploited many women and men by making several pornography contents. Kundra, along with one Sourabh Kushwah, according to the remand application, had in February 2019 started a company namely, Arms Prime Media Pvt Ltd. Around six months later, the company developed the mobile app Hotshot, and later sold it to Kenrin Ltd., a London-based entity owned by Kundra’s relative Pardeep Bakshi for $25,000. In December 2019, Kundra resigned from Arms Prime Media, after which, one Sanjay Tripathi, a witness in the case, took it over, police said. The mobile phone app, available only to paid subscribers, was used to upload pornographic content, shot in Mumbai and surrounding areas, police claimed. The remand application added that other accused and witnesses in the case have revealed that the pornographic films shot in Mumbai were transferred to Kenrin, London, from where the obscene content was uploaded on the Hotshot app. Kundra controlled the entire operation of the app through three WhatsApp groups that he had created in the name of “HS,” and that Kundra was the administrator of these WhatsApp groups. Police on Monday night arrested Kundra and one Ryan Thorpe, a Nerul resident and an expert in information technology, who allegedly helped maintain the mobile phone application through two of his associates. Both Kundra and Thorpe are in police custody till July 23 for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-kundra-planned-to-launch-another-app-to-circulate-porn-cops-101626896142635.html
22-07-2021||India||Experts say need to raise awareness on Fragile X syndrome||Fragile X syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disabilities such as autism, speech delays, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and can even lead to seizures in 25% of the patients, according to Fragile X society-India that is trying to raise awareness about the condition. The syndrome is caused by large mutations to the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene that makes a protein needed for normal brain development. It is estimated that nearly 200,000 to 400,000 children in India suffer from the condition, but most remain undiagnosed. In addition, people with smaller alterations to the gene are known as carriers or those with pre-mutation. A diagnosis can be made with a blood genetic testing. “This gene was discovered in the 1990s so it is a much recent finding as compared to other syndromes such as Down’s. There is a lot of research going on the syndrome as well as drugs to directly target the gene. But the early diagnosis is important so that the child and the parents start therapy to deal with the challenges. Also, it gives parents much needed information for planning a future child,” said Debashish Ghoshal, parent advocate at the organisation. The Fragile X Society was formed to support the families of those affected with the syndrome and launched its first clinic in Mumbai in 2013. The society calls for Fragile X syndrome screening in all children diagnosed with intellectual disability so that they may receive latest evidence-based treatments. The families must also receive genetic counselling so that they may plan their future children, the society states. There is no cure for the genetic disorder; however, treatment can help children learn important skills such as learning to walk, talk, and interact with others. In addition, medicine can be used to control certain behavioural problems. “Fragile X syndrome leads to delays in intellectual development, predominantly in boys. It can cause hyperactivity and autism. There is a lot of research going on but there is no cure for the disease. The message here is that families of children with autism must go to a genetic clinic and get them tested. There could be others in the family at risk. Also, if one child has fragile X syndrome, the second is also at risk of having it. So, a genetic test for it can be done at 2.5 months of pregnancy and if the second child also has the mutation, the pregnancy may be terminated,” said Dr Ratna Puri, head of genetics department at Sir Ganga Ram hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-say-need-to-raise-awareness-on-fragile-x-syndrome-101626895961507.html
22-07-2021||India||NCDC launches probe after first bird flu death reported in country||New Delhi: The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)’s surveillance unit in Haryana has launched an epidemiological investigation after an 11-year-old boy from Gurugram was reported as the country’s first documented case and death of bird flu (H5N1) in humans. According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, an NCDC team comprising epidemiologists and microbiologists was constituted and immediately visited the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, where the patient underwent treatment, and Gurugram for undertaking the epidemiological assessment. “NCDC received information on July 16 from AIIMS, Delhi, along with a lab report from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. The information was communicated to the IDSP State Surveillance Unit (SSU), Haryana to initiate an epidemiological investigation into the case. The matter was also reported to the animal husbandry department…The state health department and the animal husbandry department officials are also involved in the investigation,” the health ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The team of doctors and nurses, who treated the patient, is being monitored since July 16 for development of any influenza like illness, with no one being reported symptomatic till date. Contact tracing was undertaken and family members, close contacts and health care workers are under close surveillance. According to the health ministry, none of the close contacts have any related symptoms. Contact tracing, an active search for any symptomatic case, has been carried out in the hospital and the area where the patient resided. The state has been asked to carry out information, education, and communication activities for the general public, and to report any symptomatic case to the health authorities concerned. However, no symptomatic individuals were found in the area. The boy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in AIIMS, towards the end of June. He developed symptoms of fever, cough, coryza (inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose), and breathing difficulty, soon after induction therapy for AML. He was diagnosed as AML with febrile neutropenia (low white blood cells) with pneumonia and shock that progressed to cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The boy was then admitted to AIIMS on July 2, where he suffered from multi organ dysfunction and died on July 12. “Department of microbiology AIIMS received the Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for respiratory panel testing on 7 and 11 July 2021. The sample has tested Positive for both Influenza A and Influenza B. It was also negative for SARS COV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Subtyping for Influenza A remained inconclusive with available reagents for H1N1 and H3N2 at AIIMS. So, the samples were sent to NIV on 13 July,” said the statement. At NIV, both the samples were tested for Influenza A and Influenza B along with Influenza A seasonal (H1N1, H1N1 pdm09 and H3N2), non-seasonal avian subtypes (H5, H7, H9 and H10) by real-time PCR. The result showed that the sample is positive for A/H5 and Type B Victoria lineage. Whole genome sequencing and virus isolation is in process, the statement added. The animal husbandry department has also not found any suspected cases of bird flu in the area and has enhanced surveillance in a 10km zone as a precautionary measure. Further, epidemiological investigation by NCDC, involving animal husbandry department and State government surveillance unit, is underway and appropriate public health measures have been instituted, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncdc-launches-probe-after-first-bird-flu-death-reported-in-country-101626895960942.html

22-07-2021||India||CAA, NRC will not hurt Indian Muslims: Bhagwat in Assam||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday said the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) will not harm Indian Muslims and that a communal narrative was being peddled by some to gain political mileage.At an event in Guwahati, Bhagwat also said that there were organised attempts to increase the Muslim population since 1930 in Punjab, Sindh, Bengal, Assam to establish dominance and turn the country into Pakistan. He said this “plan” was somewhat successful with Partition, but failed to get Assam and other provinces in full.“After Independence, the first prime minister of the country said that minorities will be taken care of, and that has been done so far. We will continue to do so. No Muslim will face any loss due to CAA,” Bhagwat said at the launch of Gauhati University professor Nani Gopal Mahanta’s book on NRC and CAA.Bhagwat insisted the CAA and NRC are not against any Indian citizen. “The (1950) Nehru-Liaquat Pact clearly stated that each country would protect its minorities. India has been following it, Pakistan failed to do so.”The RSS chief said Indians always welcomed outsiders but designs by some to “impose their language, religion and food habits” had led to fears.“Since 1930, there have been organised attempts at increasing Muslim population in a planned manner. The design was to increase population in order to exercise their dominance and slowly turn this nation into Pakistan,” said Bhagwat.“This was true for Punjab, Sindh, Assam and Bengal. The plan worked to an extent as India got partitioned and Pakistan got created. But it didn’t happen entirely as planned and Assam didn’t go to Pakistan, though part of Bengal and Punjab got divided,” he added.The RSS leader, who is on his first visit to Assam after the BJP returned to power in the state in May, said the citizenship law is meant to provide protection to persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries seeking asylum in India.“We reach out to the majority communities, too, in these countries during a calamity.... So if there are some who wish to come to our country due to threats and fear, we will definitely have to help them out,” Bhagwat said.The contentious CAA, which was passed in Parliament in 2019, fast-tracks Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis who entered India on or before December 31, 2014, from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.The absence of Muslims in the list led to fears of exclusionary treatment; in Assam, where the traditional issue has been the influx of outsiders, there were concerns that the law could legitimise the claims of those from outside the state.“The provisions of CAA are meant for those who were persecuted in those countries and came to India for refuge. It is not for those who came to India without facing any persecution,” Bhagwat said.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was also present at the event, said the reasons behind the protests against the CAA in other parts of the country were completely different from the ones in Assam.“While the former sought inclusion of Muslims on the list of communities mentioned in the legislation (CAA), the protests in Assam were against the legislation itself,” Sarma said.Sarma said the government has a duty towards the persecuted people. “That is why I am a supporter of CAA and will remain one. But at the same time, we need to take measures to protect our Assamese identity and culture.” he said.Separately, in 2019, Assam, at the instruction and under the supervision of the Supreme Court compiled a registry of citizens, also a key charter of the Assam Accord. The result was a roster that excluded around 1.9 million of the nearly 33 million applicants from the NRC. The list was dubbed faulty by most people, citing exclusion of genuine citizens and inclusion of persons with doubtful identity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-nrc-will-not-hurt-indian-muslims-bhagwat-in-assam-101626895404753.html
22-07-2021||India||U’khand issued 5.3k more death certificates than last yr between Jan and Apr: RTI||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government issued a total of 23,324 death certificates between January and April this year, which was 5,343 more than the corresponding period last year, an RTI reply by the state health services department has revealed. Following this, opposition parties as well as social activists have accused the state government of covering up the true extent of the impact of Covid-19 in the state. The state saw 960 Covid-19 deaths from Feb 2 to April 30 as no health bulletin was issued by state in January in the first four months of the year. The right to information application was filed by the former state secretary of Samajwadi Party, Rakesh Barthwal, who had sought information about the death certificates issued in the state from April 2020 till June this year. The state health services department provided data for the whole of 2020, but for 2021, it could only provide data for the first four months, saying that data after April was yet to come. Of the 23,324 deaths, 13,807 were men and 9,517 women. In 2020, Uttarakhand had issued 62,219 death certificates of which 17,981 were issued from January to April. Of these, 10,520 were for men and 7,461 for women. This January, 5,986 death certificates were issued, followed by 5,424 in February and 5,572 in March. In April, during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of death certificates issued rose to 6,342, which was 2,751 more than the April 2020 figure of 3,591. The most number of death certificates this year were issued in Dehradun (5,659), followed by Haridwar (3,865) and US Nagar (3,337).To be sure, death certificates issued in a period do not necessarily have to correspond with the deaths in the same period. And governments around the country have worked at registering all deaths, something that could explain an organic increase in deaths. Still, the fact that there were a possible 4,383 excess deaths (5343 less 960, the deaths from Covid-19 in the first four months of the year) has been picked up by some. For instance, opposition Congress and social activists have questioned the authenticity of the number of Covid-19 deaths reported by the state government. Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni attacked the BJP-led state government, saying, “There is definitely something fishy in the Covid-19 death figures reported by the government. It is not allowing the actual death figures to come out.”She said that the death certificate numbers and the deaths due to Covid-19 don’t add up. “The number of death certificates issued and the total number of Covid-19 deaths reported have a huge difference. With the ongoing pandemic having its second wave peak in April, it is sure that most of the people whose deaths were registered had died of Covid-19. Then how come the reported Covid-19 deaths were so low?” Dasauni said.Prominent social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who has been closely monitoring the pandemic situation in state since its outbreak last year, expressed concern that the true extent of the damage wrought by the pandemic in the state may never be known. “First, it was the backlog Covid-19 deaths not reported by hospitals, and now this. It seems the people of Uttarakhand will never be able to get actual data, which is sad because we as residents of the state deserve much better from our elected representatives,” said Nautiyal, the founder of Gati Foundation, an NGO that fights pollution in Uttarakhand. The government has denied any connection between the death certificate numbers and Covid-19 deaths. “The death certificates are issued as per the rules and regulations on death of any person. It doesn’t mean that all died of Covid-19,” cabinet minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told the media on Tuesday.The Uttarakhand government was caught on the wrong foot recently over alleged fake Covid-19 tests that were carried out in the state during the Mahakumbh in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ukhand-issued-5-3k-more-death-certificates-than-last-yr-between-jan-and-apr-rti-101626894520879.html
22-07-2021||India||Opposition in sync on Rajya Sabha; Lok Sabha path still unclear||The Opposition parties have been able to find a collective script for their efforts to take on the government in the Upper House of Parliament, something they demonstrably lacked in the Lower House on the first two days of the ongoing monsoon session.On Tuesday, a few key Rajya Sabha Opposition leaders went into a huddle at 10 am to devise a strategy to balance their demands for a debate on the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and their protest over rising prices.The result: the Rajya Sabha didn’t work for three hours and then held a smooth debate on the pandemic during which Opposition leaders slammed the Centre and touted the achievements of states governed by their parties on that front.According to two senior Opposition leaders, the Upper House might again go back to protest mode on Thursday, but this will be decided after taking different parties on board.In the Lok Sabha, major Opposition parties have continued protests but without a joint strategy. “There has not been any single meeting of the Opposition parties in the Lok Sabha. No one knows what the other party plans to do,” said Sudip Bandopadhyay, House floor leader of the Trinamool Congress, the second largest Opposition party in Parliament.Congress leader Manish Tewari, a member of the party’s Parliamentary strategy group argued that the government has not offered any discussion on the latest snooping scandal or any other issue. “There is no problem of coordination of Opposition parties in the Lok Sabha. In the Rajya Sabha, the government offered a debate. In the Lok Sabha, they haven’t offered anything so far. So, all parties have launched protests which shows we are all on the same page.”The House records, however, show that parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi and other floor managers have repeatedly offered to discuss any issue on the floor of the House.Tewari also drew a line between the functioning of Rajya Sabha and that of the Lok Sabha. “They are two different houses. One is a council of states while the other one is a House of the people. Strategies can always be different for two Houses,” he said.The lack of coordination among Opposition parties has benefited the ruling dispensation on many occasions in the past. The government passed several bills, including the Triple Talaq bill, the law reorganising J&K as two union territories and the resolution to scrap Article 370 using this.Opposition leaders remained hopeful that a joint approach to issues would emerge with time. With issues such as the Pegasus snooping scandal, price rise, and the faltering economy on the radar of most parties, “a larger coordination is a matter of time, but it may involve a deft handling and require leaders who can rise above their regional considerations to look at the larger picture,” said a senior Opposition leader who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-in-sync-on-rs-ls-path-still-unclear-101626894460872.html
22-07-2021||India||States still say no deaths took place due to oxygen shortage||Officials and ministers in eight states, where reports said an estimated 320 Covid-19 patients may have died due to shortage of medical oxygen, on Wednesday denied the fatalities took place due to the crisis of supply that emerged during India’s second wave of cases.The Union health ministry told Parliament on Tuesday that none of the states had reported any deaths due to lack of oxygen, triggering criticism from multiple opposition leaders and prompting a rebuttal by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday.According to volunteer-driven data collation effort DataMeet, media reports from 20 states suggested there were at least 619 deaths due to oxygen shortage – many of these, however, were disputed with subsequent inquiries attributing the fatalities to other causes.But on Wednesday, officials and ministers in eight states were not willing to link fatalities with oxygen shortage alone, even as some of the leaders from their parties were accusing the Centre of hiding oxygen-linked deaths.In Maharashtra, where 58 deaths were reported, state health minister Rajesh Tope said no death happened due to oxygen shortage.“As far as Maharashtra is concerned, we have never said that any death due to oxygen shortage,” he told a TV channel on Wednesday. The state had, however, faced several short supplies in April and May, which at one point prompted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to request prime minister Narendra Modi to explore the possibility of pressing the Indian Air Force into duty to arrange for supplies. Maharashtra’s Sanjay Raut on Wednesday was one of the leaders who criticised the Centre over its stand in parliament on Tuesday.In Goa, 83 critically ill people succumbed to Covid-19 between May 10 and May 14. “We can’t put this as a direct answer. People who come to GMC, they are all referred cases because we are a tertiary (care) centre where criticality is high and most of the patients die because of Covid pneumonia where oxygen is a part of the treatment. So we cannot directly say this (disruption in the oxygen supply) is the reason why they have died,” said dean of Goa Medical College and Hospital, Dr Shivanand Bandekar said.During a hearing at the time the deaths took place, the Bombay high court at Goa had said: “We have long passed the stage of determining whether patients are suffering from the lack of oxygen or not. The material placed before us establishes that patients are indeed suffering and even in some cases succumbing for want of the supply of oxygen, in the State of Goa”. In court, the Goa government had admitted that “some casualties may have taken place” due to supply disruption.In Haryana, where 22 oxygen-related deaths purportedly took place, some inquiries were pending, at least one ruled out oxygen shortage as cause of deaths. But in one region – Hisar – a medical board established oxygen shortage as reason for deaths.In Madhya Pradesh, the medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said no one died due to oxygen shortage. “We received at least 10-12 complaints related to deaths due to oxygen supply disruption. Medical experts found the cause of death was other medical complications, not hypoxia,” he said. According to DataMeet figures, reports suggested 65 people died in different hospitals due to lack of oxygen.Similar stand was taken in several states, such as Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.“In fact, we have been praised for our supply of oxygen to other states,” said PK Mohapatra, Odisha’s additional chief secretary (health).Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said the state was able to manage its oxygen demand with cooperation from the Centre during the peak of the second wave pandemic and there were no deaths because of oxygen issues.“In West Bengal there has been no death due to lack of Oxygen support,” said a top official of the state health department. However, at least two families had raised allegations of lack of oxygen after their patients died at a hospital in Uluberia.Tamil Nadu’s health secretary J Radhakrishnan said there were no direct deaths in Tamil Nadu due to the lack of oxygen even though 13 patients died at the government hospital in Chengelpet district in first week of May when oxygen supply was disrupted overnight.Health activist Amulya Nidhi from Madhya Pradesh said volunteer groups have case studies to show deaths because of oxygen shortage but the government was not ready to face facts. “If they are so sure about it, they should allow an independent team of experts to probe the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-still-say-no-deaths-took-place-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101626894401439.html
22-07-2021||India||Scindia forms key panels to revive the aviation sector||Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, in his first order of business to revive the pandemic-hit aviation sector, formed three key advisory groups on Wednesday. These comprise government officials , industry leaders and other stakeholders who represent a wide array of operations: from airport operators to ground handling units, and from flight training schools to maintenance, repair and overhaul companies.The advisory group on airports headed by Scindia will include the aviation ministry’s secretary and joint secretary; director general of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security; chairman of the Airports Authority of lndia; G B S Raju, chairman of the GMR Group; Jeet Adani, vice president of the Adani Group; and Hari K Marar, MD and CEO, Bengaluru International Airport Limited.Adani and GMR operate airports.The order lays down the mandate for this advisory group: to advise the government on enhancing airport capacity and infrastructure for greater customer satisfaction and better international benchmark ratings. The group will also advise the government on tariffs and other regulatory issues, manpower training, and performance.Another group to deal with issues related to domestic airlines has also been formed and will be headed by General V K Singh (retd), minister of state for civil aviation; the aviation ministry’s secretary; the director general of Civil Aviation; Rajiv Bansal, CMD, Air India; Rahul Bhatia, chairman, Indigo Airlines; Ajay Singh, chairman, SpiceJet; Ness Wadia, director, Go Air; Bhaskar Bhat, chairman, Air Vistara; and Sunil Bhaskaran, CEO, Air Asia and the incoming CEO of Alliance Air Vineet Sood.“The Joint Secretary of DG Division will act as Convener. The Joint Secretary of DT Division will support the Group on the issues related to domestic transport,” the order reads.The joint secretary of DG Division is joint secretary of DGCA and DT stands for Domestic Traffic.The advisory group on airlines will advise the government on ways to enhance domestic and international connectivity, and on matters related to the promotion of passenger and cargo services, passenger facilities during air travel, and manpower training in the aviation sector. It will also suggest ways to safeguard the viability of airlines.The aviation sector was roiled by the pandemic with restrictions on flight operations for some part of last year, and a general reluctance to travel among the public evan with the easing of restrictions, although recent months have seen an increase in passenger traffic. The Indian aviation sector is estimated to have suffered losses worth around $ 8 billion in two years as a direct impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to aviation consultancy and research firm CAPA.“The groups shall meet regularly to deliberate upon issues and resolve challenges facing each sector. Orders have been issued for the same,” the aviation ministry said on Twitter.Airlines have been seeking government stimuli since last year to tide over losses. The aviation industry has also demanded lowering of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) taxes for years. It has sought the inclusion of ATF under the Goods and Services Tax regime as tax uniformity would lead to cost reduction.According to CAPA, airlines in India are estimated to post a consolidated loss of $4.1 billion this fiscal, similar to what they are estimated to have incurred in 2020-21, CAPA noted in a report released last month. Full-service airline Air India and low-cost airline IndiGo are expected to account for $ 4.5 billion of the combined around $ 8 billion of losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scindia-forms-key-panels-to-revive-the-aviation-sector-101626894400818.html
22-07-2021||India||Centre must give a categorical response to Pegasus row: Justice B N Srikrishna||Retired Supreme Court judge Justice B N Srikrishna, who authored the first draft of the data protection bill in 2018, says the Narendra Modi government should probe the alleged phone hacking of ministers, politicians, activists and journalists, and also explicitly state if any of its agencies uses Israeli military-grade spyware Pegasus.Justice Srikrishna, who was appointed by this government to identify and address issues in data protection in India in 2017, described the response of the government, which has thus far denied its involvement in any illegal surveillance as “unsatisfactory”.“Even the French government has ordered an inquiry so we need to do that too,” said Justice Srikrishna. “I am not at all satisfied with the government’s response. They need to give a categorical answer about who’s behind the hacking.”As unearthed by a collaborative investigation involving 17 media organisations, and reported by The Wire, which is one of the 17, the phone numbers of Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Patel, opposition leaders Rahul Gandhi and Abhishek Banerjee, activists, and 38 journalists, including three from HT and one from its sister publication Mint, were potential targets of spyware.While NSO Group, the Israeli firm that makes Pegasus, has maintained that only governments are its clients, India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has called the investigation an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”.Home minister Amit Shah has questioned the timing of the revelations that came out just a day before the start of the monsoon session of Parliament. “Aap chronology samajhiye! (Understand the chronology) This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress,” he had said.“It has nothing to do with timing. That is irrelevant,” said Justice Srikrishna. “An important question is being asked in Parliament and they (government) should answer it. That is how democracy is strengthened. They should give an open answer so that such issues are frankly dealt with.”Opposition parties, especially the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Congress have refused to let Parliament function until the government allows a discussion on the matter. TMC MPs staged a dharna on Tuesday asking Shah for a clarification after one of the reports revealed how TMC national general secretary and MP Abhishek Banerjee’s phone was on the list too along with that of their election advisor Prashant Kishor.A consortium of 17 media organisations, including The Guardian, The Washington Post and India’s The Wire, had said a phone hacking software known as Pegasus was used to target potentially thousands of people around the world. The investigation was based on a data leak of around 50,000 numbers obtained by Amnesty International and Paris-based Forbidden Stories, a non-profit. To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. Amnesty International subsequently forensically investigated 67 of these phones, and found 23 hacked and 14 showing signs of attempted penetration.The Congress has also demanded answers after reports revealed how phone numbers linked to Karnataka’s former deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, and aides of former chief ministers H D Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah were also on the surveillance list in 2019 when the JDS-Congress government collapsed.The prosecutor’s office in France has confirmed instituting a probe into the hacking after the investigation revealed that Morocco allegedly put the number of French president Emmanuel Macron on the surveillance list.“You can’t throw mud at people with allegations. You have to just give clear answers — did anyone in the government buy this software? And second, have they been using it for monitoring people?” Justice Srikrishna said.Pegasus makes it possible for those using the software to intercept all communications on their targets’ device, including stored files as well as messages. The malware also allows for the device’s microphone and camera to be turned on, and its location logs accessed.A spokesperson for the National Cyber Security Coordinator’s office said neither it nor the Computer Emergency Response Team or CERT-IN has the mandate to probe the alleged hacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-must-give-a-categorical-response-to-pegasus-row-justice-b-n-srikrishna-101626893868110.html
22-07-2021||India||High turnout of MLAs as Sidhu rallies support||Newly appointed Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu met several lawmakers, ministers and leaders on Wednesday, in a significant show of strength by the cricketer-turned-politician who is locked in a bitter conflict with chief minister Amarinder Singh over control of the party.The leaders, including four cabinet ministers, Sidhu’s predecessor Sunil Jakhar, and other senior functionaries, gathered at Sidhu’s residence in Amritsar, before travelling to the Golden Temple and other shrines. Visuals showed large crowds with no masks or distancing at the Sikh holy shrine, with Sidhu surrounded by other leaders.They paid obeisance at the Golden Temple and Akal Takht amid a heavy rush of devotees. The leaders also offered prayers at two prominent local Hindu shrines, Durgiana Temple and Ram Tirath Temple.Sidhu’s camp claimed that at least 62 of the Congress’s 80 MLAs attended the visit but state intelligence agencies put the number closer to 42. The state goes to the polls in early 2022.Sidhu avoided the media but minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said, “We have not counted how many MLAs have turned up today, nor was it a show of strength. All have come to pay obeisance at Sri Darbar Sahib which is not a place of holding such show.”The development came a day after Singh’s aides said the chief minister won’t meet Sidhu until the latter apologised for his public attacks during the past month. On Wednesday, Sidhu’s associates made it clear that the former minister wasn’t going to budge.“After all he is president of the Pradesh Congress now. Apology for what? People are with Sidhu,” said Ghanaur MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur.Three former Aam Aadmi Party legislators who joined the Congress in Singh’s presence last month, and four newly appointed working presidents -- Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Kuljit Singh Nagra, Pawan Goel and Sangat Singh Gilzian – also attended the event.Sidhu was named the state unit chief on Sunday as part of a revamp plan that involved appointing four working presidents from different communities, overriding strong objections by Singh and his loyalists.An upset Singh has not publicly commented on the appointment nor met Sidhu since, indicating that the acrimonious factionalism that roiled the party since May remains unresolved.The Amritsar East MLA will formally take over on Friday in a low-key ceremony attended by Congress general secretary Harish Rawat, who was also part of the three-member central panel tasked with tamping down tensions.Singh has not been formally invited for the event, said a person aware of developments. “It’s an important event and it is the duty of every Congressman to attend it. In the past too, invitations were never sent to anyone in the party for such an event,” said cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who was once a Singh loyalist but now supports Sidhu.Tensions between 79-year-old Singh and Sidhu, who quit the state cabinet after the CM changed his portfolio in 2019, have simmered since then but flared up in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu quickly rallied support as leaders opposed to Singh coalesced around him and publicly accused the CM of enabling corruption, prompting the Congress to set up the three-member panel. The panel met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on June 10.On Sunday, Sidhu got the coveted post of state unit chief, a position that bestows significant powers to him in an election year. But there has been no public rapprochement between the two warring factions with experts saying the infighting can bruise the Congress in the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-turnout-of-mlas-as-sidhu-rallies-support-101626893321340.html
22-07-2021||India||Non-local spouses of J&K women get domicile status||The Jammu & Kashmir government has decided to issue domicile certificates to the husbands of local women married to people from outside the state, in a significant move that will allow them to buy land or property in the Union territory, or apply for government jobs.The certificates will be issued by district officials on producing proof of marriage.Commissioner secretary to J&K government, Manoj Kumar Dwivedi, issued an order dated July 20 in which he specified that rules that make spouse of domicile certificate holder eligible for getting the certificate.“In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, read with section 15 of the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services Act 2010, the government hereby directs in sub-rule (1) of rule 5 of the Jammu and Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate Rules 220, after S.No/Clause 6, the following shall be added,” the order read.Women married to residents of the UT are automatically granted domicile status.After Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was revoked and the region split into two Union territories in August last year, the government in May notified Jammu and Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate (Procedure) Rules, 2020, which specify the conditions and the process to obtain the documents required for applying to jobs and avail other privileges restricted to residents.All people who have resided in the UT for 15 years, or have studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 or 12 examination in an educational institution in the region, and their children, are eligible for grant of domicile status.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) welcomed the decision on Wednesday. “It’s a welcome step and our party’s stand was clear on this,” BJP’s J&K unit spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the order is debatable. “Merits of the impact of individual orders may be debatable, but the bottom line remains who is doing it and how,” said party spokesperson Suhail Bukhari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nonlocal-spouses-of-j-k-women-get-domicile-status-101626893320805.html
22-07-2021||India||Centre, states row over O2 deaths in 2nd wave||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and several Opposition parties were locked in a war of words over how many people in India died due to lack of oxygen supplies while battling Covid-19, a day after the Union government told Parliament that no state reported such fatalities.The submission to Parliament brought back focus on a crisis that in part defined the devastation of the second wave, but with little accountability being fixed since. A database of media reports from the time has identified at least 619 deaths that likely occurred because of lack of oxygen, while many more may have taken place outside of inundated hospitals. Still, with most states unwilling, even on Wednesday, to accept that there were deaths on account of oxygen supplies, the Union government’s submission, while insensitive, could well be technically correct. The BJP accused the states of playing politics, and pointed to submissions by some of them to reaffirm that the central government was merely reporting data that states sent to it. “The Centre says that health is a state subject. It says that it just collects the data, it doesn’t generate it. None of them said that a death occurred in their state and Union territory due to shortage of oxygen, there is no data for that. Did the Centre generate this data? No,” said Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson.Patra in particular pointed to the Congress, the Shiv Sena and the Aam Aadmi Party to accuse the rivals of “playing politics”. “Rahul Gandhi is part of a coalition in Maharashtra and Sanjay Raut said he is shocked. The Maharashtra high court was given an affidavit by the state government where it stated that no death took place due to oxygen shortage,” he said.“On April 23 and 24, Arvind Kejriwal said 21 people died in Jaipur Golden Hospital due to oxygen shortage. He did a press conference and politicised it. This matter went to the high court. The Delhi government formed a committee and a report was submitted — it said patients got oxygen and no there was no mention of a shortage,” he said. Patra’s comments appeared to be targeted at a tweet by Gandhi on Tuesday afternoon, in which the Congress leader said: “The shortage wasn’t only of oxygen; it was also of empathy and facts. The shortage was there then, and it’s there now.”On Wednesday, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra, said people whose relatives died due to oxygen shortage should “take the Union government to court”. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, too, attacked the Centre, saying it was “completely false” to say no one died for want of oxygen. “If no deaths occurred due to oxygen shortage, why did hospitals move high court one after another every day? Hospitals had been saying that oxygen shortage led to deaths. The media, too, flagged this issue daily,” Jain told reporters.The AAP leader said the Delhi government set up a committee to collect data on such deaths and give ₹5 lakh compensation to the families of the deceased, “but the Centre got the panel disbanded through the lieutenant governor”. A day earlier, his cabinet colleague and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accused the Centre of a cover-up following its submission in Parliament. Neither Jain nor Sisodia put a number to deaths in Delhi on account of lack of oxygen. As the controversy raged, officials in eight states – Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh – told HT that there were no deaths due to oxygen shortage in their hospitals. Experts said the controversy was “unnecessary and unfortunate”. “The answers to parliamentary questions are compiled by respective ministries depending on inputs from various states and institutions, which means none of the states actually accepted that there were deaths due to oxygen shortage. The minister, however, could have just said that this is the official record and unofficially, there have been reports of deaths but there was no data,” said Dr MC Misra, former director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Such data is also challenging to collect, Misra added. “Of course, there was shortage of oxygen. This might have led to deaths even before people reached hospitals. There is no way of collecting that data. Then, there were deaths reported in hospitals but even then it is difficult to say whether the people, who were already critical, died because of oxygen shortage. You see, the shortage doesn’t lead to ventilators stopping to work suddenly, but the pressure goes down. In such a situation you can never be 100% certain and hence it is unlikely to be mentioned in a patient’s case sheets,” he said.At least some of the states that issued a denial on Wednesday had registered high profile incidents, some of which ended up in courts. In Goa, for instance, 83 people are reported to have died between May 11 and May 15 when the Goa Medical College & Hospital was running short on supplies. The Goa government admitted issues with supply during submissions to the Bombay high court at the time, which described the situation as grim. When asked to confirm if the deaths were due to the shortage on Wednesday, Goa Medical College & Hospital dean, Dr Shivanand Bandekar said: “We can’t put this as a direct answer. People who come to GMC, they are all referred cases because we are a tertiary (care) centre where criticality is high and most of the patients die because of Covid pneumonia where oxygen is a part of the treatment. So we cannot directly say this (disruption in the oxygen supply) is the reason why they have died.”In Maharashtra, Raut’s colleague and health minister Rajesh Tope told a TV channel on Wednesday: “We never said people died due to oxygen shortage in the state. Many of them had issues like co-morbidities and other illnesses. No death has taken place due to the shortage of oxygen.” In Nashik, at least 24 Covid-19 patients on life support died after oxygen supply was disrupted following an aborted refilling attempt. The hospital’s liquid oxygen tank developed a leak while being refilled, delaying the process and reportedly disrupting supplies to patients, officials had said at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-states-row-over-o2-deaths-in-2nd-wave-101626893260710.html
22-07-2021||India||BJP is turning country into ‘surveillance state’: Mamata||Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee, who has been under attack from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over post-poll violence in West Bengal, mounted her counter-offensive on Wednesday, accusing the BJP-led central government of turning the country into a “surveillance state” and appealing to regional parties to come together to form an opposition front to defeat the BJP in 2024 general elections.Banerjee also asked the Supreme Court to take cognisance of allegations that the central government could have used Israeli spyware Pegasus to target prominent politicians, journalists, constitutional authorities and even sitting ministers.“Pegasus is bigger than Watergate,” she said, referring to the Watergate scandal that led to US President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974.“I definitely know that my phone was tapped… Only the judiciary can save democracy. Oust spying and save the nation,” Banerjee said in an hour-long virtual address on the TMC’s martyrs’ day, the party’s annual event in memory of 13 party workers killed in police firing on a protest she led as a Youth Congress leader in Kolkata on July 21, 1993. She founded the TMC five years later, in 1998.Over the years, the martyr’s day rally has emerged as a platform from which Banerjee sends out messages and declares future plans. She appeared to have stuck to this format on Wednesday as she issued a public appeal to opposition parties across the country to start working together for the national elections right away and promised free ration across the country if the alliance wins.Mamata Banerjee also suggested that she wasn’t looking for a key role for herself.“I am a worker. I will follow you and your instructions. Chairs do not last forever but love of the people lives on,” she said, a remark seen as her counter to critics who believe that she sees herself as a potential prime ministerial candidate.Like last year, Mamata Banerjee addressed people virtually due to the Covid pandemic but for the first time, giant screens were installed in public places and TMC offices not only in West Bengal but also in states such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Tripura.Trinamool leaders have been speaking about plans to expand the party’s footprint to states outside Bengal after her party’s spectacular victory against the BJP in the Bengal assembly elections.Banerjee also made the effort to reach out to her potential audience outside Bengal and didn’t just speak in Bengali but English and Hindi as well.In Delhi, leaders of several opposition parties assembled at the constitution club in the heart of the city to listen to her speech. Among those present were former finance minister P Chidambaram and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar.“I don’t know what will happen in 2024 but we have to start our planning now… We will not be defeated. I am confident we will win,” she said.“Only two and a half years are left until the elections. Let us form an alliance and show the path to the nation,” Banerjee said to her potential allies.Banerjee said her party will invite regional leaders to a rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade grounds after the pandemic. For now, Banerjee said, she will be in Delhi on July 27 to 29 and asked Sharad Pawar to convene a meeting. “Mr Prime Minister please don’t disturb us,” she added quickly, a swipe at the Centre over the snooping row.“I cannot call up Sharad Pawar ji, P Chidambaram, the Delhi chief minister or the Odisha chief minister because my phone is tapped. See I have put a plaster on the camera of my phone. Instead of a democratic state you (BJP) want to have a surveillance state,” Banerjee said, holding up her phone which had a brown tape over the lens.“Before the assembly polls, I was in a meeting with our party leaders. My phone was there. They recorded everything,” she said.“Modi ji I am not criticising you as a person but you and Amit Shah ji have only come up with dark laws. You only want violence and disturbance. India is the land of Swami Vivekananda, Nehru, A P J Abdul Kalam and Bhagat Singh. India needs development and integrity. But all we can see is despair and instability,” said Banerjee.The first response to Mamata Banerjee came from the Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh who spent the day at a protest at Rajghat in the national capital to remember the lives of BJP workers killed in Bengal since 2008.“Mamata Banerjee’s government uses Pegasus to snoop on people and opposition leaders. She has a better idea about the technology,” Ghosh said in Delhi as he reiterated the BJP’s attack on the Banerjee government for the violence that followed after TMC’s win in early May.Mamata Banerjee rebutted the accusation in her speech. “Nothing happened after the polls. Some BJP members became NHRC members and submitted (to the Calcutta high court) a biased report,” she said.Referring to her election slogan ‘khela hobe’ (let’s play), Banerjee declared that the TMC will observe August 16 as Khela Divas. “Khela will take place in all states until the BJP is ousted from the country,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-turning-country-into-surveillance-state-mamata-101626892840760.html
22-07-2021||India||Farmers get DDMA nod to protest at Jantar Mantar till August 9||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday allowed farmer groups to protest at Jantar Mantar from July 22 to August 9, with a maximum of 200 people in attendance and Covid-19 appropriate protocols in place, even though large gatherings continue to remain prohibited in the national capital in light of the pandemic.The authority’s decision came three days after a Delhi Police delegation met farmer leaders at Singhu border and asked them to reconsider their proposed march to the Parliament on July 22 and a protest that they planned to start on the same day, citing DDMA orders that prohibit religious, cultural, political, sports, academic and other gatherings in the city to prevent the spread of Covid-19.“I am directed to convey the approval of Lieutenant Governor Delhi / Chairperson of Delhi Disaster Management Authority for staggered protest at Jantar Mantar by maximum 200 protesting farmers / member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha everyday from 22.07.2021 to 09.08.2021 between 11 am and 5 pm,” said the DDMA in a letter to the Delhi Police on Wednesday, a copy of which HT has seen.Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is the DDMA chairperson, and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal the vice-chairperson.After the order, Delhi Police stepped up security arrangements at the protest venue, and several senior Delhi Police officers, including police chief Balaji Srivastava, visited Jantar Mantar to check the preparations in place. Between 200 and 300 security personnel are expected to be deployed in and around Jantar Mantar and adjoining roads during the protest.In a statement, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said: “After multiple rounds of negotiations with farmers bodies... and on being assured in writing that they will remain peaceful and with the approval of DDMA, they have been permitted to protest at Jantar Mantar with limited numbers... They will be escorted to the designated location from Singhu border in buses. They have been advised to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour and social distancing... Delhi Police has put in place extensive arrangements to ensure that the protest programme remains peaceful.”Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against three newly enacted farm laws. Farmer leaders and the Centre have held several rounds of talks but the impasse remains.Farmer unions are planning to intensify their nearly eight-month-long stir by protesting till the scheduled end of Parliament’s monsoon session, to demand the scrapping of the three farm laws passed in September last year. The monsoon session of Parliament began on July 19 and is scheduled to end on August 13.The protest call was given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the agitation against the contentious farm laws.When asked about the current guidelines, which prohibit gatherings, a senior DDMA official, who asked not to be named, said the permission is an “exemption” in the light of “inputs” received from the Delhi Police.The Delhi Police have taken an undertaking from SKM, an umbrella body of about 40 farmers’ groups, that their protest will be peaceful and the 200 protesters at the venue will observe Covid-appropriate behaviour. They will also not attempt to leave the protest site or disrupt Parliament, senior police officers aware of the matter said.The police on Wednesday installed CCTV cameras in and around the protest venue. Except the 200 protesters, who will carry identify cards issued by the SKM, mediapersons and security personnel, no member of the public will be allowed at the protest site, said a senior police officer, who asked not to be named.Another police officer said that an escort team will reach Singhu border on Thursday morning and check five buses and an SUV in which the farmers will travel to Jantar Mantar. The ID cards of the participants, issued by the SKM, will be checked before allowing them inside the vehicles, which the farmers will arrange.“An ambulance will also accompany the police escort team and farmers’ vehicles. The security of the routes that the buses would take will be the responsibility of the district police concerned. After the protest ends, farmers will be escorted back to Singhu border,” the second officer said.Senior Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait group) leader Rakesh Tikait said that a fresh lot of 200 farmers, duly verified by the SKM and with valid ID cards, will visit Jantar Mantar every day, as part of the ‘Kisan Sansad’.“We never said anything about ‘sansad gherao’, but holding a kisan sansad at any place outside Parliament where the public is allowed. The 200 farmers who will participate in the protest will follow all Covid guidelines. It will be a peaceful agitation,” said Tikait.SKM in a press statement said, “From tomorrow, Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s contingents of two hundred farmers each would reach Jantar Mantar to protest against the government, and hold their own Kisan Sansads on each working day of the Parliament, until the monsoon session ends [on August 13]. Preparations are underway for the same...”Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh national president Shiv Kumar Kakka, who was part of the nine-member coordination committed that held two meetings with Delhi Police in the last three days, said the police asked them to reduce the number of protesters at the site.“We turned this request down, saying that many farmers groups are part of the agitation, and we have to take two or three representatives from each group,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-get-ddma-nod-to-protest-at-jantar-mantar-till-august-9-101626891520637.html
22-07-2021||India||Centre’s draft plan has little impact on old vehicles in NCR||The Centre’s new draft vehicle-scrapping policy, which will allow owners to use their old vehicles after a fitness test and on payment of a higher fee, will have little impact for owners of vehicles registered in Delhi, unless there are fresh directions from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) or the Supreme Court.In March, the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) released the first draft of the national voluntary scrappage scheme, under which a private vehicle over 20 years old will have to mandatorily undergo fitness and emission tests, failing which it will be deemed as an End-of-Life-Vehicle or ‘EOLV’, and will be scrapped.For commercial vehicles, the age has been capped at 15 years. Such vehicles will have to pay more for fitness certificates and will also have to pay a “green tax”, which will vary from state to state, depending on their pollution levels. None of the rates have been decided yet and the policy is likely to be implemented from next year.But the National Capital Region (NCR), because of its hazardous pollution levels in winter, is governed by a separate set of norms that will override the Centre’s scheme.What are the rules that govern the use of old vehicles in Delhi?Vehicles in Delhi have been categorised on the basis of their fuel type and assigned a shelf life. Any registered diesel vehicle more than 10 years old, and petrol vehicle over 15 years old cannot operate in NCR. These rules have been laid down in various orders issued by the NGT (2015) and the Supreme Court (2018). This is different from the Centre’s draft policy, where the only distinction is between private and commercial vehicles in determining the age for re-registration, which is dependent on its fitness.Delhi also has its own vehicle scrapping guidelines, issued in August 2018, according to which any vehicle, whether petrol or diesel, has to be mandatorily scrapped once they are above 15 years. In other states, vehicles can be run even after 15 years once it undergoes a fresh fitness test.“Delhi’s motor licensing officers issue no-objection certificates (NOCs) for vehicles that are either above 15 years old, or above 10 years if it is a diesel variant. The vehicles cannot be used in Delhi, but these NOCs can be used in select states to get the vehicle re-registered there. It is illegal to drive any such vehicle without re-registration in that state,” said a senior transport official.States where such vehicles are allowed to be sold and re-registered include Rajasthan, which allows it in all its districts; Bihar (18 districts); Maharashtra (26 districts); Uttar Pradesh (33); West Bengal (all districts but only BS-IV vehicles); Meghalaya (all districts).What are a user’s options if their vehicle is nearing the end of its mandated shelf life?A vehicle owner can use their vehicle till the day the shelf life expires. So, for instance, a nine-year-old diesel vehicle or a 14-year-old petrol one can be used for another year on NCR roads. However, after the shelf period elapses, the options for vehicle owners are few. Once this happens, the best option for an owner is to sell the end-of-life vehicle in another state, and will also result in a better monetary return.“It is better if owners start planning to sell or re-register their vehicles nearing their end-of-life age sooner than when they actually cross 10 or 15 years. That way, they will get more returns and also go through the process easily. Scrapping is an option if one wants to retain the registration number or if a vehicle has crossed 15 years or if it is badly damaged,” said a senior transport official.Is it possible that the rules will change in Delhi or NCR?To address Delhi’s peculiar situation, which is very different from what the draft national scrapping policy envisages, state transport minister Kailash Gahlot on June 16 said the Delhi government was planning to approach the Supreme Court to review its 2018 order prohibiting the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi-NCR.Gahlot on Wednesday said, “Our legal team has advised that an appeal can be filed only once the national scrapping policy is notified, because right now, it is still at a formative stage. So, we will file an appeal in the SC once the Centre notifies the policy,” he said.To be sure, it is not clear when the Centre will notify this policy, since it is taking suggestions from state governments.Exceptions in place for vintage cars On July 15, the MoRTH notified fresh amendments to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 2021 to include a special provision for registration of vintage motor vehicles. All two-wheelers and four-wheelers that are more than 50 years old from the date of first registration, maintained in their original form and have not undergone any substantial overhaul, which includes any modification in chassis or body shell or engine, shall be defined as Vintage Motor Vehicles, it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-draft-vehicle-scrapping-plan-has-little-impact-on-old-vehicles-in-delhincr-101626891220640.html

22-07-2021||Today's||New age IPOs: Beware of the lurking gray rhinos||No other initial public offering (IPO) in recent memory has evoked such divergent views as Zomato. I have written elsewhere of the global context of the late 1990s when similar tech-enabled, disruptive ecosystems were being created in the West. With the potential advent of a new class of investors post the Zomato IPO, we are now on the verge of creating an indigenous ecosystem with our own Alibabas and Amazons. A great hope prevails in the air despite obvious risks in the environment.This hope, though, needs calibration before making investment decisions in these companies. While I make the case for optimism despite mega valuations with bleeding financials, understanding some of the key drivers of the underlying business dynamics, and differentiating between potential outcomes of retail investors and institutional ones, is useful.The fact is that such humongous value creation of these venture capital (VC)- or private equity (PE)-funded consumer plays would have been impossible without a closed clique of inter se investments by foreign PE funds. As global liquidity continues with near negative interest rates, this can potentially be construed as an ingenious play to generate mega returns by inflating asset prices through “investor subsidised business models”.In privately held companies, creating the illusion of ephemeral valuations with co-investments by different funds in subsequent rounds of fundraising is fairly simple. It is ultimately the same small group of funds such as Softbank, Tiger Global and Sequoia who lead a cosy club of friendly competitors for both large-scale capital and mega deal flows. With the energy and exuberance of youthful entrepreneurs in abundance, India, with its massive virgin markets, is indeed providentially placed in this cycle of fate and fortune. Powerful investor communication in a narrative where huge operating losses are worn as a badge of honour, with icons like Amazon and Google to showcase, allows for a potboiler of an offering. The new gold rush of the 19th century revisited. Or a fool’s rush?The trick, though, in such models is not to be the last sucker holding the can when the music stops playing. With the rush of IPOs (PayTM, OYO, Mobikwik) lined up at dizzying valuations, it is possible to conceive of a scenario that mutual funds (MFs) and retail investors could be the ones holding the bucket after PE and VC funds exit, taking their billions (and our forex reserves) to newer pastures and continuing the hunt for new suckers and avenues for value creation.Though it is tempting to contextualise the current phase in India with that of the West in the late 1990s, where the concurrent rise of mobile, internet and e-commerce enabled the likes of Amazon, Yahoo and Google, we must realise that these companies had a massive intellectual property (IP) content and intellectual resources. Our companies cannot boast of such IPs with the only moat being huge access to capital to shut out the competition (starved, killed or acquired), and good execution capability in building scale, brand and intelligent data with demographically copacetic market dynamics.Though these attributes are valuable, the business model risk, at these asking valuations without a definitive, proven (or forecasted) path to profitability through sound unit economics, cannot be ignored.The core concern remains the fragile business models, hyped up through aggressive campaigns, but without either globally disruptive paradigms or significant IP, flaunting market share built on questionable economics funded by monstrous capital holding the fort from an imminent collapse. Such differentiators are unsustainable unless these companies use the runway provided by the security of global liquidity to build a credible road map to a sound profitability profile with distinct, sustainable competitive advantages, or the risk of value erosion after the initial euphoric phase is real. Zomato, being the first such IPO, faces the least risk as investment bankers would be keenly vested in keeping the story alive to accommodate the next IPOs in line.Once publicly listed, these companies will lose convenient access to capital to build profitable, fully loaded unit economics as future tranches will result in dilution of capital. Creating disruption by “blitzscaling” and price subsidisation will then no longer be hidden from scrutiny. NextSpace was driven to bankruptcy by WeWork when it was private, and its subsequent extinction post listing due to such policies is well documented. Though with a near negative interest rate scenario PEs can theoretically be infinite, overvaluing loss at the behest of scale and network effect for illusory mega-profits in a very distant utopian future is fraught with existential risks.Michele Wucker, in her seminal work, The Gray Rhino: How to Recognize and Act on the Obvious Dangers We Ignore, enunciates the decision-making biases which make us view things more optimistically, and deny things which are scary, due to our psychological make-up. It is this escapist bias which creates gray rhinos which are highly probable, high impact-yet-neglected threats. Gray rhinos are precepts which are openly discussed, but not acted upon. The markets, in general, are in this phase and we can’t ignore that such IPOs reflect this reality too.Given the global challenges of growing macro instability, health and social inequities, I advise companies to adopt the strategic choice of calibrated growth with predictable profitability for the next few years. Such choices would contain tail risks from black swan and gray rhino events which, at these levels, can be devastating.Similarly, retail investors need to evaluate these contrasting narratives in the case of upcoming IPOs and decide depending on their risk profile, loss tolerance and investment horizon. The safest course perhaps, till the environment is clearer, is to treat the optionality of these opportunities to create some alpha for their portfolios but without disturbing its core asset allocation and sectoral distribution.Prabal Basu Roy is a Sloan Fellow of the London Business School, non-executive director, and an adviser to chairmen of corporate boards The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/new-age-ipos-beware-of-the-lurking-gray-rhinos-101626955379370.html
22-07-2021||Today's||EU’s CBAM, US Carbon Tax undermine international climate and trade laws||Whether it is the unprecedented floods in Germany, heatwaves in the United States (US) and Canada, wildfires in California and parts of Australia, or droughts in Africa, there is a clear link between these extreme weather events and the climate crisis. The Assessment of Climate Change Over Indian Region, published by India’s ministry of earth sciences last year, predicts an increase in average temperature by approximately 4.4°C relative to the recent past and consequent increase in frequency of summer (April–June) heatwaves, rise in surface temperature and humidity and amplification of heat stress, particularly over the Indo-Gangetic and Indus river basins.The basic principle of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was concluded at the Earth Summit, 1992, is “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capability” (CBDR-RC). The principle of “Differentiated Responsibilities” recognises that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has originated in developed countries. The “Respective Capabilities” is a recognition of the different socio-economic status of countries. Flowing from this was the UNFCCC principle that “(T)he extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology…”.Also Read | Climate goals: India’s strides and challengesAs a result, the Kyoto Protocol (1997) placed binding emission reduction commitments on Annex I (developed) countries, while non-Annex I countries did not have binding commitments. Despite its promise, the Kyoto Protocol remained an unfinished story. The US refused to ratify it, Canada withdrew in 2012, and many of signatories refused to take commitments beyond 2012.A key grouse for the US and other developed economies has been the need for emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil to make emission reduction commitments. The Paris Agreement (2015) mandated countries to set their commitments in the form of “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDCs). It also set out principles of financial support by developed countries of $100 billion in annual climate aid by 2020, a target that has not been achieved, exacerbating uncertainty and mistrust. There is no clarity on emission-reporting and rules for carbon offsets for a global carbon market. The Conference of Parties-26 (COP26) summit is expected to be held this year and the progress on core principles of the Paris accord by then is critical for realistic outcomes.CBAM and US Carbon TaxIt is in this context that the proposal of the European Commission released on July 14 on carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) needs to be seen. CBAM is part of a series of measures adopted by the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, including the intermediate target of at least 55% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (Fit for 55 Package).CBAM envisages importers purchasing “CBAM certificates” that reflect the carbon price of the embedded emissions in the covered products that are imported into the EU. This requirement applies to imports of cement, electricity, certain fertilisers, and certain iron, steel and aluminum products from non-EU countries, except countries covered by the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), ie Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Other countries can enter into agreements with the EU for exemptions from CBAM, if they can demonstrate that they have an equivalent domestic carbon pricing mechanism.Underlying CBAM are two concerns: (a) the “competitiveness concern”, ie to level the playing field between EU producers who pay a carbon cost, and importers who do not; and (b) the “environmental concern”- ie, a measure to “induce other countries or foreign producers to cut emissions”.On the same day that the EU released its draft proposal for CBAM, there was news about Democrats in the US agreeing to include a tax on imports from countries that the US considers as lacking aggressive climate policies. There are no details as yet on how this is proposed to be implemented.Undermining International Climate Law and PolicyBoth EU’s CBAM and the proposed US carbon tax on imports, undermine the foundation of international climate law and policy, since their only concern is whether the import is from a country that applies the same emission reduction regulation that they have determined to be adequate; and not whether principles of international climate law have been implemented by that country.The CBAM proposal acknowledges the bottom-up approach of the Paris Agreement, which involves each country setting its level of ambition; but notes that “we need to make sure that Parties are not undermining the effectiveness of each other’s policies.” It notes that “as long as significant numbers of the EU’s international partners have policy approaches that do not result in the same level of climate ambition as the Union, and differences in the price applied to GHG emissions remain, there is a risk of carbon leakage.”The EU claims that CBAM does not amount to interfering with policy choices in third countries. But this is precisely what it will do, since it essentially requires goods imported into the EU follow the same rules as the goods produced in the EU. NDCs of each country are based on reduction of economy-wide emissions; EU’s approach will, however, mandate that sectors manufacturing goods for export to the EU, will be penalised, not for any violation of the domestic or international law by the country of export, but for not matching EU’s emission requirements. And it is here that the EU’s CBAM clashes with the foundation of international climate law and policy, which is premised on differential responsibilities.Whether it is the EU’s CBAM or the proposed carbon tax in the US, in setting the expectation that all countries need to share their level of “climate ambition”, they are suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach that would pretty much lead to burial of the CBDR-RC principle.CBAM is a unilateral trade measure and World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistency arises on account of at least two basic principles.First, the charge/cost imposed by CBAM would be over and above the tariffs negotiated and bound by EU members under their WTO commitments.Second, the EU would be unilaterally judging domestic climate responses of exporting countries, and assessing what products from which country would need how much value of CBAM certificates. Furthermore, the preferential treatment for free allowances or other concessions for goods manufactured within the EU may also result in discrimination between imported and domestically manufactured goods. The EU’s legal assessment notes potential for justification of the CBAM as an exception to WTO commitments; but for this, the EU must demonstrate that there was no other less trade restrictive alternative.While legal scholars engage in hypothetical arguments on how CBAM may be adjudicated at WTO, there are prominent voices, such as that of Paul Krugman, who recently argued that “given the threat of climate change, our response should be to revise or ignore trade law”. This emotional response of one of the strongest votaries of trade liberalisation is reflective of the growing desperation and horror at the visible effects of the climate crisis across the world. It, however, ignores the inequitable impact of such a measure: Not only is there a question of inconsistency with rules of trade, but one which will only create inequitable distribution of wealth and resources, and potentially defeat any effective global solution.A recent study by UNCTAD confirms that the introduction of carbon pricing coupled with a CBAM helps reduce CO2 emissions, inside and outside the EU, but also underscores that this reduction represents only a small percentage of global CO2 emissions.More pertinently, UNCTAD notes that the introduction of a CBAM results in decline in exports in developing countries in favour of developed countries, which tend to have less carbon-intensive production processes. This will only exacerbate the inequitable distribution of the benefits of trade, and limit the possibility for export-led development in poorer countries.Equity, Accountability, EffectivenessThe EU plans to start implementation of CBAM in a phased manner from 2023. It runs the risk of derailing hard-won gains of the rules of international climate policy, as well as international trade. India and other developing countries should consider engaging in discussions that seek to address the problems with innovative solutions that have equity, accountability and effectiveness at its core.Raghuram Rajan’s proposal for a “global carbon incentive” (GCI) is one such innovative solution that merits deeper understanding. Rajan explains that GCI is premised on the principle that every country that emits more than the global average of around five tonnes per capita of CO2, would pay annually into a global incentive fund, with the amount calculated by multiplying the excess emissions per capita by the population and GCI.He notes for example, that if GCI started at $10 per tonne, the US would pay around $36 billion, and Saudi Arabia would pay $4.6 billion; and that countries below the global per capita average would receive a commensurate payout. For instance, he estimates that Uganda would receive around $2.1 billion. The underlying principle, Rajan explains, is that every country would face an effective loss of $10 per capita for every additional ton that it emits per capita, regardless of whether it started at a high, low, or average level.Rajan also succinctly explains how proposals for a tax on imports, alongside a domestic carbon tax, effectively applies the same tax rate to goods coming in from countries that do not have a carbon tax, and would therefore falter on the principle of fairness. On the contrary, he explains, “they would let large importing countries impose their tax preferences on poor exporting countries and might serve as a Trojan horse for protectionism.”The real and visible impact of thr climate crisis is that the impact of emissions knows no borders, and it is the collective responsibility of all to address this in a cohesive, fair, and rational manner. The irony of the proposed EU and US unilateral approaches is that their nationalistic self-righteousness, fails to achieve anything effective to address the real underlying issues.What we need is innovative, collective solutions that can work for all; anything exclusionary will only be sub-optimal and ineffective.RV Anuradha is partner, Clarus Law Associates, New Delhi, and specialises in law and policy related to trade and the climate crisisThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/eus-cbam-us-carbon-tax-undermine-international-climate-and-trade-laws-101626950819133.html
22-07-2021||Today's||Expanding India’s foreign policy canvas||New thinking about global norms is in the air.At one level, a new global tax is being worked upon. The objective is not only to establish a minimum corporate tax regime but also a system where certain profits of large companies will be taxed where they are generated. Carve-outs to suit specific requirements are being carefully negotiated.Separately, carbon border levies are being unveiled to aid net zero emission goals. These portend fusion of trade and climate in unprecedented ways. Also, binding dispute resolution provisions are sought to be embedded into international agreements. At another level, standards are being contested and technological decoupling is taking place, leading to new value chains being set up.They are all signs that changes in the global economic domain are underway. There is no turning back. It is only the pace, not the trajectory of changes that is now an issue. Their cumulative impact will be on us. India’s choice is to understand and shape them or be at the receiving end.Also Read | Strained ties with India, other nations lead to ‘dip’ in China’s weapon exportIndian foreign policy, like that of most other States, has generally given primacy to the frictions and friendships relating to geopolitics. Geo-economics, usually, has taken a backseat. The advocacy of decolonisation; the demand for nuclear disarmament; the crafting of the Non-Aligned Movement as a response to the Cold War; the support for United Nations (UN) peacekeeping; the quest for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council; and the call for the comprehensive convention on international terrorism are some of the many global foreign policy initiatives that stand out.Such successes, have aimed to better our geopolitical situation and, thereby, contribute to our economic well-being.As global issues have evolved, India has, in a more direct manner, ventured to plug into development and economic activities as links to a global role. For example, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has espoused climate action as an issue where what India does within its borders to benefit its citizens also matters well beyond our borders. This has both economic and political benefits.Leveraging economic engagement to boost political ties is not new. It goes back to India’s decades-long development cooperation with countries of the global South. What is different is the scale and global impact of what India does or does not do on several issues coming onto the global agenda — for instance, the climate crisis, health security and digital technologies. These can no longer be termed only as sectoral issues; they are now becoming primary global concerns.During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, our foreign policy apparatus was key in securing essential global supplies even as our corona warriors battled the virus across the country. Conceptually, other subjects such as taxation of global corporates, regulation of trans-boundary digital behemoths, big data management, disaster and humanitarian relief, not to forget trade issues, can benefit by being addressed through the prism of a broader approach taking into account the global dimensions.Similarly, migration and human mobility are emerging issues. India and Africa will be the largest repositories of young populations while most other societies age. Likewise, concerns about anti-microbial resistance are rising as are those about cybersecurity. All these are trans-boundary issues with intrinsic foreign policy dimensions as we have to engage on them globally and what we do domestically has global repercussions.There will be challenges in changing from a sectoral to a broader approach that looks beyond the horizon. But let us not forget that by most accounts India emerged as a net beneficiary of the last wave of globalisation, despite going into it with considerable reluctance. With global changes of a different kind now in the making, we need a holistic approach to tackle them. In short, there is a case to expand our foreign policy agenda beyond the traditional thinking of what is geopolitical.This does not entail a shift of focus. Perennial subjects such as the boundary question with China will remain important, as will our ties with midnight’s other child in South Asia. So also rising geopolitical situations such as in Afghanistan. At the same time, increasing the scope of foreign policy to take into account the intermeshed nature of global changes underway is crucial too.Geo-economics inevitably impacts geopolitics. China’s Belt and Road Initiative is an example. Climate, health security and digital technologies are becoming aspects of geopolitical contestation of different kinds. Our willingness to encompass areas, which we previously considered beyond the pale of our foreign policy posture, will be key to our ability to navigate the coming wave of global changes.The primary goal of foreign policy is to preserve, promote and protect national interests in the broadest sense of the term, and not to limit the canvas. We have the talent in the form of a cadre of dedicated officials, as well as ability in the form of one of our ablest diplomats holding the political fort. Also, PM Modi, as a leader, is not averse to risk-taking. What is needed is to mainstream the different strands of various policies that are encompassed by the coming wave of global change into an integrated foreign policy approach. Our presidency of G20 in 2023 will provide opportunities to weave geo-economic themes with geopolitical interests. If we want to ride the next wave of global change, we need a broader global agenda and a carefully crafted game plan in place soon.Syed Akbaruddin is a retired diplomat who served as India’s permanent representative at the UN.

22-07-2021||Today's||Pegasus must lead to legal reform and consensus on the harms of surveillance||Over the last week, it has come to light that a highly sophisticated spyware (Pegasus), manufactured by an Israeli company, and sold only to governments, was potentially used to surveil the phones of several journalists, activists, lawyers, and legislators. The Pegasus revelations are part of a worldwide investigative report into the use of such spyware in a range of countries, most of which are authoritarian autocracies, from Saudi Arabia to Azerbaijan.The government’s response, so far, has been obfuscation. It has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, while also insisting that surveillance in India has to be “legally authorised”. This response, however, reveals the systemic problems that persist in our country, when it comes to unaccountable State powers over the lives of individuals. The legal regime for surveillance – which continues to be governed, in part, by the 1885 Telegraph Act (along with the 2000 Information Technology Act) – allows a near carte blanche to the government.Also Read | Pegasus row: IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to speak in Parliament todaySurveillance orders are at the discretion of the executive, and are reviewed by the executive. Even though the Supreme Court has twice stated, in 1997 and in 2017, that an order of surveillance can be passed only when strictly necessary, and if no alternative exists, the devil lies in the implementation. Without any independent scrutiny — whether judicial or parliamentary — it is impossible to ascertain whether the court’s judgments are honoured more in the breach than in the observance.If, therefore, the government is right when it says that there has been no illegal surveillance and all surveillance requests have to be “legally authorised”, then the Pegasus revelations only go to show that the legal structure is woefully inadequate, and needs a root and branch overhaul. It should be easy to agree that whatever national security imperatives might exist for surveillance in theory, tapping the phones of principal Opposition leaders, constitutional authorities, and journalists, amount to rank State abuse. It is no consolation to say that the abuse is “legally authorised”; rather, it is a stark commentary on the state of the law.An overhaul of the legal structure, however, cannot accomplish much without a broad public consensus about the harms of surveillance. It is for this reason that it becomes particularly crucial to start from first principles on the issue of surveillance. It is commonly – and easily – said that if one is not engaging in any wrongdoing, then one should have no concerns about one’s privacy. There is, of course, a pithy answer to this. What if the government made it mandatory for every individual to deposit a pair of their house keys at their local police station, so that whenever the police so chose, they could enter that individual’s house, and search for any possible illegality that might be going on within? Most people would find it unacceptable, as they would find unacceptable a threat to publish their internet search history for public consumption.This makes it clear, therefore, that there is no connection between wrongdoing and desiring privacy. The harm of surveillance is a social harm; a society in which one does not have confidence in the sanctity of one’s private sphere is a society of self-censorship, mutual distrust, and, ultimately, of conformity born out of fear.The Pegasus revelations are also important because in this day and age, smartphones have become an extension of our bodies. We do so much on our phones that unrestricted access to those instruments makes it extremely easy to profile an individual based on their browsing habits, whom they message and call, and when. Profiling facilitates control and manipulation; for example, if I know your medical shopping details, I can piece together your medical history, and either profit from it commercially (as an insurance company) or use it to blackmail you (the State). In either case, you do not need to be engaging in any wrongdoing to fall victim to the harms of profiling.Thus, the root and branch reform of law that would increase the cost of surveillance for the government, and a public consensus about the harms of surveillance must go hand-in-hand. Only then can we say that the Pegasus revelations have meant something.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based advocate The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/pegasus-must-lead-to-legal-reform-and-consensus-on-the-harms-of-surveillance-101626948285230.html
22-07-2021||Editorials||It is the Olympics||The modern Olympics is a curious beast. Every four years — in the case of this edition, five years — it rolls into the host city like a juggernaut, trailing tales of destruction, corruption, inflated budgets, development at the cost of citizens and the environment, apathy towards those suffering from natural disasters, relocation or disease. And then the Games begin. All the negativity dissolves into the background, replaced by nervous excitement and hypnotic awe at the sheer range of human endeavour, at the sight of athletes from every corner of the planet performing at the most breathtaking level possible.Also Read | Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony director fired over Holocaust joke on Games eveThe challenge this time is, however, greater. Tokyo2020 was postponed by a year because of the pandemic; its budget has breached all reasonable bounds; the greatest sporting feats in the world will unfold inside empty stadiums; the host city is in a state of emergency; and the majority of the Japanese are opposed to the idea of the Games happening at all. The first sporting action was on July 21, Japan’s softball match against Australia in Fukushima. The baseball and softball matches were given to Fukushima as a symbolic gesture, to show the world that the region has moved on, 10 years after being devastated by a tsunami and the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The stadium stands 65km from the nuclear plant. Yet, the pandemic has ensured that the people of Fukushima have nothing to do with the Games. No spectators saw Japan’s win over Australia. Games volunteers were told to stay home too.But if the Tokyo bubble holds, and if the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus can be kept at bay inside the Games, then a true spectacle awaits. The last chance to see arguably the greatest gymnast of all time, Simone Biles, in action. Novak Djokovic on his quest for a “golden slam”. Eliud Kipchoge, poised to run — officially — the first sub-2 hour marathon. Caeleb Dressel, mounting a challenge to Michael Phelps’s record of most medals in a single edition. And, most importantly for a perennially medal-starved nation such as India, a real opportunity to win at multiple events. India’s boxers, wrestlers, shooters and others are all going into Tokyo2020 ranked in the top three in the world, or, in the case of badminton player PV Sindhu, as the defending world champion. India has never had it this good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/it-is-the-olympics-101626955439903.html

The crisis was precipitated by his predecessor, KP Oli, dissolving the Parliament against constitutional rules in December. The Supreme Court (SC) reinstated the House. In May, President Bidya Devi Bhandari once again dissolved the House, despite Mr Deuba having a list of the majority of parliamentarians backing him in a bid to become Prime Minister (PM). The SC once again ordered the restoration of the House. Mr Deuba was sworn-in, and with the support of his own party, the Prachanda-led Maoist force, a communist faction led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and a Tarai-based party, is now expected to take the country to elections next year.Also Read | PM Modi, PM Deuba agree to enhance India-Nepal cooperationBesides the restoration of democracy and an end to strongman rule in Nepal, this is an opportunity to reset India-Nepal ties. The perception in Kathmandu that New Delhi was backing Mr Oli till the very end eroded India’s image. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to Mr Deuba on Monday after he won the confidence vote and private diplomatic outreach to Mr Prachanda — the key architect of the alliance — shows that Delhi is willing to cooperate with the new government.Instead of allowing intermediaries on either side to destabilise ties by undermining the government, or allowing ideological factors such as the desire to restore Nepal’s Hindu status to prevail, India must focus on cementing State-to-State ties, assisting Nepal with vaccines, backing a federal democratic secular republican framework, and working with the government. Political goodwill through support for democracy and delivery of promises and projects are key to pushing back China’s influence in Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/an-opportunity-for-a-reset-in-nepal-india-ties-101626954719410.html
