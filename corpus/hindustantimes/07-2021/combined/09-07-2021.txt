Due to large footfall, market associations and shopkeepers are not able to ensure Covid protocols over the last three days...which may cause super-spreading of the coronavirus,” said the temporary suspension order.The restrictions will come into effect at 10 pm on Friday and shall remain in force till 10 pm on Sunday, or until further orders, the notice said. However, shops dealing with essential goods and services will be allowed to open.In the last 10 days, the authorities have similarly cracked down on at least nine such popular markets in the city, including the Lajpat Nagar Central Market and Laxmi Nagar market. Earlier in the day, at a meeting of the DDMA chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, which was also attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, senior officials raised concerns over overcrowding in the city’s markets.“Grave concerns were expressed over the flouting of Covid appropriate behaviour and negligence. It was stressed that apart from enforcement efforts on the part of various agencies, the onus of ensuring and enforcing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour lay with stakeholder organisations like market welfare and resident welfare associations,” said an official who attended the meeting.The district administration on Friday directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to sanitise markets in Karol Bagh and the surrounding areas, and requested the Delhi Police to ensure “strict compliance of the order”.Currently, markets and malls in Delhi are allowed to operate between 10am and 8pm. The market associations, traders and owners of shops are expected to ensure that customers follow Covid norms such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and avoiding spitting in the open. Delhi was under a complete lockdown from April 19 due to an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. Scaling down of restrictions started in a phased manner from May 31 and markets were allowed to open from June 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-karol-bagh-markets-temporarily-closed-over-violation-of-covid-norms-101625855372074.html

He also asked officials to fast-track the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the Regional Institute of Virology, Mohali. Though no fresh cases of Delta Plus variant (apart from two reported earlier, based on May sampling) had been identified in the state, the CM directed that the Whole Genome Sequencing Lab at GMCH Patiala, coming up with the support of PATH, must become functional this month. PATH has informed that the machine is likely to be installed by July 25 July. Reviewing the Covid situation, the CM noted with satisfaction that the state was also starting dry swab testing, with a pilot at GMC Patiala next week. Sensitivity of the dry swab variant method is 79% and specificity is 99% when compared with standard RTPCR test as the gold standard. Considering its lower cost and quick turn-around, the dry swab variant method can be used as a screening tool only in settings, where automated RNA extraction is not available. State running out of vaccine With the state running out of Covishield and left with only a day’s stock of Covaxin, the CM said, “Increase in supplies was critical given the gradual opening of sectors conditional to stakeholders having taken at least one dose,” the CM said, directing officials to aggressively pursue increase in the state’s quota with the Centre. Pointing out that Punjab had already vaccinated nearly 83 lakh eligible persons (approximately 27% of the population). While the 1st dose has been administered to 70 lakh people, 13 lakh people had received the second dose, he added. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan told the meeting that the administration was following up with the Centre for more doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/expedite-work-on-identifying-new-covid-variants-cm-to-departments-101625855371501.html

A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the writ of habeas corpus does not apply in respect of a person who is in judicial custody. A habeas corpus petition is filed seeking direction to produce a person who is missing or illegally detained.“The facts will show that the petitioner is in judicial custody and detention, therefore, cannot be termed as illegal,” the bench said.It further said if Fatima is aggrieved by court orders passed in judicial proceedings before the trial court, she can challenge them before the appropriate forum in proper proceedings.“This petition is completely misplaced and not maintainable. Same is accordingly dismissed,” the bench said.Fatima was arrested on April 11 last year and is currently under judicial custody. Besides this case, she is also accused in three other riots related cases.In the habeas corpus petition, Fatima, through her sibling, claimed that her custody in an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case relating to the alleged larger conspiracy that led to the northeast Delhi riots last year was illegal, and that she should thus be released.During the hearing, the bench asked advocate Jatin Bhatt, representing Fatima, whether he was willing to withdraw the plea as it was of the view that the writ of habeas corpus was not maintainable in this case. To this, the counsel said his instructions were not to withdraw.Advocate Amit Mahajan, representing Delhi Police, said the habeas corpus petition filed by Fatima was not maintainable and that it deserves to be dismissed with cost as it is nothing but a blatant abuse of the process of law.He also told the court that a habeas corpus petition by Fatima’s brother seeking the same relief was dismissed by the high court last year.On July 5, another bench of the high court refused to hear the matter after taking strong exception to Fatima’s advocate Mehmood Pracha, for taking recourse to “heckling” and placing reliance on facts that were not on record.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-riots-hc-dismisses-student-activist-s-claim-of-illegal-detention-101625855311517.html

The area was placed on high alert on Thursday after the grenade was spotted by a sanitation worker during de-silting work.Delhi police officers said the NSG officers confirmed that the recovered grenade, HE 36, is commonly used for drills by the Indian Army. “The grenade is in the NSG’s custody now,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.Police suspect the grenade may have been accidentally dropped in to a drain from one of the army vehicles in the nearby Delhi Cantonment area, following which it found its way through several connected drains and finally reached the drain at Nasirpur village in Sagarpur. The Public Works Department drain where the grenade was found on Thursday is about 5-6 kms from the Delhi Cantonment area. The grenade, rusty on the outside and parts of its surface chipped away over the years, was spotted by a sanitation worker cleaning the drains on Thursday morning as part of the civic body’s annual de-silting exercise before the monsoon.He informed the police control room after which an alert was sounded. The grenade was shifted to a “safe location”, surrounded by “improvised safe bags” and guarded by police for nearly 12 hours on a road outside Nasirpur on Thursday, till the NSG arrived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nsgteam-recovers-grenade-found-in-west-delhi-drain-101625855132147.html

The PWD move comes in the backdrop of a drowning of a mini-truck driver last year in the flooded Minto Bridge in central Delhi. Last year, the road-owning agency stopped traffic at Minto Bridge only after the water level reached 45 cm. “We will keep updating the traffic police about the water levels, following which they can barricade the areas. Besides, all the on-ground staff have been asked to stay vigilant and pay special attention on timely draining of water from areas that are prone to waterlogging,” said a senior PWD official.A senior traffic police officer said the department is “already coordinating with the PWD”. “We will be taking all measures for the same,” said a senior police officer. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the monsoon will reach the city on July 10, with widespread rainfall and ‘isolated’ heavy rainfall predicted across the Capital from July 11-13.“We have briefed our executive staff on regular monitoring and coordination with the police as and when rainwater starts accumulating at a point. They have been told to keep a watch on all such vulnerable locations, such as underpasses, where once there is heavy rainfall, the water starts rising in no time from 20 cm to, say, 40 cm. This arrangement can effectively prevent accidents due to heavy waterlogging,” the official said. According to officials, there are around 40-50 ‘vulnerable’ locations where there is waterlogging every monsoon. Of these, five are ‘most vulnerable’, including Minto Bridge, Moolchand, Zakhira, Pul Prahladpur, Peeragarhi. The other vulnerable locations include Ashram flyover, Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, AIIMS crossing, Dwarka underpass, Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, near RTR flyover, Mathura Road, Punjabi Bagh, Vikas Marg and Laxmi Nagar, among others.Experts said that though the issue of waterlogging needs long-term solutions, such as redesigning of the drainage system and its separation from the sewerage network, accidents occur only due to “mechanical failure” or “human failure”. Some felt that the step taken by the agency to establish better coordination can help prevent untoward incidents as well as create a sense of urgency in responding to such events.Former PWD chief Sarvagya Srivastava said that accidents such as drowning due to submerged stretches can be avoided with effective coordination and vigilant staff. “In case of underpasses, which are below the ground level and have a natural tendency of accumulating water, functional pumps and round-the-clock vigil could help drain out excess water before it reaches the danger mark. Similarly, the pumping stations near the vulnerable points must be alert and keep coordinating with the traffic police so that traffic movement can be halted in time,” he said. Sewa Ram, professor (transport planning) at the School of Planning and Architecture, however, said that these are temporary measures and that the government agencies must also focus on fixing drain and road designs on stretches that are routinely inundated during monsoon showers.“This could work as a measure to immediately tackle the problem and to avoid any mishap due to waterlogging, but it is still a little short-sighted. While doing this, we must also focus on fixing the problems on these stretches so that a permanent solution can be found,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-monsoon-pwd-sets-20-cm-flooding-limit-to-halt-traffic-movement-around-underpasses-101625855130962.html

The tally of active cases further dipped to 112,231 as 10,458 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. The state saw 200 casualties, taking the toll up to 125,034, which also includes 538 fatalities added as part of the reconciliation process of Covid deaths. Aurangabad reported the highest toll with 46 deaths, followed by Kolhapur with 39 fatalities. The Kolhapur district recorded 29 deaths, while the city reported 10 fatalities.For the past one month, Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra is not improving. The state has been reporting between 8,000 to 10,000 cases since the first week of June. In the last nine days, it has reported 79,595 cases which on average comes to 8,843 cases a day. Last month, the average daily cases of the state were recorded at 10,542.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 214,862 samples and had a positivity rate of 4.18%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 14.01%, according to the data issued by the state health department on Friday.On Friday, Mumbai clocked 596 cases, taking the tally to 726,633 cases to date. It also recorded 13 fatalities taking the toll to 15,599.After cases of Delta-plus variants were found, the state government has imposed stricter norms by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three. The first two levels having maximum relaxations were removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on June 25. However, its effect is yet to be seen.“With doing away with the five-level relaxation plan, we were expecting that the daily cases will go further down, and the situation will be improved, however, that is not happening. It indicates that the existing restrictions are not being implemented strictly and this leniency needs to be dealt with,” said a senior official from the state health department.Meanwhile, Vaccination drive in the state suffered a setback on Friday as it could not be continued at many places including Mumbai and Aurangabad owing to a shortage of vaccine doses. On Friday, the state vaccinated 195,396 doses which are half of what it has been covering for the last four days, according to the data available on the Co-WIN portal.It has vaccinated 328,375 doses, 395,070 doses, 637,826 doses and 323,189 doses on July 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively, states the data available on the portal.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state is not getting enough stock of vaccine doses to speed up the drive. “The country is producing only two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) at present and two other vaccines — Sputnik and Moderna have been allowed for vaccination. We are not getting adequate numbers of vaccine doses and hence facing difficulty in speeding up the drive as per our plans,” Pawar said in Pune on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-8-992-new-covid-19-cases-no-improvement-in-daily-count-101625855073635.html

The BJP dismissed the allegations and called them “misleading”. While the AAP is in charge of the city government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to the municipal polls next year.Addressing a press conference at the party’s head office in central Delhi, AAP’s spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “ The BJP-ruled MCDs have committed corruption in the name of desilting internal drains, not even 5% of the drains in colonies have been cleaned. The north corporation claims to have extracted 9,800 MT of silt and the south MCD 35,000 MT of silt. The fact is no silt has been removed.” “Water will fill all colonies in monsoon as the drains are full of silt, the rainwater will overflow and flood the main roads as soon as monsoon starts in Delhi. Crores of rupees have been looted in the name of removing silt from drains for which contracts have been awarded,” said Bhardwaj. Officials from the north corporation were not available for comment.BJP spokesperson for Delhi Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The allegations are misleading. Mr Saurabh Bhardwaj has a habit of accusing MCDs to politically malign them. Today, he has raised the drain desilting issue to cover up the failure of the Delhi Jal Board, PWD and the flood department in cleaning major drains. These departments come under the Delhi government.” “The MCDs have done their task of desilting small drains inside colonies within the deadline of June 30. However, the small drains cannot empty out into the major drains as they have not been cleaned. An inquiry into Delhi Government departments failure to clean the major drains need to be probed,” said Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-accuses-delhi-s-civic-bodies-of-corruption-bjp-calls-claims-misleading-101625855073076.html

The two are regular employees and have been transferred from the university as well. The peon has been identified as Jatinder Singh. All were posted in the varsity’s department of planning and monitoring. This is the first time in the past five years that the varsity, which has been hit by a number of cases of corruption and bungling of funds, has taken a strict action against the erring officials.“The stringent action is required as the matter is serious. Moreover, a strong message needs to be sent in such cases of financial irregularities,” said the V-C, adding that a departmental inquiry has also been ordered against the suspended employees. It will be carried out by the three-member fact-finding committee, comprising registrar Varinder Kaushik, dean (research) Ashok Tiwari and finance officer Rakesh Khurana. In its initial report submitted last month, the panel claimed to have gathered “substantial evidence” to proceed against the erring employees. The matter came to light after the internal audit department and the varsity’s finance wing flagged issues in five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh purportedly submitted by a department in May.The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and even the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised turned out to be bogus. The committee probed bank accounts of the senior assistant and others involved in the matter. The assistance of the varsity’s forensic department was also taken to investigate the fake signatures and stamps.According to the initial probe, the senior assistant — who handled funds provided to the university under various heads and was posted in the same department for over a decade — used to create and submit fake bills in the name of “ghost” research scholars and assistants to siphon off the money. The funds mainly included those provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for development schemes, non-UGC grant for research projects and scholarships given by the Union ministry of education besides those received under the Rashtriya Uchhchatar Shiksha Abhiyan. It is believed the embezzlement went unchecked for at least six years and could run into crores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/embezzlement-punjabi-university-suspends-two-officials-sacks-peon-101625855072538.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab BJP notice: Ex-minister Joshi defends stand on farm stir||Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister Anil Joshi on Friday defended his statements on the farm protests while replying to the disciplinary notice issued by the party’s Punjab unit over his outbursts against the state leadership and high command for alleged mishandling of the issue. In the two-page reply to Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, the former local bodies minister said he had only talked in favour of farmers and party workers who are being harassed by farm unions. “In my media interviews as well, I talked in favour of arhtiyas and other industries allied with the farm sector. I also gave you certain suggestions on why party workers are leaving the Punjab unit. Is it indiscipline?” said Joshi in his reply. The two-time MLA was issued disciplinary notice earlier this week, after he, in a series of interviews, slammed the party’s state leadership, especially Ashwani Sharma, for the style of functioning and handling of the farm protests. “Had the state unit made sincere efforts to handle the situation when the farmers were protesting in Punjab, it would not have become a nationwide protest,” Joshi reiterated in his reply, while denying any indiscipline on his part. ‘I have been a loyal soldier of party’Joshi said he has been a “loyal soldier” of the party and the BJP has also given him back immensely in the form of ministership. “And whatever I am saying today is just an effort to provide more strength to the party in Punjab. I again repeat that I have not said anything against the central and state leadership. I have always tried to rake up these issues at party platforms, but these suggestions were ignored,” he said. Sharing an example, Joshi said in his reply that he had suggested to call a meeting of leaders who contest the assembly elections to get their ground-level feedback, but the party didn’t listen. “I again request you to stand by the farmers and businessmen of Punjab to involve the Centre in resolving their issues,” said Joshi. Even as Joshi remained aggressive in his interviews, the language used in the reply was “very soft”, observed a senior party leader. Any further decision on his reply is likely to come up for discussion in a couple of days, said the leader. Joshi’s issue was also discussed on Friday with party’s national organisation secretary BL Santosh during a meeting of the core committee on preparations for the upcoming assembly elections, said a member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-bjp-notice-ex-minister-joshi-defends-stand-on-farm-stir-101625855071404.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab power crisis worsens as Talwandi Sabo plant shuts down||The power crisis in Punjab worsened after the closure of the 1,980 MW Talwandi Sabo thermal plant on Friday. After running at half load for two days, the plant’s only operational unit — out of the three — also tripped around 4pm. One of the units had broken down on March 8, and another went out of operation on July 4. Already under pressure to meet the rising power demand for paddy sowing, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is imposing up to eight-hour power cuts across the state. Even the industrial sector is under a forced shutdown till July 11.Even as one 210 MW unit of the Ropar thermal plant is expected to become operational on Saturday, after remaining closed for three days due to boiler leakage, the Talwandi Sabo plant shutdown is expected to lead to imposition of more power cuts on domestic consumers.The power demand in the state — with restrictions on various consumers — is around 14,000 MW. On Thursday evening, there was a shortage of at least 1,550 MW during evening peak hours. The total gross generation in Punjab on Friday afternoon stands reduced to 4,400 MW. The state thermal units are supplying 1,440 MW and total hydropower is 775 MW. The three private generators supply stands reduced to 1,850 MW, which is almost half of the installed capacity of 3,940 MW.Assures to restart two units in three days“Talwandi Sabo thermal plant has proved to be a major setback for PSPCL in this paddy season. Its only running unit (No. 2), which was running at half load of 315 MW, tripped on Friday. The plant has informed us that the unit will be restarted after three days. It has also given an assurance to restart Unit No. 1, which broke down on July 4, the same day,” said a PSPCL official, who did not wish to be named.The officials said the plant’s Unit No. 3 has been non-operational since March 8, and it is the shortage of generation caused by it that is forcing PSPCL to impose power cuts.Meanwhile, in a press release, PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Parsad said that instructions have been issued for maintaining effective power supply amid a rising demand in the state.The CMD said field officers have been told to visit villages daily till July 19 to meet sarpanches and farmer unions to listen to their grievances and take note of major works required. He said the power situation will improve with the onset of monsoon, as even production by Bhakra Beas Management Board is down by 600 MW.Power expert VK Gupta said PSPCL’s over dependence on the private sector has proven dear to it. “Power purchase agreements are so flawed that they have no provision for penalty on plants for failing to provide power during peak season,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-power-crisis-worsens-as-talwandi-sabo-plant-shuts-down-101625855013172.html

The vaccination drive remains shut every Sunday. However, the drive will continue as per schedule at private hospitals.On Friday, the vaccination drive was suspended owing to lack of doses.In a statement on Friday, the BMC said, “Vaccination will remain suspended on Saturday, July 10, 2021, at government and municipal vaccination centres in the city due to insufficient vaccine stock available under the Covid-19 prevention vaccination campaign. The vaccination drive will resume once vaccine stocks become available to the corporation.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We are expecting to get around 85,000 doses on Saturday, and then, we will resume the drive on Monday. Further, in the coming days, we are expecting maximum doses for Mumbai, to undertake the drive aggressively.”The BMC had expected fresh stock of vaccines on Friday, but it did not receive any, due to which the decision was taken to call off the drive. According to BMC officials, the central storage facility of vaccines has been out of stock since Wednesday, and there is a minuscule amount of Covaxin available with few centres.In total, there are 401 vaccination centres in the city, of which, 283 are civic-run, 20 are of state government and the rest are private vaccination centres. Previously, the vaccination drive was similarly suspended at 300 vaccination centres on July 1 and 9, owing to vaccine shortage. Before that, Mumbai had suspended vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group between the second week of May to June, owing to the same reason.Meanwhile, as of Thursday, 5,929,190 citizens have been vaccinated in the city so far, of which 2,462,079 in private hospitals and the rest in public centres. Of the total, 1,247,410 are fully vaccinated with both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shortage-of-doses-in-mumbai-vax-drive-to-remain-suspended-at-300-centres-over-weekend-101625855011709.html

The civic body conducts between 30,000 and 40,000 tests per day, with an average positivity rate of below 2%.However, despite the positivity rate, experts believe the city needs to conduct more tests per day, especially when unlock plans start for the city, and during the festival season from September.Dr Rahul Pandit said, “Despite the lower number of cases now, and the low positivity rate, I have always maintained we ought to be conducting more tests. We should be conducting as many tests as Delhi and Bengaluru. Unlike earlier, almost 60-70% of the total tests per day in these two cities are RT-PCR. So they are effectively testing more numbers in their population.”According to Dr Pandit, if BMC traces and tests up to 25 high-risk contacts per positive case, it will prove more effective in curbing the spread of the virus. Presently, BMC traces up to 15 contacts per positive case.However, Dr Om Shrivastav, who is also a member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force, testing numbers differ based on the period and number of cases in the city. He said, “At its peak of the Covid-19 infection, when our per day caseload was high [over 5,000-6,000 cases per day, Mumbai was conducting up to 50,000 tests per day.”With the reduced number of cases, and considerable restrictions still in place, the testing figures in the city have reduced, Dr Shrivastav said.On Thursday, Mumbai conducted 39,075 Covid-19 tests, with its daily positivity rate at 1.5%.On Friday, Mumbai reported 596 Covid-19 cases and 13 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-conducts-530-249-covid-tests-per-million-of-population-less-than-delhi-bengaluru-s-average-101625855010943.html

They have also cited non-availability of films and high running costs behind the indefinite closure.“We had a meeting with the owners of multiplexes and single screen halls. It was decided that the cinema halls would remain closed for a few days more till the weekend lockdown and evening curfew continues,” said Ashish Agarwal, president of UP Cinema Exhibitors’ Federation.Agarwal explained that Saturday and Sundays were business days for multiplexes and single screen theatres. “However, following the weekend lockdown, there won’t be any business,”” he said.He also said that owing to late evening curfew, which starts from 9pm onwards, the cinema halls could run only three shows a day. “Screening of the fourth show that starts during late evening hours, would not be possible, hence this is another reason why we are not willing to open,” he said.He also said that the government had imposed Section 144 in some cities, including Lucknow, restricting the strength of the audience at cinema halls to 50 per cent.“Amid such restrictions, the multiplex and single screen theatre owners will not be able to meet the high running cost. Hence they have decided to shut the halls,” he said. He also cited non-availability of movies as another major reason but said that the cinema halls may open by July 15.Lucknow has around 9 multiplexes and 10 single screen halls. The closure of cinema halls and multiplexes started on May 1 in wake of the second Covid- 19 wave. The UP government gave orders for opening of single screen theatres and multiplexes on July 5, after the Covid situation eased. However, despite the government’s order, they remained closed. The members of UP cinema exhibitors’ federation had also met chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding waiver of house tax, water tax and fixed electricity charges during lockdown. “We have also approached the CM, who has assured us complete support and promised a waiver in the fixed electricity charges, house tax and water tax,” said Agarwal. However, this is not for the first time when multiplexes saw such a long closure. In 2020, such a closure was initiated on March 15, in wake of the first Covid-19 wave and was lifted on October 15, allowing them to open, but with 50 per cent gathering. The government eventually allowed the multiplexes and single screens to operate with full capacity on December 16, 2020.Lucknow has around 9 multiplexes and 10 single screen halls.

09-07-2021||Mumbai||MBBS grads must complete internship in same institute where they studied: NMC guidelines||Medical graduates will have to complete their 12-month compulsory internship in the same institute where they pursued their MBBS degree, states the new draft internship guidelines recently released by the National Medical Commission (NMC). MBBS graduates will also have to pursue a part of their internship in Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM), states the Draft Regulations for Compulsory Rotating Internship 2021, which was released by the NMC this week.“Indian medical graduates will complete the entire duration of their compulsory internship in the institute where they pursued and completed their MBBS. Foreign medical graduates who require to complete a period of internship shall do so only in medical colleges approved for providing Compulsory Rotating Internship to Indian medical graduates,” states the draft regulations released on the NMC website on July 7.While the medical internship until now covered mandatory time in different branches of medicine including community and general medicine, psychiatry, paediatrics, general surgery, etc, the new guidelines also include ISM branches which include Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Sowa Rigpa. “Student may choose any elective, provided the discipline is available in the same college/institution where the internship is being pursued,” states the draft regulations.The new guidelines outline the various aspects of the MBBS internship ranging from the goals, objectives and duration to eligibility and all the different branches of medicine that should be included in the 12 months. “The goal of the internship programme is to train medical graduates to fulfil their roles as doctors of the first contact in the community,” states the document.While the intention behind stating medical graduates to the same institute where they pursued their degree was to avoid students being fleeced by medical institutes, under the pretext of a no-objection certificate to pursue internship elsewhere, parents feel this will be restricting students from joining an internship programme at an institute of their preference. “The rule about pursuing an internship in the same college needs to be amended as students may prefer doing an internship at a government college where they may get exposure to better learning. It is, however, good to get clarity on the internship rules for students since many colleges take this crucial year lightly, especially private colleges,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mbbs-grads-must-complete-internship-in-same-institute-where-they-studied-nmc-guidelines-101625854952228.html

The test positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive — has also been lower than 1% in the city for 40 days now, with a recording of 0.11% on Friday. The city added 81 cases of the infection on average over the past seven days, the lowest this statistic has been since the early days of the pandemic in April last year. The positivity rate stayed below 1% for 82 days between end-December last year and mid-March, before it began to increase, as the Capital saw its worst surge of cases in April and May, when this statistic crossed 36%.“We have seen that the virus has a 12-week cycle, so there is a strong possibility of another surge in the city in August or September. We have to be prepared. People should not stop wearing masks or maintaining social distance, even if they are vaccinated,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). He headed Delhi government’s first committee on Covid-19 control and management. The city reported three deaths of the viral infection on Friday, lower than the average four deaths reported over the last seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fewer-than-100-cases-in-delhi-for-10-days-in-a-row-101625854951577.html
09-07-2021||Mumbai||74% police personnel in Maharashtra fully vaccinated||Around 74% of police personnel in Maharashtra are fully vaccinated as of Friday, while 93% are part inoculated with their first doses of vaccines for Covid-19.As per the data maintained by the state police headquarters, till July 9, Maharashtra Police, which has a total strength of 195,415 police personnel, had part vaccinated 182,551 (93.417%) personnel with the first dose, while 144,952 (74.176%) cops were fully vaccinated.Senior police officers said the second Covid wave was less lethal for the department as it claimed the lives of 115 personnel during the peak of infection in April-May 2021, as compared to 185 casualties during the peak of the first wave between July and September 2020. During the peak period of the second wave, a total of 10,034 policemen got infected by the virus, while 18,135 cops were infected during the peak of the first wave. Senior police officers attribute the lesser impact of the second wave on police force to the aggressive vaccination programme.“Adopting aggressive persuasion vaccination is one of the key reasons that are responsible for comparatively lesser casualties among police peronnel due to the deadly infection during the second wave. Emphasising on Covid-appropriate behaviour and conveying the importance of maintaining hand hygiene are also some of the factors that helped keep the number under control,” said Sanjeev Singhal, additional director general (administration), Maharashtra Police.Besides this, it has also been observed that at least 54 policemen from the state police force have died of Covid-19 despite receiving the vaccine. It also included 25 police personnel who were fully vaccinated. Surprisingly, of the total 54 deaths, 26 deceased police personnel had no comorbidities or past medical history. Senior officers believe that various factors could be responsible for this, including not adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour, ignoring symptoms and delay in treatment. A total of 135 policemen have died due to the virus between March 1 to June 30. Of these, 64 were suffering from comorbidities or had a past medical history. Diabetes, blood pressure, sugar were the most common among those cops who died of Covid-19. “There are cases of policemen having died of Covid-19 despite receiving the vaccines and also did not have any co-morbidities. But, that number is very less and the exact reason behind their deaths are yet to be established and analysed. But, this should not be seen in the context of the efficacy of the vaccines. The proportion of such cases should be looked at with the overall strength of the force or those who are vaccinated,” said Singhal.So far in Maharashtra, a total of 44,921 police personnel have been infected with the virus across the state while 485 cops have died of the infection. Currently, there are 442 active cases. Around 43,993 police personnel have recovered from the infection. Vinoy K Choubey, senior IPS officer who extensively worked in handling the first wave of the pandemic as joint commissioner of police in Mumbai, said, “There is no doubt that despite the increase in the prevalence of variants of concern, vaccination remains our most potent weapon to combat this scourge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/74-police-personnel-in-maharashtra-fully-vaccinated-101625854892867.html
09-07-2021||Mumbai||Senior IIT-B faculty involved in Covid-19 projects succumbs to post-virus complications||A senior faculty member of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), who was involved in multiple Covid-19-related research and innovation, passed away on Thursday.Rinti Banerjee, 50, professor in the biosciences and bioengineering department of the institute, succumbed to post-Covid-19 complications. She is survived by her husband and a son.Banerjee was spearheading three research projects on Covid-19 and had filed for multiple patents for the solutions designed.Last year, her team of one PhD and three post-doctoral research fellows developed a wash-resistant biodegradable coating for textiles for environment-friendly masks and PPEs. This coating, known as the Duraprot technology, crosslinks antibacterial and antiviral components onto the textile’s fibres through a simple dipping process.Duraprot is awaiting two patents. The technology was mounted on masks, which have now been commercialised. “Rinti Banerjee has undoubtedly been the brightest star among the Indian researchers in the area of biosciences. During this pandemic, she came up with several Covid-related inventions that have been commercialised also. She was quite young and held a lot of promise. It is not only a loss to her family and IIT-B, it is a great loss to the nation. The pandemic has snatched her from us too early,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B.Apart from her research, Banerjee also taught ‘Introduction to Bionanotechnology, Biomaterials, Advanced Biomaterials, Physiology for Engineers’ at IIT-Bombay. She joined the institute as an assistant professor in 2001.Banerjee’s colleagues and students, from various institutes, were shocked to hear of her passing. Kapil Punjabi, a post-doctoral research scientist, who worked with Banerjee said: “‘Certain things are not in our control Kapil,’ I remember these words from (Banerjee) madam while discussing one of my problems last year. I never knew she was giving a life lesson and preparing me for the worst expected. She plays an instrumental role in shaping my career, instilling in me the sense of pertinent research, genuine persona and dignified human being. The traits I shall forever be debt-ridden to her. Touching upon lives of hundreds of students I am sure each one is now bearing in them a part of your knowledge and continues the legacy of nanomedicine lab IIT-B.”Abhijit Majumder, an associate professor from the Chemical Engineering department, said, “We shared many committees and she always gave me very useful suggestions whenever needed. She was very approachable. I also invited her to our Navratri women in stem celebration in 2018.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senior-iit-b-faculty-involved-in-covid-19-projects-succumbs-to-post-virus-complications-101625854892192.html

The charge sheet contains statements of more than 20 witnesses in the case.NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said, “The charge sheet has been filed naming accused Sameer Khan, Ramkumar Tiwari, Rahila Furniturewala and her sister Shaista. 86 kgs of around 200 kg marijuana seized from Sejnani’s residence in Khar tested positive for narcotic drugs and psychedelic substance from a forensic laboratory in Gujarat.”In the first week of January, NCB got specific information and seized 340 grams of marijuana in three parcels from Universal Courier and Cargo at Bandra (West). In the follow up operation, officers got a lead about Sejnani and a raid was conducted at his residence in Jaswant Heights in Khar (West) on January 9. During the raid, the agency seized approximately 200 kilograms of imported strains of marijuana like OG Kush and curated marijuana. The agency then learnt about the Furniturewala sisters, following which officers raided their residence in Bandra and recovered contraband from there.The agency said the some of the contraband was sourced from the USA and some from local sources. The contraband was packed in the form of pre-rolled joints by Sejnani and was marketed to high-class clients in Mumbai and other states as well. Rahila Furniturewala provided financial and other aids to the smuggling activity, said an NCB officer.Sejnani, in his statement to the agency, alleged that he had supplied 500 grams of marijuana to city’s famous paan vendor Muchhad Paanwala. The agency then conducted searches at Tiwari’s shop and warehouse in Kemps Corner in south Mumbai and recovered curated marijuana. Tiwari was subsequently arrested in the case.During further probe, the agency found Sejnani’s connection with Khan and he was summoned for inquiry on January 13. After questioning for almost 10 hours, NCB arrested Khan in the case for allegedly purchasing the contraband from Sejnani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/200kg-marijuana-seizure-case-ncb-files-1-100-page-charge-sheet-101625854770919.html
09-07-2021||Lucknow||No aid to Bhojpuri movies promoting vulgarity, violence: Yogi||Expressing his concern over the increasing vulgarity in Bhojpuri movies, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council to stop grants to any such movies which promote obscenity and violence.“During my meeting with the chief minister (on Thursday), he (the CM) expressed his concern over the rising vulgar content in Bhojpuri films, especially songs. This is having an adverse effect on the society by promoting obscenity and violence among the youngsters . So, he has directed to stop aid to all those Bhojpuri films which promote vulgarity through dialogues or songs,” said Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council (UPFDC) chairman Raju Srivastava.“Currently, the state government gives 50% aid to Bhojpuri film-makers who shoot 75% of their films in Uttar Pradesh. But now getting this grant would not be that easy. Now, the state government has constituted a committee which will examine the content (script) and songs of films before deciding about giving grant to them,” Srivastava added.“Some directors may object to this by saying that they got their picture and content passed from the Censor Board but the UP government has the right to reject a proposal if there is some vulgar content in the film. This is hard earned money of people which is given for the making of a film. So, it cannot be given for the promotion of vulgarity or violence in the society,” he said.“Some Bhojpuri films and songs are so vulgar that they cannot be seen or heard while sitting with family and children. It is a matter of concern for anyone who loves this language. This kind of decadence in content putting a blot on Bhojpuri language and culture cannot be allowed,” he added.Earlier, actor-turned-politician and BJP MP Ravi Kishan had also expressed his concern over the growing vulgarity in Bhojpuri movies. He had also written a letter to the then Union I&B minister Prakash Javadekar and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath seeking a strict law to curb vulgar content in Bhojpuri cinema. He had said Bhojpuri movies had become “synonyms with vulgarity” which was a blot on the language and culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-aid-to-bhojpuri-movies-promoting-vulgarity-violence-yogi-101625854712350.html

09-07-2021||Mumbai||Finalise draft policy for naming airports after cities: Bombay HC to Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the civil aviation ministry to finalise the draft policy which proposes to name and rename airports after the cities they are located in, after it was informed that the policy had been pending for a long time. Referring to the recent protests held at Navi Mumbai by various groups demanding that the upcoming international airport be named after the personality of their choice, the petitioner filed a public interest litigation (PIL) saying it was against national interest and created unnecessary law and order situations, hence the system of naming and renaming airports after persons belonging to political or ideological groups should be discontinued. After hearing the petitioner, the bench observed that as the issue was pending since many years, the new aviation minister should take up the issue on an urgent basis and expedite the finalisation of the policy.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Filji Frederick, was informed that news reports had indicated that a large number of airports in the country were going to be renamed after historical and political personalities. This, he said, would create a lot of confusion especially among foreign tourists and hence the court should direct the Union civil aviation ministry to frame a policy for naming and renaming of airports and not to act on the proposals of various states for naming and renaming airports in their respective states. The PIL also sought restraining directions to the state from taking steps towards finalising the name of the upcoming international airport at Navi Mumbai till the ministry framed a policy. While making submissions, Frederick drew the attention of the court to the recent protests over naming of Navi Mumbai airport. He submitted that while one group had organised a human chain of 40,000 persons demanding naming of the airport after a local leader, another group had gathered nearly 25,000 persons demanding naming the airport after the personality they wanted. Frederick submitted that the second gathering had flouted Covid-19 norms and refusal of permission to conduct the protest. The HC pulled up the state for permitting such a congregation during the pandemic and also directed the newly-appointed panel of the aviation ministry to treat this issue on an urgent basis and expedite the finalisation of the policy. The PIL also refers to the March 13, 2018 announcement by the aviation minister about the draft policy guidelines for naming of airports had been formulated. Frederick’s PIL states that on June 10, he sought information under the Right to Information (RTI) Act from the ministry, seeking information about the outcome of a 2016 decision wherein naming airports as per city names rather than names of personalities was considered. The petitioner also sought information on the status of the draft policy for naming and renaming of airports.“It was widely decided that airports will be named after the city as then there is always this issue of people fighting over deciding on a name. It was considered that existing names will not be changed but new airports will be named as per their cities. It is not a written policy. It is only a procedure that is followed and there is a draft policy but nothing is finalised as yet, which needs to happen on urgent basis,” states the PIL.Thereafter, the court asked additional solicitor general Anil Singh to respond to the plea and said, “We would like to know the present position of the draft policy. We took the state government to task over the issue of naming the airport as there was a gathering violating Covid-19 protocols with nearly 25,000 people, who were protesting over naming of Navi Mumbai airport.”The bench referred to the newly appointed panel of ministers and said, “You have a new set of ministers now. Let the new aviation ministry take up the finalisation of the draft policy as the first thing to do.” Seeking a response from the civil aviation ministry, the HC posted further hearing to next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/finalise-draft-policy-for-naming-airports-after-cities-bombay-hc-to-centre-101625854710947.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||2 passersby killed amid firing near Bara Hindu Rao||: Two passersby were killed amid a firing after at least four unidentified assailants opened fire at a local builder and his nephew at a market in Filmistan near Bara Hindu Rao on Thursday night, said police. Though the builder and his nephew survived the alleged attack, tension gripped residents living in the crowded locality of north Delhi. The builder, Haji Naeem Ahmad Peer, and other locals said they heard at least half a dozen gunshots. The police said not more than three bullets were fired. One empty bullet shell and a cartridge were recovered from the incident spot, said police. One of the passersby, identified as Sanjay Rajput who was in his mid-twenties, was returning after visiting his extended family members in Shyam Gali, Azad Market. His family members said he used to visit the Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib almost daily and was presumably going there at the time of the incident. “When I met Sanjay in the evening, he told me he was going out. Around 11pm, we got a call from Sanjay’s friend who informed us about the incident. The police called us to the station and told Sanjay was dead,” said Jaipali Rajput, the victim’s aunt.The identity of the second dead man could not be ascertained till Friday evening. A case of murder and firing was registered at the Bara Hindu Rao police station. Four teams have been formed to ascertain the exact sequence of events leading to the firing, the motive behind it and to find the attackers, said police. Senior police officers associated with the case said preliminary investigation suggests the assailants had come to settle some scores with Peer and his nephew, identified by his first name Muneef.“We have got certain leads and our teams are working on it. As of now, we can say that there was an altercation between the assailants and the builder before the firing. We are exploring all possibilities to ascertain the exact motive behind the attack. The CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the crime scene are being scanned for clues,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.Recalling Thursday night’s horror, Peer said he was standing outside a nursing home owned by him, that is currently undergoing renovation, when a man wearing a black t-shirt stopped by and asked if the nursing home was administering Covid-19 vaccines. Peer said that he asked the man to visit Bara Hindu Rao hospital or a nearby dispensary, after which he left. Peer then sat in his Swift Dzire car and left with his nephew and his office staff Prakash.“Just a few metres ahead, the same man suddenly came in front of our car and signalled us to stop. We came out and asked him to move aside. When he refused, we pushed him aside. Suddenly, three more men joined him and got into an argument with us,” said Peer.According to Peer, some locals came to their rescue and overpowered the unidentified men. Peer and his nephew pacified the men and asked them to leave. The assailants opened fire at the uncle-nephew duo just when they were about to leave in their car. Peer said he rushed inside a local shop to save his life and saw the assailants chasing his nephew and firing at him. “My nephew somehow survived the attack. I heard five to six gunshots. After the firing stopped, I came out of the shop and found two men bleeding on the footpath,” said Peer.Police, however, could not ascertain where Prakash was at the time of the firing. Police said they received a call at 9.21pm and rushed the passersby, each of whom sustained one bullet injury, to a nearby hospital, where they were declared brought dead. Their bodies were preserved in the mortuary at the Bara Hindu Rao Hospital.The incident sparked fears among local residents who were in a state of panic even on Friday. “We are not aware of the motive, neither the circumstances in which the firing took place. However, this is certainly a matter of concern and shows that the area is not safe,” said a worker at a local garage shop without sharing his name. Police said they have learnt that Peer and Muneef were having a dispute over a 2,800 square yard property in Shahdara as they had allegedly sold half of it some years ago.

09-07-2021||Bangalore||IMD issues orange, red alert for Karnataka, predicts heavy rainfall in Bengaluru||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued red and orange alerts for Karnataka on Friday following widespread rainfall in Karnataka’s coastal regions. It said that a low-pressure area will be formed over the west and central regions in the coming days following which the IMD issued a red alert for July 11 and 12 and an orange alert for July 10 and 13.Capital Bengaluru will experience rain and thunderstorms in the next two days, IMD Bengaluru director CS Patil was quoted as saying by Livemint. An orange alert means heavy rainfall and a red alert means exceptionally heavy rainfall, according to the parameters set by the IMD.Patil said Shivamogga, Chikkmagaluru, Hassan and Kodagu districts received less rainfall between June 1-July 7, as a result of which popular tourist spot Jog Falls is drying up. Environmentalist Shankar Sharma has blamed the recent deficit in rainfall on the drastic reduction of forest cover. “One of the most important reasons behind this is drastically reducing forest cover. The problem is that none of the political leaders and the so-called intellectuals is bothered about that. We have to massively increase the forest cover in these areas,” Shankar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.According to the IMD, Shimoga, Udipi, Dakshin Kannada, Kodagu, Mysore, Hassan, and Chikmagalur have remained rain deficient regions this year based on data collected from June 1 to July 9. On the contrary, Bidar, Gulbarga, Belgaum, Bagalkot, Dharwad, Raichur, Koppal, Gadag, Bellary, Devangere, Chitradurga, Tumkur, Mandhya, Chamarajanagar, and Bangalore rural are among districts that experienced ‘excess’ to ‘very excess’ rainfall during the same time period.The IMD predicted that rain activity over both east and west coasts might increase due to the strengthening of the southwest monsoon over the Arabian Sea and a low-pressure area which is expected to form over the west-central and adjoining north-west Bay of Bengal around July 11. The increase in rainfall is likely to continue over the next 5 days. Maharashtra, Goa, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall between July 9 and July 12.However, the intensity and distribution of rainfall may decrease over the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/imd-issues-orange-red-alert-for-karnataka-predicts-heavy-rainfall-in-bengaluru-101625851904991.html

Over 25,000 acre land area has been covered under paddy in Rohtak and Jhajjar.Anup Kumar, of Mokhra village in Rohtak, said his paddy crop on four acre has been drying for the last one week and will be damaged within a week if there’s no rain.“The constant rise of diesel prices is causing misery for farmers. At such high prices of diesel, it is not possible to irrigate the fields. Only rainfall can save farmers,” he added.Surender Ahlawat, a farmer from Jhajjar’s Gochi village, said apart from delayed monsoon, power cuts, rising diesel prices have increased their problem.“Our paddy crop is drying due to water scarcity. Due to delayed monsoon, we have been running generators for 2-4 hours to irrigate our paddy fields but the diesel is getting out of our reach due to hike in prices. If there’s no rain in the region, our paddy crop will get ruined,” he added.Farmers in Bhiwani, Mahendergarh, Hisar and Charkhi Dadri are waiting for monsoon to sow bajra, moong and other crops.Satyawan Kumar, a farmer from Surpura Khurd village in Bhiwani, said they are eagerly waiting for rainfall to sow Kharif crops and are delaying it day-by-day.Jhajjar deputy director (agriculture) Inder Singh, who has additional charge of Rohtak, said the paddy crop will be damaged in many parts of Rohtak and Jhajjar by next week, if rain does not lash.“Paddy is a water-guzzling crop and is getting damaged due to hot summer and water scarcity. Delayed monsoon has brought misery to farmers and agricultural officials. Once paddy crop is damaged, it won’t survive even after rainfall,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delayed-monsoon-creates-problem-for-haryana-farmers-101625850693022.html

The INLD leader said being the leader of Opposition at that time, he had asked the CM during an assembly sitting as to why did he betray the people of the state by changing his decision.“It simply means that the CM did this to save Hooda. And the collusion between Hooda and the BJP came to fore when the government filed an affidavit saying there was no need for a CBI probe,” Chautala said.The INLD leader said SC appointed amicus curiae had also questioned the seriousness of the inquiry by a retired judge and even cited the Manesar land scam to say that the probe was conducted by the CBI under the same circumstances as the Uddar Gagan land release.On the other hand, the BJP-led state government gave an affidavit in the court that no comparison can be drawn between the Manesar land release and the Uddar Gagan case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uddar-gagan-land-release-sc-order-exposed-bjp-hooda-relationship-says-abhay-chautala-101625850091250.html

Punjab farm leader Ugrahan, who was in Hisar, said some people might have political interests, but the SKM will continue its fight against the three laws. “If anyone wants to polls, they may join any political party after the revocation of these laws. On the behalf of the SKM, I clarify that we will not get involved in politics. Our aim is revocation of these three laws,” he added.A delegation of farmers, including Ugrahan and Yudhvir Singh, met Hisar deputy commissioner for cancellation of FIRs registered against 350 farmers for staging a protest during Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s visit in May. The district administration had agreed to drop charges against farmers, after talking to farm leaders in May, and asked for a month to do so. .Yudhvir added that the local administration seems to be withdrawing from its promise. “Officials have now told us that they have initiated the process to cancel the FIRs, but the final decision will be taken by senior officials in Chandigarh. If the administration tries to betray us, we will launch a strong protest,” he added.Hitting out at Haryana deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and his grand-father OP Chautala, who got released from Tihar jail after completing his jail term in JBT teachers’ recruitment scam, Ugrahan said they will not allow OP Chautala to address farmers from their stage.“ One Chautala is sitting in the BJP’s lap and another one came out of jail.

Before joining politics, he worked in the co-operative sector. This ministry will help strengthen the co-operative sector in Maharashtra. The Modi government did a lot in the co-operative sector and gave packages to the sugar industry, also promoting ethanol.” The under-current behind that statement is that with the coop sector dominant in in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress party will need to use it as a stepping stone for any political machinations. Now with Shah in charge at the centre, he is likely to open the door for the BJP in the cooperative sector in Maharashtra to enhance the party base there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fadnavis-backs-shah-s-appointment-to-ministry-of-cooperation-101625849130663.html

Despite the mega announcement of ‘all under one roof’ concept of market place in 2018, residents living in the smart city area are disappointed. Kolte said, “We have five market places in the planning. One of them on survey no 85, which is behind Balewadi High street is ready to be handed over to PMC. The rest of them will soon be looked at by the procurement and processing committee.” In fact, one of the plots reserved for Market place under Smart city in Balewadi survey number 24, (work budget estimate ₹9,992,400) has turned into a garbage dumping area. According to residents in the area, the increasing garbage has become an eyesore and they have been hearing of a vegetable market coming up for many years. “I am not hopeful that anything will come out of smart city. They have been doing work without planning. There is nothing properly done, nor the roads or the footpaths, it is just adding to the expenses and it is wastage of money. Besides Aundh and Baner, Balewadi was supposed to be done together and they were to involve local communities, it was a good plan but not executed properly. If they had developed a market place, it would have removed the vegetable vendors on the foothpath, which is a problem for us as there is no space for to walk on. Now plot is used only as a garbage dump,” said Sarang Wable, Balewadi resident. The state of the other four projects is in a state of limbo. According to Arun Godbole, chief engineer, PSCDCL, “We have four more smart markets planned in 2018, even the tenders were accepted but due to non-availability of vacant sites, local issues and litigations, these projects are still on paper.” The smart market projects that are stuck are survey number 253 (estimated cost ₹9,225,503 subject to change) which is on Aundh DP road and partly in Baner needs special permission from PMC for the width of the road is less to make this market place. On survey number 89 in Baner ( ₹8,898,283), in Veer Bhadra nagar was stuck to due to local issues but it has been resolved and work will begin in August. On survey number 240 ( ₹1, 00, 921, 71) which is behind the Sai Heritage society on the new Aundh-Balewadi link road, the land is under litigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/smart-market-projects-move-at-snail-s-pace-residents-anxious-101625847750574.html

There are around 72 SEBC candidates who have applied from the open category. There are 365 students from other categories,” said Pandhare. These students from the last one year are forced to do odd jobs to meet both ends. “These aspirants have put in five to six years of their lives in studying and trying to crack MPSC. They have student loans on their heads and many are facing financial challenges due to the ongoing pandemic. Many have lost parents and are financially crippled due to medical expenses for treating Covid. In this situation, these students who have been selected should be given the post as soon as possible to solve their issues. They have worked really hard for this,” said Pandhare. After the protest on Friday, a letter with the demands was submitted to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. “The decision should be taken by July 31. Otherwise, we will be forced to take harsh steps. These students who are selected will be officials of the state machinery. As of now they are working in odd jobs just to make ends meet. A firm and decisive decision should be taken soon,” said Pandhare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mpsc-aspirants-protest-for-allocation-of-postings-101625847690574.html

An FIR was lodged against them on Friday, Patna’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Upendra Kumar Sharma said. This was the first time in which the hospital administration involved the local police to curb the menace of touts on the hospital campus, said IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal. “Of late, we received several complaints of touts being active on our hospital campus and misleading poor and gullible patients to private shops and health centres. This was also defeating the PM’s initiative to provide quality drugs at affordable prices through the Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadi Kendra (PMBJAK) on our hospital campus,” he said. “The touts would generally mislead the poor patients about the efficacy of the generic medicines available at the drug store or the investigations done at the IGIMS, and wean them away to private drug stores, pathological laboratories and radiological centres, where the charges were high. In return, the middlemen would pocket commission from private vendors,” said Dr Mandal. “We took help of the city superintendent of police and gave the police access to our CCTV control room to curb the tout menace, which was leading to anti-social activities and creating law and order problem on the hospital campus. The suspects were identified on the basis of the CCTV footage and the police in plain clothes caught the culprits red-handed on Thursday,” Dr Mandal said. The five arrested were identified as Sanjay Yadav of Jehanabad district, Sonu Choubey, Ravi Bhushan, Lala Prasad and Lallan Prasad from Patna. Some others managed to give the police the slip. The IGIMS has of late taken a few initiatives to curb the menace of touts on the hospital campus. Providing medicines to in-patients as part of a package system for any procedure requiring hospitalisation, online registration for outdoor patient department (OPD) consultation, opening of Amrit and Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi stores on the hospital campus are among some such initiatives. The Jan Aushadhi Kendra was opened on the IGIMS campus on September 24 last year. Quality generic drugs are available at this store at 75% less than the branded medicines sold in open market. The institute has already instructed its doctors to prescribe generic drugs to patients. The tout menace is prevalent in other state-run medical college hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-touts-held-for-cheating-patients-at-igims-101625846555581.html

Tej Pratap could not be reached for his comment.While Lalu Prasad’s younger son and leader of opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, is RJD’s heir apparent, Tej Pratap is known to be a staunch follower of Lord Krishna and prefers to spend time at Mathura. “Although he rarely visits the shop, he keep a tab on the business,” said Chowbey, who has been associated with the Hasanpur MLA for the last three years. “The business started in March, but had to be shuttered due to lockdown,” he said.Asked if the product launch was kept in abeyance for the release of Lalu Prasad, Chowbey said, “Sir (Lalu) is a big name,” he said, adding that there has been good response for the products. “There have been trade queries from Mumbai and Indore and it is being supplied to all parts of Bihar. At present, we are producing 19 flavours of incense sticks in the price range of ₹320 to ₹1020 for 200 gm pack and ₹170 to ₹530 for 100 gm pack. There is alsio a combo gift pack costing ₹2,000,” he said.“The incense sticks are made from flowers collected from temples and extracts from coconut leaves instead of bamboo. Maybe that’s why its price is high,” he says.In 2018, Tej Pratap, a former health minister of Bihar, was in news when he made a second attempt at launching his acting career with a Bollywood movie Rudra: The Avatar. The film is yet to be completed. He had earlier played the role of Bihar chief minister in a 2016 Bhojpuri film, Apaharan Udyog. This is not the first time products have been branded in Lalu’s name.In 2007, a diehard Lalu fan, Satish Singh, proprietor of Prakash Agro Industries, started manufacturing cattle feed called Lalu Pashu Aahar to be sold in international market. Singh’s industry was producing somewhere between 5300-5400 tonnes of cattle feed every month under the brand names Lalu Super, Lalu Bypass and Lalu Super Bypass.Singh later also applied for the sale of detergent powder in the name of Lalu Prasad the product lost way as the RJD chief lost power.In the past, saloons offering “Lalu-style” haircut, cosmetic boxes under the brand name of “Lalu Chale Sasural”, Lalu doll and Lalu chocolates have been common. “Lalu’s name still sells in rural Bihar. So what Tej Pratap is doing is not surprising. You cannot deny the acceptability of his name among the rural folks,” says Sambhu Singh, a retired government official. The BJP, meanwhile, was quick to take a dig. “Best wishes to Tej Pratap for his new business venture. The way he has been sidelined in the party, it’s good that he is looking for an alternative. Tejashwi can feel relieved because he is the worst victim of his brother’s tantrums,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Ananad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tej-pratap-sets-up-shop-for-pooja-items-under-lr-brand-101625846553440.html

The judge said the court cannot be asked to solve the internal party disputes.“Now it is very clear. If you want to press, it is your wish. I am clear this is inter-party dispute. You can exercise your remedies. You take your call..But the court cannot get into this dispute,” the judge said.“It is well settled that the right to regulate internal disputes of the House is the prerogative of the Speaker,” the high court said. “I find absolutely no merit in the petition. The petition is dismissed,” the court said.The high court, which was inclined to impose cost on Chirag, did not do so after a request was made by his counsel.Chirag’s petition, filed on July 7, had sought setting aside speaker’s June 14 circular showing the name of Paras as LJP leader in the Lok Sabha. Paras was inducted into union cabinet on July 7.During the hearing, advocate Arvind Bajpai, representing Chirag, said among the six party MPs, five wrote to the Speaker to recognise Paras as leader of the party in the House and directions were passed in this regard.Thereafter, the party chose to remove those five MPs and also approached the Speaker to take action and declare Chirag as the leader of the party in the House, he said. However, the speaker has not corrected the alleged mistake of recognizing Paras as the leader of the party in the House, he contended.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao for the speaker’s office vehemently opposed the petition saying Chirag was attempting to get the inter-party dispute resolved in the court.They said five out of six members of the party had approached the Speaker with the fact that Paras was the whip holder of the party and that the action of the Speaker cannot be faulted with.The court, while agreeing to the submissions of the counsels, said that it was not inclined to grant any relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-hc-junks-chirag-s-plea-against-uncle-paras-101625846550497.html

The road construction department (RCD) has already submitted the detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed bridge, estimated to cost ₹1,900 crore.Additional chief secretary (RCD) Amrit Lal Meena said the distance between the state capital and the historic and ecologically rich town of Bettiah would be reduced to just two-and-a-half hours. “The proposed road would boost tourists’ inflow to the West Champaran, where Valmikinagar Tiger Reserve is being developed as a hub of ecotourism,” said Meena.RCD minister Nitin Nabin, while lauding the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MoRTH) for strengthening the road network in the state, said the district magistrates (DMs) concerned had been asked to expedite the land acquisition process so that the NHAI could launch the ground work at the earliest. “More than 60% of land required for strengthening the road has already been acquired,” the minister said.A senior RCD official said the project, which envisages building road on 167 km, apart from nearly five-km-long bridge on Ganga, is expected to cost around ₹5,000 crore. “The best part of it is that entire expenditure would be borne by the NHAI, including that of the bridge. The state government was earlier scheduled to construction the bridge,” he said.The road, once completed, would benefit the people of Patna, Saran, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, East and West Champaran districts. Moreover, traffic load on JP setu, which is currently two-lane structure, would come down drastically once the four-lane bridge along the alignment of the existing bridge is built. The main bridge would be nearly 4.83 km long while its approach would be around five km. Officials said they would not require acquiring additional land for bridge as the RCD had already got the possession of it.Classification of Road: NH-139WLength of project: 167kmLength of bridge on Ganga: 4.83km (main structure)Length of approach road to bridge: 5kmProject cost: ₹5,000 croreDistricts to benefit: Patna, Saran, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, East Champaran and West Champaran||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-patna-bettiah-nh-gets-nod-to-cut-travel-time-to-2-5-hours-101625846551255.html

However, the NSCN (IM)’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution has been a delaying factor in signing a final deal on the protracted Naga political issue. The peace talks were suspended in April due to the prevailing Covid-19 related situation and are yet to be resumed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-lawmakers-panel-asks-centre-armed-groups-to-resume-peace-talks-without-preconditions-101625844091121.html

Nanital district administration has banned the entry of the two-wheelers on weekends to reduce traffic congestion and limit the number of people coming to the hill station. On Wednesday, while expressing serious concern over thousands of tourists inundating hill stations of the state without following Covid-19 norms, the HC directed the state government to review its decision to relax the lockdown during the weekends, saying “the tourists may bring in and introduce the dreaded Delta plus variant in the state”. The HC also directed the state government to take concrete steps to control the inflow of tourists in the state. “The steps, so taken by the state, should be informed to the public at large so that the potential tourists are informed about the steps being taken by the state,” it said. Informing about the measures to be taken in Mussoorie and other tourists places near Dehradun including Sahastradhara on weekends, Rawat said, “During weekends the tourists coming from outside the state to Mussoorie would have to produce negative RT-PCR report with mandatory registration on government portal and documents of their hotel booking at Kuthal Gate check post. Only those having these documents would be allowed.” “Also, only 50% of the tourists of the total capacity in the popular tourist spots of Mussoorie including Company Garden, Mall Road and others would be allowed on weekends,” said Rawat. He also said that the police would also stress awareness programmes in the hill town to make the people aware of following the Covid-19 precautions. “Under this, we would hold a meeting with the office-bearers of Mussoorie Hotel Association and ask them to make the tourists aware of the precautions at the time of booking. We would also run Covid-19 awareness messages on the public address system in Mussoorie to ensure that tourists follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said Rawat. The senior police officer also said that the local police would also put a barrier near another popular tourist spot of Sahastradhara near Dehradun on weekends to control the crowd. Meanwhile, the Nanital district administration had banned the entry of the two-wheelers on weekends to reduce the traffic congestion. “Nainital is witnessing a heavy footfall of tourists after relaxation in Covid curfew. Tourists, as well locals, struggle the whole weekend with traffic congestion and face road jams. Two-wheelers entry has been banned only on Saturday and Sunday to reduce the congestion of the traffic in the hill station,” said Dheeraj Singh Garbyal, district magistrate, Nainital on Tuesday. As per the decision taken by the district administration, two-wheelers of the tourists will be parked at Rusi and Narayan Nagar bypass parking spots on Haldwani road while two-wheelers coming from Bhowali will be stopped near cantonment area. Only two-wheelers of the locals will be allowed to enter Nainital but they will have to show an Aadhaar card or other documents. Tourists coming by two-wheelers will be provided shuttle service from the parking spot to Nainital the whole day. Four-wheelers will get entry and be parked on identified parking points as fixed by the administration, earlier. Nainital, like other hill stations, has been witnessing tourists travelling by two-wheelers in recent days. Locals of US Nagar, Rampur, Moradabad and Bareilly prefer to travel by the two-wheelers since they are considered cheap and can pass through the traffic congestion. Two-wheelers cause traffic congestion and problems to the police in maintaining the traffic system.

09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura police firing: Umranangal gives written consent for lie-detector test||Suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal on Friday appeared before a Faridkot court and gave a written consent to undergo the lie-detector test in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura firing case. The special investigation team (SIT) probing the case had filed an application in court last month, seeking permission to conduct narco-analysis, polygraph test and brain electrical activation profile of Umranangal besides former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and former Moga senior superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Sharma. However, Saini and Sharma refused to give consent, after which the SIT’s applications concerning the two were dismissed. Umranangal confirmed that he has given a written consent to the court, while requesting that his lie-detector test be conducted in line with the Supreme Court guidelines, which include medical check-up before the test. ‘Do Kunwar Vijay Pratap’s narco test too’Claiming that he has fully cooperated with investigation teams so far, Umranangal maintained that he was falsely implicated by the former SIT.“I am ready to undergo lie-detector test even five times if it brings out the truth. But (former IG) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh (who headed the former SIT) should also undergo narco test so that his true intentions could be revealed,” he said. Stating that he was sent to Kotkapura for mediation on the directions of the DGP, “because I served in the area on various posts and maintained good contact with the public”, the suspended IG said police had opened fire after protesters turned violent. “The firing and use of water cannons were done on the orders of the magistrate present on the spot. I will be responsible only if they can show any order issued by me,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-police-firing-umranangal-gives-written-consent-for-lie-detector-test-101625841090837.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi BJP chief threatens DJB chairman over severe water crisis||Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta on Friday said that if the "severe water crisis" in the national capital was not resolved in the next 48 hours, the state party unit would cut off water supply to Delhi Jal Board Chairman Satyendar Jain's house.Speaking during a press conference here, Gupta alleged that tanker mafia was "ruling the roost" under the Arvind Kejriwal government.He alleged that the AAP came to power in Delhi promising to eliminate tanker mafia active under the then Congress government but now the same mafia is ruling the roost under the Kejriwal government.He added that the Kejriwal government and his ministers will only realise how it feels to be without water when a minister's water supply is cut off.Gupta also claimed that the Jal Board, which was running at a profit of ₹800 crore, is now "in the red and in fact, on the verge of bankruptcy"."Lakhs of people in over 100 localities are not getting water and many of them are forced to buy it. In such a situation the BJP cannot remain a silent spectator and its workers will agitate in every nook and corner of the city to protest against the city government," the BJP leader said.On Thursday, Delhi BJP leaders and workers staged protests against the AAP government at different places across the city over the alleged water crisis.At the main protest venue near the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) headquarters at Jhandewalan, partymen led by Gupta staged a sit-in alleging lack of water supply in some areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-chief-threatens-djb-chairman-over-severe-water-crisis-101625835928453.html
09-07-2021||Patna||HC junks Chirag Paswan’s plea against Pashupati Paras’ appointment as LJP leader||The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan’s plea challenging Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s decision to recognise Pashupati Kumar Paras as the leader of the party in the Lower House, according to news agency PTI.Stating that there was no merit in the petition, Justice Rekha Palli said the court was inclined to impose a cost on Chirag Paswan but refrained from doing so after a counsel made a request to the bench. Paswan’s petition sought setting aside the speaker’s June 14 circular which displayed Paras’ names as the leader of LJP in the Lok Sabha.Paras was sworn-in as Union minister for food processing on July 7. Weeks ago, he had ousted Paswan as the party’s national president with the help of Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser.Chirag, son of late Union minister and founder of the LJP Ram Vilas Paswan, on several occasions, has expressed his disappointment over the event, accusing his uncle Paras of betrayal. During an episode of The Interview with HT last month, Paswan said that the five ‘rebel leaders’ betrayed what his father stood for.He also said that he had expected the Bharatiya Janata Party to be more vocal about the split in the LJP but Paras’ induction to the Union cabinet suggested otherwise. “The silence definitely hurts. I expected them to be a little more vocal. There are rumours that the local or state unit of the BJP may be involved in this,” Paswan said earlier in June. Paswan also blames Bihar chief minister and JDU supremo Nitish Kumar for engineering the split within the party.“It seems obvious but he may not be directly involved in this, but if his party workers were involved in this, and he remained silent that clearly shows he was supportive of them. It is Nitish Kumar and his partymen who have targeted not only my party but also my family members this time,” he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hc-junks-chirag-paswan-s-plea-against-pashupati-paras-appointment-as-ljp-leader-101625837143358.html
09-07-2021||Kolkata||Mukul Roy made chairman of PAC in Bengal assembly; BJP walks out||Mukul Roy, who has joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) but is still officially a legislator of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was made chairman of the public accounts committee (PAC) of the West Bengal assembly on Friday afternoon as the budget session came to an end. BJP lawmakers staged a walkout in protest, saying convention was violated because an opposition MLA is always made head of the PAC. The party had nominated Ashok Lahiri, former chief economic adviser to the Centre and lawmaker from Balurghat, for the post. “We did not nominate Roy for inclusion in the PAC. The ruling party wants to spend government funds and keep the accounts as well. This is autocracy. The speaker violated convention,” said Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the assembly. Defending the decision of speaker Biman Banerjee, TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “There is no rule which says an opposition leader has to be made the PAC chairman. It is only a convention. The speaker is the sole authority to select the chairman. He has done the right thing.”The speaker told the House that Roy was selected because of his experience.That Roy could be made the PAC chairman became somehow apparent on June 24 when chief minister Mamata Banerjee stoked speculations. “Anybody can file nomination papers for inclusion in the PAC. He (Roy) is a BJP member. He has been supported by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. If required, we will support him too. We will win if there is an election. Let people see who is more powerful. The speaker takes these decisions,” Banerjee told the media during a press conference. On Friday, no election was however held since the BJP had nominated six MLAs for inclusion in the PAC which has 20 members. The TMC had named 14 MLAs, said Adhikari. The BJP and the TMC got into a tussle on June 25 when Roy, who left the saffron camp and returned to the ruling party on June 11, filed his nomination for induction in the PAC. On June 18, the BJP submitted a petition before assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying Roy, the legislator from Kishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district, should be disqualified under anti-defection law as he did not resign from the BJP before switching sides. According to rules, it is the discretion of the speaker to select the chairpersons of the various committees in the assembly. The Bengal assembly has 41 committees of which the PAC is considered the most important one. On June 26, the BJP submitted a letter to the speaker saying Roy’s nomination should be cancelled because the party did not nominate him. Stating that the BJP may seek legal action, the letter said Roy should be disqualified under the anti-defection law. The decision to disqualify a member is taken only by the speaker. The Constitution does not specify any time frame for the process which involves inquiry and setting up of a committee. Adhikari, Mamata Banerjee’s protege-turned-adversary, joined the BJP in December last year and defeated her in the assembly polls. He filed the application for Roy’s disqualification. Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 and became the party’s national vice-president, returned to the TMC along with his son Subhranshu but did not officially resign from the BJP, said opposition leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mukul-roy-made-chairman-of-pac-in-bengal-assembly-bjp-walks-out-101625837612066.html
09-07-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Rest in peace Yusuf Uncle; Farewell Dilip Sahab||The dialogue whispered in sotto voce and controlled anguish; the eloquent heartbeat of a pause between sentences; the slight quiver of the Adam’s apple and flicker of a single eyelid; the trembling lower lip; that spoke of untold, inner torment; the robust, rustic body language and dialect of a rural lad… Modern India has grown up watching Dilip Kumar’s masterful performances in films like Devdas, Mughal-E-Azam, Sagina Mahato and Ganga Jumna in awe. “The history of Indian cinema would be written as before and after Dilip Kumar,” said Amitabh Bachchan, about the passing of thespian and Padma Vibhushan this week, adding that an “epic era has drawn a curtain”. *********************The patriarch of a large, vivacious clan, Kumar and his siblings, including sisters Akhtar, Farida, Fauzia, Saeeda and brothers Nasir, Ehsan and Aslam, the children of a fruit merchant family from Peshawar, were an uncommonly refined, affectionate and well-read clan. Kumar, a linguist, preternaturally erudite in Hindi and English, was deeply interested in politics, philosophy and the current affairs of his time, and like many of the brightest of his generation, was drawn to the Left. Above all, he was a man with a soft heart, someone who never forgot his old friends or his roots. “He was called Laaley by his close friends and, in turn, he addressed those he loved as Laaley di Jaan,” says Pinky Bhalla, daughter of iconic late actor Pran, who was among Kumar’s closest friends and his neighbour at Pali Hill. “Both dad and he hailed from the same north-western region and shared a love for Urdu, music and poetry,” she says. For Bhalla and her siblings, Kumar had been the consummate story-telling uncle who’d drop by often, sometimes accompanied by his sisters, and play rounds of dumb charades with them. She had been nicknamed ‘Princess Margaret’ by him and on her eighteenth birthday, he had presented her with a banjo and would encourage her to learn to play it. A great lover of languages — fluent in Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi, English, Bengali, Gujarati, Pashto, Persian and his first love Peshawari, actress Anju Mahendru, whose late mother Shanti hailed from the same region and had been a dear friend of Kumar’s, remembers how he insisted on only addressing her in Punjabi each time they met. Towards the end, when it appeared that he was having difficulty remembering people, Mahendru recalls how he would whisper in mock irritation to her “Thappad lagavan ga, Shanti di kudi hai”, when she would remind him who she was. Bakul Patel, wife of the late Congress majordomo and barrister Rajni Patel — one of Kumar’s closest friends ever since they struck up a friendship as dashing young campaign officers in Krishna Menon’s crucial Mumbai northwest elections in the Sixties, says what had drawn the two together had been a shared set of values. “They shared a common ideology and commitment to democratic, secular values and for equality for the socially disadvantaged,” she says, adding that her thoughts are flooded with memories of the charismatic Kumar. “He’d be the first to take part in our truck yatras across Mumbai, to collect clothes, blankets, medicines etc, for cyclone and other natural disaster relief. And I can never forget his childlike exuberance and whoops and whistles of joy at Rajni and my impromptu wedding, when he was asked to give me away as the bride.” *********************For my family, he’d always been Yusuf bhai, a dear friend of our parents, a frequent visitor to our home, someone who commanded our affection and regard, much the same way that PM Nehru had. Here too, there had been a shared worldview and ideology. In the early Sixties, Kumar, along with my father, award winning documentary filmmaker Rajbans Khanna and Raj Kapoor, Bimal Roy and BR Chopra, were signatories to a letter addressed to the Union government on the need for films that would promote communal harmony and national integration. “We have been discussing amongst ourselves, the possibility of using the medium of films to arouse and spread (the) feeling of national integration,” the letter had begun, going on to suggest a series of films on themes such as the Muslim weaver Sant Kabir, who became one of the leading lights of the Bhakti movement; prince Dara Shikoh, who translated 52 Upanishads; and the close bond of friendship forged between Muslims and Hindus during the Indian mutiny. When my father had passed away, Kumar had been among the first condolers to rush over that very evening, recounting stories of their shared regard for each other, even though they had not been in touch much, towards the end. Once, in the mid-Eighties, when he and Sairaji had chanced upon my mum and me, sunning ourselves on a pair of hammocks at the Taj Village in Goa, promptly an invitation had come to dine with the couple at their suite at The Aguada that evening, where, late into the night, he had regaled us with riveting stories from his childhood spent in his beloved Peshawar. And in the Nineties, when I had been commissioned by a network to anchor a talk show, he had swept us all off our feet when he’d arrived on the dot, to the modest studio where we were shooting, to record his interview. *********************There is something deeply gratifying about the poetic justice that despite facing much undeserved state harassment on numerous occasions on account of being a Muslim in the past, such as when in 1964 he was accused of being a Pakistani spy and later when he was awarded Pakistan’s highest civilian honour, Kumar was buried with full state honours, his body draped in his beloved Indian flag. Credit for this must also go to his wife Saira Banu, who cared for and protected him in equal measure, as a fiercely devoted wife and as the keeper of a national treasure, ensuring he received his dignity and due till the last. To witness such loyalty and love is in itself as rare, as it is edifying. In the end, people like Dilip Kumar with their all-expansive spirit, vibrant mind and peerless talent are those remarkable savants who invoke love and respect, in every heart they come by. So, rest in peace dear Yusuf uncle; farewell Dilip sahab; salute Dilip Kumar; it’s light’s out, cameras off and curtains down; but you will live on in our thoughts and hearts forever…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-rest-in-peace-yusuf-uncle-farewell-dilip-sahab-101625837371256.html

The accused were arrested on Wednesday after they were found illegally bringing 350 litres of IMFL, worth ₹5.50 lakh, by booking the parcel bogie of Shaan-e-Bhopal Express after paying ₹90,000 fees, Bhopal crime branch's Additional Superintendent of Police Gopal Dhakad told PTI.They secretly brought this stock of IMFL to Bhopal two days ago, he said, adding that since June 25, it was their sixth consignment that they brought to the Madhya Pradesh capital. The accused, Gajendra Rathore (36), Mukesh Mehra (32) and Subhash Soni (32), who were arrested following a tip-off, used to get these consignments from some persons in Delhi. The stock would be brought to MP in four- layered packing with ‘medicines’ written on the boxes, he said. Mehra used to sell the smuggled IMFL at his liquor shop at Panchavati area of Bhopal. Besides that, the three accused would also sell this alcohol to their customers individually, Dhakad said. The accused were produced in a local court on Thursday, which remanded them in judicial custody, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/3-held-for-smuggling-indian-made-foreign-liquor-smuggled-into-mp-from-delhi-101625836955070.html

09-07-2021||Bhopal||Man arrested for ‘forcing’ former live-in partner to change religion in MP||A 40-year-old man was on Friday arrested in Satna under Madhya Pradesh’s anti-conversation law after his former live-in partner of 15 years and the mother of their 13-year-old daughter accused him of raping her and forcing her to convert. Police superintendent Dharamveer Yadav said Rafi Khan has been booked under the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act and Indian Penal Code’s Sections 376 (rape) and 419 (cheating).“The 35-year-old woman filed a complaint that Khan met her 15 years ago and introduced himself as Rakesh Kushwaha. He was a friend of the woman’s husband, whom she married 16 years ago. They got into a relationship. Khan promised to marry the woman. The woman’s husband left her. ...Khan (later)...refused (to marry her) and convinced her to live with her without getting married.” Yadav said the woman has claimed she got to know about Khan’s real name and religion after their daughter was born. He added Khan allegedly sold the woman’s house and ended the relationship. Yadav said Khan would come to visit the daughter and the woman and wanted her to convert. “The woman ended the relationship with Khan, and he raped her many times,” Yadav said.Also Read | Madhya Pradesh board to hold special exams from September 1Yadav said Khan insisted the woman changed her religion long back, but he does not have any paper to prove this. “We are investigating whether the woman changed her religion or not.”Over 30 cases have been registered under the anti-conversation law that came into force on January 9. The law prohibits conversion by “misrepresentation, allurement, use of threat or force, undue influence, coercion, marriage or any fraudulent means”. Four petitions are pending against the law in the high court.Activists have questioned the law and alleged it has been enacted in Bharatiya Janata Party ruled states such as Madhya Pradesh to harass minorities. “In this case, how it possible that the accused has started harassing the woman to change the religion now. In many cases, women are using the law to end inter-religious relationships,” said LS Hardenia, who has filed a petition against the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/man-arrested-for-forcing-former-live-in-partner-to-change-religion-in-mp-101625834311106.html
09-07-2021||Lucknow||Trust purchases 3 Ayodhya temples for expansion of Ram Janmabhoomi campus||Among the oldest temples in Ayodhya, Kaushalya Bhavan, Fikerah Ram Mandir and Deen Kuti Mandir in the Ramkot area of the temple town have been purchased by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra for expansion of the Ram Janmabhoomi (RJB) campus, HT has learnt. Around 250 to 300 years old, these temples share their boundaries with the Ram Janmabhoomi campus. Out of the three, the Fikerah Ram Mandir is the biggest and falls inside the periphery of the Ram Janmabhoomi campus while Deen Kuti Mandir is the smallest. Mahant Kaushal Kishore Tripathi and Mahant Yashoda Nandan Tripathi aka Mahant Lalluji, the two brothers who own the Kaushalya Bhavan spread over 15 biswa or 1881 square metre land (1 biswa = 125.419104 sq metre), are preparing to leave the place and hand it over to the Trust. The Tripathi brothers live there, along with their family members, including grandchildren. The Trust has given ₹4 crore to owners of the Kaushalya Bhavan along with alternative land and ₹3.70 crore to Mahant Raghuvar Saran of Fikerah Ram Mandir along with alternative land. The Trust has given nine biswa land in the Ramkot area and 5.5 biswa land at Bag Bijaisi to the Tripathi brothers and nine biswa land in the Ramkot area to Raghuvar Saran of Fikerah Ram Mandir. “(Trust general secretary) Champat Rai, Ayodhya mayor and (Trust member) Anil Mishra came to meet us to request for the handover of the Kaushalya Bhavan for expansion of the Ram Janmabhoomi campus,” said Mahant Yashoda Nandan Tripathi. “For ages, people were waiting for the Ram Mandir to come up in Ayodhya. Now, when the temple is being constructed, the Trust wants our land for expansion of the Ram Janmabhoomi. We have handed over (sold) the property to the Trust,” added Tripathi. “The Trust had requested to hand over these temples for expansion of Ram Mandir as they are in close proximity to the Ram Janmabhoomi complex. Their owners have agreed, and the Trust has also compensated them,” said Mahant Dhinendra Das, member of the Trust. Animesh Tripathi, grandson of Mahant Kaushal Kishore Tripathi, who is an engineer by profession, said, “Change is the only constant in life. As the Ram temple is coming up, it was necessary to vacate the place.” Animesh, who worked in Mumbai, lost his job due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After the lockdown in Mumbai, he returned to Ayodhya and will remain here till he gets another job. Mahant Raghuvar Saran of Fikerah Ram Mandir, which is spread over 21 biswa or 2,633 sq mt land, is nowadays busy with the construction work at the new place allotted by the Ram Mandir Trust in the Ramkot area where he will shift in order to relocate the temple. “My temple is inside the Ram Janmabhoomi. I had no option but to accept the Trust’s offer to sell the land for expansion of Ram Mandir,” said Mahant Raghuvar Saran. “But I had demanded an alternative land in the Ramkot area only for my new temple. I did not want to move out of this locality. As I have to vacate the place at the earliest, I am busy with construction work at this new place,” said Raghuvar Saran while giving instructions to labourers at the site. The Trust has purchased Deen Kuti Mandir for ₹30 lakh from Mahant Sant Das. However, around 10 days ago, Das passed away. Before his death, Sant Das handed over the amount to his followers. The Trust is in the process of purchasing around four-five houses in the Ramkot area that are close to the Ram Janmabhoomi campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/trust-purchases-3-ayodhya-temples-for-expansion-of-ram-janmabhoomi-campus-101625833232020.html

In 2014, a girl was born to the couple. However, the second wife left for her parents’ along with the child in 2014 after the man allegedly started torturing her. The man got married for a third time. In March 2020, he got the girl’s custody after an official separation from his second wife. That was when the alleged torture began.His ex-wife said that social activist Md Jamil Akhtar, with the help of NGO Childline, rescued the girl.“My daughter told me that she was beaten with broom and kicked often. Why did he (ex-husband) take her custody if he had to torture my daughter? They must be punished for subjecting the child to such torture,” she said.Childline director Benudhar Senapati said, “Her father and stepmother took out their frustration on her. They used to beat her every day,” he said.The man, however, dismissed the allegations of torture and attributed his daughter’s poor health to psychological stress. “She inflicted the injuries on herself by putting her fingers into boiling milk when I was away,” he said.Police said apart from attempt to murder charges, the couple has been charged under relevant Sections of Indian Penal Code and Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-couple-arrested-on-charges-of-torturing-man-s-minor-daughter-101625830050474.html

That is why the BSP has decided to not contest both these indirect elections,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister wrote on Twitter.Hitting out at the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP over its “verbal opposition” to the Yogi Adityanath government in the state, Mayawati said the former was known for similar abuses of power to win elections. “The SP's attack on the BJP government is very deceiving and unbelievable because the SP regime was known for similar abuses of power deployed to win elections at all costs. People have not forgotten anything," she added.Also Read: Violence mars filing of papers for block panchayat chief in UPUP reported incidents of firing, clashes and stone pelting from 17 blocks on July 8 as the process of filing of nominations for the election of block panchayat heads were underway at 825 blocks across 75 districts. A fight broke out between the BJP and SP in Unnao’s Purwa block with the son of the BJP candidate accusing the SP nominee and her supporters of robbing him.The BJP won the zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls on July 3 after 67 of the 75 seats went to candidates backed by the party. The SP had boycotted the polls citing misuse of power. “The BJP demolished all democratic norms to manufacture a win.

09-07-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Farewell to the accessible humane prince, and long live the emperor’s work||Honest, earnest, hard-working and loyal. That’s the kind of people I grew up with. That’s also the kind of people I watched in movies. Real, down-to-earth people with lives I could relate to, with struggles I knew were plausible, and with little joys and triumphs that weren’t exaggerated or far-fetched. Like Shankar and Krishna’s story in Naya Daur.In Bombay of the 1970s, movies were something we watched on a cloth “screen” stretched across the road between two buildings near our society’s community hall. Everybody sat on the road and watched whatever was up. Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor movies were a big draw, movies from the 1950s and 1960s. Occasionally, we got an Amitabh Bachchan movie that was relatively recent. Sometimes of a Sunday, we went to a neighbour’s house to watch the black and white movies broadcast by Doordarshan - very few had a television back then. Prithviraj Kapoor, Sohrab Modi and Dilip Kumar movies were frequent Sunday treats.In 1978 we got our own Dynora black and white television and from then on we would not just watch, but also invite neighbours and friends over (which was the whole point at that time, what one had, one shared); equally important, we could discuss the movies at home. The significance was that we got first-hand insight into characters and circumstances, since my father and my uncles and aunts grew up in Banaras (Varanasi) and Delhi in the same time period, and in similar economic strata as portrayed by many of the movies. Our family circle in Bombay comprised getting-to-middle class families from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Assam, among other states and thus, the movies meant something to me, as if the stories were related to the struggles and aspirations of my family’s previous generations and of the people around me. Most importantly, the values reflected by the characters Dilip Kumar played, resonated with us. Naya Daur was an extraordinary movie in many ways and of course, the writer and director were instrumental in crafting that. And I remember the movie as much for the stories of Krishna and Shankar, as for Rajni and Manju. The impact of the movie was that I used to watch it every time it came on TV and since YouTube came into the scene, I watch specific clips on demand - I watched the final race scene earlier this week.Earlier this week, I originally searched for two bhajans penned by Rajinder Krishan and sung by Mahendra Kapoor (Ramchandra kaha gaye Siya se) and Mohammad Rafi (Sukh ke sab saathi, dukh mein na koi). Both were part of the movie Gopi, portrayed on screen by Dilip Kumar (who played Gopi). Again, it is the values and relationships that were the hook, but also an underlying method of education about family and social interaction. This was a masterclass performance in the middle years of his career and all this happened before I was even born, but relevant enough to have an influence on me and my siblings and friends, as I discovered later in life. Dilip Kumar was of course the screen name of actor Muhammed Yusuf Khan. My father greatly admired the craft of Yusuf Khan and one day in the mid-1980s, when we were in Delhi and had relatives over (many of them his colleagues from theatre), there was a debate on actors and their techniques, and he said in exasperation: “To understand how great an actor he is, you must watch Sagina Mahato. Then you’ll understand that the others you watch are actors, because you can’t look beyond them; but Sagina is Sagina, not Dilip Kumar. That’s an honest performance.” He was referring to the 1970 Bengali film by Tapan Sinha about the labour movement wherein, Dilip Kumar played the central protagonist. As an earnest listener to a similar debate in our house, I discovered Yehudi (starring Dilip Kumar and Sohrab Modi), which was a Bimal Roy remake of a Premankur Atorthy movie, which in turn was a screen adaptation of an Urdu/Hindi play about persecution of Jews in the Roman Empire.Dilip Kumar served as a more pragmatic reference in my life in the late teens, since my parents used to frequently remind me, “Of course you have a crush, but don’t become Devdas and waste your life!” This was because Dilip Kumar’s Devdas was frequently watched and discussed in our house, especially every time a young family member found themselves down romance lane.I saw him once, fleetingly, at an award function in the 1990s, as I was picking up empty glasses discreetly in my black and white uniform. He had looked into my eyes for a brief second and smiled to acknowledge the existence of a waiter. I never forget that moment, because it taught me that he was an earnest and accomplished artiste because he was an earnest and considerate human being first. Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) Khan’s career spanned six decades; he acted in more than 60 films, won numerous industry awards and several civilian honours, including the Padma Bhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke Award and Padma Vibhushan. But, his legacy lies far beyond the accolades and numbers. If there was ever an actor whose work was art and not entertainment, I would aver it was Dilip Kumar. His singular purpose as an actor seemed to have been to help others experience what the world may be like for different people, in different circumstances, and to achieve a sense of oneness through a universal experience. He portrayed the life of human beings in their many facets, efficiently underlining the palpable struggle between an individual’s personal emotions, moral callings and social responsibility. Farewell to the accessible humane prince then, and long live the emperor’s work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-farewell-to-the-accessible-humane-prince-and-long-live-the-emperor-s-work-101625827590780.html
09-07-2021||Kolkata||Cops begin fresh probe into alleged suicide of Suvendu Adhikari’s guard in 2018||Police in West Bengal have started a fresh probe into the alleged death by suicide in 2018 of a security guard of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari. “We have received a complaint from the victim’s wife on Wednesday. On the basis of that complaint, we have registered a case under section 302 (murder) of IPC (Indian Penal Code) against unknown persons,” said Amarnath K, police superintendent, Purba Medinipur district. Police said the guard allegedly shot himself with his service revolver in October 2018 when Adhikari was a minister in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s previous government. The guard succumbed two days later.Adhikari, who defected to the BJP ahead of this year’s state assembly elections, defeated Banerjee from Nandigram even as her Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept back to power. A protégé-turned-adversary of Banerjee, Adhikari is now the leader of the opposition in the state assembly.Also Read | NHRC member says Bengal police ‘threatening’ victims of post-poll violencePolice said the guard’s widow, in her three-page complaint letter, demanded a fresh probe into her husband’s death. She could not be contacted for comments. In her complaint letter, she wrote: “From the beginning, I had doubts about my husband’s death. As Adhikari was a powerful man both at the state and district level, and I used to stay with my two daughters, I could not gather the courage to say anything. But now the situation has changed, and I thought I may get justice.”The complainant wrote when her brother-in-law raised doubts over the “suicide theory”, a close aide to Adhikari told them that the latter was unhappy. The aide, Rakhal Bera, was arrested in June in connection with a job racket.TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said the guard died under mysterious conditions. “His wife does not believe in the theory that was put forward to explain the death. She thinks that the probe was influenced and hence has demanded a fresh probe. She has also named Rakhal Bera.”Adhikari could not be contacted for comments. The BJP questioned whether the probe was influenced by Banerjee. “They are referring to a case which is three-year-old. At that time too TMC was in power. Mamata Banerjee was the chief minister, and the state home department was under her. If the investigation was influenced at that time, then the allegation is directly against Banerjee,” said BJP leader Jay Prakash Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cops-begin-fresh-probe-into-alleged-suicide-of-suvendu-adhikari-s-guard-in-2018-101625827292349.html

09-07-2021||Kolkata||To avoid crowds amid Covid, no raths for dieties in yatra this year in Kolkata||For the first time in 50 years, Lord Jagannath, Balram and Goddess Subhadra would be travelling in a convoy of 15 vehicles, comprising trailer-trucks, instead of chariots, coming Monday as a part of the annual rath yatra organised by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Kolkata.The yatra will also be taking an undisclosed route to avoid large public gathering amid the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee would not be attending the ceremony but would be sending bhog and her offerings on Monday. “This is for the first time that Lord Jagannath, Balram and Goddess Subhadra would be travelling in a convoy. Pilot cars of the city police would move in front. Usually, they travel in three chariots which are pulled by devotees and thousands of citizens. We are not even disclosing the route that the convoy would take to avoid any gatherings of devotees on both sides of the road,” said Radharaman Das, vice president of ISKCON, Kolkata. While the idols would be travelling in one trailer-truck with a small temple-like structure set up, the other vehicles would be carrying their outfits, puja paraphernalia for nine days, servants and pujaris. “The last time we held a rath yatra was in 2019. In 2020, we had to cancel it because of Covid-19. The deities were taken from one room to another inside the ISKCON premises in Kolkata as a symbolic rath yatra,” he said. On Monday, the convoy would start from the ISKCON temple and reach ISKCON house which is the ‘Gundica Mandir’ around three kilometres away. “On July 20, on the day of ulta rath yatra, the convoy would return to the temple again, guided by the police pilot cars. During their stay at ISKCON house for nine days, only a limited number of devotees will be allowed darshan,” said Das. ISKCON authorities had planned a mega celebration this year which coincides with the 50th year of the rath yatra in Kolkata, but those had to cancelled because of Covid second wave. While West Bengal is reporting a little less than 1,000 new cases every day, Kolkata is logging 80- 90 new cases daily. In Odisha, the state government had announced that the annual rath yatra in Puri would begin on July 12 and will take place without devotees. The Supreme Court this week refused to allow rath yatras in cities other than Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/to-avoid-crowds-amid-covid-no-raths-for-dieties-in-yatra-this-year-in-kolkata-101625826150660.html

There are 21 ministers, including the chief minister, in the Cabinet which can accommodate up to 30 ministers. People familiar with the development said Maken met AICC president Sonia Gandhi before coming to Jaipur on Tuesday. He will meet the party high command with the chief minister’s suggestions and return to the state next week. The demands for political appointment and Cabinet reshuffle gained momentum after reports of resentment in the camp led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who along with 18 MLAs rebelled against the leadership of Ashok Gehlot last year.Also Read | Cabinet reshuffle and political appointments in Rajasthan is work in progress: Ajay Maken“The reshuffle is possible this month as the assembly session would begin next month. Earlier, the session was to be called this month but was postponed, possibly because of the reshuffle,” said a senior party leader. On Tuesday, Maken made it clear that the meeting with the CM would focus on Cabinet reshuffle and political appointments. “The exercise on Cabinet reshuffle and political appointments in Rajasthan is a work in progress. It means that discussions with all are being held,” he said. When former deputy CM Sachin Pilot was asked about the reshuffle on Wednesday, he said that Maken’s word should be taken seriously as he is the representative of Sonia Gandhi and general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan. Sources claimed that Pilot and his supporters have conveyed that there would be no negotiations over what was promised to them. Last year’s patch-up between Gehlot and Pilot factions happened after assurances from the Congress’s central leadership that the latter’s supporters will be suitably accommodated. A leader from the Pilot faction said this time it’s not about numbers in the Cabinet but power-sharing. “Eyeing assembly elections next year, the party want to douse all the small fires, be it in Punjab, Haryana or Rajasthan,”he said. People close to Gehlot said their leader wants no faction in the party and the selection for the Cabinet should be on the basis of merit, social engineering, and regional representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/ajay-maken-visits-rajasthan-cabinet-reshuffle-on-the-cards-101625817510000.html

The submission was made in connection with MCGM’s appeal against a National Green Tribunal order penalising the corporation for pollution in water bodies.The corporation said 90% of the work on the plant is complete and that it will have a capacity of about eight megalitres per day. The plant will be fitted with the requisite sequencing batch bioreactor technology to divert the flow of untreated sewage away from the lake.The lake, which has a large population of fish and crocodiles, is the only major notified wetland in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, as per the amended wetland rules 2017. A Maharashtra State Angling Association study in March found dead fish floating in the lake. The fish died due to fluctuating dissolved oxygen levels that lead to a proliferation of blue-green algae, which can be harmful to the fauna. Pollution levels in the lake are believed to be eight times above the permissible standards. Satellite images have also shown a significant reduction in the water surface over the last three years apparently due to the growth of water hyacinths, which are known to have adverse effects on overall biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems.Officials declined to comment saying the matter is sub-judice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sewage-treatment-plant-near-powai-lake-to-be-operational-by-december-101625806169348.html

This covers 58% of such schools -- the state has 45,625 government-run upper primary schools, which are for Class 6-8 students, in 75 districts. The government has also sanctioned ₹488 crore for the same, of which ₹327 crore has been released, said state education department officials. The procurement has been duly approved by the project approval board of the Union education ministry too, they said. “The government believes that the furniture would help improve classroom pedagogical practices, instil self-confidence among students and also generate pride in them for their institution. The government also hopes that the move would spur admissions in government schools,” said a senior official of the basic education department.Also Read | Uttarakhand to review decision to stop Kanwar Yatra amid Covid-19Divisional assistant director (basic education), Prayagraj, Ramesh Kumar Tiwari said the furniture would be procured from the government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal overseen by a committee headed by respective district magistrates. “The furniture would be child-friendly and provide adequate space between the desk and the chair, keeping in mind the different age groups of the students,” he explained. They said the stress is on safe, comfortable and quality furniture made with hollow circular pipes instead of the old-style angle iron frames that could cause injury to students. The furniture would also have adequate space for students to keep their school bags, books and notebooks besides water bottles, said a government directive. As many as 687,036 pieces of furniture are being procured for 26,599 upper primary schools as part of this exercise. “In Prayagraj, 16,791 pieces of furniture for 599 upper primary schools would be procured.

09-07-2021||Delhi||Kitty Kumaramangalam’s murder: Laundryman got ‘tempted’ by locker in almirah||The one mistake that cost south Delhi resident Kitty Kumarmangalam (70) her life was to trust her laundryman enough to allow him inside the house whenever he returned with the elderly woman’s clothes, investigators said on Thursday.Laundryman Raju Lakhan Kanojia, arrested for the murder of Kitty Kumarmangalam, wife of former Union minister P Rangarajan Mangalalam, told police that he often went inside her house and kept the clothes in her almirah. What he saw inside became a source of envy that ultimately triggered him to become a murderer, a police officer, who questioned Kanojia (24), said on Thursday.Kitty’s husband was the Union minister of power between 1998 and 2000 during the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.Raju told police he knew the woman was a minister’s wife and thought she had money stored in a small detachable locker inside the almirah. On Tuesday night, Raju and his two accomplices, Rakesh Raj and another person Suraj (identified by his single name in police records), murdered Kitty, assaulted her domestic help, and fled with cash, jewellery and the small locker.Police arrested Raju and Rakesh Raj,34, while Suraj is on the run. Rakesh and Suraj work as drivers. Till late Thursday night, police were conducting raids in different places across the city to arrest Suraj.“He said he was always curious about the small detachable locker in the almirah. He stole that too on Tuesday. The elderly lady (Kitty) did not believe that Raju, who she had seen for so many years, could rob her. Maybe this is why, the kind lady trusted him and allowed him inside. Usually, people don’t. Raju said that he had seen cash and the locker, whenever he put the cleaned clothes back in the almirah. Greed had struck him in the past. This greed, coupled with intoxication from drinking with his friends at the PVR Priya market, emboldened him to murder and rob her,” the investigating officer cited above said on condition of anonymity.The questioning of the two arrested men revealed that after the murder, the three rode to a wooded area on Nelson Mandel Marg and shared the stolen cash and jewellery. They shared around ₹80,000 each. While hiding in the bushes, the three also used a stone to break open the small locker but found only papers inside.“We have recovered the stolen locker along with the papers. It is a part of case property and is strong evidence that we have gathered against them,” the officer added.The murder came to light around 10.10pm on Tuesday when Kitty’s domestic help, Mithila,33, whom the three men had strangled with a belt and left for dead, woke up and called her husband. Her husband alerted the neighbours, who then informed the police. Mithila told police that at 8.10pm the three men entered Kitty’s second floor house in A block, overpowered the two women, strangled her with a belt in one room, and smothered Kitty to death with a pillow in another. Kitty died on the spot.While prime accused Raju is in police custody, his family members who live in the nearby Bhagwan Singh camp -- a slum cluster next the posh Vasant Vihar area -- refuse to believe that the 24-year-old could be a murderer. Police said Raju confessed he and his friends Rakesh and Suraj needed money, so they readily agreed to assist him. Raju’s mother, Geeta Kanojia, said, “We earn about ₹20,000-25,000 from washing and ironing clothes. We are told that he stole about ₹2 lakh. My son could not have done this. We refuse to believe he is a murderer.”But police believe they have all the evidence to pin the murder on the three men. Police will file a charge sheet against the three men in the next 60 days. Laundryman Raju and his accomplice Rakesh are currently at the Vasant Vihar police station. A city court on Thursday sent them to three days’ police custody.Other laundrymen who live and work in the bylanes of A block in Vasant Vihar are in fear. They believe they will forever be seen with suspicion. Geeta Ram,74, who runs a small ironing shop in the bylane next to Kitty’s house, said, “I have lived here for more than 50 years. All my life, my wife and I have climbed the stairs in these buildings and taken clothes for laundry. This is the first time that a laundryman murdered his own employer. Because of this one case, we will be viewed with suspicion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kitty-kumaramangalam-s-murder-laundryman-got-tempted-by-locker-in-almirah-101625782559751.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||DU yet to verify caste certificates submitted by aspirants in 2020||Delhi University (DU) is yet to verify caste certificates submitted by students last year even as it was set to begin the admission process for the current session, officials privy to the matter said.After the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last year, DU shifted to online admissions. Students who sought admission under the SC/ST and OBC quota submitted an online copy of their reservation certificate on DU’s admission portal. The university announced that it will perform a “forensic verification” of documents once students join the campus and submit the original copies with their respective colleges. However, due to the pandemic, in-person classes are yet to begin.Last year, around 70,000 students applied for seats under the OBC quota, 42,000 in SC quota, 8,600 in the ST category, and 10,173 sought admission under the EWS category.According to the reservation policy of India, 50% of the total seats are reserved for OBCs (27%), SCs (15%), and STs (7.5%) in government educational institutions and government jobs. Besides, the Centre has introduced a quota for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) this year as well.DU colleges forensically check certificates submitted by students at the time of admission, and any forgery leads to cancellation of admission.Hansraj Suman, the chairperson of the forum of academics for social justice and a former academic council member, said, “We have raised the demand of verification of reservation certificates with the university vice-chancellor and Dean of Colleges because in the past we have seen admissions based on fake caste certificates. In the last several years, fake caste certificates of SC, ST, and OBC quotas were found in colleges. What if the same has happened this year as well?”Explaining the process in the previous years, Suman said, “At the time of admission college first verifies the certificates on its own with the help of experts. It then sends the certificates to the authorities who had issued the certificates to verify them. After that, they confirm the admission of students. Nothing like that happened last year due to the pandemic. This can lead to chaos later.”DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani confirmed that the verification has not been done so far. “Even the government offices that could have verified the certificates remained closed for a long time due to Covid-19,” he said.Principals of several colleges said that they will have to cancel the admission of students, if their documents are found to be fake at any point in time. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “We have accepted the self-attested copies of documents of students. In case, they are found to be fake at any point of time, we will have no option but to cancel the admission of such students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-yet-to-verify-caste-certificates-submitted-by-aspirants-in-2020-101625781814596.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||‘Tweaking Class 10 marking plan will hurt our image’: CBSE tells high court||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday told the Delhi high court that any direction to the board for tweaking its policy of evaluation or publication of results will hamper its credibility, besides being disadvantageous to the students as well.In an affidavit filed before the court, the central board defended its assessment scheme devised for Class 10 students against a petition by an NGO which alleged that aspects of the evaluation plan were unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students.The Class 10 board exams were cancelled on April 15 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The board announced an assessment scheme for the students on May 1. However, several teachers and students called the policies flawed, saying that they were unfair to meritorious high scorers whose marks will likely be standardised downwards based on the average performance of their school.An NGO, Justice For All, challenged the assessment in the high court. According to its petition, the moderation policy will be “an injustice to the students as the performance of school [is] not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student”.In its affidavit, the board said that in no manner any school will be able to take undue benefit from the policy. It said that if schools ignore the need to ensure that the average marks in each subject are within 2 marks of the subject-wise average reference year marks, according to the petitioner, it will damage the credibility and image of the CBSE across the globe resulting in disadvantage to the students in future.On May 1, the CBSE released a special marking scheme for Class 10 students stating that their results will be tabulated based on their performance in unit tests, half-yearly examination, and pre-board examination conducted by schools.The board, however, said each school should keep a check on inflation of marks and award marks in consonance with its best performance in Class 10 in the last three academic years--2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.The selected year will be the reference year for the schools, and subject-wise marks allotted by the schools for 2021 will be within a range of + or - 2 marks obtained by the school in the subject in the reference year. The board has also said that the overall average marks of the schools for 2021 should not exceed the overall average marks obtained by it in the reference year.However, a plea by an NGO Justice for All through advocates Khagesh Jha and Shikha Sharma Bagga challenged the policy saying that the moderating of the average marks assessed by the school, based on the historical performance of the previous average result of the school, in terms of the best overall performance would be injustice to the students as the performance of school is not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student.”It has also said that moderating the marks in consonance with the overall average score of the district, national and state average “was absolutely unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students of a school which would appear in the board exams for the first time”, with no previous data of performance. The NGO has alleged that it can also lead to the manipulation of marks and exploitation, extortion of the students and parents.Defending its scheme through an affidavit, CBSE has said that the policy has been prepared by a team of experts from the schools, CBSE and it has been kept in mind that no school should be able to do injustice with the students and marks be awarded based on the learning of the student.“Also, the result should not be more than the best result of the past three results. Accordingly, while allowing moderation to the result committee, limits have been fixed. Responsibility has been given to the Result Committee for ensure just, fair and reliable result. Similar policy with extended liberty has been extended in Class-XII policy which has already been approved by the Supreme Court,” the CBSE said.It said that the petitioner had failed to show “any ex-facie perversity or illegality in the process adopted in the evaluation policy”.“…there is neither any illegality in the Evaluation Policy for Class X nor there is any arbitrariness in the Wednesbury sense or unreasonableness or illegality,” the board said.It also said that school management has no role to play in evaluation of students which has to be done by the Result Committee having external members as well adding that there are various checks in the Evaluation Policy for Class X in the form of verification of records by CBSE.It contended that the record would be sealed under the signature o f all members of the Result Committee, kept in the safe custody of the principal.“Further, the said Evaluation Policy provides that in cases where the school deliberately indulges in practices that are not consistent with fair, unbiased and objective practices of assessment, the answering respondent will take serious actions against such schools including action of disaffiliating the said school and/or imposing penalty against the school,” the reply read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tweaking-class-10-marking-plan-will-hurt-our-image-cbse-tells-high-court-101625781602593.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s driving test tracks set for slew of reforms||The Delhi state transport department is rolling out a plan aimed at improving services at its automated driving test tracks by introducing an electronic queue management system, increasing operation timings, allowing people to take driving tests on all days of the week, and reducing human intervention in the testing process.The department floated a tender on Thursday to outsource the operation and maintenance of all ADTTs in the city, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.“The idea is to offer a comfortable experience to applicants who visit our regional transport offices (RTOs) to give driving tests for a permanent driving licence (DL),” said Gahlot.“To give an example, the experience will be similar to what one witnesses during visa application for countries like the UK or Japan. Currently, the entire driving test system is manned by our own government officials, which leads to a lag in service delivery as the demand is high and the manpower scarce. So, outsourcing the job will help address all these issues, while simultaneously ensuring that the quality of the service offered to customers is premium,” said the state transport minister.Three years after the Delhi government introduced the city’s first ADTT in 2018, such tracks are operational in 10 locations.The tender document, a copy of which was seen by HT, states that the operation hours during which driving tests will have to be conducted will be from 8am to 8pm -- a 12-hour window against the seven-hour window, from 9am-4pm, currently in place for an applicant to take the driving test. It also says that driving tests will be conducted on all days of the week, instead of six days.The system is likely to be put in place in three months, once the tender process is complete, officials said.Ashish Kundra, Delhi’s transport commissioner, said that some of the operational tracks conduct tests for two-wheelers and four-wheelers sequentially. He said that, under the new system, the number of tests conducted in a single day will also increase as multiple applicants will be assessed parallelly on different tracks in a single centre.“Our automated test tracks have already reduced human intervention and the subsequent requirement of manpower. The test results are now given immediately without any scope of manipulation. But the existing operational hours and days limit the number of people who can take the test in a day. The idea is to further remove manual intervention and create a system where the transport department only has to play a supervisory role. Once appointed, the company will have to supply trained manpower for managing the driving licence test services and maintenance of hardware and equipment at the sites,” said Kundra.He said special focus will also be given to ensure people do not have to wait long at the centre for the test.“The applicants of DL skill tests will file online applications. The facilitation/DL test executives (two at each centre), will receive the applicants and will verify the documents as per the Department’s instructions; The applicants... will be taken to the test site in batches on their turn. They will be escorted to the test site by the site manager. The applicants will be entertained using the EQMS system and no candidate will need to stand in a queue. The DL test engineer (one at each site) will ensure that the tests are taken by automated software and he will be responsible to hand over the computerised results to the MLO/MVI. He will also ensure the compliance of other provisions of CMVR i.e. seat belt, rear view mirror etc,” said the tender document.The project will first be rolled out from ADTTs at Loni road, Rohini, Shakur Basti, Janakpuri, Sarai Kale Khan and Raja Garden. For other sites, the 12-hour shift will be decided by the transport department based on the volume of applications.Reshma Juneja (24), a consultant, said her recent experience of giving the driving test at the automated track in Mayur Vihar Phase 1 was good. “But I failed the test. I think practice is important because now in Delhi driving test is not like old times when the government official would pass your test even if you’ve performed miserably. It’s all sensor based now. I had to wait quite a bit for my turn to come, I hope with the new system that you’re taking about, this improves,” she said.Ravindra Kumar, senior principal scientist, transportation planning and environment division, CRRI said the government should also bring in other driver’s learning infrastructure to become holistic in its approach. “Simulators are important. The government should also bring in simulators in some of its centres to prep the applicants. It should also empanel a set of authorised driving schools and create a set of guidelines which need to be followed by such institutions as then it will help ensure all driving and traffic rules are imparted correctly and inculcated in all the learner’s,” he said.Delhi currently has 11 ADTTs, and another track being constructed in Hari Nagar will be ready by next January. The transport department is in talks with Maruti, which owns two automated tracks, and Ashok Leyland, which owns one, to use their centres for driving licence tests.The first automated driving test track was built at Sarai Kale Khan in February 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-driving-test-tracks-set-for-slew-of-reforms-101625781297675.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal inaugurates Delhi’s second genome sequencing lab at ILBS, Vasant Kunj||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday inaugurated the Delhi government’s second laboratory to sequence genomes of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, a day after he flagged off the first such facility at the Lok Nayak hospital.The laboratory at ILBS will be able to sequence over 300 samples a week and provide results in five to seven days, the government said in a press statement.“Yesterday [Wednesday], we launched a similar laboratory in Lok Nayak hospital, but this is going to be even more advanced,” Kejriwal said at the inauguration event.He further said, “Till now, we were dependent on NCDC [National Centre for Disease Control] and other central government facilities to sequence genomes. But now, we are independent and will be able to identify variants on time, take the right actions and strategise for any of the next waves (of Covid-19), if they break out.”“The facility will help sequence data of the Sars-CoV-2 virus to identify and screen new strains and variants with clinical significance, circulating in and around Delhi NCR [National Capital Region]. This facility can sequence nearly all 30,000 molecules of the coronavirus, in fact, the whole length of the virus. By doing this we can find out any mutations in any part of the virus, not merely the spike protein area.”Dr SK Sarin, ILBS director, said, “After the sequencing, we will be able to identify through the results whether the variant is new or an existing one. It’s not that every variant is extremely dangerous, but we need to be well informed about the new cases logged in Delhi and their variants.”“We already have more than 100,000 samples from previous months and upon the requests of the health minister or the chief minister, we can sequence a portion of them as well. We can sequence more than 300 samples in a week and their results can be made available within five to seven days,” said Sarin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-inaugurates-delhi-s-second-genome-sequencing-lab-at-ilbs-vasant-kunj-101625781158029.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||Pained to see MCD staffers seeking court’s help to get salaries, says high court||The Delhi high court on Thursday slammed both the Delhi government and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NrDMC) for their failure to pay salaries and pensions to employees/pensioners and said it was “pained” to see employees approaching courts to get their salaries. The high court also directed the Delhi government to pay ₹293 crore that is due to the NrDMC within 10 days.“We are pained to see such people (employees and pensioners) coming to courts. They need to have a lawyer just to tell us that they are not being paid. You are doing your job but we are pained by the callousness. It’s shocking,” the court told the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.The court was hearing a clutch of petitions relating to non-payment of salaries and pensions to teachers, hospital staff, sanitation workers and engineers.It observed that corporations are meant to not only pay employee salaries but also make the city “world class” as well as manage health issues such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh also ordered the Delhi government to disburse ₹293 crore to the NrDMC within 10 days, for the payment of salaries and pensions, which is due to the civic body towards the second and third quarter of GIA and basic tax assignment (BTA).The court remarked that there is “corruption everywhere”, both in the corporation as well as the Delhi government.“Let’s agree that people are sitting in a cosy environment. Your government is no better. Not just the corporate, there is corruption everywhere. We would want officers to act with responsibility. Tell us the money that you are incurring on advertisements,” the court told the Delhi government.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said it was not the responsibility of the government to ensure that civic body employees are paid salaries. He said advertisements given in newspapers are for dissemination of important and meaningful information.To this, the court said, “Advertisements with a political push do not indicate meaningful advertisement. When you say that you are short of funds to give to the corporation, you are also not behaving in a prudent or responsible manner.”The bench also came down heavily on the NrDMC for its insistence to run its six hospitals, despite not having the resources to do so.“You are very possessive about running your hospitals…but we can’t have a situation where on one hand, NrDMC is not able to meet its primary obligation of paying salaries and pensions, and on the other hand, it is insisting on retaining and running hospitals, which could not generate any revenue and are source of expenditure.”It said a decision has to be taken by the corporation as to whether the hospitals could be taken over by the Centre or the Delhi government.“If NrDMC continues to enjoy the luxury of running and maintaining municipal hospitals causing strain on its resources, it cannot be at the expense of salaries and pensions of employees and it may be necessary that the financial burden on account of lack of resources is borne by the elected representatives of the corporation,” the bench said, directing the NrDMC commissioner to file an affidavit within two weeks with all disclosures.The bench also asked the SDMC and EDMC, represented through advocate Manu Chaturvedi, to take similar steps to augment their resources, as being done by NrDMC, and file their respective affidavits detailing the steps taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pained-to-see-mcd-staffers-seeking-court-s-help-to-get-salaries-says-high-court-101625780990663.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||DDA finalising tenders for in-situ houses for 10,000 families living in slums||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is finalising the bids for six in-situ slum redevelopment housing projects for 10,000 families who live in these clusters.The in-situ redevelopment of slum clusters is part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), a flagship mission of the Union government implemented by the ministry of housing and urban affairs that ensures a pucca house to all eligible urban households by 2022.A senior DDA official said, “We have received the bids for five projects so far. We might have to re-tender for one of the projects. A decision will be taken in this regard soon. We are technicallly evaluating these bids, after which work will be awarded to the contractors.”The six projects have been planned in Rohini, Pitampura, Shalimar Bagh, Dilshad Garden, Pooth Kalan and Haiderpur, where 10 JJ clusters will be redeveloped. There are four clusters with over 4,000 households in Rohini’s Sectors 18,19 and 20. Similarly, flats will be constructed for 1,991 households in Haiderpur and 2,645 families in Dishad Garden respectively.Of the 675 slum clusters in Delhi, 499 are on central government land. Under the PMAY, DDA has to carry out in-situ redevelopment of 376 clusters which have come up on its land.The housing agency has completed surveying households, which started in 2019, in 23 slum clusters.Currently, the DDA has three in-situ redevelopment projects in west Delhi’s Katputhli Colony, Jailorwala Bagh in north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar and Kalkaji extension where a total of 5,990 flats are under construction.The official quoted above said the land owning agency plans to take up redevelopment of 16 slum clusters on a public private partnership (PPP) basis by the end of this year, just like the Katputhli Colony project---the first in-situ redevelopment project to be implemented on PPP mode.“Close to 30,000 flats will be constructed as part of these in-situ redevelopment projects. For the first time, DDA has taken up slum rehabilitation projects on such a large scale,” said the official.He added the Katputhli Colony redevelopment work, which was conceived in 2009 but the work started in March 2018, is likely to be completed by early next year. “The work got delayed due to the lockdown that was imposed following the outbreak of Covid-19,” said the official.DDA plans to hire private developers for the in-situ slum development projects, who will construct a multi-storey housing facility for slum dwellers (or beneficiaries identified through the survey), along with commercial spaces on the land where the slum exists. The commercial component will be used by the developer to recover the total cost of the project. The land will be leased to the developer, the period of which will be decided by the DDA.Earlier this year, the DDA had eased the redevelopment norms to allow developers to recover the cost of the project. “The in-situ projects have to be financially viable. For this, some norms were changed.

Residents of the area caught the taxi driver at the spot and handed him to the police, who arrested and booked him for rash and negligent driving causing death and injuries.A medical examination confirmed that the driver was not drunk when the incident took place, the officer added.The dead man was identified as Kallu, a resident of Seemapuri in northeast Delhi, and the injured man as 68-year-old Kanta Bhai, who lives with his family in Jahangirpuri. Both sold vegetables on the pavement outside the Daryaganj vegetable market for several years, a police officer aware of the matter said.The two men were arranging vegetables along the footpath around 3.45am on Thursday when the vehicle, which came from the Delhi Gate side, hit them.“The driver, Sachin, (25) told us that he was looking at the map on his mobile phone which was on his lap while he drove. He said that because he was distracted, he did not see the men and hit them with his vehicle. Three passengers were seated in the cab when the incident took place,” said the police officer, who asked not to be named.Kallu was taken to the nearby Lok Nayak hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Kanta Bhai was referred to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for better treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/taxi-runs-into-vegetable-vendors-at-daryaganj-one-dead-101625780448468.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police file FIR, send notice to GitHub after Muslim women ‘put up for sale’ on app||The Delhi Police on Thursday said it has registered a first information report (FIR) against unidentified persons, four days after pictures of several Muslim women were uploaded without their consent on an app called “Sulli Deals” to imply that these women were “up for sale”. ‘Sulli’ or ‘Sulla’ is a derogatory slang used to refer to Muslims.The police have also sent a notice to source code depository platform GitHub, using which these images were uploaded, asking it to share “relevant details”.Police are awaiting a reply from Github to ascertain the exact number of women who were subjected to the sexual harassment, which came to fore only after a few of the targeted women took to social media with screenshots to highlight the harassment.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said a case of sexual harassment under Indian Penal Code’s Section 354-A was registered on Wednesday following a complaint received on National Cybercrime Reporting Portal regarding “Sulli Deals Mobile Application”.“The case has been registered by the cyber crime unit (CyPAD) and investigation has been taken up. We have also sent notices to GitHub for sharing relevant details,” Biswal said.Police said the images were uploaded on the app on July 4 and included those of several known journalists and activists in India and abroad. The app was hosted by GitHub, a provider of Internet hosting. The app was taken down following widespread criticism on social media and after a few women, whose images were uploaded, sought police action. One of them used Twitter to update that she has filed a case in this regard in Noida.When contacted for a statement, a GitHub spokesperson said, “GitHub has longstanding policies against content and conduct involving harassment, discrimination, and inciting violence. We suspended user accounts following the investigation of reports of such activity, all of which violate our policies.”A senior CyPAD officer, who asked not to be named, said they have sought details from GitHub to know who created the mobile app and used the platform to upload the objectionable content.“We also want to know from where that app was developed and who all were involved in its creation.Our investigation will proceed further, once we get the details from GitHub,” the officer said.On Wednesday, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) issued a notice to the Delhi Police, seeking an action taken report in the matter by July 12. “Many women had to leave social media platforms after their images got circulated. This is a very serious matter constituting cyber crime. We have asked the cyber crime cell of the Delhi Police to provide us with relevant information about the same,” DCW chief Swati Maliwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-file-fir-send-notice-to-github-after-muslim-women-put-up-for-sale-on-app-101625779795677.html

Consumers can play a very important role in ensuring an incident-free monsoon by following simple safety guidelines.”To ensure that over 4.5 million consumers and 1.8 crore residents get uninterrupted power supply, Reliance Infrastructure led BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) are undertaking active measures to minimise moisture accumulation in the grids and panels.“The height of the foundation (base) of transformers in low-lying areas has been increased to safe levels. Proper fencing around all plinth and pole mounted transformers has been done. Due to water-logging, chances of electricity related mishaps are high during monsoon. Simple precautions will help the consumers stay safe. People, especially children, should stay away from electrical installations like electricity poles, sub-stations, transformers, streetlights etc,” said the spokesperson.He added the main switch should be turned off in case of water logging and earth leakage circuit breaker should be installed. Consumers should keep a ‘tester’ at their homes to check leakage in case of wet power switches, said the spokesperson adding people should also prune twigs and plants close to electricity lines.Helpline numbers 19123, 399 99 707 ( south & west Delhi) and 19122, 399 99 808 (east & central Delhi) areas have been set up for consumers to report broken cables, poles or exposed wiring, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bses-issues-advisory-ahead-of-monsoon-onset-101625779613131.html

They were booked for murder after a case was registered at the Kapashera police station, deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said.DCP Singh said around 5pm on Wednesday, an e-rickshaw driver, Nawab Ansari, spotted a teenager’s body on a debris heap near the farmhouse in Samalkha near Kapashera and informed the police. A police team reached there and saw that there were laceration wounds on the teenager’s back and a cut mark on the lateral side of the hand. They were also dog bite marks on his body, the DCP said.“Through local inquiry, we identified the boy and met his family members who live in another farmhouse in Samalkha itself. A case of murder was registered and investigation was taken up,” he said.During the investigation, the police said it was learnt that around 11am on Wednesday, the teenager and his two others entered the farmhouse owned by Sandhu. The guard of the farmhouse thought that they had entered to commit a theft. He raised the alarm and caught the teenager, while his friends escaped. Sandhu was also present at the spot.“We learnt that Sandhu and the father-son duo assaulted the boy with sticks. The boy suffered injuries to his head as well. When he tried to flee, some dogs chased and bit him. He finally collapsed on the debris heap, around 60 metres from Sandhu’s farmhouse, and died,” said DCP Singh.Police said the alleged attackers fled the scene after the crime. The investigating team conducted searches and caught Sandhu and the other two attackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmhouse-owner-2-others-beat-teen-to-death-on-suspicion-of-theft-arrested-101625779416527.html
09-07-2021||Delhi||DJB vice-chief Raghav Chadha inspects reservoirs amid water supply complaints||Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha inspected reservoirs in central and west Delhi on Thursday and directed officials to ensure that the city receives uninterrupted water supply amid complaints of shortage from several parts of the city.“Inspected several water reservoirs of central and west Delhi with the Delhi Jal Board officials at 4am this morning to check water supply. Given strict instructions to officials to maintain pre-determined water levels at each such reservoir so that water supply is regular and uninterrupted,” tweeted Chadha.Over the last two weeks, several parts of the national capital have been facing acute water shortage with daytime temperatures remaining above the 40 degrees mark, and monsoon being delayed inordinately. Since June 20, parts of Rohini, Dwarka, Mayur Vihar phase-one and two, Patel Nagar, Prem Nagar, Baljit Nagar, Kalkaji, Govindpuri, South Extension and Greater Kailash, have either faced irregular water supply or received less than the prescribed amount because of high pollution in the raw water, and low water levels at the water treatment plants.The Delhi Jal Board supplies 935 MGD (million gallons per day) water to the city as against a total demand of around 1,200 MGD during summer.Last week too, Chadha chaired a high-level meeting with senior DJB officials to chalk out a plan for the equitable distribution of water, tackle issues of supply shortage and water contamination and set up an emergency response team to minimise water-related complaints.The senior Aam Aadmi Party leader also instructed officials to do a constituency-wise analysis of the amount of water received by DJB installations, at regular intervals to ascertain the gap between demand and supply.Many residents and resident welfare associations (RWA) complained about irregular and contaminated water supply being supplied by the DJB.Manoj Singh, a resident of Aya Nagar, said his locality has been receiving water supply only once a day--that too for 30 minutes for the last 15 days.“We used to get water supply from the DJB in the morning and in the evening. These days, they have reduced it to only once a day and that too for only half-an-hour, compared to the one-hour supply earlier. We are a family of six, how do they expect us to make do with limited quantity of water and that too in this weather?,” asked Singh.Arun Kumar, a resident of Badarpur, said despite repeated complaints to local DJB officials, the water supply in his street has not been regularised. “We have not got water for the last one week, and now we are surviving on drinking water cans. The local DJB staff has also stopped answering our calls,” Kumar alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/djb-vice-chief-raghav-chadha-inspects-reservoirs-amid-water-supply-complaints-101625779174666.html
09-07-2021||Dehradun||Haridwar admin gives in, allows some tourists after questions raised on CM visit||Haridwar: The Haridwar administration on Thursday rolled back its decision to barricade entry points of Har-ki-Pauri to allow a limited number of tourists during Ganga aarti after mounting pressure from Ganga Sabha office bearers, local priests and traders. The district officials have clarified that barricading will not be done although it will be ensured that Covid guidelines and social distancing are not violated. The decision comes in the wake of Ganga Sabha president, general secretary and priests staging a sit-in protest opposing the administration move on Wednesday evening. Trader representatives, hotel associations, Dharamshala-ashram committees have also been demanding that pilgrims and tourists be allowed during Ganga aarti. Notably, since lifting of Covid curbs a fortnight back, a sudden rush is being witnessed at Har-Ki-Pauri and adjacent Ganga ghats.Keeping this in mind, the administration had been sealing the entry towards sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-ki-Pauri for the past few days. Ganga Sabha office-bearers had asked why the police didn’t seize or resrict the gathering of BJP workers during the visit of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami for Ganga worship at Brahamkund on Wednesday.“We oppose the move of containing, blocking, sealing and prohibitive entry rules at Har-Ki-Pauri, during the evening Ganga aarti. Why is it that strict rules are implemented only on pilgrims and political gatherings are allowed? Lifting of covid curfew is being done phase-wise, shopping malls are also now open. So why keep restrictions on pilgrims during Ganga aarti,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha. Assuring the administration that Ganga Sabha will continue to ensure their office bearers and personnel adhere to Covid-19 guidelines, its general secretary Tanmay Vashisth said that through public announcement system, pilgrims, tourists and local people will be sensitized about Covid safety measures. Superintendent of police Kamlesh Upadhyay said everyone should cooperate and understand that social distancing norms and wearing face masks needs to be adhered to in public places. A meeting was also held by Ganga Sabha and Bhimgoda-Khadkhadi Trader Division expressing displeasure over the recent immoral act of partying, hookah smoking, and dance party by some people at Har-Ki-Pauri and adjacent Ganga ghats.Local priests and traders demanded police action against such conduct.“On the one hand, they are stopping pilgrims at Ganga ghats, while on the other, such anti-social elements are hurting the religious atmosphere here, said Prantiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal secretary Sanjay Triwal. Meanwhile, police on Thursday arrested six tourists hailing from Haryana, UP and Delhi from Malviya Ganga ghat and three from Risshikul Ganga ghat for causing nuisance. As part of the drive at Ganga ghats against such elements, police patrolling has been stepped up and offenders are being booked to ensure sanctity at Ganga ghats, city circle officer Abhay Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/haridwar-admin-gives-in-allows-some-tourists-after-questions-raised-on-cm-visit-101625775206982.html

A dejected SM Rabik has left Rajinikanth’s fan club in Madurai, of which he was one of the founding members since 1977. He was also working as part of the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), a conglomeration of all his fans clubs launched when the superstar announced his entry into politics in December 2017. “I’ve relieved myself from everything since he has decided not to pursue it,” says Rabik. “I was never interested in any other political party. But I was waiting for decades for him to enter politics,” he said.RMM was packed with Rajinikanth’s cult following, with no background in politics. But they turned into his foot soldiers as he began from scratch. Another fan and RMM functionary, who wanted his identity protected, resigned from a private software company in Chennai, three days after Rajinikanth announced his exit due to excessive trolling he faced in his office and online. The actor returned from his shooting from the sets of Annathe and on December 29, 2020, he announced that he would not pursue politics due to his health condition. “I had canvassed for votes for him everywhere, including my office and everyone kept telling me he will back out,” he says. “So when he did back out, my colleagues humiliated me for wasting my time. One friend even got me a t-shirt with the slogan ‘Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum (this too shall pass)’.” He shifted jobs and his new company isn’t aware of his association with Rajinikanth’s brief stint in politics.For some Rajinikanth fans, the questions remain if he was forced into politics for multiple reasons. “If he did it for commerce,” says a fan who wrote a book which has ‘Rajini’ in the title and he didn’t want to be identified. “Rajini was this duck who laid a golden egg with a film every two years and fans would crave for it. Ever since he announced his political entry he has been making back-to-back films and none of them had any hint of his politics.” Tamil Nadu is after all a pioneer in fusing silver screen and politics. “But with Rajinikanth several things were off the mark so disappointment with him is something that happened slowly,” the writer says. He adds that he was wondering how Rajinikanth would plan an exit strategy after his press conference in March 2020 where he announced he would lead the party but someone else would be chief minister. “The hardcore fans told me I should be thinking loyally not logically. For them Rajinikanth is God and God will never do anything wrong to us. While some still hold on to that belief, this shattered a few others.” Several others, including those who held key positions in RMM have joined other parties such as the DMK and BJP with Rajinikanth’s blessing. Political greenhorns like Gayathri Srinivas believe that RMM gave them a political launchpad. She was the RMM’s district secretary of the women’s wing in south Chennai who joined the BJP earlier this year. “Along with family and friends, I joined RMM to work towards social causes and bring about an alternative politically,” says Srinivas. Despite the disappointment, sections of his fan base remain intact such as 27-year-old Nagaraj Jayakumar who was RMM youth wing head of Chennai’s Alandur. “We wouldn’t have learnt the basics in politics in established parties but here we completed work in 70% of the booths,” says Jayakumar. He had started a YouTube channel, Samaniyar exclusive for Rajinikanth to bust fake news about him. But he says it’s been hard to move on. “I worked for the party during weekends. We have spent a lot of time on party work, so it’s frustrating and several people are still stuck not knowing what to do next. I’ve continued with my day job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-rajinikanth-abandons-political-quest-fans-pick-up-pieces-101625774606118.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers stage protests against high fuel, cooking gas prices||Farmers in Punjab and Haryana on Thursday held protests at several places against the repeated hikes in fuel and cooking gas prices. The call for the protest from 10am till 12noon was given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading an agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, currently on hold. Protesters parked their tractors and other vehicles on the roadside and raised slogans against the Union government over the rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas. Some of them also brought empty LPG cylinders to the protesting sites as a mark of protest. Agitating farmers also honked their vehicles for a few minutes, saying it was done to “wake up” the government from “slumber”. The farmers slammed the government for not being able to control the prices of essential commodities. Police personnel were deployed in strength near the protest sites to maintain law and order, officials said. Protests were held at many places in Mohali, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Moga, Rupnagar in Punjab and Sonipat, Sirsa and Gohana in Haryana. In Moga, a protester said rising prices of diesel would increase the farmers’ input cost. In Haryana’s Sirsa, a protesting farmer brought a camel to pull a four-wheeler as a mark of protest against the rising fuel prices. Agitating farmers said their demonstrations were peaceful. In Patiala, farmer unions, along with students associations, staged protests on state and national highways. Manjit Singh, a farmer leader, said the NDA government has completely failed to control inflation at a time when people are facing acute financial crisis due to Covid-19. “The Union government should immediately reduce fuel prices to give some respite to the common man. The government should lower taxes to control fuel prices,” he said.

This would help the families to avail Covid-19 death related compensations provided by the state for their kin, the court observed. The first bench comprising the Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy was hearing a plea moved by HA Shrirajalakshmi. The petitioner sought for the court to direct the authorities concerned to provide the reason of death as Covid-19 in the certificates issued by the state to claim compensation.During the hearing on Thursday, the counsel for the central government informed the bench that the state government has been informed on the recent judgement of the Supreme Court that insisted for Covid-19 death to be noted specifically in the death certificates of the people who died due to the viral infection.During a previous hearing, the bench had stated that across the country, there are grievances that all the deaths that have been caused by the pandemic may not have been appropriately recorded and sought responses from the Tamil Nadu and Union governments on the matter.The court adjourned the plea by another 10 weeks for the state government to file a detailed report on the issues raised by the petitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ensure-kin-of-covid-19-deceased-get-documents-to-avail-relief-hc-to-tn-govt-101625774548478.html

09-07-2021||Other||Former IPS officer Annamalai named TN’s BJP chief||Chennai: Former IPS officer K Annamalai has been appointed as the new BJP chief of Tamil Nadu. He succeeds L Murugan a day after the latter was inducted into the reshuffled union cabinet. Murugan has been appointed as union minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, and information and broadcasting. His elevation is seen as a reward for his work as the party chief of the southern state where the BJP won four seats, after a gap of 15 years, in the recently held assembly elections.Both Murugan and Annamalai lost in the recently held assembly elections in Tamil Nadu in the constituencies of Dharmapuram and Aravakurichi respectively. Annamalai, a Karnataka cadre, resigned from his post in 2019 and joined the BJP last year. “He will be a youth icon,” said BJP vice-president KS Narendran. “He has shown that he is a strict and good administrator as an IPS officer. He left the services at a young age and joined us because of his nationalistic ideals.”The party hopes that 37-year-old Annamalai will draw in more youngsters ahead of the local body elections slated later for the year and with an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Since 2019, he is the third leader to take charge of the BJP’s top post in Tamil Nadu. Murugan took over as BJP chief six months after his predecessor Tamilisai Soundararajan was made Governor of Telangana. Since earlier this year she is also holding additional charge as Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry. Before his appointment as BJP state president in March 2020, Murugan was the national SC/ST commission vice-president and he practised law in the Madras high court for 15 years. The Dalit leader hasn’t had much success electorally having made his debut in the 2006 assembly elections in Sankari constituency. This year he lost from Dharapuram, a seat reserved for Scheduled Castes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned for him. Murugan joined the ABVP during his college days. As state coordinator for the BJP’s SC Morcha wing, he was associated with President Ramnath Kovind who was then the national coordinator. Speaking to reporters in Delhi, Murugan on Thursday said he will work towards the development of Tamil Nadu’s education and culture. “I will work towards making Tamil Nadu the foremost state,” he said.Tamil Nadu has always been a tough state for the BJP to appease and in his short time, Murugan brought in several known faces to the party such as Ananmalai, DMK’s deputy general secretary V P Duraisamy, Ku Ka Selvam, actor turned politician Khushboo Sundar and several Tamil film personalities. Although there was criticism from the old guard over actors and other party members jumping ship as not being true to Hindutva, there was no denial that the BJP was in the limelight in Tamil Nadu which was relegated to a fringe, hitherto.Murugan strayed away from the Ayodhya issue in the state, where it didn’t have much traction and pressed on localised worship of his namesake deity Lord Murugan to consolidate the Hindu votes. Experts see these appointments from the OBC community as the BJP’s way of representation and caste consolidation. The party is in agreement. Duraisamy who shifted from the DMK to BJP last year says that Murugan’s elevation makes the cadre and community happy. “He is the first Arunthathiyar from Tamil Nadu to be a union minister. People will show their gratitude for this towards the BJP in the future,” says Duraisamy. “It can also be viewed as a safe and honourable exit for Murugan to pave the way for Mr Annamalai. Tamizhisai was similarly given such an honourable exit,” said political commentator Sriram Seshadri. “It’s been a probable plan for the last one year by the RSS and the Central BJP leadership. While Tamil Nadu needed to be represented, instead of accommodating the AIADMK in the Council of Ministers, BJP has taken the berth through the Rajya Sabha route.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-ips-officer-annamalai-named-tn-s-bjp-chief-101625774486124.html
09-07-2021||Other||Out of TN’s jurisdiction to form NEET panel: Centre||Chennai: In a preliminary affidavit filed with the Madras high court, the union government said that it is out of the jurisdiction of Tamil Nadu to constitute Justice AK Rajan committee to study the impact of NEET on socially backward students. The court had asked the union government to indicate its stand on the issue after a PIL was filed against the committee by Tamil Nadu BJP’s state secretary Karu Nagarajan seeking to quash the same as unconstitutional, illegal, unfair and without legal justification. The reply affidavit was filed by Chandal Kumar, under secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare which was circulated on late Wednesday. The case is being heard by the bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy. The next hearing will be on July 13 where the DMK-led government is a respondent and several parties who have requested to be impleaded as party to the case will be heard.The Union government has cited a Supreme Court judgement, several legislative provisions under National Medical Commission Act, 2019 and the constitutional lists to make its case that the committee is neither requisite nor valid.The affidavit submitted that the field ‘medical education is regulated statutorily under a Central legislation i.e. the NMC Act. “Accordingly, nothing inconsistent or contrary can stand legally,” the Indian government’s affidavit read. “Therefore, the State cannot constitute a high level committee to study the impact of NEET on Medical admissions.”The Centre stated that the committee was going into an issue that is already settled. “The Supreme Court has already upheld the validity of NEET against the anvil of the Equality Code contained in the Constitution,” the affidavit read. “It was held without a pale of doubt that the conduct of NEET examinations is not in contravention to Article 14 nor is it against the socio-economic polity of the Country. In spite of the same, the Term of Reference of the Committee seeks to question whether NEET is an equitable method of selection. This reference is not only a slight against the status and privilege of the Supreme Court but is also an exercise in futility as the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all functionaries by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.”A judgement by the Supreme Court on April 2020, in the matter of Christian Medical College Vellore Association Vs Union of India and others held that the provisions of uniform examination of NEET in the Act and Regulation is not opposed to social principles prescribed in the Constitution and India’s social fabric.The judgment said, “The NEET has been prescribed by the legislature in the larger public interest that has to prevail. We find the provisions to be reasonable conditions of recognition/ affiliation that are binding for the very existence of all such institutions whether they are run by majority or minority failing which they cannot exist and impart education.”The Centre further added that entry 65 of the Union list provides coordination and determination of minimum standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions. “The subject ‘medical education’ is under the Concurrent List (Entry 25) of the Constitution of India,” the affidavit read. “The Legislation framed by the State under Entry 25 is subject to the Entry 65 of the Union List. Therefore, Article 162 makes it clear that the Executive power of the State government is coterminous with the legislative power of the state.”NEET is an emotional issue in Tamil Nadu since several medical aspirants have died by suicide. It has gone through several legal wrangles before it entered the state in 2017. Until then Tamil Nadu considered class 12 board exam marks for admissions into medical colleges. Abolishing NEET is an election promise of the two-month old DMK-led government and this issue is supported by opposition parties, including the AIADMK as they are of the view that NEET puts rural and poor students at a disadvantage.

The public notice stated that the building owner will be held responsible for any mishap that occurs. The civic body, however, did not take any steps ensure the directions are followed. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said in many of these buildings, the owners and tenants are caught in a legal tussle, making it impossible for the MC to intervene in a matter that is sub-judice. Residents, however, slammed the civic body for inaction. Tribhuvan Thapar, secretary of Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust, said two such buildings are in Naughara Mohalla, where the house of martyr Sukhdev Thapar is situated. “These buildings can collapse anytime. It is so risky that people have to avoid passing by the area during thunderstorms. If the MC cannot demolish these buildings, at least they should get these vacated.” Sunil, a resident of Nali Mohalla, said a few buildings are located on Deepak Cinema road and adjoining areas. “The MC must at least repair these buildings to avoid any untoward incident,” he said.Municipal town planner (MTP) SS Bindra said, “MC issues notices to building owners but it cannot get the buildings vacated. The police department has to carry out this task. We have written to them. The bridges and roads (B and R) department of MC had also checked the strength of a number of buildings and it was found that many of these can be repaired. Action against the buildings has to be taken as per the reports of the B and R department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/declared-unsafe-ludhiana-mc-hasn-t-been-able-to-get-these-buildings-vacated-101625774367277.html

Speaking to ANI, Tewari said, “There is no problem in the state, there are some issues due to the step-motherly treatment of the Central government. However, if someone wants to take on his personal agenda through Twitter or any other medium then the leaders at the AICC should take it seriously.” Sidhu has been continuously taking on Captain Amarinder Singh’s government in Punjab on the power shortage issue in the state, but Tewari has backed Captain. “The Congress has secured victory in more than 90 per cent of the local bodies. Punjab government is doing well; but a few people have their own agenda,” Tewari said. Capt Amarinder had met Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Tuesday and had assured that he will follow the decision that she would take.

He built and nurtured this party and criticising Yediyurappa is the same as criticising the BJP,” Renukacharya said on Thursday.The statements comes at a time when a section of legislators from the BJP have continued to attack the chief minister and his family over allegations of corruption and misuse of powers for personal gain.They have also openly asked for the chief minister to be replaced.The statements from dissidents comes despite warnings from the BJP national leadership of stern action if they continue to air their concerns publicly.A section of legislators, who are considered close to Yediyurappa, had initiated a signature campaign to rally behind the 78-year-old as a sign of the latter’s hold over the party and his resilience to ward off any attempt to unseat him.Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), AH Vishwanath, CP Yogeshwara among others continue to call for the chief minister’s removal and have changed that Yediyurappa’s son, BY Vijayendra, runs a parallel administration under the aegis of his father.Renukacharya said the monsoon session of the Lok Sabha starts from July 19 and they will meet the national leaders before it and demand that the dissenters be removed.Renukacharya also threatened to release corruption details of the dissenters.“Those who are making statements against him (Yediyurappa) daily, we will release documents of corruption and scams against them,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-bjp-mlasto-meet-high-command-seeking-removal-of-bsy-dissenters-101625774307181.html

The corridor, which opened in November 2019 in the wake of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, gives Indian pilgrims a visa-free access to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, the last resting place of the Sikhism founder.Also, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Jagir Kaur on Wednesday had reiterated the demand for reopening of the corridor. PSGPC president Satwant Singh in a communiqué to the SGPC said, “We fully support the SGPC’s demand and will reassure that all the arrangements will be made for Indian Sikh pilgrims in a befitting manner to facilitate them during their yatra to the Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur. The pandemic situation is totally under control in Pakistan and we are looking forward for an early decision from the Indian government on the corridor.” “On this historic moment of reopening of the corridor, we would also like to extend an invitation to the SGPC president, her team and the Akal Takht jathedar to visit the Kartarpur gurdwara through the corridor,” he added. In a press statement, SGPC chief Jagir Kaur said, “As most of the religious shrines and public places have been opened now, there should be no excuse to keep the corridor shut. We have already written several letters to the Indian government in this regard, but to no avail.”The corridor was closed by both the countries in March 2020 nearly four months after its inauguration. Pakistan, however, decided to reopen it last year after the pandemic situation improved but closed it in the wake of the second infection wave. Now again, the Pakistan government has announced to reopen the corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-under-control-india-should-reopen-kartarpur-corridor-psgpc-101625774249350.html

Now, this is going to be achieved in a government high school by taking the help of the Indian Technological Congress Association and ISRO,” read a statement from Narayana’s office.Designing and making of the satellite will be done at the school by involving students of a few other government schools, he added.“In recent days there is an increase in enrolment in some government schools. But, more than the numbers, the quality of teaching-learning is more important. Government educational institutions should compete with private institutions in terms of providing quality education,” Narayana said in his statement.The enrolments to the government schools in the Malleshwaram constituency have increased from 2,221 to 2,743. But this increase in enrolment should be matched by achieving standards in quality teaching-learning, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-govt-school-to-become-1st-in-country-to-develop-a-satellite-101625774248353.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ineligible beneficiaries claiming Shagun scheme aid as amount hiked from July 1||Ineligible beneficiaries are furnishing fake marriage cards, affidavits and forged marriage certificates with the help of sarpanches and area councillors since financial assistance under the Punjab government’s Shagun (also Ashirwad) scheme was increased from ₹21,000 to ₹51,000 from July 1. It has been just a week since the revised scheme came into effect, but the district administration in Moga has already received at least 15 such claims. The number could be even more as they are in the process of verify other claims as well, officials said. The scheme offers monetary help for the marriage of girls belonging to the scheduled castes, backward classes and those from the BPL (below poverty line) category besides daughters of widows. The amount was ₹21,000 before July 1. To avail of the scheme, a beneficiary needs to apply before getting married or 30 days after marriage. But the district administration is receiving claims of marriages that took place even a year ago. Moga district welfare officer Harpal Singh Gill said, “The beneficiaries are required to furnish documents such as marriage cards and certificates attested by local sarpanches and councillors. But the elected representatives are attesting forged and counterfeit documents.”“During the verification of claims, we found that ineligible beneficiaries had printed fake marriage cards and submitted these. In most cases, the marriages of women took place six months or a year back, but they have printed marriage cards with recent dates. Besides, they have also changed dates on marriage certificates,” said Gill.Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans said, “The officials concerned brought to my notice that some of the documents attested by the sarpanchs and councillors were forged during the verification. This is an apparent move to get benefit of the scheme by manipulating the facts.”“We have directed all the sarpanches and councillors to attest documents only after verifying the facts. If more such cases come to the fore in future, a strict action will be taken against them,” the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ineligible-beneficiaries-claiming-shagun-scheme-aid-as-amount-hiked-from-july-1-101625774247852.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Bulletproof car had helped gangster Naruana survive June 21 attack||It was a bulletproof vehicle that actually helped now slain gangster Kulveer Naruana survive an attempt on his life by another criminal Sandeep Bhalla, alias Bhalla Sekhu in Bathinda city on June 21. At least 10 rounds were fired at Naruana’s vehicle, a Mahindra Bolero, on Ring Road in Bathinda that day. Out on bail, he was shot dead on Wednesday along with his accomplice by his close aide Mandeep Singh Manna at a Bathinda village. Police officials said it is probably for the first time in recent years that a gangster was found using a fully bulletproof vehicle that may withstand bullets fired from an AK-47 rifle. Police are struggling to ascertain where did the gangster got the bulletproofing of the vehicle done. The police said prima facie, Naruana’s murder was not an outcome of a gang war. They say Manna is likely to have killed Naruana in a fit of rage as their relations had soured. Officials said while several automobile manufacturers have bulletproof vehicle variants, vendors in Jalandhar and some other places upgrade any private vehicle into a bulletproof one. There is no check on fabricating vehicles, they said. “It may pose a serious challenge to the police while handling criminals. There should be a strict protocol for those dealing, buying or fabricating bulletproof cars. Bulletproofing is not an accessory and not everyone needs such level of protection,” said an official. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said they are trying to trace the vendor that bulletproofed the gangster’s car. “Naruana had a serious criminal past and his activities were under surveillance. Though he was facing several criminal cases in courts, his direct involvement in any organised crime surfaced in the last 2-3 years,” said the SSP. Another police official said in the absence of adequate rules and regulations on the sale and purchase of bulletproof vehicles, even criminals have a free access to them. “When political dignitaries from different countries visit India, bulletproof cars are prepared for their protection. After the use, these cars are put on auction and it makes it easy for gangsters to have access to such vehicles,” he said. Inter-gang attack claim under watch A Facebook user on Thursday claimed that notorious Lawrence Bishnoi gang was behind Naruana’s murder. The FB page was created on the name of Mandeep Singh Manna, arrested for Naurana’s murder. The timeline suggests that the page was created on Wednesday night and it had only one textual post and three photos. SSP Virk said Manna is in custody amid tight security in hospital. “He will undergo surgery as he suffered a bullet injury in the thigh. We are verifying as who created the FB page and claims made on the platform,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bulletproof-car-had-helped-gangster-naruana-survive-june-21-attack-101625774246704.html
09-07-2021||Bangalore||Police arrests 12 for gang rape, torture of Bangladeshi national||Bengaluru: Twelve people have been arrested in connection with the gangrape and torture of a Bangladeshi woman in May, Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said on Thursday. Out of the 12 accused, 11 are Bangladeshi nationals and two are women. “Twelve accused are arrested, out of which 11 accused persons and the victim are Bangladeshi nationals. The investigation is complete, and a detailed and systemic 1019-page charge sheet has been submitted to the Hon’ble Court within a short span of 5 weeks,” Pant tweeted. Shobuj Sheik and Rafiq alias Rafsan are the main accused. Their associates Ridoy Babu, Rakibul Islam Sagar, Mohammed Babu Shaik, Hakil, Ajim, Jamal, Dalim, Nasrath, Kajal and Tanya are the other suspects named in the chargesheet submitted before the 1st Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) court on Wednesday. Pant praised the investigating team for the work and added that a reward of ₹1 lakh has been sanctioned to the team. A disturbing video of the woman’s assault was circulated on social media in which the accused even inserted a bottle in her private parts. The incident was flagged by Assam Police first in May 2020., and later redirected to the Bengaluru police after they received information about a possible suspect in the city. “We formed our teams to follow these leads and were able to detain one of them and based on the information provided we arrested the rest of the accused,” Pant said. Another police officer said on the condition of anonymity that the Bangladesh Police helped identify one of the suspects -- Ridoy Babu, of Tejgaon in Dhaka -- based on his TikTok account and the video circulating online. “The cops tracked down his (Babu’s) family and made his uncle call him on WhatsApp. On the call, Ridoy admitted that he was one of those seen in the video. He (Babu) also identified the victim. This was what we have been told (by Bangladesh police),” the officer said. The rape survivor was allegedly trafficked from Bangladesh by a network of human traffickers active in her country, Assam, West Bengal, Telangana and Karnataka, three years ago, police said. She was then forced into prostitution by the gang, they added. The accused allegedly tortured and gang-raped her following a financial dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/police-arrests-12-for-gang-rape-torture-of-bangladeshi-national-101625774126044.html

The Ludhiana team had reached the knockout (semi-final) stage of the tournament before getting debarred. As per information, the PCA had conducted an inquiry into a complaint submitted by the Moga team regarding the overaged player, following which action was taken against the Ludhiana team. The Moga team had lost to Ludhiana during the tournament. An office-bearer of the association, requesting anonymity, said senior officials of the associations were aware that Viraj was overaged but still allowed him to play in the team. Now, parents of other players are objecting to the ban on the entire team, stating that they are bearing the brunt of the actions of one player and a few members of the association. Missing this tournament will have an impact on the careers of other aspiring players. Meanwhile, LDCA officials that the trickery has been committed by the player by submitting the forged documents, along with a notary attested affidavit, and the association is not at fault. LDCA president Satish Mangal and honorary secretary Gagandeep Bhalla said all players were asked to submit the documents prescribed by the PCA, including Aadhar card, certificates etc, and the player Viraj also submitted the same documents. Bhalla said, “The player even submitted a notary attested affidavit and the LDCA allowed the player on that basis only. It is possible to check the age of players till 16 through medical check-up but in case of the U-19 team, we have to depend on documents only. The documents were also checked by four PCA referees during the tournament but no anomalies were found at that time too. The association is not at fault and no trickery was done intentionally by the officials.”Mangal said, “The player forged the documents and we will file a plea with the PCA that the rest of the team should not be barred from the tournament.”PCA chief executive officer (CEO) Deepak Sharma said, “Action has been taken against the LDCA, the overaged player and U-19 team as per the norms of the PCA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-u-19-team-barred-from-c-ship-for-playing-with-overaged-member-101625773766646.html
09-07-2021||Kolkata||TMC done much more than Left Front, says BJP’s Ashok Lahiri after Bengal budget||Kolkata: Former chief economic adviser and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Ashok Lahiri on Thursday told the Bengal assembly that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) should audit the accounts of the state government. After taking part in a discussion on the state budget submitted by the government on Wednesday, Ashok Lahiri, who won the Balurghat seat in north Bengal, told reporters that no CAG audit report has been submitted in the House since 2016-17.“All companies audit their accounts every year. Similarly, the accounts of the central and state governments are audited by the CAG. An audit of the 2020-21 accounts is not possible now because of lack of time. An audit of the older accounts is possible but no CAG report is available since 2017-18. Hence, the figures mentioned as ‘actuals’ in the budget papers are actuals for the government, not according to audited accounts. I told the assembly that CAG reports for 2019-20 should be placed before the House,” said Ashok Lahiri.Welfare schemes, special rebate on stamp duty and amendments in road tax were the highlights of the ₹3,08,727 crore budget for 2021-22 that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government placed at the assembly on Wednesday. “The government has placed its budget. The actual expenses and revenue receipts may vary and the government will submit a revised report around November-December. Only an audit can find out the actual figures. I am not saying this government only announces schemes and does not spend the amount it announces in its budget,” said Lahiri. Asked to compare the performance of Asim Dasgupta, the last finance minister of the Left Front government and finance minister Amit Mitra, Ashok Lahiri said, “I know both of them. I will not compare but I must say the TMC government has done much more than the Left Front. The TMC has improved Bengal’s condition. I must admit that.”During discussion on the budget, Lahiri told the assembly that Bengal needs a deep sea port. He also said the state government should come up with separate reports on the state’s economic condition, the plight of migrant workers and long-term plans for development.Ashok Lahiri later said it was a very significant day for me.“I never thought I would be into politics, never thought that in the assembly I would be sitting anywhere outside the visitor’s gallery. Today I had the opportunity to address the highest forum of democracy in the state. The first thing I said was that as a member of the opposition, I will take part in constructive discussion and speak with logic on the basis of documents. They are welcome to counter me with logic. Nobody tried to stop me while I spoke,” said Lahiri.During the day, the BJP wanted to move an adjournment motion and demanded a statement from the government on the recent fake vaccination scam. Assembly speaker, Biman Banerjee, did not allow the motion. In protest, BJP legislators did not attend the meeting of the assembly’s business accounts committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-done-much-more-than-left-front-says-bjp-s-ashok-lahiri-after-bengal-budget-101625773646504.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Burhan Wani’s death anniversary: Spontaneous strike in parts of Valley||A spontaneous shutdown was observed in parts of Kashmir on the fifth death anniversary of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani on Thursday. Since 2017, authorities have been suspending internet services in the region. However, this time no curbs were imposed except in Wani’s home district in south Kashmir’s Pulwama where an encounter was also raging between militants and security forces.Shops and businesses were partially closed and traffic movement was also affected in parts of summer capital Srinagar, particularly in the old city and in the city centre Lal Chowk. Shutdown was also observed in parts of south Kashmir districts.“The people here are observing a strike to remember Burhan Wani. Most of the shops are closed while traffic was thin in the morning but the movement improved by the afternoon,” said Mohammad Akbar, a street vendor in Old City Srinagar. In the city centre’s business hub of Lal Chowk, businesses were mostly closed while public transport was not much affected. “Nobody had given the call for the hartal but this is a spontaneous response on his death anniversary every year,” said a shop keeper not wishing to be named. Burhan Wani, a Hizbul Mujahideen commander, was killed along with two other associates in an encounter with security forces on July 8, 2016 in south Kashmir’s Kokernag in Anantnag district. His death had plunged the whole valley into crisis for months together and led to the death of around 100 persons.While separatists would call a strike on Wani’s anniversary but after the crackdown on them and revocation of J&K special status on August 5,2019, there have been no calls from them for strike. Authorities would earlier impose restrictions in parts of the Valley but not this time, except for an increased presence of security forces. A police official of Awantipora in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, where Wani lived, said that no restrictions were imposed. “There was a partial strike in Wani’s home town of Tral but no restrictions were imposed in the district,” he said. A local of Pulwama said that the situation was normal. “There is an increased presence of security forces. Many checkpoints have also been established and mobile internet has been suspended from midnight,” said Bilal Ahmad, a resident.Police have vigorously rejected a press release under the name of hard-line Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Geelani calling for strike on July 8 and 13 as fake and issued by someone from Pakistan. Police said that Geelani’s family confirmed that he did not issue any such statement.Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar on Wednesday said internet services will not be snapped on July 8 and July 13 but police will increase its surveillance to ensure peace. July 13 is observed as Martyr’s Day in memory of 21 Kashmiris who were killed by the army of autocratic ruler Maharaja Hari Singh during an uprising in 1931 when the region was a princely state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/burhan-wani-s-death-anniversary-spontaneous-strike-in-parts-of-valley-101625773406626.html

Division Number 5 police have registered a case against unidentified persons. Complainant Gurdeep Singh, 46, of Patti Sekhwa village of Barnala, said that on Wednesday, three men contacted him for hiring his taxi to Jalandhar. When he refused, the men asked him to drop them off at Ludhiana to which he agreed and settled the deal at ₹1,900. Gurdeep said that on the way, they stopped at a filling station near Jalaldiwal where one of the accused paid for the fuel with a debit card. The men had initially asked Gurdeep to drop them near Bharat Nagar Chowk but when they reached there, the trio asked him to take them to Sarabha Nagar.

I am ready to face any investigation,” Shekhawat had then said.The senior ACB official cited above said the magistrate concerned will issue a notice to Shekhawat and Sanjay Jain to appear before the court and provide samples. The notices will be executed by the ACB.The ACB request for the voice samples came a fortnight after the Congress’ chief whip Mahesh Joshi was summoned by Delhi Police on June 15 in connection with the FIR lodged by Shekhawat on phone-tapping on March 25 this year against the chief minister’s officer on special duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma.The OSD has approached the Delhi high court to seek quashing of the FIR against him.

So, there was no deficiency in service on its part.However, the commission stated, “It is not...that Swiggy is providing purely gratuitous service to its customers, without any consideration.”“Swiggy is an online shopping portal and works as a link between the buyer and seller to collect orders from consumers and forward those to the seller/vendor concerned for the purpose of delivery...It is certainly not a charitable organisation,” it held.Terming Swiggy guilty of unfair and deficient services, the commission directed it to refund ₹4.50 along with interest @9% per annum with effect from the date of filing of the complaint till its realisation. Apart from paying ₹10,000 to Garg for mental agony, harassment and litigation charges, the company has also been ordered to deposit ₹10,000 in the account of Haryana State Council for Child Welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charging-panchkula-man-4-50-gst-on-soft-drink-costs-swiggy-20000-101625772686705.html

I see that a strong linkage needs to be there between academia, industry, and extension department so that research of PAU could reach the farmers at the earliest.”He lauded the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technique recommended by PAU and said it has been a successful model. “Not only has the technique saved 20 to 50% groundwater, it has also saved the input cost of farmers by ₹3,000 per acre. Last year, paddy was sown under five hectares of land through the DSR technique. We are yet to receive the report on the area covered under DSR this year,” said Tewari.Tewari called upon the agri-experts to come up with a course for progressive farmers in the field of horticulture.He further stated, “We need to take the farmers out of this monoculture of wheat-paddy and give new options to them for diversification.” “The entire focus of the research has been on productivity. But despite high productivity, we are unable to meet the returns, which farmers expect,” he observed.Tewari said,“Punjab is the most prosperous state and is dependent on the farming community. If we have a prosperous farming community, it will help generate employment in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/additional-chief-secy-tewari-takes-charge-as-pau-vc-101625772568022.html

She returned to work and got busy for an hour in a video conference. Meanwhile the person didn’t leave for the test and continued to wait outside her office,” said an official, not wishing to be named.When she got free, after confirming whether she received a call, he put the health minister on call with her, the official added.After an inquiry was marked, Dr Kaur submitted the text messages exchanged with the person, indicating that he was immediately attended to and was asked to get the test done. But a suspension order followed, evoking criticism from various resident associations and the Indian Medical Association. When contacted, Dr Kaur refused to talk. Vij and Rajeev Arora, Haryana’s additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, did not revert to HT’s attempts to contact them.Decision has demoralised doctors: HCMS bodyThe Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) Association, a body which represents over 3,000 government doctors of Haryana, has come forward in support of Dr Kaur.Body’s president Dr Jasbir Singh Parmar said the decision was unacceptable and had demoralised doctors, who had been working hard during the pandemic. “Everyone is preparing for the third wave and here a doctor has been suspended after dealing with the first two waves from the front,” he said, adding that they will be writing to the health minister to reinstate the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/suspended-panchkula-civil-surgeon-seeks-reinstatement-101625772386845.html

Constable Pradeep complained to the police that while he was on duty at the traffic lights, he spotted the driver of a Maruti Swift car (PB-13BK-7087) talking on the phone while coming from Colony Number 5 side. As the vehicle stopped at the traffic lights, he also saw that both the driver and the person sitting next to him were not wearing seat belts. He approached the car and asked the driver to park the vehicle on the road side, but he tried to escape the spot. In the attempt, the car hit Pradeep who landed on the bonnet of the vehicle. But the driver continued to drive and suddenly applied brakes after 500 metres, causing Pradeep to fall on the road, the police said. The driver sped away, following which Pradeep alerted the traffic helpline 1073.

OPD, sampling at pathology and X-ray services are likely to be affected. “The third wave of Covid is likely to come and all the medical staff are busy preparing infrastructure/facilities, including paediatric ICUs. In such a situation, transfers will not be justified,” said Dr Amit Singh, general secretary, Provincial Medical Services Association, a body of about 14,000 government doctors. The call for the work boycott has been given by the Chikitsa Mahasangh, Uttar Pradesh. Roughly, 50,000 members of the Mahasangh, including 7,000 pharmacists, 4,500 staff nurses, 2,000 lab technicians and government doctors have supported the call. “Transfers at this time are like punishment. Many health workers are ill and many have their family members suffering from post-Covid problems,” said Sunil Yadav, president of UP branch of pharmacists’ federation. “We won’t force anyone to join the work boycott. If anyone wants to work, they can,” said Singh. 18,915 people inoculatedLUCKNOW A total of 18,915 people, including 8,202 female beneficiaries, took the Covid vaccine jabs in Lucknow on Thursday.

Various other state boards are also yet to announce the results.PU-CET (UG) was earlier scheduled to be held in June but was delayed and there is no clarity on when the final call will be taken.However, PU’s controller of examination Jagat Bhushan said, “The matter is under consideration, and we will take a decision as soon as possible.”Last year, PU had suspended its undergraduate and postgraduate entrance tests due to pandemic, and students were admitted on merit basis. However, entrance exams will be held physically this year.PU has already scheduled some entrance tests, including PU-CET (PG) on August 3 and 4, the tourism and hospitality aptitude test (PUTHAT 2021) on July 30 and lateral engineering entrance test (PULEET 2021) on August 1. For the LLB (three-year) course, the entrance exam will be held on August 8.Conduct exam soon, say teachersMany teachers are of the opinion that the varsity should the date of entrance test immediately and start the admission process so that students are enroled timely. They said the entrance test centres should be set up in major cities where affiliated colleges are located like Ludhiana etc.“The university should start the admission process for UG courses now because other universities have already begun the same. Even private colleges in the peripheral areas of Chandigarh have started enroling students. In the previous years, the UG entrance exam was conducted before the announcement of Class 12 results,” said a PU professor on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-yet-to-decide-on-ug-entrance-test-schedule-101625771733912.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||High court seeks senate polls schedule from Panjab University||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Thursday sought the schedule of senate elections from Panjab University (PU) by July 16.The bench of justice AG Masih and justice AK Verma observed that in view of the present situation, this court is of the firm view that the direction issued by the single-judge bench with regard to holding of the election needs to be complied with.The court was hearing a plea from PU challenging the judgment which asked the varsity to hold polls within two months, in March. The HC in March had criticised the role of vice-chancellor Raj Kumar and directed PU to conduct senate polls within two months. Its order came on the plea of seven former senators, who had moved the court on December 22 seeking directions to hold governing body polls.The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31, 2020. Elections were to take place in August 2020, but varsity deferred the same citing Covid-19 as the reason. The single-judge bench had criticised the V-C’s role and observed that provisions on governance had been thrown “off to the winds” and the university was being run as a “one-man show”.PU in the appeal filed on May 13 had argued that March 23 judgment was not only contrary to facts but also to three division bench judgments in which decision on various steps taken in view of pandemic were upheld by the HC in the matters of admissions etc. The directions are untenable because the varsity is bound to follow restrictions/prohibitions imposed by the respective states during the pandemic period, PU had stated. On May 13, the HC had deferred the hearing in view of the raging pandemic. The matter will now be taken up on July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-seeks-senate-polls-schedule-from-panjab-university-101625771674823.html

I have given all departments till the end of this week to prepare a list all projects which can be completed within 100 days,” said Pal. The adviser has also directed them to prioritise their work and stick to deadlines.After the list is compiled, he will monitor and examine their implementation and emphasis will be on sticking to deadlines. The accountability of the departments will be fixed in case they don’t stick to the schedule.The adviser’s directions came after he reviewed the working of different UT departments and the municipal corporation. Over a week, the departments had made detailed presentations before him, detailing the status of ongoing and proposed projects.Pal, a 1988-batch Indian Administrative Services officer belonging to the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre, was appointed UT adviser on June 21 and joined the administration on June 23.In addition to Covid management with emphasis on vaccination, Pal had stressed on major improvements in the road network within the city. In directions issued to the MC and the UT engineering department, he had asked the work to be prioritised as soon as monsoon withdraws from the city.Earlier, he had directed the departments to complete cleaning of road gullies and seasonal rivulets to avert flooding and waterlogging during monsoons.Projects marred by delaysOver the last few years, the administration’s working has come under criticism for its poor track record of implementing projects within stipulated deadlines. Some of these are: Health infrastructure: A sports injury centre, a new emergency-trauma centre and a mother-child care centre—all planned to come up at GMCH-32, have been marred with long delays. Even with funds allocated and plans in place, these projects are nowhere near completionSector-17 rejuvenation: Engraving of the city’s map at the Sector 17 plaza was to be completed within six months, with a deadline of August 15, 2020, but is yet to be doneGarbage legacy mining in Dadumajra: It was scheduled to be completed within 18 months, but has missed several revised deadlinesImplementation of policies: The administration has failed to formulate key policies like start-up policy, EV policy and policy for contractual employees. In cases where it is in place, like the parking policy, departments have failed to initiate the implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-adviser-demands-roadmap-to-wrap-up-projects-swiftly-101625771546743.html
09-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s positivity rate jumped to 2% on Wednesday||For the first time in 10 days, the city’s test positivity rate – the percentage of tests that come positive – jumped to 2% on Wednesday. While the positivity rate has been oscillating between 1.4% and 1.7% since June 28, civic officials attributed Wednesday’s marginal rise to focussed testing. The positivity rate, however, dropped down to 1.4% on Thursday. “A positivity rate of 2% means the situation is still under control,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “The marginal increase only suggests that our strategy of targetted and focussed testing is working. We are also gradually opening the city and there is plenty of movement of people, which could also be contributing to positive cases,” he said. According to Kakani, the civic body has rolled out focussed testing for close contacts of positive patients, people living in containment areas, and in wards that are recording higher cases. The positivity rate has to be correlated with the number of tests carried out in the city. Typically, when the number of tests goes down, the positivity rate shows a rise. Mumbai’s daily testing numbers have been fluctuating between 30,000 and 35,000. On Wednesday, when Mumbai carried out 31,944 tests, the city’s positivity rate jumped to 2% with 664 positive cases. On Thursday, the city carried out 37,802 tests and its positivity rate dropped to 1.4% with 540 cases. Experts say the number of daily positive cases in Mumbai which run into hundreds suggest that there is a continuous circulation of the virus. This trend should push the civic body to increase the number of tests as the current tests are inadequate. For instance, according to BMC’s dashboard. Delhi is carrying out 11.53 lakh cumulative tests per million population and Bengaluru is carrying out 9.94 lakh tests per million. In comparison, Mumbai’s cumulative tests per million are at the lower end at 5.3 lakh, according to BMC’s dashboard. Dr Ajit Pampatwar, a medical officer in K-West ward, said they are reaching out to residents in sealed buildings for testing. “We are also testing people in hotels, at construction sites, and other crowded areas like malls and grocery stores, etc. Overall, the positivity seems to be very low and a majority of those who are testing positive have a mild infection,” he said, adding the ward, which covers Andheri west, Vile Parle and Juhu, is now recording anywhere between 40 and 60 positive cases daily. During the peak in April and May, the daily positive cases ranged between 900 and 1,100 in the ward. According to Kakani, the civic body is set to roll out the fifth serological survey to better understand the exposure of the population to the virus. “This upcoming survey will have a sample size of around 4000 people randomly selected from all wards. It will help us gauge the situation before the third wave.” The fourth serological survey had covered only the paediatric population and revealed that nearly 50% of children had antibodies against the virus. The third survey, conducted with a sample size of 10,197, had revealed that nearly 36% of people had developed antibodies. The previous serosurveys showed more population living in slums was exposed to the virus as compared to the non-slum population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-positivity-rate-jumped-to-2-on-wednesday-101625771306045.html
09-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s vax drive at over 300 centres put on hold again||For a second time this month, the Covid-19 vaccination drive at more than 300 centres run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and state government will remain suspended on Friday, owing to a shortage of doses. However, vaccination will continue as per schedule at private hospitals. In a statement on Thursday, the BMC said, “Vaccination will remain suspended on Friday, July 9, 2021, at government and municipal vaccination centres in the city due to insufficient vaccine stock available under the Covid-19 prevention vaccination campaign.”The BMC had expected replenishment of vaccine doses on Wednesday, but it did not receive any stock due to which the decision was taken. According to BMC officials, the civic body’s central vaccine storage facility was out of stock on Wednesday, but the drive continued in nearly half of the centres on Thursday with the help of leftover stock at the respective vaccination centres.There are 401 vaccination centres in the city, of which 283 are civic run, 20 are of state government and rest are private vaccination centres.Previously, the Covid-19 vaccination drive was similarly suspended in 300 vaccination centres on July 1, owing to vaccine shortage.Before that, due to the vaccine shortage, Mumbai had suspended the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group between the second weeks of May and June.According to BMC officials, they require even more vaccine doses in July considering the highest number of first doses, around 550,000, was administered in April 2021, and assuming these are now coming to civic run centres, the BMC needs even more vaccine doses. A BMC official said, “We have the capacity to vaccinate over 100,000 vaccine doses on a daily basis, but we are not able to administer even half of it due to vaccine shortage.”Meanwhile, 45,171 citizens were vaccinated on Thursday. Of these, 16,112 were vaccinated at civic, state centres and 29,059 at private hospitals. Overall, 5,929,190 citizens have been vaccinated in the city till now, of which 2,462,079 in private hospitals and the rest in public centres. Of the total, 1,247,410 are fully vaccinated with both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-vax-drive-at-over-300-centres-put-on-hold-again-101625770945907.html

They said Agarwal got manufactured this fake syrup of brand name ‘Dr Gas’ through Apple Formulation Pvt Ltd firm of Roorkee and supplied it to different medical agencies in Lucknow and its adjoining districts such as Gonda, Barabanki and Ayodhya..Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) STF Deepak Kumar Singh said the STF initiated investigation on the complaint of Harendra Singh of Credit Life Sciences Pvt Ltd of Basti, who are the original manufactures and suppliers of Dr Gas syrup.The DSP said Agarwal with help of Roorkee firm owned by two brothers Naveen and Rahul Khetan through his aide Himanshu Soni got manufactured this duplicate quality of syrup.He said the duplicate quality of syrup was manufactured at very cheap rates and supplied in the market on original rates.He said the STF are carrying out further raids to arrest the remaining people whose names have surfaced in the investigation.It is the second time when Roorkee has been linked to fake medicine racket. In another case related to Roorkee, fake medicines worth ₹ 3 crore were seized from Amroha in 2018 when FSDA officials got information about certain medicines being sold at ‘surprisingly low’ rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/arrest-of-lucknow-pharma-firm-owner-unearths-racket-supplying-fake-medicines-101625770465976.html
09-07-2021||Lucknow||BJP candidates set to win unopposed on 292 out of 825 block pramukh seats||The BJP candidates looked set to win unopposed at nearly 292 of the 825 seats where nominations for block pramukh (or kshetra panchayat chairpersons’ polls) were held on Thursday, amid reports of violence at a few places.The Samajwadi Party looked set to retain its stronghold in Saifai.Officials said the block pramukh scene would be little clearer on Friday after close of withdrawal time on Friday. Political observers feel that there would be several ‘withdrawals’ on Friday.“Elections for the remaining posts at the rural level would be held on Saturday and results known the same day,” state election commission officials said.Like in recent held zila panchayat chairpersons’ poll where zila panchayat ward members voted, in these block pramukh polls, the block development committee members will vote to elect their chiefs.Both are indirect polls. There are 826 block pramukh posts in UP.Many senior politicians, including former UP assembly speaker Mata Prasad Pandey whose wife is a contestant for the block pramukh polls in Itwa block of Siddharthnagar and former UP minister Lalji Verma who had gone to support a candidate in Tanda block of Ambedkarnagar, alleged harassment during the nomination process.“My vehicle was smashed, we were targeted, and a set of nomination papers were snatched,” said Pandey.Verma also alleged ill treatment at the hands of the ruling BJP members. At several places, BJP was up against rebels, as many party members fielded candidates against the party’s official pick. At few others, the BJP was up against independents. “The BJP goons are openly threatening to murder democracy and the police is looking the other way,” SP MLC Sunil Singh Sajan said in Unnao.“They have forgotten their past. The opposition claims are bogus,” said UP BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava.“The opposition allegations of misuse of power are a bunch of lies. In fact, a viral audio of one of Samajwadi Party MLCs, in which he is obliquely claiming ownership of the fact that only he and his party have the copyright to hooliganism is self-explanatory,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev.In January 2020, the then additional state election commissioner Ved Prakash Verma had written to the state government to consider the proposal of amending the clause in the 73rd constitutional amendment that provides for indirect elections to these zila panchayat chairpersons’ and block pramukh posts.HT is in possession of the letter written by Verma to principal secretary, Panchayati Raj favouring a proposal for direct elections to zila panchayat chairpersons and block pramukh polls.“That missive was sent in response to a centre’s query of December 30, 2019, to the state on the subject. The point is that only the parliament can carry out an amendment if direct elections are to be held for zila panchayat and block level chief’s posts. And that means it would have to be considered at the appropriate level,” an official said. The BJP that had lost to the Samajwadi Party in the elections to the 3050 zila panchayat ward members, made up by winning 67 (including a solitary win of its ally Apna Dal) of the 75 zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls held last week.Fearing resentment in its ranks, the BJP had relaxed norms for these polls, allowing family members of ministers and lawmakers to contest these polls.In zila panchayat ward members polls it had barred family members of party leaders from contesting and also said those leaders wanting to contest themselves would have to quit party posts.UP labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya’s daughter-in-law is contesting these polls from Unchachar, in Rae Bareli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-candidates-set-to-win-unopposed-on-292-out-of-825-block-pramukh-seats-101625770225887.html
09-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai door-to-door vax: BMC collects ward-wise data of bedridden patients||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started collecting ward-wise data of bedridden patients who want to get inoculated with Covid-19 vaccines. BMC has issued a form for bedridden patients at each ward asking them to submit details of such patients. The form includes the name of the patient, age, sex, the reason for being bedridden, duration and willingness for the Covid-19 vaccine.Hundreds of bedridden patients in the city aren’t able to get vaccinated as they can’t travel to vaccination centres. Many of these families who belong to poor economic backgrounds cannot afford ambulances to ferry them to vaccination centres for inoculation. But considering these patients have underlying health issues, they become most susceptible to Covid-19.“We haven’t got the final green signal from the Central government to start the door-to-door vaccination but, we want to keep the data prepared. So, we have asked all the ward offices to compile the data and submit it to the BMC for further references,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.As per the BMC rules, any patient with health issues who is completely bedridden and can’t travel to vaccination centres will be included in the list. But, all the medical documents would be checked to confirm the health status of the patient. “Also, physically challenged people who have been bedridden for more than six months will also be added. But we would also require a doctor certificate with the declaration that the person is physically unfit to travel,” Kakani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-door-to-door-vax-bmc-collects-ward-wise-data-of-bedridden-patients-101625769625852.html

09-07-2021||Lucknow||Owaisi’s visit to dargah in Bahraich triggers war of words between BJP, Bhagidari Morcha in U.P.||All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s visit to dargah sharif at Bahraich to pay obeisance to medieval Ghaznavid general Ghazi Salar Masud alias Ghazi Miyan on Thursday sparked a war of words between the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha constituents — AIMIM and the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP).Terming the visit of Owaisi to the dargah as an insult to Maharaja Suheldev, an 11th century ruler, who is said to have defeated and killed Masud in a battle at Bahraich in 1034 AD, Uttar Pradesh’s backward class welfare minister Anil Rajbhar said the alliance between AIMIM and SBSP was an insult to the backward Rajbhar community.The BJP government in U.P. was working to restore the pride of Suheldev by constructing a memorial and installation of a statue at Chittaura in Bahraich, he said.Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Sardhana assembly seat in Meerut district Sangeet Som, too, lashed out at Owaisi and Om Prakash Rajbhar.“The leaders of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha have hurt the sentiments of the Hindu community who revered Maharaja Suhdeldev,” he said.Announcing the launch of the campaign for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election, Owaisi hit back at the BJP leaders, “We are not jokers of the circus but ring masters, all will dance to our tunes.” He alleged that BJP was trying to divert the attention from the mismanagement by the state government during the Covid pandemic.He further alleged that a large number of deaths were reported in U.P. due to the failure of the state government when the second wave of Covid-19 hit the state. Hundreds of bodies were dumped in rivers and patients admitted in hospitals across the state did not get oxygen, he claimed.The Covid vaccination in UP was also slow and merely 3% people had received the vaccine doses, he alleged. [According to official figures, 3.52 crore or 35.2 million doses have been administered in U.P. since January 16].Inaugurating the office of the party’s district unit in Bahraich, Owaisi said AIMIM will contest the 2022 assembly election in alliance with SBSP-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha which would highlight the failure of the BJP government to keep the promises made during the 2017 assembly election.SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar said BJP leaders were trying to drive a wedge between the AIMIM and the SBSP over the issue of Maharaja Suheldev and Salar Masud as they feared that OBC (Other Backward Class) voters will not support the BJP in the assembly election.The Mehbooba Mufti-led People Democratic Party formed a government in Jammu and Kashmir with the support of BJP in 2016 and it was an unholy alliance, he said. The SBSP will contest the assembly election in alliance with the AIMIM, he asserted.“We will work on Backward-Muslim and Dalit unity to win the assembly election,” he said.Political observer SK Srivastava said the main political parties — the BJP, the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress — were working to consolidate the support of the backward and Scheduled Caste communities in the run-up to the 2022 assembly election but splinter groups like Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a coalition of various caste leaders, were looking to upset their applecart. The BJP and SP were trying to win the support of the small political parties that enjoyed some influence over various castes in the state, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/owaisis-visit-to-dargah-in-bahraich-triggers-war-of-words-between-bjp-bhagidari-morcha-in-up-101625769449331.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Power to recall witness should be exercised with discretion: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court said the power of a court to recall witness for examination has to be exercised with discretion after the court is satisfied that the demand for the same is not a frivolous or a vexatious one to delay the trial.The HC bench of justice Jaishree Thakur observed that an onerous duty has been cast upon the courts to ensure fair trial and to arrive at the truth, for which a witness can be recalled to testify under Section 311 of the CrPC. But the power has to be exercised with discretion.The HC declined the request from two accused in an alleged case of gangrape reported in April 2017 in Tohana (Fatehabad) in Haryana. They had challenged the August 2019 order of the additional district and sessions judge, Fatehabad, whereby an application for recalling two witnesses was dismissed.As per the order, during the course of proceedings before the trial court, the matter was compromised on January 1, 2018 after it was agreed that one of the accused would solemnise a marriage with the girl.The complainant resiled from her statement to secure the accused persons’ release. The girl’s family made arrangements for the marriage, but the accused did not turn up. The complainant filed plea for re-examining herself, which was allowed.Subsequently, the accused too filed a plea for re-examination of two witnesses arguing that cross examination of two witnesses was not proper and accused be allowed to recall two witnesses.The HC observed that the argument that proper questions could not be put to the witnesses in view of the compromise being in effect is not sustainable, as the medical was on record and available for the counsel to cross-examine the witnesses.There is nothing on records to show that due opportunity was denied to the petitioners herein from cross-examining the witnesses, it said further adding that a perusal of the pleadings and dates as mentioned concludes that the petitioners had been diligently following their case and were afforded opportunity to cross examine two witnessed in question.Now, seeking to recall the witnesses already duly examined is nothing but an effort to delay the entire trial and to fill up the lacunas which cannot be permitted at any cost, the court added, dismissing the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-to-recall-witness-should-be-exercised-with-discretion-hc-101625769393863.html
09-07-2021||Chandigarh||Uddar Gagan land release: BJP-JJP govt didn’t want CBI probe||The BJP-JJP government in Haryana was not keen on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the release of land in Rohtak to real estate developer Uddar Gagan Properties Limited, during the Congress rule.Brushing aside government’s contention, the Supreme Court on July 7 ordered a CBI probe into the matter.A perusal of the note filed by the amicus curiae, Jaideep Gupta in the apex court and the state government’s response to his note revealed that while amicus curiae said it was necessary to have a proper time-bound investigation keeping in mind the specific observations of the court, the state government countered him saying there was no justification for entrusting the investigation to the CBI since the matter has already undergone detailed technical and legal scrutiny.AMICUS CURIAE’S VIEWThe amicus curiae said clear findings were given by the high court that government officials acted fraudulently, indulged in suppression of relevant information and failed to assist the chief minister to arrive at a fair and just decision.“It was held that an unholy nexus to promote the interest of the private developer came into existence and derailed the public purpose and led to misuse of power... The apex court found no reason whatsoever to disagree with the findings recorded by the HC. It was categorically held that the state acted in violation of the public trust doctrine in a fraudulent and clandestine exercise of power,” the amicus told the court.Referring to the inquiry done by retired judge, the amicus curiae said it does not appear that the committee has seriously taken into consideration the HC’s findings as upheld by the SC. “In Manesar case, the investigation was entrusted to CBI under similar circumstances,” he said.The aspects pointed out by the HC and the SC in their judgements will not appear from a mere perusal of document files. It is clear that a proper investigation keeping in mind specific observations of the court is necessary. Such investigation may be entrusted to the CBI as was done in Manesar case, the amicus curiae said.HARYANA’S VIEWOpposing the contentions of the amicus, the government, in an affidavit, said justice (retd) RS Madan submitted a detailed report which made a detailed analysis of all technical and legal issues in the matter.“The matter was examined comprehensively to submit conclusive findings in the matter. The government has accepted this inquiry report after taking legal opinion from advocate general. Role of certain officials was also inquired into by IAS officer Anurag Rastogi, who also submitted his report. The report is being examined by the state government for a final decision,” government said.The government said since the matter has already undergone detailed technical and legal scrutiny, there is no justification for entrusting the investigation to the CBI.‘MANESAR, UDDAR GAGAN DIFFERENT CASES’The government said no parity can be drawn in the Uddar Gagan case with the Manesar land release case.Manesar and Uddar Gagan cases are different. In Manesar case, the land owners executed sale deeds and the land was released during acquisition proceedings and before the award.In Uddar Gagan case, there was no sale or purchase of land during acquisition proceedings. The land owners entered into collaboration agreements with Uddar Gagan before the award and filed an application for grant of license before the award.In Manesar case, the settlement money at ₹3.5 crore per acre was made over to entities who neither procured the land from the original land holder nor were they wanted to develop the property.“Such entities were termed ‘middle men’ who walked away with tremendous amount of money or benefit at ₹3.5 crore per acre. It was found to be a deal denoting quid pro quo whereas it was not so in the Uddar Gagan case,” the government said.“In Uddar Gagan case, licenses stood rejected by the department for approximately 140.975 acre on file after deliberation on merits and were pending for concurrence of the state government when the civil writ petitions challenging the non-grant of licenses were filed before the HC and accordingly the licenses were granted only upon the HC orders to do so within a prescribed time frame. No such situation existed in the Manesar case,” the government added.The affidavit said the HC ordered release of land and grant of license in Uddar Gagan case for balance areas for which license applications were not yet granted. No such release of land or grant of license was ordered by the HC in Manesar case.Thus, licenses for 15.80 acre, 32.45 acre and 92.725 acre were granted as per the HC orders whereas in Manesar case, licenses were granted after lapse of award.There is no allegation regarding title transfer or registration of land for license before award in the present case whereas the main ground for orders in Manesar case was title transfer or registration between Section 4 and award before grant of license.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uddar-gagan-land-release-bjp-jjp-govt-didn-t-want-cbi-probe-101625769326976.html

He also extended his support to the NGO’s ‘Refuse to Ride’campaign which draws attention to the plight of Asian elephants in India. The German diplomat is also a professional musician who has over five records to his credit and has previously served as ambassador in Kenya, Seychelles, Venezuela and South Africa. Being an avid animal lover, Walter spent time observing the resident pachyderms, all of whom have been given a second chance at a life free of abuse and cruelty. He was impressed by the scientific and humane elephant management techniques adopted by Wildlife SOS such as positive conditioning and target training. This was followed by an interactive session with the Wildlife SOS team of elephant care staff and veterinarians to learn about their efforts to help these animals have a better, healthier future at the centre and understand the threats that Asian elephants face in India. He was deeply moved upon hearing the heart-breaking stories of the elephants and the trauma that they endured in the past. Lindner also visited the elephant hospital which was established by Wildlife SOS and the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department in 2018. At the hospital, he learnt about the serious health issues of captive elephants and the efforts taken by the expert veterinary team to treat injured, sick and geriatric elephants. He concluded his visit with an observational walk with elephants, Maya and Phoolkali at the Yamuna riverbanks. The envoy said, “It was really heartwarming to see these elephants being cared for and loved by the Wildlife SOS staff. I would recommend everyone to come here and see these majestic animals. You can see what cruelty had been inflicted upon them in the past so let’s strive to prevent it from happening in India and anywhere around the world. I am happy to extend my support to Wildlife SOS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/german-envoy-visits-elephant-care-centre-in-mathura-101625769265909.html

Till Thursday, the state recorded 162 mm rainfall, slightly more than normal. Thirty-eight of the 75 districts in the state reported an average of 28% less rainfall in the monsoon season, while only 18 districts recorded rainfall normal rainfall. As per the Indian Metrological Department (IMD) data,, the western UP districts received less rainfall as compared to eastern UP districts. The average rainfall recorded in western UP between June 1 to July 8 was 80 mm, 35% less than the normal rainfall of 123.7 mm. The districts which recorded the least rainfall as per the data are Gautam Buddha Nagar (-79%), Ghaziabad (-84%), Etawah (-72%), Lalitpur(-82%), Aligarh (-52%), Auraiya (-49 %), Baghpat (-64%), Bulandshahr (-62%), Mathura (-61%), Mahoba (-61%), Saharanpur (-69%), Shamli (-61%) and Farrukhabad (-74%). Many of these districts are leading growers of paddy and sugarcane, two major kharif crops of the state. Experts believe that the lack of rain will affect the production of kharif crops in the state. “The lack of rain will affect paddy farmers more than those who have grown sugarcane in their farms. Paddy farms require excess water in the first 50 days after cultivation. The monsoon ensured the availability of this water. But this year, paddy farmers are forced to depend on tube -wells for water because of pause in monsoon. This will reduce the earning of farmers and will also cause rise in price of paddy,” explained farm economist Hitesh Chandra. However, the monsoon is likely to revive over the state,, bringing some respite to the farmers. According to the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD), the monsoon will cover the entire state by the end of this week. “The monsoon rain resumed in some eastern UP districts on Thursday. It is expected to cover the remaining parts of the state by Saturday,” said state MeT director JP Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-turns-rain-deficient-as-monsoon-takes-a-halt-101625769145997.html

We are unable to drive tractors as diesel is costly. The farming cost has increased, and the outcome also is not satisfactory... Earlier, BJP leaders used to protest against price rises. However, now that they are in the government, the inflation is not in check.”Sunil Pradhan, spokesperson of BKU-Tikait, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “A lot of people have lost jobs in the Covid-induced lockdown. This has put their household budget in a state of disarray... The state government must take measures to create employment rather than increasing the commodity prices so frequently.”BKU-Tikait workers protested at Noida’s Mahamaya flyover, Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk, and the sub-registrar’s office in Jewar, from 10am to 12:15pm. Meanwhile, BKU-Kranti members protested at Noida Sector 19, and later submitted a memorandum to the Noida city magistrate, Uma Shankar Singh, demanding that the Uttar Pradesh government address the issue at the earliest.Uma Shankar Singh said, “We have received the memorandum and will forward it to the Uttar Pradesh government.

HC directed the Maharashtra government, through the education department, to publish the details of the divisional fee regulation committees (DFRC) in all the divisions of SSC board via media after it was informed that many private unaided schools had acted “high-handedly” by increasing the fees for the academic year 2020-21 and had refused to allow students to attend virtual classes whose parents who were unable to pay them. However, the unaided schools’ forum sought to oppose the public interest litigation (PIL) stating that the allegations were not valid as there was no specific case mentioned in the plea and hence, sought time to file a reply. HC, however, said that due to the pandemic, schools should approach the issue differently to avoid forcing parents approaching the court. The intervenors were asked to file their reply by July 12. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, was hearing the PIL filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar and some parents. The bench was informed that though schools had been functioning virtually during the entire pandemic period and would continue to do so till the lockdown restrictions are lifted by the government, the court should direct authorities to get the institutes to provide various reliefs to parents and not act high-handedly by increasing fees for the new academic year. The PIL had sought directions to allow parents to pay fees in instalments and not debar students from attending classes. Senior counsel Birendra Saraf for Bhatkhalkar submitted that several parents in the western suburbs had complained about aided and unaided schools debarring their children from attending online classes due to non-payment of fees and hence, they had approached HC as similar problems were being faced by parents not only in Mumbai but other parts of the state as well. He added that the state had failed to constitute DFRCs. On Thursday, additional government pleader (AGP) for the state in response to the query of the bench on Wednesday submitted the government notification of June 7, which constituted DFRCs for Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad that were headed by a retired judge and said that process for appointing DFRCs in Kolhapur, Latur and Nashik divisions were underway. The AGP submitted that information of these DFRCs would be put up on the government website as soon as they were constituted. However, senior advocate JP Sen for unaided schools’ forum objected to the issues raised by the petitioners and said that the claims were vague and were not substantiated with any instances wherein parents were forced to pay fees or students were not allowed to attend classes. Sen requested the court to allow the forum to intervene and file its reply to the PIL, which the court allowed. The court then said that as the apprehension of the petitioners about DFRCs not being constituted were addressed, it would consider the other grievance of fee hike and said, “We allow intervenors to file reply so that the issue can be resolved amicably in the current circumstances arising out of pandemic. Let reply affidavits be placed on record by July 14.” The PIL has been posted for hearing to July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/settle-fee-hike-issue-amicably-hc-to-maharashtra-govt-parents-and-schools-101625769086498.html

The politician and his family are accused of defrauding the government exchequer of ₹61.25 crore.The case pertains to the purchase of a plot at Bhosari village in Haveli taluka on April 28, 2016, by Khadse’s kin for ₹3.75 crore against the prevalent market rate of ₹31 crore.Previously, Khadse had been questioned by ED in January. However, as new facts have emerged in the investigation, the central agency quizzed him for the second time. Khadse had joined NCP last year after exiting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).His son-in-law, Girish Chaudhari, was arrested by ED on Wednesday in the same case. A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday sent Chaudhari in ED’s custody till July 12. The agency on Thursday questioned Khadse with Chaudhari together, ED sources said.The senior NCP leader left ED office around 8pm and did not interact with mediapersons. His statement was also recorded by ED, his lawyer said.ED sources said that Khadse was quizzed regarding his role in the alleged illegal purchase of the Bhosari land as well as the fudging of records at the registration office. ED officers also questioned him regarding the alleged abuse of power and misuse of his official position as then revenue minister and forcing the registration officials concerned to reflect the market value of the said as 3.75 crore.He was also questioned about his role in allegedly suppressing the true market value of the land in the public and illegal changes/alterations in the government records, agency sources said.Khadse was also quizzed regarding some meetings that took place in 2016 between the accused in the case, including Chaudhari. ED officers also tried to find out if the former minister has any knowledge about the five shell companies which were used in layering of funds to purchase the said land.Khadse’s lawyer Mohan Tekavade, while speaking to mediapersons outside ED office, said, “We have been asked to submit certain documents, which we’ll provide within 10 days. No other summons has been issued. We will co-operate with the investigation and attend when required by ED.” Before entering ED office in the morning, Khadse had told journalists: “It’s a politically-motivated case. Earlier, five agencies had probed the same case and found nothing against me. [But] I will co-operate with ED.He had earlier also claimed that the investigations in the case, including those carried out by state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) and Income Tax department, had found no irregularities in the transaction. He had also claimed that the central agency was put after him because he left BJP to join NCP.Khadse’s wife Mandakani and the Bhosari land’s owner Abbas Rasalbhai Ukani Bhosari were also booked in the case by ED on August 28, 2019. ED’s case is based on the complaint filed by Maharashtra ACB against the Khadse’s in 2017. ACB had later closed the case, but ED continued its investigation into the alleged financial irregularities in the land deal.The plot’s ownership was contentious as the industries department acquired it in 1971, but the final award of the land was not made, and the owner had not been compensated for it.According to ED’s case Khadse and his family, despite having knowledge that the said plot is reserved for Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), fraudulently purchased it so that when MIDC would acquire it, they can claim compensation of the said property from the revenue authorities and receive compensation of more than double the market rate.ED said that Khadse, as the then revenue minister, mobilised the revenue officer for MIDC to acquire the land so that his family could file for compensation of the plot.“As per the valuation of the land provided by the sub-registrar, it [price of land] comes to ₹31.01 crore. However, it appears that Khadse, by abusing and misusing his official position, coerced and forced the registration officials concerned to reflect the market value of the said land as ₹3.75 crore,” ED stated in their remand application on Wednesday.Khadse, his wife and his son-in-law have suppressed the true market value of the said land from the public, ED added.The act of deleting and omitting the true market value of the said property in the records by sub-registrar and reflecting the compromised market value prima facie reflects a criminal act of tampering and forging a valuable security by sub-registrar on the instruction of the revenue minister, the central agency stated.While establishing the money trail, when ED officials asked Chaudhari about the source of funds for the land purchase, he said that he had availed a loan of ₹2 crore from Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited as he knew the firm’s chief director since 2003-04.However, when ED scrutinised the balance sheet of Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited, it was revealed that the company did not have any operating income in 2014-15 and 2015-16, and only ₹1.5-lakh income was generated in 2016-17 from the revenue.The probe further revealed that the company received funds from five other firms companies (Proficient Merchandise Ltd, Abjayoni Trading Pvt Ltd, Adamina Traders, Chemexgoods Pvt Ltd and Pearl Dealers Pvt Ltd) and transferred the amount to Chaudhari. These five companies exist only on paper and are shell companies used for layering of funds, ED said. This clearly shows that the source of the funds for the purchase of the said land is not genuine and has been routed through various companies by Chaudhari, the central agency said.ED has claimed that at the time of land deal, Chaudhari was aware that the land is reserved for MIDC. But he claimed before ED officers that his lawyer had informed him that a no objection certificate (NOC) from MIDC was not required as the 7/12 of the land was in Ukani’s name.Meanwhile, leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis, who was in Nashik, said, “ED has begun a probe against Khadse. The agency will say whatever it wants to say about the probe. I am not a spokesperson for ED. The law is taking its course.” While reacting to Khadse’s allegations that BJP is taking action against him for joining NCP, Fadnavis said that there is no culture of indulging in vendetta politics in BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-land-scam-ed-grills-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-for-nine-hours-101625768785895.html

09-07-2021||Pune||Experts advise against further relaxations in Pune; say, infection not yet under control||Though the demand for further relaxations of Covid norms has been made by traders and hoteliers, experts have warned that such a decision could worsen the situation. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management, said that a marginal increase in the positivity rate after the unlock should not be taken lightly. He suggested that the administration hold the thought of further easing Covid curbs for a few more weeks. District and civic officials are expected to discuss the Covid situation at the weekly Covid review meeting on Friday. “In the current set of relaxations, Covid cases have not dropped, on the contrary, they have increased. We will be heading for trouble if caution is not observed while making these decisions. The viral activity has not reduced. It means that the spread of the virus is still not in our control. People are not following the rules. At the Covid review meeting, I would suggest waiting for a week or two and then considering further relaxations. More curbs need not be added, but further relaxations should not be made,” said Dr Salunkhe. For the week of July 2-July 8 the positivity rate in the limits of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was recorded at 5.07%. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) recorded a positivity rate at 5.13% and the rural parts recorded it at 7.46%. Last week, Pune’s guardian minister Ajit Pawar had also expressed concern over the slight increase in the positivity rate. After the state government’s orders, level 3 restrictions have been imposed in the limits of PMC and PCMC. There has been a growing demand from the traders and hoteliers to increase the hours of operations for business establishments. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh said that any decision regarding the relaxation would be taken after the detailed discussion at the Covid review meeting. He also asserted the high testing numbers in Pune district. “Pune district has a high number of testing rates. We are doing more than 20,000 thousand tests per day and more than 60% of them are RT-PCR tests. All the measures advised by the task force are being followed,” said Deshmukh. Dr Salunkhe also highlighted the worrying Covid situation in Kolhapur and Sangli. He also added that the increase in the occupancy of ICU beds is being observed in Mumbai. “The Covid situation in Kolhapur and Satara can go out of control if more restrictions are not imposed there. Testing, institutional isolation should be the focus. These simple steps have to be implemented properly,” said Dr Salunkhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/experts-advise-against-further-relaxations-say-infection-not-yet-under-our-control-101625768006504.html
09-07-2021||Lucknow||After Modi ministry expansion, focus shifts to possibility of Yogi cabinet reshuffle in Uttar Pradesh||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried out a major expansion of his council of ministers, the focus is shifting to chief minister Yogi Adityanath in connection with the long- pending cabinet reshuffle that he may carry out ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.As barely six to seven months will be left for the new ministers to show their performance following the possible reshuffle, Yogi Adityanath would have to weigh his options before he decides to undertake the exercise.There are already seven vacancies in the council of ministers in Uttar Pradesh. The previous cabinet reshuffle in the state was on August 21, 2019.The chief minister may use the opportunity to reward good work, act against non-performers and strike a caste and regional balance. Although PM Modi’s move of inducting seven ministers from UP has helped in giving representation to various castes and regions, a rejig in the UP ministry will make a fresh impact.“Yes, there is the likelihood of a cabinet reshuffle in UP, too, in the coming days. Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept the performance of the ministers in focus as he carried out the reshuffle, giving representation to various caste and regions. Any reshuffle in UP is bound to have performance in focus as this will create an impact among the voters too,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department political science at Lucknow University. Senior BJP leaders were not available for comment on the matter.Yogi’s challenges will be greater if he decides to make performance the criteria for the possible reshuffle. Prime Minister dropped Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and shifted his minister of state Ashwini Kumar Choubey apparently over mismanagement during the second wave of Covid-19. The Opposition has targeted the Yogi government too for mismanagement of Covid-19 in the state.Three ministers, Kamla Rani Varun, Chetan Chauhan and Vijay Kashyap, died while fighting Covid-19.Veteran Bareilly MP Santosh Gangwar, who was then a Union minister, and UP minister for law Brijesh Pathak had raised the issue of Covid-19 management as did some other BJP leaders.PM Modi’s moves are generally followed by the BJP-ruled states. As Yogi too has been following the PM’s moves on important issues, it remains to be seen whether Yogi will carry out changes in the health department team in the state.The chief minister will also face the challenge of balancing caste and regional equations. Apna Dal (Sone Lal) MP Anupriya Patel’s induction in the union ministry is being viewed as the BJP’s attempt to keep its close ally and the Kurmi community in good humour. The Nishad Party has been one of the BJP’s allies and is now feeling left out for not getting any place in the Union ministry. Nishad Party leader Sanjay Nishad’s meetings with Union home minister Amit Shah and the chief minister had led to speculation about likely representation for the party in the ministry at the Centre or in the state. Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), one of the BJP’s allies in past, has parted ways with it. SBSP chief and former minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has been targeting the BJP. The BJP may have to rework its plans to counter the SBSP’s attempts to wean the Rajbhar community away from the party.The BJP had given indications about its renewed focus on Brahmins when former Union minister Jitin Prasada joined the party from the Congress. Prasada has met the chief minister more than once after joining his new party. It also remains to be seen whether the BJP will accommodate Prasada in state ministry or make use of him in the party organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-modi-ministry-expansion-focus-shifts-to-possibility-of-yogi-cabinet-reshuffle-101625762186113.html

All the patients of Covid-19 in Kasganj, Shravasti and Aligarh have recovered, and this happened because of teamwork. The public representatives, health workers, frontline workers, monitoring committees, local administration, and people played an important role in this. The efforts and awareness should continue. At the same time, the three districts should continue with aggressive testing,” he said.He said Uttar Pradesh had an aggressive “trace, test, treat and vaccinate” policy.In the past 24 hours, a total of 2.59 lakh (259,000) samples were tested and 112 new cases were detected while 258 patients recovered, the chief minister said.“The positivity rate is a mere 0.04% and the recovery rate is 98.6%.

Of these, around 1,000 trees will be replanted, said PMRDA officials. In 2018, the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) signed a contract with Tata and Siemens for the project to be developed on a public- private partnership model to decongest traffic in the city by improving connectivity within the metropolitan region. According to PMRDA Metro officials, they have identified a total 1,445 trees in the 23 kilometre metro route between Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar. The metro route is passing through PMC, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), PMRDA and Hinjewadi industrial zone. The maximum numbers of trees (841) are located in the PMC limits as compared to the PMRDA and PCMC region. There are only 58 trees to be removed in the PCMC area. Banudas Mane, PMRDA Metro official said, “We have tabled proposals to respective authorities to give us permission to cut these trees. Recently, we have asked the PMRDA to give permission to 176 trees in which 89 will be replanted and remaining 87 will be uprooted.” He further said, “We have decided to plant a total of 5,836 trees in different parts of the PMC, PCMC, PMRDA and MIDC region. Due to the demolition of Pune University flyovers, there are chances to save trees. We will also try to save around 20 per cent of trees in this route. We will replant more than that.” Ashok Ghorpade, chief garden superintendent of PMC said, “We have already given permission to PMRDA Metro to remove trees. We have also instructed Metro to replant trees and plant new trees in the ratio of 1:3 against chopped trees.” The proposed PMRDA Metro route is a 23.3 kilometre elevated track between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar. It will take less than 40 minutes to cover the distance from the civil court in Shivajinagar to the Hinjewadi IT Park. The route will have 23 elevated stations. The project is estimated at ₹8,100 crore.

The memorial service was also attended by political leaders from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Congress and the Left parties. Participants pledged to take the work done by Father Stan Swamy for the rights of tribals forward.“The UAPA is an old law, but it was never unleashed on the citizens this way since the Modi government came to power. They are using it to silence citizens, especially against those who raise the voice of dissent. The temperament of this government is the same as those of the British. They killed Birsa (Munda) in jail, now Swamy has been killed similarly,” said Dayamani Barla, noted tribal rights activist. Booked under sections of UAPA, Swamy was sent to jail in October 2020 over terror charges by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence case. Underlining how Swamy was a voice for the marginalised, Barla recalled how he played a crucial role in movements against the amendment of the CNT/SPT Act, anti-conversion bill, land acquisition amendment Act and mob lynching incidents in the state. While speaking at the event, senior JMM leader and legislator Stephen Marandi described Swamy’s death as “murder” and called for a continuous fight to give the right tribute to Swamy. “It was a conspiracy. This has now become an international issue. We need to take lessons from this incident as it will continue to happen and we need to expose this conspiracy using all possible means. As a political party, we will continue to expose the government,” added Marandi. Congress legislator Rajesh Kachhap, under whose constituency Bagaicha is located, shared similar views. “Our real tribute would be if we continued his fight for the cause of tribals, dalits, minorities and the poor,” he added. However, activist Gladston Kandulna blamed the parties like Congress and the JMM for the prevailing scenario. “We should not forget it was the Congres that brought the UAPA in 1967. If they are true to this fight, the JMM government should immediately withdraw the industrial policy it approved two days back,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/activists-politicians-gather-at-bagaicha-vow-to-take-stan-s-fight-forward-101625757805162.html

RDIF’s remarks came as some countries such as Kazakhstan and Argentina have decided to increase the gap between the two doses of the vaccine.Sputnik V, a vaccine against the coronavirus disease developed in Russia, is marketed abroad by RDIF. The comments on widening the gap between two doses were made by an official at RDIF in a statement, news agency Reuters reported, without naming the official. However, HT has not individually verified the statement. While Kazakhstan has increased the duration between two doses of the vaccine citing stronger immune response, Argentina has done so to ensure that the maximum number of people possible are covered by at least one dose of the vaccine, the Reuters report showed.Also read | India’s Morepen Labs begin manufacturing test batches of Sputnik VData from trials conducted by the Gamaleya Research Institute, the developer of the Sputnik V vaccine, showed that longer gaps between two doses provided a better immune response, the RDIF official said, without providing any further details about the trials. He also denied any connection between widening the duration between two doses and the supply of the vaccine by Russia, Reuters reported.He further said that all foreign partners and vaccine buyers have been notified by the RDIF that a gap of 90 days between the two doses would help to slightly increase the immune response.A gap of 21 days between two doses of 0.5ml each was prescribed by India’s Union health ministry in April 2021, when Sputnik V was granted a permission for restricted use in emergency situations by the country’s regulators. Also, in April, director of the Gamaleya Institute Alexander Gintsburg said that the gap between two shots of the vaccine could be increased to 90 days.Indian pharmaceutical company Morepen Laboratories earlier on Tuesday (July 6) said that it has started manufacturing test batches of the Sputnik V vaccine in India.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rdif-says-gap-between-two-sputnik-v-doses-can-be-increased-to-180-days-report-101625851549079.html
09-07-2021||World||Mystery swirls around Haiti president Jovenel Moise's murder||A 28-member hit squad made up of Colombians and Americans murdered President Jovenel Moise, Haitian police say, but little is known about who masterminded the assassination and their motives as the investigation pressed on Friday.Seventeen suspected assailants in Wednesday's pre-dawn attack have been arrested, including 15 Colombians and two Americans of Haitian origin, the country's police said Thursday at a press conference.Three Colombian gunmen were killed by police, while eight members of the hit squad are at large, Haiti's police chief Leon Charles said, though the figures differed slightly from other official sources.But little has been revealed on why gunmen broke into the president's personal residence, riddling him with bullets and wounding his wife, Martine.Authorities have caught the perpetrators of the attack, Leon said, but are now looking for the masterminds.Police paraded some of the suspects before the media Thursday, along with Colombian passports and weapons they had seized.At least six suspected members of the hit squad appear to be former Colombian soldiers, said Colombian Defense Minister Diego Molano.According to Interpol, the ex-military men were two retired non-commissioned army officers and four former soldiers, said General Jorge Vargas, national police director. Two were among those killed by the Haitian police.Colombian President Ivan Duque assured interim Haitian Prime Minister Claude Joseph "the collaboration of his country in advancing the investigation."Colombian media reports on Friday said four of the former military suspects left Bogota on June 4 for Haiti's neighbor the Dominican Republic, crossing the border on June 6.Taiwan confirmed late Thursday that 11 of the suspects were arrested on its embassy grounds, after security discovered a group of armed men had broken into the courtyard of the property that had been shuttered "for safety reasons" after Moise's murder.The US State Department, without confirming the arrest of any American nationals, has indicated it will help the Haitian investigation.The United States will help with the investigation by sending senior FBI and other officials as soon as possible, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday.- 'We need to know' -After days of paralysis in the capital, Port-au-Prince saw the timid return of people to the streets, shops opening and the resumption of public transport on Friday morning.People scrambled to stock up on basic necessities at supermarkets in anticipation of more days of instability.Gang violence, rife in the Caribbean nation, also picked up again on Friday, with clashes between groups paralyzing traffic on a major highway.The city's airport, shuttered in the wake of the attack, is expected to re-open Friday.But questions continued to swirl in the country over who killed the president and why."Foreigners came to the country to perpetrate this crime. We, Haitians, are appalled," a resident of the capital told AFP."We need to know who is behind this, their names, their backgrounds so that justice can be served," he added.Senior police officers, directly responsible for the security of the Haitian president, are in the hot seat and have been summoned to appear before the courts, said Port-au-Prince government commissioner Bed-Ford Claude on Thursday."If you are responsible for the security of the president, where were you? What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?" Claude said.Others have speculated on the possible involvement of security agents in the killing, adding to the confusion."The president of the Republic, Jovenel Moise, was assassinated by his security agents," former Haitian senator Steven Benoit said on Magik9 radio Friday."It is not Colombians who killed him. They were contracted by the Haitian state."- Political chaos -The attack has further destabilized the poorest country in the Americas, plagued by insecurity.Two men are now vying to lead the country of 11 million people, more than half of whom are under age 20. There is no working parliament now.One of Moise's last acts as president was to appoint on Monday a new prime minister, Ariel Henry. He had not taken office when Moise was killed.Several hours after the assassination, Henry's predecessor, interim premier Claude Joseph, declared a national "state of siege" for fifteen days and said he was now in charge.While the opposition has accused Joseph of power-grabbing, the United Nations envoy to Haiti, Helen La Lime, has said he had authority because Henry had not been sworn in.The country was already in the midst of in an institutional crisis: Moise had not organized an election since he came to power in early 2017 and as the country has had no parliament since January 2020, Moise had been ruling by decree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-swirls-around-haiti-president-jovenel-moise-s-murder-101625850548690.html

A post-mortem last month concluded she had died as a result of compression of the neck.Appearing by videolink from prison for a hearing at London's Old Bailey Court, Couzens, bearded and wearing a blue sweatshirt, sat with his head bowed and said "guilty ma'am" when asked how he pleaded to the charge of murder.Prosecutor Tom Little said the officer had never met Everard prior to kidnapping her from London's South Circular road and they were "total strangers".Judge Adrian Fulford said Couzens had previously only given an entirely false account of events, an elaborate story involving an eastern European gang."This has been a mammoth investigation which has produced some very significant results in terms of being able to understand what happened," Fulford said.London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, Britain's most senior officer, told reporters outside court she had personally apologised to Everard's family."All of us in the Met are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes. They are dreadful," she said.Everard's murder provoked outpourings of anger from women who have recounted their own experiences and fears of walking the streets on their own at night, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to promise action including money for better street lighting.Couzens' lawyer, James Sturman, said his client's pleas represented "truly genuine guilt and remorse for what he did"."As he put it to us this morning he will bear this burden for the rest of his life, and he deserves to - his words 'and I deserve to'. He accepts the victims in this case are the Everard family and friends, not him," Sturman told the court.A two-day sentencing hearing, which will consider psychiatric reports, will begin on Sept. 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-officer-pleads-guilty-to-sarah-everard-s-murder-101625832787603.html
09-07-2021||World||UN expert calls on countries to designate Israeli settlements as 'war crimes'||A UN human rights investigator on Friday called on the countries to designate the Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem as “war crimes” under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Michael Lynk, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, told the Human Rights Council in Geneva that the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem violate the absolute prohibition against transferring of its civilian population by an occupying power into occupied territory.“For Israel, the settlements serve two related purposes. One is to guarantee that the occupied territory will remain under Israeli control in perpetuity. The second purpose is to ensure that there will never be a genuine Palestinian state,” said Lynk.The session of the UN Human Rights Council addressed by Lynk was boycotted by Israel which does not recognise the investigator’s mandate or cooperate with him.Also Read | Israeli settlers agree to leave flashpoint West Bank outpost: OfficialsThe region recently witnessed indiscriminate rocket firings from Gaza and retaliatory attacks from Israel that claimed many lives, including that of dozens of children, renewing the concern over Israeli occupation. According to the report, there are now close to 300 Israeli settlements in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, with more than 680,000 Israeli settlers.Lynk said Israeli settlements were “the engine of Israel’s 54-year-old occupation, the longest in the modern world.” “It is a tragic paradox that, while the Israeli settlements are clearly prohibited by international law, the international community has been remarkably reluctant to enforce its own laws,” he said.The Special Rapporteur urged the international community to adopt a plan of action, which includes calling upon Israel to fully dismantle its settlements and ensuring full accountability of Israeli leaders who are “responsible for grave breaches of international law” in the occupied Palestinian territory.“The time for criticism of the Israeli settlements has passed...a new approach grounded in international law is the only path to a just end to this perpetual occupation,” said Lynk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expert-calls-on-countries-to-designate-israeli-settlements-as-war-crimes-101625850180222.html
09-07-2021||World||‘Hope Pakistan begins to play more constructive role in peace process’: Afghan ambassador||Air power is essential for Afghan security forces to successfully take on the Taliban, and the Afghan government is looking to India and the US to provide more combat helicopters and associated logistics support, Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay said on Friday in an interview with Hindustan Times. On Pakistan’s role in the peace process, Mamundzay said Islamabad has not delivered as expected. Here are excerpts from the interview:Q: With the US president announcing the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan will be completed by August 31, which is much earlier than expected, what is your assessment of the security situation? Would you agree with the feeling in some quarters that the US drawdown could have been handled better? A: Following the announcement by the US president about the withdrawal of US and international troops, the Taliban has waged a war against the Afghan government and the public. And that has made the situation very dire, not only in terms of security, but this has caused a humanitarian catastrophe. Over 200,000 people have been displaced since April 14, 2021, close to 4,000 civilians who have been killed. So this could have been handled in a more organised and planned manner. Now, the withdrawal would be completed in several weeks time. We were expecting that we will go through a very troubling time once these forces leave. And we are right, we are going through that phase now. There is an active conflict going on and in almost 150 districts, the Taliban have captured many centres of our districts. Now, just remember that some of our districts are very large. So it’s difficult for them to hold the entire district. But what is significant for both the Taliban and our government is to hold the centre or capital of the district. Taliban has been capturing a number of capitals of the districts, which has caused an outcry from the local population and the government. In the past three days, we have been able to recapture 10 districts. Now, this would continue for a number of months, we would capture districts, they would recapture them. The withdrawal comes in a very un-fashioned manner. This could have been handled properly. Q: How do you look at assessments by some Western capitals that the Afghan forces are not prepared and they’re going to collapse? And how much of a factor is air support? A: First, if you have looked at US President Biden’s interview on Thursday, [he] denied that there has been any such assessment on the part of the US intelligence community, but in any case, the assumption that the government would collapse in six or 12 months, I think, is a very unrealistic assessment. We outnumber the Taliban by five or six times, a force of 70,000 to 75,000 cannot face a force of around 400,000. Also, given our landmass, our country consists of 652,000 sq km, one-fifth the size of India with almost 400 districts. It’s a very big country with very difficult terrain and it’s very difficult to be guarded by 400,000 people with a population of over 35 million. So the assessment, I think, is unrealistic. Like I said, we are going through a turbulent time, but the resilience of our people and the heroic patriotism of our forces is there to defend Afghanistan. In terms of air support, that’s the game-changer for us. Our assessment is, if we have the required air support, the Taliban would never be able to capture any district. And just to give you one instance, should we have 15 to 20 Mi-35 helicopters, or 30 to 40 Black Hawks or Chinook gunships, they would not be able to hold ground. The Afghan forces are still in their development phase, we have not yet got to a stage where we have a full conventional army. Taliban have the same equipment, weapons and ammunition that we have. Our superiority lies in air support and we appreciate the support that the US has recently promised, that they would support us with more air support. We call on all responsible countries in the region, including Russia, Iran and India, to provide us with the required air support. There are two components in air support – one is logistics, which also requires support, and one is helicopters used for fighting on the battleground, which is more critical than the logistic support. Q: So if India could provide more helicopters, that would be welcomed? A: We look to India for the light combat helicopters or LCH, of which we recently received two. We would want more of these helicopters. Q: Have you raised this officially? A: Not yet, no, we are waiting for the helicopters to be received from the US. Once we receive delivery of those, we are also raising our air force, which is not big enough to look after these precious assets. We are also in the training phase of growing the air force. So should we get to that stage, we will be requesting India to provide us with more support. Q: The Taliban’s current strategy seems to be a mix of getting hold of territory and capturing key trade posts on the borders with Central Asian states. What could be their game plan? What do you think is behind this strategy? A: There are several components. First, the Taliban are delaying the peace process. On July 5, they announced they would come up with a peace proposal next month. So, effectively they’re giving themselves two months’ time. Now, next month is a very vague term, when you are in the very first week of July, and you give yourself the luxury of prolonging that duration to next month. Technically, it could be the end of August, which leaves us with eight or nine weeks. You make Afghan people suffer for eight more weeks, inflicting heavy human and property losses. So it indicates that first, they want to delay the peace process despite the fact that there have been efforts on part of Iran to bring the [Afghan] government and Taliban to the negotiating table and have some sort of breakthrough, which didn’t happen sadly. Taliban are delaying this because they want to gain more territory so that they would speak from a position of strength should we get to the negotiating table again. Second, they want to prove to their foot soldiers, ground commanders and affiliates and associates that they are back in power. We have reports that Al-Qaeda, Jundullah, ETIM, LeT and JeM are celebrating Taliban’s victories. So the joyous moment for them is that the emirate is back, they would have a place where they could be used as a launching pad again for their operations. So in order to justify to those supporters, it is crucial for them to gain more territory and hold it. Third, some Taliban leaders say they want to settle previous scores. For them, an element of revenge also exists, they think they have been treated badly in the past and it’s time for them to do the same, which goes against Islamic values and principles. Q: There are a multiplicity of processes involving Iran, Russia, Qatar and Turkey to negotiate with the Taliban. Do you think these processes are really delivering? A: I think none of these processes delivered sadly. We started the process with very good faith back in September, fulfilling all those commitments that a responsible government was supposed to do. But we were faced with a group that didn’t respond positively to the requests and desires of the Afghan people. If you look at the US-Taliban agreement, there were six commitments made – three on the part of the American and three on the part of the Taliban. The American commitments were they would release 6,000 Taliban prisoners, they would help form a negotiating team from the Afghan republic, and that they would withdraw from Afghanistan. The Taliban commitments were that they will cease violence, cut ties with international terrorist groups and they would enter the peace process with good faith. Now, without being party to [the agreement], we delivered on the two commitments made by the US and released 6,000 prisoners and formed a team for negotiations. On the part of the Taliban, none of the three commitments was honoured. And President Biden said [on Thursday] that he doesn’t trust Taliban. This comes from the failure of the Taliban to honour any of those three commitments. You saw the recent UN Security Council report which states Taliban have not cut ties with international terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda or with any regional or international terrorist groups. Second, they didn’t stop the violence. There has been no suspicion of violence. We are on the brink of a huge influx of refugees to neighbouring countries, Turkey and the West. This is caused by the Taliban. In the past 20 years, this is the first time that Afghans are leaving their home. We invested heavily to bring those people back. So none of those processes, whether it was the extended Troika in Moscow, Tehran, Istanbul, Qatar, delivered any results. We feel that the Taliban are buying time for themselves to continue with their military adventurism and capture more land. And then when we get to winter, they will propose peace negotiations when fighting is difficult. And then they speak from the position of strength that we hold XYZ percentage of the landmass, now agree to a peace deal on our terms, or else face defeat. Q: The situation in Afghanistan can’t be delinked from the role of regional players, especially Pakistan. What do you think of efforts made by regional players so far to get the peace process moving? Have they delivered? A: I think the country in the region with the most influence over the Taliban is Pakistan, which has been hosting the Taliban over the past 20 years. The Quetta Shura, Miranshah Shura, Peshawar Shura – they all exist in Pakistan. We understand that Pakistan may not fully control the Taliban, but they have a significant amount of leverage and influence over the Taliban. We expected Pakistan to play a very constructive role to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table, use that influence that the Pakistanis used to help the Americans. We understand that had Pakistan not supported the deal between the US and Taliban, there would have been no deal. We expected the government of Pakistan to help us in the same manner, in the same spirit so that Kabul and the Taliban reach a dignified and lasting deal. We sadly have not seen the kind of role that we expected Islamabad to play. I hope in the weeks ahead, that calculus will change and they will begin to play a more constructive role. Q: India is the largest regional donor in Afghanistan and has done a lot of work on the development side. What are your country’s expectations now from India and what kind of support are you looking for? There’s been some talk of Afghanistan seeking help from India for the listing and delisting of Taliban leaders at the UN Security Council because there is a feeling they have possibly been given too much freedom to travel. Could India play a role there? A: I think the three things that India can do – first, extending to us the required political and diplomatic support, which has always been there, but enhancing and strengthening that role both at the UN and other regional and international forums, with things like listing and delisting, raising the voice of the Afghan people, getting the consensus required in the region for the peace process. And being an active member in the peace process on the side of the Afghan people, so that’s the first thing – where India can use its convening power to support the peace process. Two, India can and should continue with economic and development assistance. And that could be used as leverage. When peace talks begin, it could be used as a way to send the right signals to the Taliban, that should they value democratic processes and preserve the gains of the past 20 years, India would continue assisting the Afghan people. Third, together with diplomatic and political and economic assistance, is possible security assistance should we not reach a dignified and lasting peace deal with the Taliban. If we get to a stage where war is imposed on the Afghan public, then we look at India for military and security assistance to protect our people and to fight terrorist groups. So we have not yet got to that stage, we’re still giving peace a chance. Q: Would this assistance involve troops or is Afghanistan opposed to boots on the ground? A: We would want no boots on the ground. There is the required manpower who are willing to take arms and fight for their country and sacrifice. Despite the fact that there’s a lot of violence there, the people have always been there to be recruited for our security forces. [We want] more support for our military, more military hardware, more intelligence and logistics support, financial resources, things of those nature. The fighting could be done by the Afghans. And one fact to be remembered – we are not fighting a civil war, we are fighting regional and global terrorism. In the Taliban and their ranks, there is a big percentage of foreign fighters. Those foreign fighters are irreconcilable. We want the Taliban to become part of mainstream society, come back and live in peace with us, integrate back into the mainstream polity of Afghanistan. But we would always have a problem with foreign fighters, with irreconcilable elements. Therefore, India with other major powers in the region, including Russia, China and Iran, should come forward and support the Afghan and Afghan army, who are fighting a major war on behalf of the region and the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-pakistan-begins-to-play-more-constructive-role-in-peace-process-afghan-ambassador-101625848231278.html

The auction was livestreamed and attracted no more than a dozen bids.Earlier in the week, Sotheby’s said it was the most expensive physical object ever publicly offered for purchase with cryptocurrency.Auction houses are increasingly accepting cryptocurrencies for payment, with Phillips offering a piece from street artist Banksy last month for Ether or Bitcoin. Christie’s accepted payment in Ether in March for the record $69.3 million sale of Beeple’s “Everydays: the First 5,000 Days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diamond-sold-for-12-million-in-cryptocurrency-101625845323364.html

He said the government should consider offering third doses to those with inadequate immune response.“If there is such a loss of confidence in certain vaccines, then the government needs to order a third dose and free up the capacities for giving them,” Kiss told The Associated Press, adding that the tests are available to anyone over 60 regardless of which vaccine they received.“We think the the more tests we perform, the more societal pressure there is for a third dose,” Kiss said. The testing drive will continue next week, and initial results will likely be released next week with the full results expected by the end of the month.Hungary was an early vaccination leader in the European Union, due largely to its procurement of jabs from eastern countries like Russia and China, on top of vaccines received through the EU.It was the first country in the 27-member bloc to approve Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, and is the only one to deploy China's Sinopharm. More than 5.1 million doses of the jab have been distributed to Hungary, of which it has administered more than 2 million, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.While government officials insist there is no reason to offer a third dose of the Sinopharm vaccine, critics of the jab - including Budapest's liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony - have cast doubt over its efficacy.In announcing the city's antibody testing campaign in June, Karacsony referred specifically to the Chinese vaccine as the reason for the measure. He pointed to other countries like Bahrein and the United Arab Emirates, which have offered booster shots for some Sinopharm recipients amid efficacy concerns.Both Sinopharm and Sinovac, another Chinese company who has produced its own vaccine, said in April that they were looking at whether a booster shot could help better protect against Covid-19.Karacsony often spars with Hungary’s right-wing government and is considered a front-runner for replacing Prime Minister Viktor Orban in national elections next year.Sinopharm jab recipient Maria Szaniszlo, 78, said she backed a move to offer booster shots to anyone who needs them.“There is news that the Chinese vaccine isn’t reliable because it doesn’t offer protection to many people,” said Szaniszlo after showing up on Thursday for an antibody test in the capital. “I decided that I wanted to know too ... They sent me the (immunity) card saying I’m protected, but I’ll find out tomorrow if I really am.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-concerned-over-efficacy-of-china-s-sinopharm-vaccine-101625842378752.html

COVAX had decided to provide nearly two million doses to North Korea under its global distribution scheme, of which the Serum Institute of India is a major contributor.South Korea said that the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines was expected in May but the delivery was delayed amid protracted consultations, according to news agency Reuters. The reclusive country has not reported a single case of coronavirus disease to date, a claim many experts are apprehensive about.Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS), affiliated with South Korea’s spy agency, said in its report that Pyongyang has rejected the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine over safety concerns. Apart from AstraZeneca, North Korea is also not keen on Chinese vaccines due to concerns over their efficacy, the INSS report said.North Korea has reportedly shown interest in vaccines developed by Russia, hoping that the neighbouring country would provide the shots free of charge. “It’s leaning towards the Russian vaccine, yet no arrangements have been made,” Lee Sang-keun, director of strategic research on the Korean peninsula at INSS, told Reuters.Several European countries and the United States earlier this year halted administering the AstraZeneca vaccine after severe blood clotting events were reported in some recipients. While the US decided to not use its AstraZeneca shots, many European countries resumed vaccination following a report by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that said the vaccine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks.But western countries have the option of purchasing high-cost vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioTech and Moderna. On the other hand, North Korea is hugely dependent on donations as the country is witnessing a serious economic downturn, exacerbated by sanctions imposed by the United States."We continue to work with DPRK authorities, as we work with all the countries we serve, to help respond to the Covid-19 pandemic," a spokesperson for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) alliance told Reuters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-rejected-free-astrazeneca-jabs-not-keen-on-chinese-vaccines-report-101625844234948.html

She also called it clear evidence that the pandemic is not on the wane yet, news agency Bloomberg reported.In an interview to Bloomberg Television, Dr Swaminathan said that most parts of the world have been facing a shortage of medical oxygen, a lack of hospital beds and higher mortality rates while the vaccination levels in some countries have been mitigating severe cases of infection and also the hospitalisation.“In the last 24 hours, close to 500,000 new cases have been reported and about 9,300 deaths -- now that’s not a pandemic that’s slowing down,” Bloomberg quoted Dr Swaminathan as saying.Also read| 'We should be watchful': Govt on Covid's Lambda variant in IndiaFive out of the six WHO regions have witnessed an increase in the number of cases being reported and in Africa, mortality rates spiked by 30% to 40%, she mentioned. She also said that the “fast-spreading” Covid-19 Delta variant is the main reason behind the increase in the infection while the slow rate of vaccination rollout across the world along with the relaxation of safety measures like mandatory wearing of masks and physical distancing rules.Earlier in the day, director-general of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus too emphasised on the need for increased vaccinations against the coronavirus disease. “I'm worried about the emergence of a potent #COVID19 virus variant, like Delta. Unless we increase vaccine access to those who need them first & need them now, we're collectively at high risk of losing the gains we've made. Speed is very important,” he said in a tweet.The WHO chief’s warning came ahead of the restrictions set to be relaxed in the United Kingdom on July 19. Also, the US and some countries in Europe have already eased some restrictions following the fall in the number of cases.As of 2pm (IST) on Friday, 185,038,806 cases of Covid-19 have been reported globally, according to the WHO’s dashboard and 4,006,882 people have lost their lives so far.(With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-not-slowing-down-yet-delta-variant-spreading-rapidly-who-s-chief-scientist-dr-soumya-swaminathan-101625843487253.html

09-07-2021||World||‘Devastating: South Africa buckles under Covid-19 wave driven by Delta variant||South Africa on Friday announced its plan to start vaccinating people under 50s as the country buckles under the third wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. South Africa last week reported the highest single-day infections since the start of the pandemic, and reports suggest that South Africa’s healthcare system is at a breaking point.A senior doctor at a major public hospital in Johannesburg said that Covid-19 patients are dying while waiting to be admitted in a ward, reported CNN. “It's devastating, it's soul destroying. We are trained to save lives, but you revert to that wartime mentality. You revert to becoming numbed, you revert to becoming blunted," the doctor was quoted by CNN as saying.The decision to expand the age group for vaccination eligibility comes at a time when the number of daily new deaths related to Covid-19 is witnessing another surge. Reported average Covid-19 cases per day in South Africa over the past week has been hovering around 333 per million people, making it one of the worst-affect countries in the region per capita.South Africa has administered at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine to around 6% of its population and the percentage of the fully vaccinated population is just over 2%, making the country vulnerable to deadly coronavirus variants, especially the Delta strain which has higher chances, as per recent studies, of evading vaccine-induced immunity as well as natural immunity.With more than 2.1 million overall Covid-19 cases so far, South Africa accounts for 37 per cent of the continent's infections, followed by Morocco and Tunisia with nine and eight per cent respectively, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Leading virologist Tulio de Oliveira told a weekly media briefing that the Delta variant "is still fast spreading" in the country."What's happening in South Africa is happening in many countries that still have low vaccination rates."The South African government recently approved the use of Chinese vaccines Sinovac and Sinopharm, extending the list of approved vaccines along with Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson jabs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/devastating-south-africa-buckles-under-covid-19-wave-driven-by-delta-variant-101625837321458.html

After the withdrawal of the NATO forces, it was expected that the country would have to face a difficult period, he added.“We are not heading to a dark age. We need to remember there were 40+ NATO member countries fighting a war on terror. After their withdrawal, this was expected that we would be going through a difficult period,” the Afghan ambassador was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Friday.Speaking on ties with India, Mamundzay said it has been a major partner of Afghanistan and can play a constructive role in “our peace process, together with other regional actors”. “India can utilise its convening power to put more pressure on the Taliban through diplomatic channels to come to the negotiating table,” he said while urging the latter to cease violence as the process of withdrawal of US troops nears completion.“We are concerned over the intensity of violence and we call on the Taliban that they need to cease violence since the withdrawal of international forces is complete to a larger extent. It's time to put an end to the bloodshed of innocent people,” he said.Also Read: No military solution': Biden says war in Afghanistan will end August 31Mamundzay’s statement came hours after AFP reported that Taliban negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar has claimed the group now controls "85 percent of Afghanistan's territory", roughly covering some 250 of the country's 398 districts. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also spoke about Taliban’s growing influence in the region, as the group "currently controls about two-thirds" of the country’s border with Tajikistan.More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers were forced to flee to Tajikistan this week after clashing with the Taliban, marking the third time this month Taliban has forced troops to flee to save their lives. Regarding the recent spate of violence, the envoy said, “Over 3,600 people have been killed since April, civilians alone. Close to 1,000 soldiers have been martyred, over 3000 have been wounded. So the cost that we pay with human lives is unparalleled.”Mamundzay said there have been no talks on closing the Indian consulate in his country as there is no immediate security threat. “The people of Afghanistan value and want the presence of Indian consulates, its decision for the people and government to make with the Indian government. We see no immediate threat. There are no such talks on closing Indian consulates,” he said.He also spoke about the presence of Shuras in Pakistan which he said was “something of great concern to us”. “Their families still live there. They have the support and infrastructure currently present in Pakistan, we would want to see that changed.”Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who held a meeting with Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, during the day said the situation in Afghanistan occupied a lot of our attention because it has a direct implication for regional security. “We believe that the immediate need of the day is really a reduction in violence,” he said.Also Read: 'Legitimacy aspect' of ruling Afghanistan should not be ignored, says JaishankarUS President Joe Biden told reporters on Thursday that US troops will completely withdraw from the war-ravaged country on August 31, while stating that America did not go to Afghanistan to “nation build” and that “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future”. The Biden administration’s plan to evacuate thousands of Afghans who helped the US military as translators, informers, and drivers during their deployment, is also under intense scrutiny from many Congressional lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-not-heading-to-dark-age-ties-with-india-intact-says-envoy-101625832508060.html
09-07-2021||World||Afghan pilots assassinated by Taliban as US withdraws||Afghan Air Force Major Dastagir Zamaray had grown so fearful of Taliban assassinations of off-duty forces in Kabul that he decided to sell his home to move to a safer pocket of Afghanistan's sprawling capital.Instead of being greeted by a prospective buyer at his realtor's office earlier this year, the 41-year-old pilot was confronted by a gunman who walked inside and, without a word, fatally shot the real estate agent in the mouth.Zamaray reached for his sidearm but the gunman shot him in the head. The father of seven collapsed dead on his 14-year-old son, who had tagged along. The boy was spared, but barely speaks anymore, his family says.Zamaray “only went there because he personally knew the realtor and thought it was safe," Samiullah Darman, his brother-in-law, told Reuters. "We didn’t know that he would never come back."At least seven Afghan pilots, including Zamaray, have been assassinated off base in recent months, according to two senior Afghan government officials. This series of targeted killings, which haven't been previously reported, illustrate what US and Afghan officials believe is a deliberate Taliban effort to destroy one of Afghanistan's most valuable military assets: its corps of US- and NATO-trained military pilots.In so doing, the Taliban -- who have no air force -- are looking to level the playing field as they press major ground offensives. The militants are quickly seizing territory once controlled by the US-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani, raising fears they could eventually try to topple Kabul.Reuters confirmed the identities of two of the slain pilots through family members. It could not independently verify the names of the other five who were allegedly targeted.In response to questions from Reuters, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the group had killed Zamaray, and that it had started a program that will see Afghan Air Force pilots “targeted and eliminated because all of them do bombardment against their people."A U.N. report documented 229 civilian deaths caused by the Taliban in Afghanistan in the first three months of 2021, and 41 civilian deaths caused by the Afghan Air Force over the same period.Afghanistan's government has not publicly disclosed the number of pilots assassinated in targeted killings. The nation's Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon said it was aware of the deaths of several Afghan pilots in killings claimed by the Taliban, but declined comment on US intelligence and investigations.Afghan military pilots are particularly attractive assassination targets, current and former US and Afghan officials say. They can strike Taliban forces massing for major attacks, shuttle commandos to missions and provide life-saving air cover for Afghan ground troops. Pilots take years to train and are hard to replace, representing an outsized blow to the country's defenses with every loss.Shoot-downs and accidents are ever-present risks. Yet these pilots often are most vulnerable in the streets of their own neighborhoods, where attackers can come from anywhere, said retired US Brigadier General David Hicks, who commanded the training effort for the Afghan Air Force from 2016 to 2017."Their lives were at much greater risk during that time (off base) than they were while they were flying combat missions," Hicks said.Although Taliban assassinations of pilots have happened in years past, the recent killings take on greater significance as the Afghan Air Force is tested like never before.Just last week, US forces left America’s main military bastion in Afghanistan, Bagram Air Base outside Kabul, as they complete their withdrawal from the country 20 years after ousting the Taliban following the Al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11, 2001."Pilots are on top of the Taliban's hit list," the senior Afghan government official said.That Afghan official and two others, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they're working to protect pilots and their families, moving some to on-base housing and relocating others to safer civilian neighborhoods.A White House National Security Council spokesperson strongly condemned “all targeted assassinations in Afghanistan” and stressed US commitments to continue providing security assistance to the Afghan military.The Afghan Air Force is heavily dependent on US training, equipment and maintenance as well as logistics to ensure a reliable pipeline of munitions and spare parts. The Pentagon has yet to fully detail how it will keep Afghan aviators flying after the US-led mission formally ends in coming weeks, as ordered by President Joe Biden.The Pentagon told Reuters it would seek to provide Afghanistan with extra aircraft to ease the strain of combat losses and maintenance downtime.David Petraeus, a former CIA director and former commander of US forces in Afghanistan, warned that failure of the United States to provide enough support for the Afghan military could be disastrous."We are potentially consigning Afghanistan and the Afghan people to a civil war," Petraeus said in an interview.Washington is moving to evacuate interpreters who worked for the US military, but it’s unclear if the Biden administration would risk doing the same for Afghan forces, like pilots. Some officials believe offering an exit strategy for elite Afghan troops could accelerate a feared collapse following the US withdrawal.US intelligence assessments have warned that the Afghan government could fall in as little as six months, two US officials told Reuters."No one wants to have the (Afghan forces) preemptively throw in the towel," another US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Precious, Over-stretchedTwo Afghan Air Force pilots were killed on June 7 while trying to evacuate troops wounded during a surge of fighting against the Taliban insurgency.The Taliban claimed responsibility for shooting down their Russian-made, US-financed Mi-17 helicopter. Local media identified the deceased pilots as Milad Massoud and Abdul Alim Shahrayari. The Afghan Defense Ministry said in a statement that the aircraft crashed, but it did not say why, nor would it identify the pilots. An Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the chopper was shot down.Both the crew and the aircraft were precious.The Afghan fleet contained just 13 Mi-17 helicopters and 65 qualified aircrews of pilots and co-pilots to fly them, according to US military data from April 2021 and November 2020, respectively.Those data show the entire Afghan Air Force comprises 339 qualified aircrews and 160 aircraft -- less than a quarter of the fleet size of US commercial carrier Southwest Airlines. The "usable" fleet is even smaller - around 140 aircraft - after accounting for aircraft undergoing maintenance, according to the same April data.Built in America's image, the Afghan Air Force is equipped with UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and lumbering C-130H transport aircraft, neither of which Afghans know how to maintain, according to a Pentagon report released in April. Those aircraft are serviced by US-funded contractors, which also handle most maintenance for the rest of the fleet, including A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, AC-208 Eliminator planes and MD-530 helicopters, according to that report.A separate 2020 report by the Pentagon's Lead Inspector General warned that Afghanistan's fleet would stop being "combat effective" within a few months if the Afghan Air Force were to lose contractor support. The Pentagon has not said how many contractors will remain in Afghanistan.Reuters contacted two large US defense contractors that support the Afghan Air Force: Leidos Holdings Inc and DynCorp International, now part of Amentum Services Inc. Spokespeople for those companies declined to say how many contractors, if any, were still in Afghanistan.In comments to Reuters, the Pentagon acknowledged the withdrawal of contractors could impact routine maintenance, something it was working to address. Spokesman Major Rob Lodewick said it had already become common practice to send aircraft abroad for heavy maintenance.Petraeus said that’s not only costly, but it’s "impractical" in a wartime setting to fly aircraft out of Afghanistan for repairs. Remote instruction and meetings via video-conference also have natural limitations.Along with Afghanistan's Special Forces, the Afghan Air Force is a pillar of the nation's strategy for preventing a Taliban takeover of cities. In addition to providing air cover and performing bombing raids, pilots conduct medical evacuations, ferry supplies and transport troops for the country's over-stretched army.Since Biden’s April withdrawal announcement, Taliban militants have more than doubled the number of districts under their control in Afghanistan to 203, which is nearly half the country’s 407 districts, according to the Long War Journal, an online publication associated with the conservative think-tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. Reuters could not independently verify the data.Western security officials said insurgent forces have captured more than 100 districts, but the Taliban say they have control of more than 200 districts in 34 provinces comprising over half the Central Asian country.The US military has stopped releasing its tally of Taliban-controlled districts and says that information is now classified. But on Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged the Taliban had taken "dozens" of district centers.Swift gains by the Taliban are putting more strain on Afghan Air Force crews and aircraft to repel the advances, four US officials said.Even before the latest wave of Taliban offensives, the Afghan Air Force was flying missions at a faster pace than anticipated, piling up maintenance checks that took more planes out of circulation, according to a May report by the Pentagon's Inspector General.General Austin Miller, the commander of US-led forces in Afghanistan, warned on June 29 that he was concerned about "overuse" of the Afghan Air Force."If you overuse the organizations, it's difficult for them to ... reconstitute," Miller told reporters.In remarks from the White House on Thursday, Biden said aid to Afghanistan’s military would continue after the US military mission ends on Aug 31. But Biden was hardly optimistic about Afghanistan’s future, casting doubt on the two-decade-old project to preserve a unified, centralized state. Still, he said a Taliban victory was not inevitable."I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, which is better trained, better equipped and more competent” than the Taliban, he told reporters.Stay and Fight?It wasn't just Taliban death threats against him and his family that drove decorated Afghan helicopter pilot Major Naiem Asadi out of Afghanistan. Asadi said the Afghan Air Force had failed to do enough to protect pilots vulnerable to off-base assassinations."They spend a lot of money on (the training) of these pilots, but they can't spend any money on the pilots for their security," Asadi told Reuters in an interview, after arriving in New Jersey in June to start his bid for asylum.Asadi complained that not all Afghan pilots got paid the same or even regularly. As a member of the ethnic Hazara minority, Asadi believed he was also passed up for promotion."They are not taking care of every pilot equally," he said.The Afghan military did not respond to requests for comment on Asadi’s case. Asadi did not show Reuters documentation to support his discrimination claims.Experts say the morale of Afghan forces could prove critical in preventing collapse, given the momentum of the Taliban and the perceived weakness of the Afghan central government in key parts of the country.On Sunday, more than 1,000 Afghan security personnel fled across the border into Tajikistan following Taliban advances in northern Afghanistan. Almost 300 flew back to Afghanistan on Wednesday, and officials in Kabul continue to express confidence in the Afghan security forces.A review by a US government watchdog found nearly half of all foreign military trainees who went Absent Without Leave (AWOL) while training in the United States since 2005 were from Afghanistan. The Pentagon eventually halted training of Afghan pilots inside the United States.Niloofar Rahmani, the first female fixed-wing pilot in the Afghan Air Force, won asylum in the United States in 2018 after receiving death threats from the Taliban and others in Afghan society who condemned her for working alongside the US military.Rahmani, who is now training in Florida to become a flight instructor, said the Afghan government didn't take those threats seriously enough and that even some of her fellow pilots didn't think women should fly. She said she wasn't paid for a year.Still, the decision to leave Afghanistan wasn’t an easy one."It honestly broke my heart, I was depressed for two years just thinking about it," Rahmani said, explaining she felt like she had abandoned her family and what once seemed like a promising military career. She said she feared many pilots would drop out of the force "because of lack of support, because of the threat."The Afghan military did not respond to a request for comment on Rahmani’s case.An active-duty Afghan pilot, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity from Afghanistan, said he, too, was trying to figure out a way to flee the country in the face of deteriorating security.Some are finding the US door shut. Mohd Hamayoun Zarin, a former A-29 pilot, expressed shock that the US Embassy in Kabul rejected his visa request in March.As an Afghan Air Force veteran who spent years training in America, Zarin is convinced the Taliban will make good on their many threats to kill him and his family now that US troops are leaving.It would be payback, he says."I wasn't dropping flowers on them. These were bombs," Zarin said in an interview, detailing his case publicly for the first time in the hopes that the United States might reconsider.In its letter to Zarin, viewed by Reuters, the US Embassy in Kabul said he was ineligible for the same visas set aside for interpreters because he did not work directly for the United States, but rather for the Afghan government.Zarin said that distinction makes little difference on the ground in Afghanistan, where he was known as an English-speaking pilot who spent years training in the United States.The State Department declined comment on Zarin’s case, saying visa applications are confidential.Trained KillersMasood Atal, a Black Hawk helicopter pilot, was driving on his day off on Dec. 30 to buy fruit for his mother when two motorcycles flanked his gray Toyota Corolla on a Kandahar city highway, one on each side of the car.Gunmen on the back of both bikes opened fire on Atal, shooting him 11 times, once in the face, six times in his right arm and hand, the rest in his chest, his family said.Atal had confided to his family that he had received Taliban death threats, the latest in an expletive-laced phone call just two days before he was killed."We're killing you," they told him, recounted Bashir Ahmad, one of Atal's brothers.Atal had asked for bodyguards and a bullet-proof car but the Afghan military turned him down, Ahmad said, accusing it of being "very weak on these things."An Afghan military spokesman, Sadeq Esa, confirmed Atal had been killed by the Taliban but did not provide further comment about his case.The Taliban confirmed it killed Atal and said it would do the same to other pilots.“Targeting those who bombard civilians, who drop blind bombs on civilian houses, is an obligation for us and we will do this,” Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, told Reuters.For Atal's parents, it was their fifth child killed in the many decades of fighting in Afghanistan. In 1984, during the Soviet occupation, a rocket fired by an anti-Soviet mujahideen landed in front of their children's school in Kandahar, killing another son and three daughters, the family said.Such crossfire has killed untold numbers of Afghan civilians. But there was nothing indiscriminate about Atal's killing, his family said. The Taliban "are absolutely focusing on the pilots first ... to make the Afghan government vulnerable enough so they can be beaten," said another brother, Waheed.Catching the killers of Afghan pilots has proven difficult.A few weeks after the January shooting of Zamaray, the airman shot dead in his realtor's office, Kabul police told the family they had made an arrest. They asked Zamaray's 14-year-old son to identify the suspect.Glimpsing the detainee at the police station, the teen informed police they had the wrong man. Police tried to convince the boy that the suspect might now look different because he had a broken nose, the family said."The police were pushing (Zamaray's) son to identify and implicate the wrong person just to hide their weakness and show an achievement," Darman, Zamaray's brother-in-law, said.Afghan authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-pilots-assassinated-by-taliban-as-us-withdraws-101625828943049.html

Pardeep Singh, 24, was arrested after a commercial truck driven by him entered Canada at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie in Ontario and was pulled aside for a secondary examination.Border agents discovered the cocaine, estimated at $14 million, inside five duffle bags, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said in a statement. Singh was arrested and transferred to the custody of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). He has been charged with the importation of a controlled substance, contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.CBSA district director Kim Upper hailed the seizure as an “integral role” of the agency in safeguarding the borders. “Our officers have interrupted the smuggling attempt of a massive amount of narcotics, and have put a full stop to the ripple effect these narcotics would have in neighborhoods across our country,” Upper said in a statement.Singh is set to make a court appearance in St Catharines on Friday.Despite border restrictions in place due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, commercial traffic remains open to maintain the flow of goods including food and medical supplies, vital for all Canadians.Starting July 5, some exemptions have been granted to fully vaccinated individuals for entry in certain cases. Currently, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Covishield and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) are the accepted vaccines to benefit from the exemption. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Sputnik V, Sinopharm and Sinovac have not been approved by Canada for granting fully vaccinated status.Meanwhile, restrictions on non-essential travel are expected to remain in place until at least July 21 as the fear of the highly contagious Delta variant has caused concern for authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-man-arrested-in-canada-for-smuggling-112-kg-cocaine-worth-14-mn-101625823611714.html
09-07-2021||World||'Legitimacy aspect' of ruling Afghanistan should not be ignored, says Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday said that the issue of Afghanistan occupied a lot of attention during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, given its direct implication for regional security. Speaking at a joint press conference in Moscow, Jaishankar stressed the need for an immediate reduction in violence in Afghanistan."And if you have to see peace within Afghanistan and around Afghanistan, that's important for India and Russia to work together to ensure that much of the progress we have seen in economic and social and democratic terms are maintained," the external affairs minister said.Amid the Taliban's offensive to capture more parts of Afghanistan, Jaishankar underlined that whoever governs the country has a legitimacy aspect to it "which can not and should not be ignored." He said that India and Russia are committed to "independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan." The two leaders also talked about what was happening in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya as both India and Russia have long-standing interest in the region, he said. "We believe peace and stability in such a sensitive region is very important for global interest," the minister added.Earlier today, Jaishankar met Russia’s deputy prime minister Yury Borisov and also delivered a speech on “India-Russia ties in a changing world” at Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow. Speaking at the event, Jaishakankar said that India-Russia relations have been among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world after the Second World War.The external affairs minister, who is on a three-day visit to Russia, acknowledged that there have been changes in the bilateral ties and issues over a period of time. But at the end of the day, Jaishankar said, the “logic of geo-politics was so compelling that we barely remember these even as minor aberrations.”“The undeniable reality of the exceptional resilience of our ties is surely a phenomenon that is worth analyzing. The paradox though is that precisely because it has held so steady, this relationship is sometimes taken for granted,” the minister said.“The case for its constant nurturing is therefore as powerful, if not more, than with the more volatile ones,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-occupied-a-lot-of-attention-jaishankar-after-meeting-with-lavrov-101625824152974.html

Neroli oil is known to be a type of essential oil that is extracted from the flowers of bitter orange trees.Balu Natarajan was the first Indian-American winner of the Spelling Bee way back in 1985.Indian-Americans won many spelling bee crowns subsequently since 2008. Their unrelenting hold on the competition has been the subject of popular documentaries.Asked about her victory, Avant-garde said, “I mean, I was a bit surprised.”“I had been warned about the confetti,” she said, referring to the celebration. “But I didn’t quite understand what they meant, so that was a bit surprising.”Nine of the 11 finalists were Indian-Americans who have dominated contest for more than a decade now.The contest was cancelled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zaila-14-creates-history-becomes-first-african-american-to-win-spelling-bee-101625816849943.html

The airline confirmed the report in a post on its Twitter-like Weibo account but offered no additional details.The Global Times and other reports said 22 of those onboard tested positive for Covid-19, although those numbers did not appear on the National Health Commission’s daily report of new cases.US forces are scheduled to leave Afghanistan by Aug. 31 after nearly 20 years of battling the Taliban.Chinese companies have invested in Afghan mining and infrastructure, but those assets appear increasingly in jeopardy as the Taliban seize large amounts of territory, possibly placing Kabul at risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-evacuates-210-nationals-from-afghanistan-amid-us-troops-pullout-101625814627798.html
09-07-2021||World||With eye on Delta cases, Canada allows only fully vaccinated inbound travellers||As Canada has decided to gradually open up to international travel, the country has also seen an uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases related to the highly infectious Delta variant over the last few weeks. More than 4,600 cases related to the Delta variant of the coronavirus have been reported in Canada so far and its spread is being watched carefully by the country’s health authorities. However, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government was proceeding on a “step-by-step” basis and the “next step will be looking at measures that can allow for international travellers who are fully vaccinated. That will be our first focus”. Non-essential travel to Canada has been prohibited since March last year, when the Covid-19 pandemic first took hold in the country and across the world. “We are going to make sure we are moving forward on that in the coming weeks,” Trudeau said on easing restrictions on non-essential travel. However, such a move will not apply to those who are not vaccinated against the disease. “That’s not going to happen for quite a while,” the Canadian PM clarified. Canada announced easing of restrictions for citizens and permanent residents that came into effect on July 5. The requirement of isolating at a government-approved hotel for three days while results of a Covid-19 test on arrival are available was dropped for fully vaccinated individuals that qualified for the exemption. The categories of travellers benefitting from the relaxation in rules included citizens, permanent residents, their immediate and extended family members, international students with a valid study permit at a designated learning institution with a Covid-19 readiness plan approved by its province or territory, and temporary workers with valid work permits. The move also applied to those vaccinated with a jab approved for emergency use authorisation by Health Canada. Health Canada has so far approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Astra Zeneca/Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. While Covishield, the Indian version of the AZ vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, is accepted in Canada, Indian-made Covaxin and Russian-made Sputnik V are not. The Pennsylvania-based firm Ocugen has partnered with Bharat Biotech to make Covaxin available in North America, and has entered into discussions with Health Canada for regulatory approval. The vaccine has yet to receive emergency use authorisation. Restrictions remain in place for those not fully vaccinated or vaccinated with a jab not authorised in Canada. Such travellers have to complete the three-day quarantine at a government-approved hotel while awaiting results of their tests, submit to a second test on day eight of their arrival, and complete the full 14-day period of self-isolation. Travellers arriving in Canada still have to provide a negative molecular test result taken within 72 hours prior to departure. RISE IN DELTA VARIANT CASES Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said there were 4,654 cases caused by the Delta variant, which was first detected in India. Tam released these numbers during the course of a briefing on Thursday during which she also said that this was a variant health authorities were “keeping track of quite closely”. This was the first time that Canadian health authorities have given a composite count of the number of cases linked to the Delta variant. The agency Canadian Press had reported three weeks earlier that there were approximately 2,000 cases of the variant in the country. That would mean the caseload connected to this particular variant has more than doubled in the space of 21 days. Delta was upgraded to a variant of concern (VOC) by Canadian health authorities in mid-May as it caused a severe crisis in India. There are four VOCs listed by the Canadian government, of which Alpha has been linked to 225,287, Beta to 2,298 and Gamma to 18,957 cases. In a statement released on Thursday, Tam said “recent evidence shows that all Covid-19 vaccines in use in Canada provide substantial protection against symptomatic illness and severe outcomes caused by variants of concern, with excellent protection after the second dose”. The emergence of the Delta variant also led to the imposition of a ban of direct flights from India on April 22. That suspension remains in place, after it was renewed twice despite the total cases in India falling considerably over recent weeks. Prior to the flight ban, both Air Canada and Air India were operating almost daily flights between the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver and New Delhi in an air corridor arrangement that came into place last summer. Passengers from India who arrive via an indirect route, through a third country, will have to provide a pre-departure negative coronavirus test result from the last port before continuing their journey. Tam also addressed the issue of the Lambda variant, which originated in Peru and said there were 11 cases reported so far in Canada and it is considered a variant of interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-eye-on-delta-cases-canada-allows-only-fully-vaccinated-inbound-travellers-101625814150509.html
09-07-2021||World||Flooding reported in parts of New York ahead of Storm Elsa's expected arrival||Several subway stations were flooded and major roads were cut in New York on Thursday ahead of the expected arrival of Storm Elsa, which has moved up the US East Coast after lashing Florida with wind and rain.Between 2 and 4 inches of water fell in a series of thunderstorms over the city and surrounding areas on Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service (NWS) said, "causing extensive flash flooding in certain places."Subway passengers posted video footage on Twitter of flooded platforms at the 157th Street station north of Manhattan.Commuters could be seen waist-deep in the water, crossing a dark pool to reach the station's platforms."Lines 1 and A have really taken a hit, with a lot of flooding in the stations," Sarah Feinberg, head of the MTA, New York's public transport authority, said on Thursday at a press briefing.Some major roads, including in the Bronx, were temporarily closed, disrupting traffic.

Terming the claims as "false," Pakistan Peoples Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, "no one has asked him for a base.”Zardari made the remarks at a public gathering in Haveli during his campaign for the upcoming Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) elections. "To tell you the truth, no one has even asked him, no one has made a phone call, no one has asked him for a base, he is just saying it on his own," the Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper quoted Zardari as saying.In an interview with Axios last month, Prime Minister Imran Khan categorically said that he would not allow any bases and use of its soil to the United States for action inside Afghanistan. "Absolutely not. There is no way we are going to allow any bases, any sort of action from Pakistani territory into Afghanistan. Absolutely not," Khan told Axios in the interview.Continuing his attack against the Pakistan Prime Minister, Zardari further said that "this puppet government (the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government) does not have that strength to do such big things."As American troops are leaving war-torn Afghanistan, experts of international affairs have speculated that Washington, DC may seek to set up military bases in nearby countries, including Pakistan, to ‘monitor’ the situation across the border.On May 26, a Reuters report said that US officials are exploring potential basing options in countries near Afghanistan, like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. However, they have not come to an agreement with any of them.Pakistan shares a border with Afghanistan that runs along heavily contested areas of south and eastern Afghanistan where the Taliban have a large presence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilwal-bhutto-of-ppp-slams-pak-pm-imran-khan-says-us-did-not-ask-for-a-military-base-101625799059484.html
09-07-2021||World||United States: Earthquake of 5.9 magnitude rattles California-Nevada border||An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.9 rattled the California-Nevada border Thursday afternoon, with people reporting feeling the shaking hundreds of miles away, according to the US Geological Survey.There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries.The earthquake struck at 3:49 p.m. in a region about 250 miles (402 kilometers) east of San Francisco and south of Lake Tahoe. Its epicenter was 4 miles (6.5 km) west-southwest of Walker, a California town of fewer than 900 residents. It was followed by a dozen aftershocks, with at least one with a 4.6 magnitude, the USGS said.“The ground was shaking pretty bad, and then everything started falling,” said Carolina Estrada, manager at the Walker Coffee Company. Syrup bottles broke, dishes fell to the ground and the roof of the shop caved in a bit.The shaking lasted 30 seconds or more, she said.“We ran out of the building,” Estrada said. But the shaking continued, and “boulders the size of cars” fell onto nearby US 395, she said.Cars were struck by rocks, but nobody was injured, the California Highway Patrol reported.At one point, rockslides closed about 40 miles (64 km) of the interstate, a major route through the northern Sierra Nevada, authorities said. Portions of the interstate were later reopened, but crews remained at the scene in case of aftershocks, according to the California Department of Transportation.In Nevada, Reno City Hall was evacuated, Mayor Hillary Schieve told the Reno Gazette Journal.“It shook pretty good,” Schieve said.Regionally, “this would be the largest one in almost two and a half decades,” said Graham Kent, director of the University of Nevada, Reno’s seismological lab.Communities all around Lake Tahoe and as far south as Fresno, California, felt the earthquake, which had a depth of 6 miles (9.8 km).The quake was “a classic normal faulting earthquake for eastern California," and aftershocks were common in the region, seismologist Lucy Jones tweeted.More than 30 aftershocks were reported in the first two hours, including at least five of magnitude-4.0 or greater, the USGS reported.“People in the area should expect aftershocks for days following an earthquake of this size,” said Jason Ballman with the Southern California Earthquake Center at the University of Southern California. “We’ve already seen a pretty vigorous aftershock sequence.”Ballman cautioned that reports of damage or injury might not be available for days because a lot of the shaking was felt in remote areas.Preliminary reports had indicated two earthquakes striking 25 seconds but 100 miles apart. But the U.S. Geological Survey revised the shaking and removed the report of a magnitude 4.8 quake in Farmington, about five miles (8 km) southeast of Stockton, the Sacramento Bee said.“While there are no preliminary reports of damage or injuries, this is a rapidly evolving situation & more details will emerge in the coming hours.” California’s Office of Emergency Services tweeted. “We are working closely with local officials to ensure they have the resources and support to rapidly respond to these earthquakes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-earthquake-of-5-9-magnitude-rattles-california-nevada-border-101625795155168.html

According to a report by the Associated Press, one of the arrested men was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haitian capital Port au Prince.Hours after the arrest of Americans, Taiwan officials also said that 11 suspects were detained from its embassy grounds. The police launched an operation around 4pm (Thursday) and successfully arrested 11 suspects," Taiwan's embassy said, adding it had agreed to a police request to search the grounds "without hesitation". Others are reported to be of Colombian origin."We have arrested 15 Colombians and the two Americans of Haitian origin. Three Colombians have been killed while eight others are on the run," national police director general Leon Charles said at a news conference.The police have also recovered "weapons and materials used by the assailants," Charles said, adding, "We will strengthen our investigation and search techniques to intercept the other eight mercenaries," he also said.President Moise and his wife Martine were attacked by gunmen at their private residence in the capital Port-au-Prince on Wednesday. During the attack, Moise was shot dead, while his wife sustained injuries. She is currently being treated at a hospital in the United States’ Miami and is reported to be in a stable condition.The killing of Moise has pushed Haiti, an economically-backward country in the Americas, into a political crisis. It now has no president or working parliament, while two men -- Ariel Henry, Claude Joseph -- are claiming to be in charge as prime minister.Officials have not given a motive for the killing so far. Since he took office in 2017, Moise had faced mass protests against his rule - first over corruption allegations and his management of the economy, then over his increasing grip on power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-cops-arrest-two-us-citizens-in-president-jovenel-moise-assassination-case-101625793822711.html
09-07-2021||World||Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine may require third dose, companies seek approval||The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, sold under the brand name 'Comirnaty', may require a third dose to work more effectively against the original strain of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), news agencies reported on Friday morning, citing a statement from the companies from a day ago. The third Covid-19 shot is also expected to provide better protection against the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, and the Delta variant, found in India, as per interim data from an ongoing trial into the vaccine.Also Read: When will Moderna and Pfizer Covid vaccines reach India? Latest updatesPfizer and BioNTech announced on Thursday that they would seek regulatory approval for the third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine, in view of the interim trial data which showed that a third dose can push antibody levels five to 10 times higher against the said variants of the coronavirus compared to the first two doses alone. This will, in effect, provide better protection than the current practice of administering two shots, the statement read.The development comes after the vaccine was reported to be less effective against the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A study, published in the journal 'Nature', showed that a single shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or even the AstraZeneca shot for that matter, "barely" induces any neutralising antibodies against the Delta Covid-19 strain.The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was reportedly dropping in efficacy after six months, the Israeli government said earlier this week. According to Bloomberg, data from Israel’s health ministry showed the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine protected 64% of the country’s people against the virus between June 6 and early July, down from the earlier 94%.This decline has been observed amid the emergence and rise in cases of Delta variant in the country, the data revealed. Commenting on the matter, Pfizer-BioNTech said that the third dose may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination for complete protection.Also Read | Moderna, Pfizer vaccines warn of heart inflammation riskIn light of these findings, Pfizer-BioNTech announced that the companies are working on a Delta-specific vaccine, the first batch of which has already been manufactured at BioNTech's facility in Mainz, Germany.However, more studies are needed in this area and the companies anticipate the clinical trials to begin in August, subject to regulatory approvals."The companies expect to publish more definitive data soon as well as in a peer-reviewed journal and plan to submit the data to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), EMA (European Medicines Agency) and other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine-may-require-third-dose-companies-seek-approval-101625790454549.html

Nine people were reported to be on board: eight skydivers and the pilot.Lars Hedelin, spokesman for the Bergslagen region police referred to "multiple" deaths. While he would not give a specific figure, he did say that one person had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.In 2019, nine people were killed when a plane carrying skydivers crashed outside the city of Umea, northeast Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-dead-after-small-plane-crashes-in-sweden-101625787303179.html

No,” he said, before adding that it was not inevitable that the country would fall to the hardline rulers who were in power before the US launched an invasion in retaliation to the September 11 attacks.The US last weekend abandoned Bagram air base, the long-time staging ground for US military operations in the country. Washington agreed to withdraw in a deal negotiated last year under Biden’s Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.Biden has since overruled military leaders who wanted to keep a larger presence to assist Afghan security forces and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a staging ground for extremist groups. On Thursday, Biden said the country will refocus its counterterrorism efforts in other regions such as Syria and Yemen where terror groups had gained strength.The Taliban on Thursday seized a third Afghan border crossing, this time with Iran.The Taliban now control roughly a third of all 421 districts and district centres in Afghanistan. Their victories are also putting pressure on provincial cities and taking away government control of key transportation routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-mission-will-end-on-august-31-joe-biden-101625783709194.html
09-07-2021||World||Justin Trudeau says Canada will not welcome unvaccinated tourists for some time||Foreign tourists who are not vaccinated against Covid-19 will not be allowed to enter Canada for quite some time because the government is unwilling to jeopardize progress made on containing the virus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday."I can tell you right now that's not going to happen for quite a while," said Trudeau, when asked by reporters when Canada would allow unvaccinated tourists to enter the country.Canada, as of this week, has waived quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated citizens. But non-essential foreign travelers are still not allowed to enter despite pressure from the country's hurting tourism sector.The United States does not have vaccine requirements for visitors. At this point talks about lifting border restrictions are focused on fully vaccinated travelers, Trudeau said."The next step we'll be looking at what measures we can allow for international travelers who are fully vaccinated," he said. "We will have more to say in the coming weeks."Trudeau has previously said authorities are looking closely at domestic vaccination rates, the spread of variants of concern, and how the rest of the world deals with Covid-19.Some 78% of people aged 12 years or older in Canada have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, health officials said on Thursday. About 44% of people 12 years or older are fully vaccinated.Governments in Canada and the United States have faced pressure to reopen the world's largest land border, which has been shuttered to non-essential travel since March 2020. The current restrictions are in place at least until July 21.A White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that a reopening of US borders to many global tourists will still need more discussion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-says-canada-not-to-welcome-unvaccinated-tourists-for-some-time-101625775298784.html
09-07-2021||World||Haiti's President Jovenel Moise assassination: Police arrest 6 in last 36 hours||Two men believed to be Haitian Americans — one of them purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Port au Prince — have been arrested in connection with the assassination of Haiti's president, a senior Haitian official said Thursday.Mathias Pierre, Haiti's minister of elections, told The Associated Press that James Solages was among six people arrested in the 36 hours since the brazen killing of President Jovenel Moise by gunmen at his home in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday.Four other suspected assailants were killed and two are still missing, Pierre said.Pierre would not provide additional details about Solages' background, nor would he provide the name of the second Haitian-American he said was arrested.Solages describes himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida to assist residents.On his bio page for the charity, Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. Calls to the foundation and Solages' associates at the charity either did not go through or were not answered.“The pursuit of the mercenaries continues,” said Léon Charles, director of Haiti's National Police, in announcing the arrest of suspects. “Their fate is fixed: They will fall in the fighting or will be arrested.”Witnesses said two suspects were discovered hiding in bushes in Port-au-Prince on Thursday by a crowd, some of whom grabbed the men by their shirts and pants, pushing them and occasionally slapping them.Police arrived shortly afterward to arrest the men, who were sweating heavily and wearing clothes that seemed to be smeared with mud, an Associated Press journalist at the scene said. Officers placed them in the back of a pickup truck and drove away as the crowd ran after them to the nearby police station.Once there, some in the crowd chanted: “They killed the president! Give them to us. We're going to burn them!”One man was overheard saying that it was unacceptable for foreigners to come to Haiti to kill the country's leader, referring to reports from officials that the perpetrators spoke Spanish or English.The crowd later set fire to several abandoned cars riddled with bullet holes that they believed belonged to the suspects, who were white men. The cars didn't have license plates, and inside one of them was an empty box of bullets and some water.At a news conference Thursday, Charles, the police chief, asked people to stay calm, go home and let police do their work as he warned that authorities needed evidence they were destroying, including the burned cars.Officials did not provide any details about the suspects, including their nationalities, nor did they address a motive or say what led police to them. They said only that the attack condemned by Haiti's main opposition parties and the international community was carried out by “a highly trained and heavily armed group.”Prime Minister Claude Joseph assumed leadership of Haiti with the backing of police and the military and on Thursday asked people to reopen businesses and go back to work as he ordered the reopening of the international airport.On Wednesday, Joseph decreed a two-week state of siege following Moïse's killing, which stunned a nation grappling with some of the Western Hemisphere's highest poverty, violence and political instability.Inflation and gang violence have spiraled upward as food and fuel grew scarcer in a country where 60% of Haitians earn less than $2 a day. The increasingly dire situation comes as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 following a history of dictatorship and political upheaval.“There is this void now, and they are scared about what will happen to their loved ones,” said Marlene Bastien, executive director of Family Action Network Movement, a group that helps people in Miami's Little Haiti community.She said it was important for the administration of US President Joe Biden to take a much more active role in supporting attempts at national dialogue in Haiti with the aim of holding free, fair and credible elections.Bastien said she also wants to see participation of the extensive Haitian diaspora: “No more band-aids. The Haitian people have been crying and suffering for too long.”Haiti had grown increasingly unstable under Moïse, who had been ruling by decree for more than a year and faced violent protests as critics accused him of trying to amass more power while the opposition demanded he step down.According to Haiti's constitution, Moïse should be replaced by the president of Haiti's Supreme Court, but the chief justice died in recent days from Covid-19, leaving open the question of who might rightfully succeed to the office.Joseph, meanwhile, was supposed to be replaced by Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who had been named prime minister by Moïse a day before the assassination.Henry told the AP in a brief interview that he is the prime minister, calling it an exceptional and confusing situation. In another interview with Radio Zenith, he said he had no dispute with Joseph. “I only disagree with the fact that people have taken hasty decisions ... when the moment demands a little more serenity and maturity,” he said.Moïse had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.On Thursday, public transportation and street vendors remained scarce, an unusual sight for the normally bustling streets of Port-au-Prince.Marco Destin, 39, was walking to see his family since no buses, known as tap-taps, were available. He was carrying a loaf of bread for them because they had not left their house since the president's killing out of fear for their lives.“Every one at home is sleeping with one eye open and one eye closed,” he said. “If the head of state is not protected, I don't have any protection whatsoever.”Destin said Haiti has always been a complicated country and that he wasn't sure what the upcoming days would bring. “Haiti doesn't know what direction it's heading in right now,” he said. “To be honest, I don't know what the solution is. There's always been a fight for power.”Gunfire rang out intermittently across the city hours after the killing, a grim reminder of the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said gangs were a force to contend with and it isn't certain Haiti's security forces can enforce a state of siege.“It's a really explosive situation,” he said, adding that foreign intervention with a UN-type military presence is a possibility. “Whether Claude Joseph manages to stay in power is a huge question. It will be very difficult to do so if he doesn't create a government of national unity.”Joseph told the AP that he supports an international investigation into the assassination and believes elections scheduled for later this year should be held, as he promised to work with Moïse's allies and opponents alike.“Everything is under control,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haitis-president-jovenel-moise-assassination-2-haitian-americans-detained-101625774680297.html
09-07-2021||World||'No military solution': US President Joe Biden says war in Afghanistan will end August 31||President Joe Biden on Thursday said the US military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on Aug. 31, saying “speed is safety” as the United States seeks to end the nearly 20-year war.“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said in a speech to update his administration’s ongoing efforts to wind down the US war. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”Biden also amplified the justification of his decision to end US military operations even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country. The administration in recent days has repeatedly sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a military solution.”“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said to those calling for the US to extend the military operation. He added, “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome."Biden said he didn't trust the Taliban but trusted the capacity of the Afghan military to defend the government.Before his speech, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden administration officials always anticipated an “uptick” in violence and greater turmoil as the US withdrawal moved forward. She added that prolonging US military involvement, considering former President Donald Trump had already agreed to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops.“The question fundamentally facing him was after 20 years was he going to commit more American troops to a civil war in Afghanistan,” Psaki said.Biden said it was “highly unlikely” that one government will control Afghanistan after the US pullout, and urged the Afghan government to reach a deal with the Taliban.The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the US war comes to an end.“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world," he said.US forces earlier this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the US epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the US that triggered the war.Remaining US troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty later this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced US military mission.Biden in recent days has bristled at reporters when asked about the drawdown and the security situation in Afghanistan. Asked last week at an event to highlight a strong jobs report whether he was concerned that the Afghan government could fall in a matter of months, he didn’t hide his annoyance.Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. But the president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.“Do I trust the Taliban? No," Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the US military as translators, drivers and in other jobs who are now fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the US withdrawal is complete.The White House says the administration has identified US facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January.“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Biden said. “There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-military-solution-us-president-joe-biden-says-war-in-afghanistan-will-end-august-31-101625770286087.html
09-07-2021||India||Long delayed, monsoon likely to arrive in Delhi on Saturday: IMD||New Delhi: After slowing in mid-June, and then entering a 10-day lull, the monsoon has started reviving and is set to finally advance over Delhi on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said — almost a month after its initial prediction of June 12-15.The monsoon will also cover the remaining parts of western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in the next 24 hours, IMD added.It said the conditions were becoming favourable for the advance of monsoon over the remaining parts of the country between July 11 and 12, and to intensify further in the next three or four days. “Widespread rainfall is likely over northwest India, including Delhi, over the next five days. Besides, isolated heavy rainfall is expected in Delhi and surrounding regions from July 11 -13,” IMD said in its Friday bulletin.“The showers will intensify on July 11, with good rainfall likely across Delhi, and will continue throughout the week at least,” said a senior IMD scientist who asked not to be named. Monsoon showers are expected to hit Gurugram and Noida on Saturday as well, he added. This is already the most delayed monsoon in the Capital for at least 17 years, for which the weather office has records, going back to the 2006, when the seasonal showers hit the city on July 9. Monsoon usually arrives in the city by June 27-28.The monsoon was racing through the country in early June, and the Met predicted last month that it would hit Delhi by June 15, the earliest in the period for which data is available, before it suddenly slowed down and appeared to hit a “break” phase.Since June 1, the country has received 6% less rain than it normally does. Delhi has received only 42% of the rain it receives in that time, while Haryana has got 71%, Chandigarh has received 60%, and Punjab has got 64%, IMD data showed.“During the next 24 hours, monsoon is likely to make its onset over Delhi and other parts of northwest India. Conditions are favourable because easterlies have started coming towards this region... The circulation features and expected weather support the advance of monsoon to northwest India. We saw a spell of rain on Thursday evening as well, and there is some clouding,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.A low-pressure area is likely to form over west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal around July 11, and will further intensify rains over west and central India. “When the low-pressure area develops over Bay of Bengal, good rainfall is expected in its path. To begin with, India Meteorological Department (IMD)‘s May 31 forecast for monsoon onset over Kerala raised hopes of early showers across the country. But this was revised, at the last minute on May 30, to declare the onset of monsoon for June 3. IMD, on June 11, forecast that monsoon would advance to remaining parts of the country outside south Rajasthan and Kutch during the next six to seven days. But the northern limit of monsoon has been stationary. The Northern Limit of southwest monsoon has been stationary since June 19 at Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar. IMD initially forecast that monsoon would make onset over Delhi by June 15, around 12 days ahead of its normal onset date. But the weather office gradually deferred it to July 10, nearly a month later than its initial prediction. Independent weather experts backed the latest Met’s prediction.“Easterly winds have started blowing in, and will completely replace the westerly winds. There is already an increase in moisture levels due to easterly winds. During the next two weeks we expect widespread rains across the country, including northwest India,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet weather, a private forecaster.He added that the showers will bring Delhi some long-awaited respite from the heatwave conditions. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius on Friday, two notches above normal, but down from 41.8°C the previous day.“The day temperature will drop to around 34°C,” Palawat said.So far, Delhi has seen heatwave conditions from June 29 to July 2 and then on July 7 and 8. Palawat also said that, according to Skymet’s forecast, Delhi is likely to have a “normal” monsoon. “The monsoon will most likely be normal with 103% of long-period average (LPA),” he said. LPA is considered the normal range of temperatures and rainfall, which helps note deviation. Monsoon rainfall in the range of 96%-104% of LPA is considered ‘normal’. Easterly winds are also likely to strengthen at lower levels over northwest India in coming three or four days. Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rainfall is very likely over northwest India in the next five days, said the weather office.Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied with frequent cloud to ground lightning is very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during next 24 hours. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-delayed-monsoon-likely-to-arrive-in-delhi-on-saturday-imd-101625855310932.html
09-07-2021||India||SC dismisses govt plea against hearings on IT rules in HCs||The Supreme Court on Friday turned down the Centre’s plea to restrain all high courts in the country from passing any order on the government’s new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, which has been challenged in multiple petitions by tech companies, digital news publishers and individual citizens.Refusing to pass any interim order for now, the Supreme Court said the Centre’s transfer petition for shifting all cases pending before different high courts to the top court will be heard on July 16.The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna tagged the Centre’s petition with a clutch of other petitions related to regulations that cover over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar. The 2021 IT Rules too apply to OTT platforms, and have become contentious for how it affects social media and digital news. On March 23 this year, a three-judge bench of the top court stayed all High Courts from considering any fresh petitions in connection with the OTT regulations. It will be this bench that will now consider the transfer petition by Centre with regard to petitions challenging the IT Rules 2021 on July 16. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who appeared for Centre, informed the Court that petitions against the IT Rules were pending before the high courts of Delhi, Madras, Bombay and Kerala. These petitions include those by WhatsApp, which has challenged clauses requiring originator of a private message to be traced, news publishers and broadcasters, who have said it violates the fundamental right to free speech, and private citizens like TM Krishna, who has challenged the entirety of the rules on multiple grounds. Mehta stated that the Kerala High Court on Friday had ordered interim protection to the News Broadcasters Association from any coercive action for non-compliance under the IT Rules. The Delhi High Court, on the other hand, refused protection to another set of petitioners. Mehta urged the Court to stay proceedings before various High Courts till the next date of hearing. The bench said, “Today we are simply tagging this matter with the other pending case. That matter is pending before a bench presided over by Justice DY Chandrachud. We will not issue any order except to list this petition before the appropriate bench on July 16.” The Foundation for Independent Journalism, which runs the news website The Wire was present during the proceedings on caveat. It was the first to challenge the rules before the Delhi High Court in March this year. Later, the Quint Digital Media Limited, which runs the website The Quint, also filed a petition that is now pending with the Delhi High Court. Online legal news portal Live Law also moved the Kerala high court against the rules. Senior advocate CU Singh and advocate Liz Mathew, who appeared for the Foundation and Live Law respectively, informed the Court that the matter heard by Justice Chandrachud had nothing to do with the challenge to IT Rules 2021. “Those petitions were filed prior to the coming of the IT Rules 2021 and are on a completely different issue,” said Singh. The IT Rules 2021 were introduced in February this year. The new rules apply to digital news media platforms, social media intermediaries and OTT platforms, bringing all digital media functionaries under a three-tier oversight mechanism for regulation of content. This comprises of a grievance officer responsible to deal with complaints within 24 hours. The two remaining tiers consist of a self-regulatory body of experts headed by a former judge, and an inter-departmental committee headed by a senior bureaucrat of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Calcutta High Court too is considering the validity of the IT Rules in a PIL proceeding while a media house has gone to the Karnataka High Court challenging the Rules in question. These petitions have largely claimed that the Rules curtail and restrict the freedom of press in India and claim the conditions imposed under the Digital Media Ethics Code and guidelines to be onerous and beyond the scope of the Information Technology Act 2000. The use of vague words such as “good taste” and “decency” in the Ethics Code are additional challenges to the Rules which, according to many of the petitioners, gave “pervasive control to state over published content”. However, the Centre has said that the Rules are intended to provide speedy redressal of complaints to enable taking down harmful content, personally intimate pictures or videos of individuals within 24 hours. The Rules also require the media functionaries to cooperate with the Government and investigating agencies for purposes of verification of identity, detection and prevention of crimes, and investigation or prosecution of offences. “The Supreme Court’s decision demonstrates that it will not simply believe the government’s assertion that the Rules are perfectly legal unless they unpack the complex regulations. Government could have prevented this situation by not rushing in with the Rules. High Courts interfered as they felt the Rules could be detrimental to online media freedom. This apprehension also stands affirmed by the top court,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Policy director and senior international counsel at Access Now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-govt-plea-against-hearings-on-it-rules-in-hcs-101625855251531.html
09-07-2021||India||‘No major infirmity’ in purchase of low-floor AC buses, says LG panel||A probe committee appointed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has given a clean chit to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) over the tendering and procurement of 1,000 air-conditioned (AC) low-floor buses -- an issue that was a bone of contention between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which alleged corruption in the process.The three-member panel, however, recommended floating fresh tenders for its annual maintenance contract (AMC) over what it described as “procedural lapses” arising out of a “bona fide decision-making process”.The report submitted to the L-G this week -- HT has reviewed portions of it -- stated that the committee, prima facie, did not find criminal misconduct by any public official. “The tendering process of purchase of buses warrants no interference and suffers from no major infirmity... The committee, prima facie, did not come across any material to impute criminal misconduct attributable to any public official,” the report said. “There were only procedural lapses apparently arising out of a bona fide decision making process. However, a greater effort for understanding the market and a higher degree of due diligence in assessing reasonableness of bids was required compared to what seems to have been demonstrated,” it added.“…In light of the findings outlined above, the committee recommends that the bid for AMC of buses be scrapped,” the panel, said while giving four recommendations.These included either going for a fresh bid, asking DTC to develop and strengthen in-house capabilities to maintain these buses, suggesting that a fresh bid could be floated for a turnkey operation and maintenance contract for these buses as against a simple AMC contract, and recommending that DTC could rope in experts to design suitable variants of all the stated options. DTC comes under the Delhi government.The panel urged the government take a decision soon based on its recommendations soon, so that there was no gap between the arrival of new buses and their operations. Delhi currently has at least 6,600 buses against the requirement of 11,000 buses, as mandated under various court orders. Bone of contentionIn March last year, DTC floated a tender for procurement of 1,000 CNG low-floor buses, issued another tender for allotting the AMC for these buses four months later. The BJP-led opposition in the Delhi assembly, raising the issue this March, contended that the AMC should have been included in the same tender meant for procuring the buses on the grounds that it would have been cheaper. The Delhi government was spending ₹875 crore in the procurement of the 1,000, buses and the AMC, as per the second tender, was costing the DTC ₹3,500 crore. To be sure, the purchase is a one-time expense, and the maintenance contract is valid for 12 years.Eventually, BJP leaders led by Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta, filed a complaint with the city’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) and the LG. On June 11, the Delhi government put on hold its plan to procure these buses through the DTC, saying it was open to investigation. On June 16, the state vigilance department, on the direction of LG Baijal, constituted a three-member committee headed by former bureaucrat OP Aggarwal. The other two members were principal secretary (vigilance) KR Meena, and transport commissioner Ashish Kundra. The committee, in its report, said that the tender for procurement of buses “warrants no interference”.Suppliers’ marketAt the same time, it noted that there were some deviations from the process outlined in the General Financial Rules (GFR) and Manual for Procurement of Goods in tendering for the AMC. “While separate bids for purchase and AMC can be justified with a view to get greater competition and a larger number of bids, the efforts made to get more bids is not apparent. In fact, the eligibility criteria do appear restrictive and defeat the purpose of splitting the bids. The process of discounting for a longer duration contract was not undertaken and only a total cost evaluation was done.” The panel went on to explain why the DTC may have done so, saying that various court orders limit the corporation to purchasing only low-floor CNG buses. “There are very few others who use such buses, and so DTC (in fact Delhi) has been pushed into a suppliers’ market, with very few manufacturers. These limitations may compel some deviations in the procurement process. Yet, if these deviations had become necessary, DTC should have ensured that they did some kind of reasonableness test of the rates for AMC, especially since the rates were far more than what they had in earlier contracts.” It stated that this incident should be taken as an “opportune occasion” for the transport department to take a hard look at comprehensive reforms of DTC in both the short- and the long-term. Neither the Delhi government nor the LG’s office commented on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-major-infirmity-in-purchase-of-low-floor-ac-buses-says-lg-panel-101625855131647.html
09-07-2021||India||Judges must know their limits, not act like emperors: SC||Judges must not behave like emperors, the Supreme Court observed on Friday as it condemned the practice of summoning government officials by courts “at the drop of a hat and to exert direct or indirect pressure”. The bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta took a grim view that some of the high courts in the country have developed a practice of calling government officials routinely which, it said, is against public interest as many important tasks entrusted to such officials get delayed. “Judges must know their limits. They must have modesty and humility, and not behave like emperors. The legislature, the executive and the judiciary all have their own broad spheres of operation. It is not proper for any of these three organs of the state to encroach upon the domain of another, otherwise the delicate balance in the Constitution will be upset, and there will be a reaction,” the bench said, quoting from a 2008 judgment of the Supreme Court. “The line of separation of powers between Judiciary and Executive is sought to be crossed by summoning the officers and in a way, pressurising them to pass an order as per the whims and fancies of the court,” the court noted while hearing an appeal of the Uttar Pradesh government against an order of the Allahabad high court in a service matter. In the case relating to posting and back wages of a medical officer of the state, the high court had passed certain orders which are being contested by the UP government before the top court. In February, the bench had stayed the order of the high court to give back wages to the medical officer but the high court did not hold its hands and still summoned the health secretary of the state in a contempt case against the state government. Disapproving of such orders, the top court held that it is time to reiterate that public officers should not be called to the court unnecessarily. “The dignity and majesty of the court is not enhanced when an officer is called to court. Respect to the court has to be commanded and not demanded and the same is not enhanced by calling public officers,” it said. The bench emphasised that the presence of public officers comes at the cost of other official engagements demanding their attention and may eventually take a toll on the tasks they are supposed to do for the public. “The public officers of the executive are also performing their duties as the third limbs of the governance. The actions or decisions by the officers are not to benefit them, but as a custodian of public funds and in the interest of administration, some decisions are bound to be taken,” the court said. The bench added that a court can always set aside a decision which does not meet the test of judicial review but summoning officers frequently “is liable to be condemned in the strongest words.” Citing the example of the judiciary, the bench underscored that court proceedings also take time since there is no mechanism of fixed time hearing. “The courts have the power of a pen which is more effective than the presence of an officer in the court. If any particular issue arises for consideration before the court and the advocate representing the state is not able to answer, it is advised to write such doubt in the order and give time to the state or its officers to respond,” the bench maintained. The top court also set aside the orders of the high court initiating contempt proceedings against the state government as well as the directive to pay back wages to the medical officer. It noted that the high court was wrong in granting relief to the medical officer who did not join his posting for 13 years on the pretext of not receiving his joining order in 2002. The court said that it was not open to the medical officer to defy the order of transfer on the ground of non-communication when more than 100 medical officers were transferred by the same common transfer order and then he chose not to join where he was posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judges-must-know-their-limits-not-act-like-emperors-sc-101625854893450.html
09-07-2021||India||UCC shouldn’t remain a mere hope in Constitution: HC||New Delhi The Delhi high court has said a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) should not remain a mere hope in the Constitution, expressing regret over conflicts in society due to differences in various personal laws.A single-judge bench of justice Pratibha M Singh said there is a requirement for such a code that would be “common to all” and enable uniform principles being applied in respect of aspects such as marriage, divorce, succession, etc so that settled principles, safeguards and procedures can be laid down. In a judgment dated July 7 that was released on Friday, the bench said the need for a UCC has been reiterated from time to time by the Supreme Court.“In modern Indian society, which is gradually becoming homogenous, the traditional barriers of religion, community and caste are slowly dissipating. The youth of India belonging to various communities, tribes, castes or religions who solemnise their marriages ought not to be forced to struggle with issues arising due to conflicts in various personal laws, especially in relation to marriage and divorce.”“The hope expressed in Article 44 of the Constitution that the State shall secure for its citizens a Uniform Civil Code ought not to remain a mere hope,” justice Singh said in her judgment of July 7. The court said more than three decades have passed since the apex court, in 1985, directed the law ministry to take appropriate steps. “More than three decades have passed since then and it is unclear as to what steps have been taken in this regard till date. Accordingly, let the copy of the present judgment be communicated to the Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, Government of India, for necessary action as deemed appropriate,” the court said in a 27-page judgment.The court’s observation came while hearing a plea involving the applicability of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in respect of parties belonging to the Meena community.The couple got married in 2012 under Hindu rites and customs and had a child in 2013. In 2015, the husband initiated a divorce petition in the trial court.Opposing the same, the wife filed an application in a city court contending that the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 do not apply to the parties concerned as they are members of a notified Scheduled Tribe in Rajasthan. The trial court, while dismissing the husband’s divorce petition, held that the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act would not apply to the couple, as they belonged to the Meena community.Challenging this judgment, the husband had moved to the high court where the wife argued that even though she was married under the Hindu Marriage Act, that would not take away her status of belonging to a particular community.On July 7, while setting aside this judgment, the high court said that even though the parties belonged to the Meena community, their marriage was solemnised according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and they follow Hindu customs.It said that this stance has been made clear in various documents submitted by the wife, including the marriage invitation and the FIR.The court said that if the members of a tribe voluntarily chose to follow Hindu customs, traditions and rites, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the provision of the Hindu Marriage Act. “…nothing has been placed before the court to show that the Meena tribe has a specialised court with proper procedures to deal with these issues,” the court said.“Thus, insofar as divorce proceedings are concerned, if proper tribal customs are not established or the following of Hindu customs or rites is admitted by the parties, there is no reason to hold that the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 would not apply,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ucc-shouldn-t-remain-a-mere-hope-in-constitution-hc-101625854891594.html

Around 250 to 300 years old, these temples share their boundaries with the Ram Janmabhoomi campus.Mahant Kaushal Kishore Tripathi and Mahant Yashoda Nandan Tripathi, aka Mahant Lalluji, two brothers who own the 1,881 sq metre Kaushalya Bhavan, have been paid ₹4 crore and an alternative plot.“(Trust general secretary) Champat Rai, the Ayodhya mayor and (Trust member) Anil Mishra came to meet us to request for handover of the Kaushalya Bhavan for expansion of the Ram Janmabhoomi campus,” said Mahant Yashoda Nandan Tripathi.“Since ages, people have been waiting for the Ram Mandir to come up in Ayodhya. Now, when the temple is being constructed, the Trust wants our land for expansion of the Ram Janmabhoomi. We have handed over (sold) the property to the Trust,” added Tripathi.Mahant Raghuvar Saran of 2,633 sq metre Fikerah Ram Mandir, too, has been given ₹3.70 crore and an alternative land. “My temple is inside the Ram Janmabhoomi. I had no option but to accept the Trust’s offer to sell the land for expansion of Ram Mandir,” said Saran.“But I had demanded alternative land in the Ramkot area only for my new temple. I did not want to move out of this locality,” he added.The Trust has purchased Deen Kuti Mandir for ₹30 lakh from Mahant Sant Das. Das, however, handed over the amount to his followers before his death in May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-acquires-more-land-to-expand-ayodhya-temple-complex-101625854830884.html
09-07-2021||India||WhatsApp will put policy on hold till data law is enacted||WhatsApp on Friday told the Delhi high court that it has “voluntarily agreed to put on hold” its new privacy policy till India enacts the proposed data protection law, while adding that users will not be compelled to accept new terms in a significant climbdown from its recent stance.WhatsApp, represented by senior advocate Harish Salve, told a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that it would not compel users to give consent for the new policy, but will continue to remind them about the update to the terms and conditions. The policy had also caught attention of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which launched an inquiry against which the company filed a court appeal.“The update which triggered the inquiry of CCI is, for the present, we have voluntarily agreed to put it on hold…We will not compel people to accept…We will continue to display our updates from time to time to people who have not accepted. In addition, we will display the update whenever a user chooses relevant optional features, like when a user communicates with a business receiving support from Facebook,” Salve told the court. The controversy relates to WhatsApp making it mandatory for people to consent sharing data about their interaction with businesses (not including the actual message contents) on the app with Facebook companies if they wanted to keep using the service.“The commitment is that I will not do anything till the parliamentary law comes. Obviously, then if parliamentary law comes, you have to fit within that law. If Parliament allows me to have a separate policy for India, I will have it. If it does not allow me, then bad luck. I will then have to take a call,” said Salve.Friday’s stance is a significant departure from what the company said on May 17, when senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for WhatsApp on that day, told the court that user accounts can be deleted for not accepting the new privacy policy. Sibal had said that contrary to reports, WhatsApp was not deferring its update on the privacy policy and it came into force from May 15. He said that it would not straightaway delete the accounts and would rather persuade people to come on board. The contentious privacy policy also invited interventions by the Union government, which on multiple occasions urged the company to withdraw it.The court was hearing the appeals of Facebook and its firm WhatsApp against a single-judge order refusing to stop the competition regulator CCI from beginning a probe into WhatsApp’s privacy policy.Salve argued that since the policy is on hold, the basis of the probe -- the privacy policy -- has been stalled and the inquiry by CCI “had become academic”.But, the court remarked: “You are not implementing it but the policy is with you and any day it can come”. It asked Salve about the opt-out option being given to the European users and not to the Indian users. To this Salve said: “Objectionable part was ‘take it or leave it’. For present, ‘take it or leave it’ is something we are not doing. Opt in, opt out is not there. If a user gives consent to the new privacy policy, his data would be shared. If they don’t, there is no change. Everybody is using WhatsApp even if they agree or not to allow sharing of the information of the users.”He also said that WhatsApp has informed the Union government about the developments related to the implementation of the security policy after the latter sent a communication on May 13, asking them to withdraw the policy.The communication sent to it in May established that the privacy policy was already a subject matter of hearing before the Supreme Court and the high court.“Government has asked us to shut down the policy. We have said we will not enforce it till the Data Protection Bill comes out. That is open-ended because we don’t know when the Bill is going to come out.... Suppose the Bill allows me to do it, we will have completely different ramifications,” Salve submitted.Opposing WhatsApp’s stand, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, for CCI, argued that as long as the privacy policy existed, its implications will continue to persist. He said that the matter before CCI was only at the stage of inquiry and “nothing is going to happen even if steps are taken”.“As long as policy stands, competition law issues persist... It is not as if by filing reply anything detrimental will happen until the court hears and disposes the matter,” Lekhi said, responding to WhatsApp’s contention that it should not be compelled to respond to information sought by CCI.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Facebook, contended that the Supreme Court is hearing an appeal against WhatsApp’s privacy policy and hence CCI cannot be allowed to hold inquiry above a superior constitutional authority.The court, while refusing to allow an impleadment application opposing WhatsApp’s plea, posted the matter for July 30.Experts said WhatsApp’s latest stand did not have a legal foundation. “It ultimately diverts the attention from the main issue that the privacy policy is in violation of IT Act and Rules. So rather than addressing that, what effectively WhatsApp is saying that we will continue to perpetuate our contravention under till a data protection law comes. That leads to WhatsApp losing its immunity against criminal prosecution. WhatsApp cannot wait for a new policy to justify its scheme which is in violation to the current law,” said senior advocate Pavan Duggal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-will-put-policy-on-hold-till-data-law-is-enacted-101625854110864.html
09-07-2021||India||Delhi rolls out graded plan for Covid-19 curbs||Private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down in Delhi if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to a new Covid-19 action plan approved by authorities that sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from as low as 0.5% TPR in order to scuttle an outbreak.The graded response action plan, which harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months, was drafted by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government and approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). It classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it. “In today’s DDMA meeting, ‘Graded Response Action Plan’ was approved. There will now be no confusion regarding when lockdown is to be imposed and when scaled down. In the meeting, we also had discussions on Delta+ variant. We have to protect Delhi from spread of this variant (of the virus), for which the government is taking all necessary actions,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting. The colour-coded classifications take into account three factors: the test positivity rate over two consecutive days, new cases over a seven-day period, and the average weekly hospital occupancy rate (see box). Had such rules been in place prior to the April wave of infections in the Capital, a lockdown would have been put into place 10 days sooner than it was – the city crossed the 5% threshold for what is now the red alert category on April 9. A full lockdown was announced only on April 19. To be sure, the test positivity rate in the Capital has been 0.12% over the past two days, there have been 580 cases in the last seven days and, over the last week, the number of hospital beds occupied has reduced form a little over 620 to 450 on Friday.“Now that this plan is going to be in view of the public, there will be a sense of certainty and accountability on our part towards the people of Delhi. The plan descriptively elaborates upon when the lockdown will be imposed and when it will be lifted. This kind of a graded plan should be adopted at the national level as well… We can’t let our guard down, the preparation for the road map of an impending third (nationwide) wave (of Covid-19) is being worked upon consistently by the Delhi government,” Kejriwal said in a press statement. The chief minister is the vice-chairperson of the DDMA, which is headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. A senior official in Baijal’s office, who asked not to be named, said: “After detailed deliberations and presentations made by the health department of the Delhi government and the Indian Council of Medical Research, it was decided to notify the graded response action plan that will objectively and transparently ensure an institutional and automatic response with regards to enforcement measures, lock downs and unlock based on criteria such as test positivity rate and quantum of cases.” According to the plan, seen by HT, the first of curbs are triggered when the positivity rate crosses 0.5%, or new cases over a week exceeds 1,500, or if there are more than 500 oxygen beds occupied on average over a seven-day period. Once any of these thresholds are breached, the city is under a yellow alert mechanism in which non-essential shops are allowed to open only on an odd-even basis, a night curfew comes into force, and offices are required to move half of their staff to a work-from-home function.If test positivity, case numbers and hospitalisations rise further, the amber alert comes into effect. In this scenario, some venues and activities are completely halted: parks need to close, barber shops cannot open, and dining in at restaurants will be prohibited (as will the opening of bars). Amber alert is when TPR rises above 1%, or if there are more than 3,500 cases over a week, or if oxygen bed occupancy surpasses 700.The next alert level, orange, takes effect if TPR breaches 2%, the number of new cases in a week goes beyond 9,000, or if the average number of oxygen beds occupied over the week goes beyond 3,000. In this scenario, private offices, malls, Metro rail services and weekly markets will be shut down. In the most severe red alert category (if TPR is above 5%, cumulative weekly case above 16,000 or hospital occupancy above 3,000), there will be a 24-hour curfew with people allowed outside only for essential services. In this scenario, all offices engaged in non-essential work need to shift to a completely work-from-home functioning.The new mechanism also makes it mandatory for incoming passengers in the national capital to produce a certificate of full vaccination (both doses) or a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours if Delhi is on red alert. People coming by air from states with positivity rate higher than 5%, or if they come by any mode of transport from a state with positivity rate is of 10% or more, irrespective of the alert applicable in Delhi, too, will be subjected to the same requirements. People coming from a state where a new variant is found spreading, irrespective of the nature of alert in Delhi at that point, will also need to show vaccination certificates or a negative test, the documents said.Friday’s DDMA meeting was also attended by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog, Dr Balram Bhargav of ICMR, Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, and Dr SK Singh of NCDC, said the official in the L-G’s office. Experts welcomed the response plan. Dr Charu Hans, the head of the department of microbiology at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences, said: “Such anticipatory actions are likely to prevent any delays and avoid confusion, and conceivably lead to effective preventive measures in limiting the spread of Covid-19 disease. The experience gained in the last two waves of the disease and learning about mutations of the virus have enabled the government to come up with such a strategy. This strategy can play an important role in limiting the impact of a potential third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-rolls-out-graded-plan-for-covid-19-curbs-101625854051507.html
09-07-2021||India||Afghanistan must get legit govt: Jaishankar||India on Friday stressed the need for a legitimate government in Afghanistan and a reduction in violence, saying the situation in the war-torn country has implications for regional security and stability. External affairs minister S Jaishankar articulated India’s position during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow against the backdrop of efforts by the Taliban to project itself as a key player following a campaign of targeted assassinations and attacks on crucial districts. “Violence cannot be the solution for the situation in Afghanistan. And at the end of the day, who governs Afghanistan has a legitimacy aspect to it. I think that is something which cannot and should not be ignored,” Jaishankar said in response to a question on whether the world community could make peace with the fact that Afghanistan would be controlled by the Taliban. Expressing concern at the “direction of events in Afghanistan”, Jaishankar referred to India’s stated policy of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. “In many cases, when there is volatility in a society, we leave the people of that country to work it out. But Afghanistan is a very different case because now for more than 30 years, there have been international conferences, groups [and] formats to discuss how to stabilise and bring about peace in Afghanistan,” he said. “And the reason is because it has proven implications for regional security and regional stability. So the point right now we stress is that we must see a reduction in violence,” he added. In his opening remarks at the news conference, Jaishankar said the situation in Afghanistan “occupied a lot of our attention because it has a direct implication for regional security”. He added, “We believe that the immediate need of the day is really a reduction in violence and if we have to see peace within Afghanistan and around Afghanistan, it’s important for India and Russia to work together and ensure that much of the progress that we’ve seen in economic, social and democratic terms are maintained. We are both committed to an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.” Lavrov said the situation in Afghanistan was of “great concern” to Russia because the violence might spill over the borders into Central Asian states. Jaishankar’s remarks came a day after a Taliban delegation led by key negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar, which was in Moscow for talks with Russian officials, asserted that the group controls “85% of Afghanistan’s territory”. Delawar told a news conference in Moscow that the US “was forced to leave our territory” because the Taliban brought the Afghan population over to its side under the “principle of Islam”. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted Delawar’s delegation met Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s special envoy for Afghanistan, and discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan and the peace process. Shaheen said Delawar had “maintained that all borders now in [Taliban] control will remain open and functional”, and that the group would not “target diplomats, embassies and consulates, NGOs and their staff”. India has been calling for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire to end the violence that has coincided with the rapid drawdown of US forces, 90% of which has been completed. US President Joe Biden has said the withdrawal of troops will be completed by August 31, triggering concerns in the region that resultant vacuum will add to the instability in Afghanistan and have far-reaching security implications. Though New Delhi has steadfastly backed the government of President Ashraf Ghani, it recently opened channels of communication with some Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-must-get-legit-govt-jaishankar-101625854050853.html
09-07-2021||India||India can help boost our air power: Afghan envoy||With air power emerging as a key element in the campaign by Afghan security forces against the Taliban, Afghanistan is looking to India, the US and Russia to help bolster the country’s fledgling air force, Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay said on Friday. Amid reports of intense fighting in several parts of Afghanistan and the capture of a large number of districts and some crucial border crossings by the Taliban, Mamundzay rejected assessments by some Western powers about the possible collapse of Afghan security forces. He, however, acknowledged the situation is “very dire”, with the fighting displacing more than 200,000 people and resulting in nearly 4,000 civilian deaths since mid-April. The Afghan envoy ruled out the possibility of seeking Indian boots on the ground but said New Delhi could assist Kabul with military hardware, intelligence and logistics support and financial resources in the fight against regional and international terrorist groups, including a “big percentage of foreign fighters”. Describing air support air support as a “game changer”, Mamundzay said: “Our assessment is [that] if we have the required air support, Taliban would never be able to capture any district. And just to give you one instance, should we have 15 to 20 Mi-35 helicopters, or 30 to 40 Black Hawks, they would not be able to hold ground.” He added, “Taliban have the same equipment, weapons and ammunition that we have. Our superiority lies in air support and we appreciate the support that the US has recently promised, that they would support us with more air support. We call on all responsible countries in the region, including Russia, Iran and India, to provide us the required air support.” Mamundzay said there is “active conflict” in almost 150 districts of the total of 400 districts in Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. “Taliban has been capturing a number of capitals of the districts, which has caused an outcry from the local population and the government. In the past three days, we have been able to recapture 10 districts. Now, this would continue for a number of months, we would capture districts, they would recapture it back,” he said. The drawdown of US troops, he said, “could have been handled in a more organised and planned manner”. Mamundzay described the assessment by some Western capitals about the possible collapse of Afghan forces and the government in Kabul in six to 12 months as “very unrealistic”. He said: “We outnumber Taliban by five or six times, a force of 70,000 to 75,000 cannot face a force of around 400,000...We are going through a turbulent time, but the resilience of our people and the heroic patriotism of our forces is there to defend Afghanistan.” The Taliban are delaying the peace process by not setting a time frame for returning to talks “because they want to gain more territory so that they would speak from a position of strength should we get to the negotiating table again”, Mamundzay said. The Taliban also want to prove to “their foot soldiers, ground commanders and affiliates and associates that they are back in power. We have reports that al-Qaeda, Jundullah, ETIM, LeT and JeM are celebrating Taliban’s victories,” he added. The situation has been further complicated because none of the processes aimed at kick-starting peace talks – from the “extended Troika” backed by Russia to the talks arranged by Iran and the process in Doha – have “delivered any results”, the envoy said. “We feel that Taliban are buying time for themselves to continue with their military adventurism and capture more land. And then when we get to winter, they will propose peace negotiations when fighting is difficult. And then they speak from the position of strength, that we hold XYZ percentage of the landmass, now agree to a peace deal on our terms, or else face defeat,” Mamundzay said. Describing Pakistan as the “country in the region with the most influence over the Taliban”, Mamundzay said: “We expected Pakistan to play a very constructive role to bring Taliban to the negotiating table, use that influence that the Pakistanis used to help the Americans...We expected the government of Pakistan to help us in the same manner, in the same spirit so that Kabul and Taliban reach a dignified and lasting deal. “We sadly have not seen the kind of role that we expected Islamabad to play. I hope in the weeks ahead, that calculus will change and they will begin to play a more constructive role.” Asked about what India could do to find a lasting solution in Afghanistan, Mamundzay said India could enhance the political and diplomatic support it currently provides, including helping at the UN Security Council with the listing and delisting of Taliban leaders and forging the required consensus in the region for the peace process. India should continue its economic and development assistance and also look at the possibility of “security assistance should we not reach a dignified and lasting peace deal with the Taliban”, he said. “If we get to a stage where war is imposed on the Afghan public, then we look at India for military and security assistance to protect our people and to fight terrorist groups. So we have not yet got to that stage, we’re still giving a peace a chance,” Mamundzay added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-help-boost-our-air-power-afghan-envoy-101625853570903.html
09-07-2021||India||‘Violence cannot be the solution,” Jaishankar expresses need for legitimate govt in Afghanistan||India on Friday asserted the need for a legitimate government in Afghanistan and a reduction in violence, saying the situation in the war-torn country has implications for regional security and stability.External affairs minister S Jaishankar articulated India’s position during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow against the backdrop of efforts by the Taliban to project itself as a key player following a campaign of targeted assassinations and attacks on crucial districts.“Violence cannot be the solution for the situation in Afghanistan. And at the end of the day, who governs Afghanistan has a legitimacy aspect to it. I think that is something which cannot and should not be ignored,” Jaishankar said in response to a question on whether the world community could make peace with the fact that Afghanistan would be controlled by the Taliban.Expressing concern at the “direction of events in Afghanistan”, Jaishankar referred to India’s stated policy of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. “In many cases, when there is volatility in a society, we leave the people of that country to work it out. But Afghanistan is a very different case because now for more than 30 years, there have been international conferences, groups [and] formats to discuss how to stabilise and bring about peace in Afghanistan,” he said. “And the reason is because it has proven implications for regional security and regional stability. So the point right now we stress is that we must see a reduction in violence,” he added. In his opening remarks at the news conference, Jaishankar said the situation in Afghanistan “occupied a lot of our attention because it has a direct implication for regional security”. Also read: ‘Hope Pakistan begins to play more constructive role in peace process’ - Afghan ambassadorHe added, “We believe that the immediate need of the day is really a reduction in violence and if we have to see peace within Afghanistan and around Afghanistan, it’s important for India and Russia to work together and ensure that much of the progress that we’ve seen in economic, social and democratic terms are maintained. We are both committed to an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.”Lavrov said the situation in Afghanistan was of “great concern” to Russia because the violence might spill over the borders into Central Asian states.Jaishankar’s remarks came a day after a Taliban delegation led by key negotiator Shahabuddin Delawar, which was in Moscow for talks with Russian officials, asserted that the group controls “85 percent of Afghanistan’s territory”.Delawar told a news conference in Moscow that the US “was forced to leave our territory” because the Taliban brought the Afghan population over to its side under the “principle of Islam”. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted Delawar’s delegation met Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s special envoy for Afghanistan, and discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan and the peace process.Shaheen said Delawar had “maintained that all borders now in [Taliban] control will remain open and functional and that the group would not “target diplomats, embassies and consulates, NGOs and their staff”.India has been calling for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire to end the violence that has coincided with the rapid drawdown of US forces, 90% of which has been completed. US President Joe Biden has said the withdrawal of troops will be completed by August 31, triggering concerns in the region that the resultant vacuum will add to the instability in Afghanistan and have far-reaching security implications.Though New Delhi has steadfastly backed the government of President Ashraf Ghani, it recently opened channels of communication with some Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-cannot-be-the-solution-jaishankar-expresses-need-for-legitimate-govt-in-afghanistan-101625852791498.html

This was followed by a religious ceremony that was attended by Patriarch Ilia II, the spiritual leader of the Georgian orthodox church, and Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili.There has been a persistent request from the Georgian side for the permanent transfer of the holy relics of Saint Ketevan found in India. Taking into account the historical, religious and spiritual sentiments attached to Saint Ketevan by the Georgian people, the Indian government decided to gift one part of the holy relics to the government and people of Georgia. The move is aimed at strengthening friendship and understanding between India and Georgia.“Warmly welcomed in Tbilisi by FM @DZalkaliani. Blessed to hand over the holy relics of St. Queen Ketevan to the people of Georgia. An emotional moment...,” Jaishankar tweeted, along with images of the hand-over ceremony.Also read: ‘Legitimacy aspect’ of ruling Afghanistan should not be ignored, says JaishankarKetevan the Martyr, who was the queen of Kakheti in eastern Georgia, a hilly region known for its wine, offered herself as a hostage to Persian Shah Abbas I in 1614 in a failed attempt to prevent Kakheti from being attacked by Iranian forces. She was held in Shiraz until 1624 when she was tortured and killed after refusing to convert to Islam.Two Portuguese friars of the order of St Augustine exhumed the queen’s body in 1628, and it is believed her right arm was brought to Goa in 1627 to be interred in the St Augustine complex.Her relics were found at the St. Augustine Convent in Goa in 2005 on the basis of medieval Portuguese records. Acting on a request from the Archaeological Survey of India, the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad carried out a mitochondrial DNA analysis which confirmed in 2013 that the bone fragments were consistent with being from a Georgian woman.In 2017, at the request of the Georgian government, India sent the relics to Georgia for an exhibition for six months. The relics were then personally received by Patriarch Ilia II and a large number of Georgians. The loan of the relics was extended for another six months before they were returned to India in September 2018. Jaishankar is visiting Georgia during July 9-10 at the invitation of Zalkaliani. This will be the first visit of an Indian foreign minister to independent Georgia. He will have a meeting with his counterpart that will cover different aspects of bilateral ties and issues of regional and global interest. He will also unveil the newly installed statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Tbilisi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-begins-visit-to-georgia-by-handing-over-relic-of-revered-saint-101625852732001.html

It might be a welcome sign for the travel and tourism industry but it has come much to the displeasure of government officials, health experts as well as the top ministers of the government.Pictures of tourists across tourist hotspots in both these states invited widespread concern at a time when the second wave is still going on. While medical experts say that the nation is not yet out of the woods, some defiant tourists believe otherwise.Uttarakhand | Devotees throng to Har ki Pauri in Haridwar as state govt eases COVID-19 restrictions."We feel like we have come out of jail after 2 yrs.

Govt's top adviser explains in 4 points||When daily Covid-19 cases fall to 10,000 in India and the figure is maintained for at least three weeks, the 2nd wave of the pandemic can be presumed to be over, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said on Friday, adding that the current decline in the daily number of cases is not an indication that the second wave is over.A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of recent crowding at several tourist places in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the health ministry repeated its warning that such careless behaviour is a direct invitation to Coronavirus. The transmission of the virus can still be arrested if these travellers quarantine themselves after returning from the hills.Look at Russia, UK, Bangladesh: Government's fresh warning to revenge travellersThe 2nd wave of the pandemic is not over, Dr Paul said explaining 4 points that establish that the wave is still on.> Rate of decline in the number of cases has become slow, which shows that the situation is not to be taken lightly, Dr Paul said.> Second wave is still visible in some districts of particular two states -- Maharashtra and Kerala, and the northeastern states. "This shows that the country is not yet in the safe zone. This has happened earlier too that cases are localised at one point of time and then they suddenly explode," the adviser said.> Daily case of ranging between 35,000 and 37,000 is not a small number, Dr Paul said, adding that this number looks small because of the peak the country experienced. The present daily number is still one-third of the peak of the first wave.> The daily number is far from the baseline.

The Union government has rushed a team of experts to the state. At least 14 cases have been confirmed, said the state health ministry.A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Parasala in Thiruvananthapuram district was the first to test positive for Zika on Thursday, later 13 others were added to the list. Of the 19 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, 14 were found to be positive. Health minister Veena George later called an emergency meeting and an action plan was formulated.“We have started a vigorous vector control programme and the whole state was alerted. We are monitoring the situation closely and more testing labs will be opened,” said the minister, adding that there is no need for panic. The woman has no travel history and it is suspected that she was infected locally. Health officials said samples were sent to the NIV last week and the mother gave birth normally on July 7, both mother and child are stable. At least 60 other samples were sent to Pune and health authorities are busy making arrangements to test samples at the NIV regional centre in Alappuzha.A surveillance team, vector control experts and entomology units visited the area where the woman lived and took precautions to prevent further spread.The health authorities hoped that further spread could be contained with an utmost vigil as all the patients lived not far from the house of the initial patient. Some of the affected are health workers. “They were all working at a private hospital. We will check their travel history and take immediate action,” the minister said.In Delhi, health joint secretary Lav Agarwal said a 6-member expert team has been rushed to help the state. “The six-member team includes vector-borne disease experts and doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences,” he said. The virus is mostly spread by mosquitoes, though it can also be sexually transmitted, said experts. However, few people die from Zika and only one in five develops symptoms. The symptoms of the disease, first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and the first human reported from Nigeria in 1954, include joint pain, fever and headache. In May 2015, it was reported in Brazil and spread rapidly. It leads to shrunken brain in children and a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome, experts said, adding it was first reported in the country in Gujarat in 2017.Meanwhile, the state’s Covid-19 cases remain quite high. On Friday, Kerala reported 13,563 new cases of Covid-19 with a high test positivity rate of 10.4 per cent. For almost a month the state has been reporting the highest number of cases in the country. It also reported 130 deaths taking the toll to 14,380.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-alert-in-kerala-after-zika-outbreak-14-cases-confirmed-101625840431851.html

In fact, pregnant women should take vaccines for two special reasons, Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said. "The impact of Covid-19 in pregnant women is not different from that of others. But for pregnant women, Covid becomes a serious disease as the physiology of pregnant women at that point of time is different," Dr Paul explained."There might be or might not be some other pregnancy-related complications. It is the question of two lives. But it is not the only reason. There are risks of pre-term delivery too if a pregnant woman gets infected by Covid. Then it affects both the mother and the premature baby. So the vaccine has been recommended as it can prevent such complications," Dr Paul said.'We should be watchful': Govt on Covid's Lambda variant in IndiaThe ministry has recently issued a guideline allowing the vaccination of pregnant women in India. All the three vaccines available in India -- Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik -- are safe for pregnant women and they should take it, the government has said.The vaccination drive in India began in January but pregnant women were not allowed to take vaccines as the clinical trials did not include pregnant women. "We took time to recommend vaccination for pregnant women as studies were going on and now as all studies are in favour of vaccination for pregnant women, we are strongly recommending it," Dr Paul said.Pregnant women do not need to undergo any test before being vaccinated, the government said adding that the vaccine is safe for menstruating women and has no effect on the fertility of both men and women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-may-cause-pre-term-delivery-govt-on-why-pregnant-women-must-take-jabs-101625839079229.html

Karad has been junior minister the Union Finance department.Also Read: New team starts with focus on farm, healthIn an editorial published in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena said, “Bhagwat Karad has been made a minister of state. This is a move aimed at finishing off (the political career) of Pankaja Munde. Karad, who grew up in the shadow of BJP leader late Gopinath Munde, was made a minister instead of (Pankaja’s sister) Pritam Munde. There is room to doubt whether the move is aimed at creating a division in the Vanjara community (to which Munde and Karad belong) and to teach Pankaja Munde a lesson.”“All eyes were set on the expansion of the Union cabinet. This has been done before the monsoon session of Parliament. It has been carried out as if it is a panacea to problems like the crumbling economy, the health crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic, chaos in the education sector, inflation and unemployment,” the editorial further said.However, Pankaja immediately refuted Sena’s claims and said she is not upset with the BJP for not including her sister in the new team of ministers. “I was born in the Vanjara community and that doesn't mean I should be referred to as a Vanjara or OBC leader. I belong to the state. I am a woman leader and I represent the entire state. It would be wrong to portray me as a Vanjara leader," Munde told news agency PTI on Friday.While stating that she or her sister had not demanded a ministerial berth, Pankaja said this has, however, spread “negativity” among her supporters. "If there is an attempt to reduce anybody's clout, the clout in fact grows stronger. I admit my supporters are upset and there is some negativity, but my sister or I never sought ministerial positions," she told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-says-new-cabinet-move-may-end-pankaja-munde-s-career-latter-refutes-claim-101625837530456.html

Russia had sent at least 22 tonnes of medical supplies to the country when the pandemic was at its peak.“Despite several changes happening across the planet, both before and during the pandemic, our time-tested and trust-based relationship remains very strong and continues to grow. I express my appreciation for the support we received from Russia during the second wave of Covid-19. India is Russia’s partner in the production of Sputnik-V vaccine. We believe that this is not only good for both nations, but it also has positive implications for the rest of the world,” Jaishankar said while addressing a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has tied up with pharmaceutical company Dr Reddy’s to manufacture and produce the Sputnik-V vaccine in India. The RDIF has also tied up with Morepen Laboratories, Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech to produce vaccines in the country.Meanwhile, Russian military aircrafts in April delivered at least 20 oxygen production units, 75 ventilators, 150 medical monitors and 2,00,000 packs of medicine.Shortly after delivering the medical aid, Russia also sent its first shipment of Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V on May 1. It sent 1,50,000 doses on the same day India launched its vaccination drive against Covid-19 for people between 18 and 45 years of age. Russia on June 1 sent 3 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine to India.Jaishankar, who is on a trip to Russia, said both the countries share strong diplomatic, strategic, medical as well cultural ties. He also termed the relationship between the two nations as one of the ‘steadiest’ after the second World War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timetested-ties-continues-to-grow-jaishankar-thanks-russia-for-covid-19-aid-101625836758187.html

Virus will become endemic, says top ICMR official||In an indication that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may not completely go away from the country, a senior official of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Friday that the Covid-19 virus, just like influenza, will subsequently "reach its endemic stage." This means that the virus will "always be present" among a certain population or within a region.Also Read | Look at Russia, UK, Bangladesh: Government's fresh warning to revenge travellersAccording to Dr Samiran Panda, who heads ICMR's Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, once the virus reaches its endemic stage, annual vaccination may be required. "The Covid-19 virus will reach its endemic stage like influenza after a while. Then, the vulnerable population may have to get vaccinated annually," Dr Panda said. He continued, "Commonly known as flu, influenza was a pandemic 100 years ago but today it is endemic. Similarly, in the case of Covid-19, it is expected that it will gradually become endemic from its current stage of pandemic."Also Read | ‘Area of concern’: Health ministry on rise in Covid-19 cases in Kerala, MaharashtraDr Panda further recommended the elderly to take their flu shots every year. "There is no need to panic. As the influenza virus keeps on mutating, minor changes are made to the vaccine simultaneously," the ICMR official said.In the backdrop of concerns over a potential third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the top doctor urged those eligible for vaccination to take their shot from among the vaccines available in the country currently, instead of waiting for globally available shots to be cleared by the country's drug regulator. He also urged breastfeeding mothers to take an anti-Covid shot, explaining that "antibodies which develop in a mother due to the vaccine get passively transferred to the baby while breastfeeding."Also Read: 'We should be watchful': Govt on Covid's Lambda variant in IndiaThe vaccines, Dr Panda said, are "absolutely safe for everyone."India's second Covid-19 wave emerged in late February-early March and was at its peak in April and May.

All you need to know||Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have jointly developed “sensitive and cost-effective” RT-LAMP technology for rapid diagnosis of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to ICMR, no other sophisticated instruments are required for the interpretation of results. The medical research body said that the technology has been transferred to two companies for the manufacturing of RT-LAMP kits.What is RT-LAMP technology?Loop-mediated isothermal amplification, or LAMP, is an assay that can be used for viral RNA detection, and reverse-transcription LAMP, or RT-LAMP, allows for quicker analysis of genetic material than traditional PCR. RT-LAMP has been successfully used in the detection of the Sars-Cov-2, which helps fight the pandemic more effectively by detecting the virus quickly.ICMR-NIV developed sensitive and cost effective RT-LAMP technology for rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. @DeptHealthRes @icmr_niv #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/O5tlSRDBZKCovid-19 and RT-LAMPAfter the World Health Organization (WHO) urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing last year, researchers from the University of Oxford applied RT-LAMP to detect Sars-Cov-2 in 30 minutes. The researchers used a colourimetric change to report the results, which enables people to read the outcome of viral RNA amplification by the naked eye without the need for an expensive or dedicated instrument.They validated the method in a hospital in China, employing 16 clinic samples with 8 positives and 8 negatives. The Covid-19 test results were consistent with the conventional RT-PCR. The researchers also demonstrated how a one-step process without RNA extraction was feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample, paving way for a large screening at public domain and hospitals, particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areas.The speed, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of RT-LAMP make it ideal for the diagnosis of Covid-19. While the importance of RT-LAMP in the detection of Sars-Cov-2 was highlighted last year, it has been in the process of being commercialised since then. ICMR-NIV’s RT-LAMP technology could prove significant in the fight against the pandemic as the third wave of Covid-19, according to the experts, is around the corner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmrniv-develops-rt-lamp-technology-for-rapid-diagnosis-of-covid-19-all-you-need-to-know-101625835496801.html
09-07-2021||India||SC to hear Centre’s transfer plea on IT Rules next week||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the proceedings against the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 pending before various High Courts on a plea moved by the Centre to transfer these petitions to the top court.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna directed the Centre’s transfer petition to be listed on July 16 before another bench that is considering regulations to rein in over the top (OTT) platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar, etc. The 2021 IT Rules also apply to OTT platforms.On March 23 this year, a three-judge bench of the top court had stayed all High Courts from considering any fresh petitions with regard to OTT Regulations. It will be this bench that will now consider the transfer petition by the Centre with regard to petitions challenging the IT Rules 2021 on July 16.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, informed the Court that presently, petitions against the IT Rules were pending before the High Courts of Delhi, Madras, Bombay and Kerala. As per the Rules, the digital media functionaries were to appoint a Grievance Redressal Officer within three months. That period expired in May this year.Mehta stated that the Kerala High Court on Friday had ordered interim protection to the News Broadcasters Association from any coercive action for non-compliance under the IT Rules. The Delhi High Court, on the other hand, had refused protection to another set of petitioners. Mehta urged the Court to stay proceedings before various High Courts till the next date of hearing.The bench said, “Today we are simply tagging this matter with the other pending case. That matter is pending before a bench presided over by Justice DY Chandrachud. We will not issue any order except to list this petition before the appropriate bench on July 16.”The Foundation for Independent Journalism, which runs the news website ‘The Wire’ was present during the proceedings on caveat. The Foundation for Independent Journalism was the first to challenge the Rules before the Delhi High Court in March this year. Later, Quint Digital Media Limited which publishes The Quint also filed a petition and the same is pending with the Delhi High Court.Senior advocate CU Singh and advocate Liz Mathew who appeared for the petitioners before various High Courts informed the Court that the matter heard by Justice Chandrachud had nothing to do with the challenge to IT Rules 2021. “Those petitions were filed prior to the coming of the IT Rules 2021 and are on a completely different issue,” said Singh.The IT Rules 2021 were introduced in February this year. The new rules applied to digital news media platforms, social media intermediaries and OTT platforms, bringing all digital media functionaries under a three-tier oversight mechanism. This comprised of a grievance officer responsible to deal with complaints for taking down indecent content within 24 hours of a complaint. The two remaining tiers of the oversight system consisted of a self-regulatory body of experts headed by a former judge, and an inter-departmental committee headed by a senior bureaucrat of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.Besides Delhi High Court, petitions challenging the IT Rules are under consideration of the Madras High Court in a petition filed by Digital News Publishers Association among others; Kerala High Court on a petition filed by legal news website Live Law and lately the News Broadcasters Association; and the Bombay High Court on two petitions moved by a journalist and a news portal.Even the Calcutta High Court is considering the validity of the IT Rules in a PIL proceeding while a media house has gone to the Karnataka High Court challenging the Rules in question.These petitions have largely claimed that the Rules curtail and restrict the freedom of the press in India and claim the conditions imposed under the Digital Media Ethics Code and guidelines to be onerous and beyond the scope of the Information Technology Act 2000.The use of vague words such as “good taste” and “decency” in the Ethics Code are additional challenges to the Rules which, according to many of the petitioners, gave “pervasive control to the state over published content”. However, the Centre has said that the Rules are intended to provide speedy redressal of complaints to enable taking down harmful content, personally intimate pictures or videos of individuals within 24 hours. The Rules also require the media functionaries to cooperate with the Government and investigating agencies for purposes of verification of identity, detection and prevention of crimes, and investigation or prosecution of offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-centre-s-transfer-plea-on-it-rules-next-week-101625835030803.html
09-07-2021||India||Look at Russia, UK, Bangladesh: Government's fresh warning to revenge travellers||Citing the examples of the United Kingdom, Russia, Bangladesh and South Korea, the union health ministry on Friday said the second wave of the pandemic is not yet over and at the crucial juncture while the cases are mostly going down, the adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour can't be done away with. Showing the recent viral video of the Kempty Falls in Uttarakhand's Mussoorie, Agarwal said, "Is it not an open invitation for Covid-19 virus to infect us?"The sudden crowding at places of tourist importance as soon as the restrictions are being gradually withdrawn was discussed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first meeting with his council of ministers on Thursday. PM Modi said that these videos and photos should instil a sense of fear but as politicians, the ministers should not spread fear among the people. Instead, an effort to strike a balance between reopening and Covid-appropriate behaviour should be made.'We should be watchful': Govt on Covid's Lambda variant in IndiaIn Friday's press briefing, the ministry linked the recent surge of cases in other countries with the nonchalance of the people in India and said such behaviour can lead to a fresh wave as it happened in many countries."Look at the UK. During Euro 2020, there was a sharp rise in the number of infections there. And now again we are seeing that the country is moving towards a distinct peak. Not only the UK, but a resurgence is also being observed in Russia, Bangladesh, South Korea, Indonesia etc," Agarwal said.According to union health ministry data, the peak of the second wave in the United Kingdom was observed when it was reporting around 59,000 daily cases. Now, with 27,000 daily cases, the UK is moving towards another peak.In Russia, the last peak was of 28,000 daily cases and now the country is recording around 23,000 cases daily.The third wave of Bangladesh has proved to be severe than the second one as now the country is witnessing 9,000 cases per day while during the second peak, the number of 7,000.South Korea had managed the pandemic well, the union health ministry said, adding that with 900 cases daily, the country is nearing its earlier peak of 1,000 daily cases. Both Bangladesh and South Korea brought back some restrictions in the wake of the resurgence."We are only giving the virus opportunities to spread by our irresponsible behaviour. It is not yet time that we can freely mingle and mix without Covid precautions. It is not yet late to be cautious as these people will come back and there will be mixing which has to be stopped," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/look-at-russia-uk-bangladesh-government-s-fresh-warning-to-revenge-travellers-101625833639361.html

09-07-2021||India||From fame to oblivion, the story of marathon runner Budhia Singh||In 2006, at the age of four, Budhia Singh ran a gruelling 65 km distance between Puri and Bhubaneswar in a little over seven hours. He became an instant sporting phenomenon in India as people began talking about the prospect of him bringing home a medal in global sporting events. Many even said that was the next Milkha Singh.Fifteen years later, as India gears up for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics with talk about Odisha-born sprinter Dutee Chand’s medal prospects, Budhia Singh is long forgotten in mainstream discourse.In the Bharatpur slums of Bhubaneswar, where his widowed mother Sukanti and two sisters live in a cramped one-room tenement, no one has seen Budhia run in the last few years. Any enquiries about the marathon prospect are met with a dismissive nod from neighbours, while his own family would rather talk about how everyone, including the state government, “cheated” him for their own gains instead of focusing on his running prowess.Also Read | Fermented rice diet can boost immunity: AIIMS studyWhile holding up her phone displaying a recent photo of him, his older sister, Rashmi, said, “My brother is away in Delhi pursuing his graduation in arts. Since everyone from his coach Biranchi (Das) to the Odisha government exploited him, he did not want to stay in Odisha. He could have become a big marathon runner, but was just used and forgotten.”Pointing at the house, she recalls, “The government that promised that it would do everything for him could not even give him a proper house. Look at our rented home. Can a family live here?”, she asked. Rashmi and her mother Sukanti work in an engineering college in the city.Budhia had come home in May this year before leaving for Delhi in June, and is also reluctant to talk about his past. “Are you trying to talk about my past? I am not going to talk about it anymore. I have forgotten all about it,” he said, on the phone from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, refusing to share any details about his educational institution or his plans for the future.When he was born in 2002, his story would probably have ended like most slum children. After his father died, his mother Sukanti, who washed dishes in people’s homes, had allegedly sold him to a street hawker for ₹800. When Biranchi Das, then president of the Saliasahi Slumdwellers’ Association, found out about Budhia, he was livid and returned the child from the hawker by paying him ₹800. The hawker claimed that he had adopted the child. Sukanti did not deny this.It was happenstance that Das, a local judo coach, discovered Budhia’s talents when he punished him by asking him to run. When he came back after five hours, he was stunned to find him still running. This was a catapult that launched him into the game. He later made Budhia run 65 km, which helped him get into the Limca Book of Records and made him run 48 more marathons. The runs, however, came to an end after a controversy erupted over allegations that Das was exploiting the child, following which the state government put him in a sports hostel in 2007. In April 2008, Das was shot dead by two gunmen sent by a local gangster over past enmity, ending the child’s tryst with success.Also Read | From Bhima Koregaon to the death of Stan Swamy, a timeline of key eventsIn the SAI hostel of Bhubaneswar, however, Budhia did not prosper as he did not like running sprint events and lagged in other events. Often complaining about food quality and the lack of proper training, he left following a minor controversy. Odisha sports minister Tushar Kanti Behera said, “His family has cut off all relationship with the government. His mother created a controversy alleging that the state government was exploiting (the child). We don’t have any idea where he is now,” he said.In 2016, he was briefly talked about when the film "Budhia Singh-Born to Run" directed by filmmaker Soumendra Padhi and starring Manoj Bajpayee won ‘Best Children’s Film’ at the 63rd national awards. Later, in 2018, Patrick Sang, coach for fastest marathoner Eliud Kipchoge offered to guide and train him. “We could be looking at a potential athlete, depending on when he is put to test to see what distance he can do. Running at that tender age is a sign of potential,” Sang told Reuters. However, as he got older, Budhia’s running hit a dead end.Bhubaneswar-based sports journalist Sambit Mohapatra, who has tracked Budhia’s story since 2006, says the prodigy’s story is over. “We can’t compare Dutee with Budhia. While Dutee battled the adversities and was focused, Budhia did not have any focus. He could have been out in a sports hostel where young long-distance runners are nurtured. To be a medal prospect in the Olympics, one has to participate in national championships like Dutee did and then be eligible for the Olympics. Budhia did not participate in any such championships and, thus, no one knows what he could have achieved,” said Mohapatra.Rishabh Jaiswal of Sporting Ethos, a sports medicine and psychology institute in Delhi, felt that Budhia’s is a classic case of early burnout. “Budhia’s body may not have been able to take the strain of all the marathons he ran at such a young age,” he said. "When children in the age group of 11-12 years are trained hard it impacts their physical and mental health. If you are running marathons at any age you require to refuel yourself. For a child of 7 years to eat as much as they are spending becomes very difficult the moment the workload keeps on increasing. When there is a nutritional deficiency it would impact your sleep, growth and overall health."But Budhia would rather not talk about his past. “I have had enough,” he said. His family believes that he has been wronged.A Twitter page set up in Budhia’s name (@Budhiasingh_Ind) shows photos of him grown-up, running and participating in marathons. It also has a link to a fundraising page that aims to help him raise money to keep his Olympic dream alive. But so far, it has raised only ₹44,674 of the ₹1.5 million target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-fame-to-oblivion-the-story-of-marathon-runner-budhia-singh-101625833651546.html

While Kerala contributed 32% of the total Covid-19 cases logged by the country last week, Maharashtra's contribution of 21% was the second-highest," Lav Agarwal, a joint secretary at the MoHFW, said at a press conference on the current coronavirus pandemic situation in the country.Also Read | Covid-19 latest update: Maharashtra at top, Kerala sees uptick in new casesAgarwal mentioned another cause of concern with respect to the two states. "Maharashtra reported over 8,700 new cases on July 3 which declined steadily to over 6,700 on July 6. However, since then, the number of daily cases have been higher than those on July 6." On Kerala, he said, the state saw more than 12,800 infections on July 2 which fell to more than 8,300 on July 6 but on the following days, the number of new cases was higher."We're coordinating with the two state governments. Our effort is to contain the spread of the infection through intensive containment measures," Agarwal said further.On Thursday, Kerala witnessed 13,772 Covid-19 cases while the corresponding number for Maharashtra was 9,114, according to data provided by the respective state governments. Hence, together, the two states contributed 22,886 or 52.74% of the cases reported from across the country in the last 24 hours which, according to the Union health ministry's data on Friday morning, stood at 43,393.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/area-of-concern-health-ministry-on-rise-in-covid-19-cases-in-kerala-maharashtra-101625827489618.html
09-07-2021||India||'We should be watchful': Govt on Covid's Lambda variant in India||There is no case of the Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2 in India at present but the government is closely monitoring the global landscape of this new variant, which was first found in Peru and then spread to around 30 countries in the world, including many European countries. Had it entered India, it would have been detected by INSACOG (The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium of Genomics), Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said on Friday, during the press briefing of the health ministry."We should be watchful as the virus is under pressure across the world. Whenever the virus is under pressure, it picks up certain new characteristics," Dr Paul said adding that the full potential of the variant is yet to be ascertained globally as Lambda variant remains a variant of interest, as classified by the World Health Organization.No case of lambda Covid-19 variant detected in India so far"Lambda is the 7th variant of interest, which was notified by the World Health Organization on June 14. This variant is predominant in Peru and was first reported in Peru. Our INSACOG is monitoring the situation," joint secretary of the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said.Lambda variant elsewhere in the worldFirst reported from Peru, this variant is now responsible for nearly 82 per cent of the Covid-19 cases in Peru. The health ministry of Malaysia said this variant is proving to be deadlier than Delta -- the variant which is driving the ongoing wave of the pandemic across the world and was responsible for India's 2nd wave.In the United Kingdom too, Lambda has been detected.In the latest development, Lambda has been detected in Canada which said that there are at least 11 cases of this variant in the country, though the actual spread of the variant is not known.Kappa variant in IndiaThe health ministry also commented on the reports of Kappa variant cases in Uttar Pradesh and said that the variant of interest is not new in India. It was detected at the same time when the Delta variant was reported. But in the course of time, Kappa got overshadowed by Delta. "If cases are detected, this means that the variant has stayed in the country. Delta is a related variant of Kappa. Kappa is much less in its intensity. There are many variants in the country. Not all cases are of Delta variant. Our watch will continue," Dr VK Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-should-be-watchful-govt-on-covid-s-lambda-variant-in-india-101625830825050.html

The US narrative that CBGs can be targeted by long-distance ballistic missiles comes from a position of strength, where the US Navy has no less than 11 super carriers at its disposal,” said a former Indian Navy admiral.The PLA’s type 003 carrier is expected to be more than 85000 tonnes with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), which will allow the ship to launch aircraft with more fuel and weapons as well as airborne radars, anti-submarine warfare and aerial refuellers from the floating deck. This means that the range and strike of the aircraft carrier will increase manifolds. None of the Indian carriers has catapult aircraft launch system.“In the Indian context, the Chinese carrier is a potent weapon and has to be treated as such. The security of IOR will be affected if two Chinese carriers come into the area. We must remember that the Chinese are using the US playbook in almost all their force application paradigms … like the US carrier in Taiwan straits… what prevents that Chinese carrier in future from carrying out a freedom of navigation operations in Andaman Seas!, ” said a naval operations expert.While India has developed a new intermediate-range ballistic missile Agni-Prime with the wartime objective of targeting CBGs, the PLA with four aircraft carriers by 2025 will more than a match for INS Vikramaditya (presently under maintenance) and INS Vikrant, which will be commissioned by August 2022. Under the circumstances, India has no options but to build its nuclear-powered attack submarines to deter the Chinese flotilla and have one aircraft carrier operational at all times as air power at sea is an operational necessity and cannot be provided by the land-based air force. Without a protective aerial bubble, the CNG is not only exposed to incoming missiles but also to enemy aircraft.“Carriers are being looked at purely from a force on force perspective. Questions are being asked why should we not build submarines to counter the Chinese carrier groups. That is true, but then our own carrier can threaten something else and balance the operational equation. Why do we assume that one carrier needs to go into battle with only another carrier? CBGs are flexible and have a range of operations - other than addressing the enemy carrier. That must settle the Carrier or Submarine debate as both are required for protecting the IOR,” an admiral said.While many within the Indian national security set-up believe that an aircraft carrier is a World War II weapon and the era of stand-off weapon systems has dawned, the Chinese investment in building more such platforms clearly shows that the Indian Navy has a legitimate case for a third aircraft carrier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-latest-type-003-aircraft-carrier-is-a-threat-to-indopacific-101625826966663.html

09-07-2021||India||PM reviews oxygen availability as govt looks to set up 1,500 PSA plants||The Centre is setting up at least 1,500 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants across the country to support more than 400,000 oxygenated beds, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was informed on Friday in a meeting to review oxygen augmentation and availability as India prepares for a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections.Modi asked officials at the meeting to ensure the plants are made functional at the earliest and work closely with state governments, said a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office.These plants include those being financed by the PM CARES fund as well as from various ministries and government firms,the statement added.“The PM asked officials to ensure there is adequate training of hospital staff on operation and maintenance of oxygen plants... to ensure that each district has trained personnel available,’’ the statement said.Principal secretary PK Mishra and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba were among top officials who attended the meeting.Officials familiar with developments said each plant has a daily capacity of 1.5-2 MT of oxygen. A standard hospital needs 15MT of oxygen daily in usual circumstances. A training module is being prepared by experts and they are aiming to train around 8,000 people across the country to operate the oxygen plants, the official added. During the second wave of infections this summer, India faced a debilitating shortage of medical oxygen as demand shot up from 4,000 MT to more than 10,000 MT due to a surge in infections and deaths. Unable to meet demand, many hospitals ran out of oxygen, leaving hundreds of patients gasping for breath. In response, the government banned industrial use of oxygen, airlifted oxygen trucks from industrial plants and ran oxygen trains but experts stressed on the importance of augmenting supply to avert any future crisis. The issue was taken up by high courts and the Supreme Court with daily monitoring of supply after a number of hospitals approached the courts in distress. According to the PMO statement, the PM also urged officials to ensure India uses advanced technology Internet of Things (IoT) “to track performance and functioning of these oxygen plants at a local and national level”. IoT is a system of internet-connected devices embedded with sensors that can collect and transfer data over a wireless network for computation and research purposes.“A pilot (is) being done using IoT for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants,” officials told the PM, according to the statement.The decision came a day after the Union Cabinet announced a ₹23,123 crore package to augment grassroots health infrastructure and set up an emergency response system in preparation for a third wave. The ‘India Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package: Phase-II’ will be implemented across 736 districts to improve medical infrastructure at primary and district health centres. Projects under the plan will be implemented within nine months. The Centre will provide ₹15,000 crore and states ₹8,123 crore in the package.The Prime Minister’s meeting was followed by the commerce minister Piyush Goyal holding a meeting in the evening with oxygen manufacturers, where he focussed on three aspects of oxygen supply. The minister asked how production of oxygen could be increased, how it could be stored and finally, how to increase transportation abilities of liquid oxygen, said a person familiar with the development.“RIL Jamnagar has been very efficient in converting gaseous oxygen into liquid but they are unable to increase storage. So, the minister asked if their strategy could be replicated by other manufacturers and how could they ramp up storage,’’ said the person quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-progress-of-oxygen-augmentation-availability-101625825730354.html

He joined BJP in March 2020 and is a Rajya Sabha member.General V K Singh also took charge as the Minister of State for Civil Aviation.Scindia has taken over the charge of the ministry at a time when the civil aviation sector is facing strong headwinds due to the coronavirus pandemic which has impacted overall demand and has also resulted in financial woes for the industry players.The government is also moving ahead with the disinvestment process for the national carrier Air India.Scindia has served as a Minister of State for Communications, Commerce and Industry and power during the Congress-led UPA government. The scion of the former royal family of Gwalior was inducted into the UPA government in 2007 and remained a part of the Union Cabinet till 2014.He resigned from Congress and joined BJP in March 2020.

All you need to know||Uttar Pradesh has reported two cases of the Kappa variant of Covid-19, which has been confirmed by the King Geroge's Medical College where the genome sequencing of 109 samples took place. Out of these 109 samples, 107 Delta variant cases have been found. Some reports claimed that there have been three cases of Kappa variant in Uttar Pradesh and the first patient, a 66-year-old resident of Sant Kabir Nagar, has succumbed to the disease.According to the Union health ministry's June data, there were 3,969 Alpha, 149 Beta, 1 Gamma, and 16,238 Delta and Kappa variant cases in India. The B.1.617 lineage was first observed in Maharashtra and was "associated with an unusual rise in several districts of the state", the ministry had said about the lineage, not specifying Delta or Kappa. On Friday, Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said the Kappa variant in India got overshadowed by Delta. Not all cases in India are of Delta variant and Kappa has been there for quite some time. What is Kappa? Is it a new variant?This is not a new variant. According to the World Health Organizations's site on tracking SARS-Cov-2, the Kappa variant was first detected in India in October 2020. The variant is identified as B.1.617.1, while Delta is represented as B.1.617.2.Also Read: Lambda variant | All you need to know about fast-spreading strainIs it a variant of concern?WHO at present has not classified this variant as a variant of concern. Like Lambda, which has already spread in 30 countries across the world, Kappa is a variant of interest.Is it a double mutant?Yes, like Delta, Kappa is referred to as a double mutant because of two mutations -- EE484Q and L452R.Is this variant immune escape?It is believed that the L452R mutation may help the variant to escape the body's natural immune response. But since it is a variant of interest, its full potential remains to be explored.Are these the first Kappa cases in India?No, as the Kappa variant was found in India in October 2020, it is evident that these are not the first instances of the variant. This variant has been found in many states.Difference between Delta and KappaBoth the variants, belonging to the same lineage of B.1.617, have been found first in India in October 2020. Delta, which was a variant of interest in April 2021, became a variant of concern in May 2021. Kappa on the other hand remained a variant of interest, as designated last on April 4. Delta has emerged as a threat across the world as most of the present Covid-19 cases in the world are that of Delta variant. The second wave of the pandemic in India was also because of the dominance of the Delta variant. A further mutation of Delta called Delta Plus has now emerged in many countries, including India. Kappa is not as intense and Delta is in its effect and hence it got overwhelmed by the Delta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-covid-s-kappa-variant-found-in-uttar-pradesh-all-you-need-to-know-101625823940538.html

The high court said it was concerned that every "Tom, Dick and Harry" was collecting funds via crowdfunding for treatment of the children suffering from rare diseases and asked the state government whether it has any control over such transactions. Justice P B Suresh Kumar said the court does not want to interdict the crowdfunding process, but it wants the funds to go to the government instead into the account of some private individuals who may or may not give it to those who require the money. "I do not want every Tom, Dick and Harry to collect money. Is there any state control over this collection of funds via crowdfunding? We should know where the money is going," the court said and added that if private individuals and entities can collect crores of rupees in a short span of time, why the government cannot? "For providing free vaccines the state government could collect only ₹68 lakh, while 18 crores was collected in a week (for treatment of a boy suffering from spinal muscular atrophy)," the court said. "I do not want to interdict the process of crowdfunding, but I want government control over it," Justice Kumar said during the hearing of an autorickshaw driver's plea seeking free treatment for his six-month old infant son who is suffering from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as the medicine for it costs around ₹18 crore and he has no means to raise that kind of money. In his petition, filed through advocate P Chandrasekhar, the father - Arif - has said that while he obtained permission for importing the required medicine - Zolgensma Onasemnogene injection - he cannot afford to buy even one dose as the same costs ₹18 crore. During the hearing, the Kerala government also expressed apprehensions regarding the source of the money being collected via crowdfunding. The court also observed during the hearing that such transactions if left unsupervised could destabilize the economy. It has on its own also impleaded the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the matter. The court said it would be passing a detailed order in the matter. Arif has moved the court, claiming that he cannot ensure his son's treatment without the support of the state government. The government, in a statement filed in court earlier, had said that neither the Health Department nor the Kerala Social Security Mission (KSSM) was in a position to extend financial support for bearing the huge cost of the treatment/medicine required by Arif's son, who has been admitted in the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and is on ventilator support. The government had also said that according to the National Rare Disease Policy,2021 of the Union Health Ministry Ministry, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is categorised in Group 3, for which the cost of treatment is very high, and it recommends a digital crowd funding platform be leveraged for mobilizing the necessary funds. It had further said that there are around 102 patients in the state suffering from SMA, a rare genetic disorder, of whom 42 have received the treatment under the compassionate use programme extended by pharmaceutical companies. The state also said that the funds it has, Including those under We Care scheme, are not even sufficient to meet the needs of various health schemes of the KSSM, which provides assistance to the elderly, cancer patients below 18 years of age and minors requiring emergency treatment for various other ailments like heart disease. "In these circumstances, it is humbly submitted that the Health department and KSSM is not in a position to extend financial support for bearing the huge expenditure of SMA," the state had said in its statement and sought dismissal of the the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-want-tom-dick-and-harry-to-collect-money-bombay-hc-on-crowdfunding-for-treatment-of-rare-diseases-101625821040180.html

In March 2021 too, she complained of a breathing problem and had to be airlifted from Bhopal to Mumbai for treatment. But now, the BJP MP seems to be in the pink of her health as videos of her taking part in several physical activities are going viral. Madhya Pradesh Congress leader Narendra Saluja posted both the videos on Twitter and sad whenever he sees sister Pragya playing basketball, walking steadily and dancing -- without any assistance, he feels delighted. And then he puts a question mark.हमारी भोपाल की सांसद बहन प्रज्ञा ठाकुर को जब भी बास्केट बॉल खेलते हुए , बग़ैर सहारे के चलते हुए या इस तरह ख़ुशी से झूमते हुए देखते है तो बड़ी ख़ुशी होती है…? pic.twitter.com/MR01GumnunThe dance video is from July 7 as the MP took part in a pre-wedding ceremony which was held at her residence in Bhopal. Reports said Pragya Thakur is the guardian of these two sisters -- Chanchal and Sandhya -- whom she married off on Wednesday at her residence. The MP has also been quoted as saying that she considers these two girls as her daughters and will continue to be the guardian of the couples.The father of these two sisters had approached the MP for their wedding as he was going through financial constraints because of the lockdown. It was reported that the MP did not only bear the expenses of the wedding but allowed her bungalow to be the venue for the grand reception that was organised. She was also present at all rituals and the video of her dancing was shot at one of those.A few days ago, Sadhvi Pragya was seen playing basketball as she attended an event at Bhopal stadium. Posting that video, Saluja had written, "Have seen Bhopal BJP MP Sadhvi Thakur on a wheelchair till now, but today felt great happiness after seeing her trying a hand at basketball in Bhopal stadium. So far, we knew that owing to some injury, she could not stand and walk properly. May God keep her healthy always."The sarcasm doesn't fail to hit home as Pragya Thakur claimed to have serious injuries because of alleged custodial torture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-playing-basketball-pragya-thakur-now-dances-and-congress-is-delighted-101625820770002.html

The restrictions will be imposed on the entire route of the procession from early morning till afternoon, the home minister said.The state government also restricted the number of vehicles to be allowed for the procession. "Only three chariots and two other vehicles will be allowed to carry out the Yatra," he also said after the meeting.No other vehicle or singing troupes, akhadas, elephants or decorated trucks will be permitted to take part in the procession. "We appeal to the people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and adhere to the protocols," the state home minister urged the citizens.Last year as well, only a symbolic Rath Yatra was organised in the premises of the Lord Jagannath temple in the Jamalpur area after the Gujarat high court denied permission for the usual public procession due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation.In the pre-Covid times, grand procession used to be held with lakhs of devotees taking part in the Yatra. Traditionally, it is led by the chariots of Lord Jagannath and begins at around 7am from the 400-year-old temple. It covers a distance of 19km and concludes at the temple by late evening.The procession also stops at Saraspur for an hour-long lunch break, which is also to be skipped this year.The procession used to involve decorated elephants and tableaux moving around in at least 100 trucks. This year it is expected to be done within a few hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curfew-cap-on-vehicles-gujarat-govt-announces-guidelines-for-rath-yatra-101625819672638.html

The daily number of cases have been increasing since the past few days. On June 24, the seven-day-average of daily cases in India was 53,123 and on July 7 it declined to 42,547; however, on July 9 India reported 43,393, recording an increase.Besides the slight growth in the single-day cases, another worrying trend could be noticed in the nature of the infection curve, which changed about a month ago, as new cases started declining at a much slower rate. The seven-day average of new cases, which was declining at the rate of 6.7% on June 2, have started to go down at a much slower pace now, declining at the rate 0.96% on July 7. The rate of decline of active cases has similarly decreased from 5.23% on June 9 to 1.8% on July 7.Similar patterns are being repeated in states like Kerala, which saw daily infections rise by 2,216 cases.

The association, which represents 25 news and current affairs broadcasters, challenged the rules on Thursday, saying they give government authorities “excessive powers” to “unreasonably and impermissibly restrict” the media’s freedom of speech and expression.Justice PB Suresh Kumar, who granted interim relief to NBA members, also issued notice to the Union government for its stand on the petition. NBA said the rules seek to create an “oversight mechanism giving the executive unfettered, unbridled and excessive powers to regulate the content of digital news media”.During Friday’s hearing, senior lawyer Maninder Singh, appearing for the NBA, drew the court’s attention to the high court’s decision to grant protection against coercive action in March to legal news portal Live Law and sought a similar shield for the news broadcasters.The NBA’s challenge is essentially focussed on Part 3 of the new IT rules that relate to digital news media and requires publishers to establish a grievance procedure, a self-regulatory body, and adhere to the code of ethics, according to news agency PTI. The self-regulatory bodies to be formed by media companies or their associations have to be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, high courts or an eminent person.Maninder Singh argued that a joint secretary-rank official would be heading the oversight mechanism at the ministry, which would supervise the self-regulatory body headed by a retired judge.Since a joint secretary-rank official will head the oversight mechanism which would supervise the self-regulatory body headed by a retired judge, Maninder Singh argued that this would imply that the joint secretary will supervise orders of a retired judge.“The grievance redressal mechanism created and the powers delegated have a ‘chilling effect” on the content of the media,” NBA’s petition said, contending that the rules exceeded the authority granted under the Information Technology Act and violate the constitutional rights of equality before law and freedom to practise any profession.The rules, which apply to digital news media platforms, social media intermediaries and OTT platforms, were notified by the Centre on February 25 and came into effect on May 25.It has, however, led to a storm over compliance. Petitions against the rules have been filed in several high courts including Delhi, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Kerala, prompting the Centre to approach the Supreme Court to request that the top court transfer all these cases to itself.These rules also require digital companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Instant messaging WhatsApp has approached the Delhi high court over the provision that obligates social media intermediaries to identify the first originator of a message.The Centre has argued the rules are intended to provide speedy redressal of bringing down harmful content and allows users to demand the removal of personally intimate pictures or videos within 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-grants-interim-relief-to-nba-in-plea-challenging-new-it-rules-101625818709993.html

A scramble for government beds, medical oxygen, ventilators, and other pieces of equipment across the country was reported, even while the death toll and infections continued to rise exponentially.The Prime Minister instructed officials to ensure that these plants are made functional at the earliest. He said that the central government officials should work closely with the state governments for the same and ensure that there is adequate training of hospital staff on the operation and maintenance of oxygen plants. Officers told the Prime Minister that they are in regular contact with officers from the state governments regarding the fast-tracking of the oxygen plants.Prime Minister Modi also directed officials to ensure that each district has trained personnel available. The government should focus on deploying advanced technology like IoT to track the performance and functioning of these oxygen plants at a local and national level, he said. The officials briefed him regarding a training module prepared by experts, which is aimed at the training of around 8,000 people across the country. A pilot is also being done for using IoT for monitoring the performance of the oxygen plants, they said.This is the Prime Minister's first such high-level Covid-19 meet after a reshuffle in his council of ministers earlier this week. The new Union health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, took charge of his ministry on Thursday replacing Dr. Harsh Vardhan on the post, who resigned in the middle of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-high-level-meet-pm-says-oxygen-plants-should-be-functional-at-the-earliest-101625816920029.html

Airlines have been seeking government stimulus since last year to tide over the losses. The aviation industry has also demanded lowering of the Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) taxation for years. It has sought the inclusion of ATF under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime as tax uniformity would lead to cost reduction.Also Read | Modi’s new Cabinet: Blend of youth, skills, social engineeringAirlines in India are estimated to post a consolidated loss of $4.1 billion this fiscal--similar to what they are estimated to have incurred in 2020-21, CAPA noted in a report released last month. Full-service carrier Air India and no-frills player IndiGo are projected to represent around $ 4.5 billion of the combined around $ 8 billion of losses, CAPA said.Kapil Kaul, the CAPA head, said the Indian aviation sector is critically placed due to back-to-back Covid impacts. He added most of the players have serious solvency risks. “The industry needs billions of dollars of solvent recapitalisation. The new minister must immediately reduce the excise duty of ATF, bring ATF under GST and provide full input credit to IGST on aircraft repairs and try to amend the AERA Act to increase the control period from 5-8 years,” he said, referring to the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority Of India Act, 2008.“And simultaneously undertake a deep and thorough review of the sector and break all the regulatory/policy and fiscal barriers to allow aviation to realise its true economic potential... I expect the new minister to address all the structural issues,” said Kaul.The divestment of national carrier Air India has also been pending. To be sure, the divestment comes under the Union finance ministry’s department of investment and public asset management.Mark D Martin, MRAeS, Martin Consulting, said, “Mr Scindia has aviation in his DNA. His father was the architect of the open sky policy and airlines like Jet and Sahara and SpiceJet were all a product of that.” Martin said Scindia clearly understands aviation. “He knows where to pick up the pieces from and move on. This is his dream shot to carry forward his father’s legacy and... rationalise and make aviation radical to what his father did back in 1991, but he has a lot of challenges ahead. Among the challenges are the Pawan Hans and Air India divestment, the revamp of the DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) into a more powerful organisation… Aggressively modernising airports that are up ahead. And he has only three years to make all this happen. Only time will tell. I hope he lives up to his father’s legacy and transforms civil aviation.”The aviation ministry also has the key role of boosting the Centre’s regional connectivity scheme and leasing out airports under the Public-Private Partnership model. Both of these have slowed down during the pandemic.The Association of Private Airport Operators last month said they “are not generating sufficient cash flows to sustain operations and meet debt obligations.” Their downgraded credit ratings “have made it impossible to take further financing support from financial institutions.” The operators sought urgent relief from the government to sustain their operations and save jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/challenges-ahead-for-jyotiraditya-scindia-the-new-civil-aviation-minister-101625817749920.html

It also informed the court the new policy has been put on hold and will be implemented "if Parliament allows it," according to a PTI report. Until then, it will not limit the functionality of its platform to users who choose not to opt for the new privacy policy, the platform said.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp against a single-judge order refusing to stay an order of competition regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) directing a probe into WhatsApp's new privacy policy."We voluntarily agreed to put it (the policy) on hold... we will not compel people to accept it," advocate Harish Salve appearing on the behalf of WhatsApp. It would, however. continue to display the update to its users, Salve further said, according to the PTI report.Later in the day, WhatsApp also released a statement, assuring users about the privacy concerns and said the recent update "does not change the privacy of people’s personal messages." "Its purpose is to provide additional information about how people can interact with businesses if they choose to do so," it said in the statement, a copy of which is with HT."We will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works in the coming weeks. Instead, we will continue to remind users from time to time about the update as well as when people choose to use relevant optional features, like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook," the spokesperson said.The spokesperson also said the company hopes this "approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business. We will maintain this approach until at least the forthcoming PDP law comes into effect.""We reiterate that the privacy of users remains our highest priority," it said.In January this year, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy, which allows the instant messaging service to share data about users' interactions with business accounts with its parent company Facebook.The move sparked major privacy concerns among users as well as outrage after WhatsApp announced it would limit the functionality of its platform in case users choose not to accept the conditions. Following criticisms, the platform pushed back the roll-out of the policy but again said in February that it will go ahead with its decision. This came despite the Indian government urging the company to abandon its plans.The Centre cited the rules in the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, to contend that the updated privacy policy fails to specify the types of “sensitive personal” data being collected, and with whom the information was being shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-won-t-compel-users-to-accept-privacy-policy-advocate-harish-salve-tells-delhi-hc-101625816882664.html

The court noted that the modern Indian society is gradually becoming "homogeneous", dissipating 'traditional barriers' of religion, community, and caste, and in view of these changing paradigms, a uniform civil code is in order.The judgment was passed by Justice Prathiba M Singh on July 7 on a plea involving the applicability of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in respect of parties belonging to the Meena community.While going over the case, Justice Singh observed that courts have been repeatedly confronted with the conflicts that arise in personal laws. People belonging to various communities, castes, and religions, who forge marital bonds, struggle with such conflicts, she observed.Also Read | Has the Supreme Court set the ball rolling for a Uniform Civil Code?"The youth of India belonging to various communities, tribes, castes, or religions who solemnise their marriages ought not to be forced to struggle with issues arising due to conflicts in various personal laws," Justice Singh said, adding, "especially in relation to marriage and divorce."The Delhi high court judge said that a Uniform Civil Code in India, as envisioned under Article 44 of the Constitution, has been "reiterated from time to time" by the Supreme Court. Such a civil code would be "common to all", the court said, and would enable uniform principles to be applied in matters of marriage, divorce, and succession. This will reduce conflicts and contradictions within the society that arise from various personal laws, the court observed.The Supreme Court had in March last year sought a reply from the Centre over religion-neutral inheritance and succession laws in India. A lawyer at the top court and a member of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), Ashwini Upadhyay, succeeded in getting five such petitions admitted by the apex court, a development that could be seen as a precursor to the Uniform Civil Code in the country.The UCC essentially refers to a common set of laws governing personal matters such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession for all citizens of the country, irrespective of religion. Currently, different laws regulate these aspects for adherents of different religions and a UCC is meant to do away with these inconsistent personal laws.These laws include the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Indian Christian Marriages Act, Indian Divorce Act, Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act. However, Muslim personal laws are not codified and are based on their religious texts, though certain aspects of these are expressly recognised through laws such as the Shariat Application Act and Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-backs-uniform-civil-code-asks-centre-to-take-necessary-steps-101625812927126.html

It is learnt from media reports that the Union Government had waived off taxes in a similar case of a 5 month old child who is suffering from SMA in Mumbai,” he wrote.Muhammad, whose 15-year-old sister also suffers from SMA, will have to be administered the medicine before he attains the age of two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pinarayi-vijayan-urges-pm-modi-to-waive-off-tax-on-life-saving-drug-for-infant-101625814124232.html

Speaking at the United Nations's high-level political forum (HLPF) on the issue, India also noted that the countries should experience and learn from each other to implement the 2030 Agenda.The comments were made by India’s Permanent Representative the United Nations TS Tirumurti. "How can localisation of SDGs contribute to leaving no one behind?" asked Tirumurti and said, the global Covid-19 pandemic is threatening to disrupt the "decade of action"."It goes without saying that we need to work together collectively to ensure that all countries, especially the vulnerable ones, stay their course on the 2030 SDG Agenda," he further said.The 2030 SDG Agenda is the global effort to mobilise actions and commitments to achieve clean, affordable energy for all by 2030.Tirumurti added that he is convinced "due to the localisation efforts we are undertaking, our path to implementing the 2030 Agenda will be relatively smooth even in the face of the pandemic."The diplomat further said that breaking down goals and implementation to sub-national and local levels is the only way to succeed in achieving SDG targets. "Localisation also allows developing local solutions to local challenges by empowering provincial and local levels of government," the Indian envoy also said at the forum.Speaking on the same, Tirumurti also gave an example of successful implementation of localisation of SDGs as he highlighted India's aspirational districts programme which focuses on more than 100 developmentally challenged districts across five sectors such as health, education, agriculture, infrastructure, and skill development.The programme involves real-time monitoring of 49 indicators across the five focus areas on the 'champions of change' dashboard, with a monthly ranking of the best-performing districts. It has also strengthened the technical and administrative capacities of the districts through collaboration with development partners for providing technical expertise and skills training.UNDP's appraisal report released in June this year pointed out that the programme is a very successful global model of "local area development" by leveraging local structures of governance with multi-stakeholder partnerships, to ensure that localisation of the SDGs becomes a reality.(With inputs from ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-size-fits-all-approach-for-localisation-of-sdgs-india-at-un-101625802791716.html

09-07-2021||India||SC grants bail to 13 juveniles lodged at Agra jail for over 14 years||The Supreme Court on Thursday granted bail to 13 prisoners lodged at Agra Central Jail who spent 14-22 years in jail despite being juveniles at the time of committing the crimes.The 13 convicts approached the Supreme Court last month, claiming their detention to be “illegal” as there were clear orders passed by the Juvenile Justice Board with regard to each of them at various intervals between February 2017 and March 2021, declaring them to be juvenile at the time they had committed the crime.A bench of justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian released the 13 convicts on interim bail, subject to furnishing personal bonds. It also gave the state two weeks’ time to verify the facts about their continued stay in jail despite an order establishing their juvenility.Uttar Pradesh’s additional advocate general Garima Parshad sought time to verify details about the 13 petitioners. However, the state did not object to the grant of interim bail.The 13 prisoners had stated in their petition that their continued detention in jail along with hardened criminals violated the spirit and purpose of the Juvenile Justice Act 2000 which requires juvenile offenders to be tried separately. Had the Juvenile Boards tried these cases, the accused would have secured a maximum punishment of 3 years’ stay at an observation home.Arguing the petition, advocate Rishi Malhotra said the case exposed the unfortunate and sorry state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh. According to him, there are similar persons who were juveniles at the time of committing the crime and languish behind bars for years together.This fact came to light in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) proceeding pending before the Allahabad high court in 2012 where it was said that a significant number of prisoners lodged in UP jails were below 18 years of age at the time of commission of crime. The high court called for a report from director general (prisons) who confirmed this fact. In May 2012, the HC ordered an inquiry by Juvenile Justice Boards which resulted in orders being passed in the case of the 13 petitioners.The petition said, “There is a clear infringement and violation of the fundamental right of the petitioners envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution in as much as though the petitioners having judgments declaring them as juveniles are actually undergoing illegal detentions as on date and pray inter alia from the apex constitutional court to pass necessary orders of releasing them forthwith.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-bail-to-13-juveniles-lodged-at-agra-jail-for-over-14-years-101625801309377.html

These winds are likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10.Accordingly, southwest monsoon is likely to advance over remaining parts of west Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi around July 10.A low pressure area is likely to form over westcentral and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts around July 11.Under the influence of these conditions, scattered to widespread rainfall very likely over northwest India from July 9 onwards and isolated heavy rainfall is also very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad , Punjab on July 11 and 12; Uttarakhand & West Uttar Pradesh during July 8 to 12; Himachal Pradesh, east Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi during July 12.Isolated very heavy rainfall is also very likely over Uttarakhand on July 11 and 12. Scattered to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls very likely over Central India (Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and Odisha) during the next five days.Due to strengthening of monsoon winds over Arabian Sea and likely formation of a low pressure area over westcentral, and adjoining Northwest Bay of Bengal around July 11, enhanced rainfall activity very likely along the west and east coasts likely to continue during the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-starts-reviving-onset-likely-over-delhi-tomorrow-101625800589238.html
09-07-2021||India||Covaxin to get WHO nod soon? Chief scientist says Covid-19 vaccine trial data 'looks good'||In what potentially comes as a piece of good news for Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech, the World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that it might just provide its much-awaited approval to Covaxin, the company's indigenous jab against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist at WHO, told a Mumbai-based news organisation that the final phase trial data for Covaxin “looks good” and meets the safety profile of the international public health agency so far.Also Read | Covaxin booster dose: What is it? What does govt say about this?The pre-submission meeting between Bharat Biotech and WHO was held on June 23, Swaminathan told CNBC TV-18 in an interview, adding that the data packet is currently being assembled. She noted that although Covaxin's efficacy against the Delta variant of Covid-19 is a bit low, it is still not bad, while the overall efficacy is "quite high."Bharat Biotech finally made public its findings from the Phase-3 efficacy analysis of Covaxin last Saturday, where it claimed an overall efficacy of 77.8% against symptomatic Covid-19 patients. The pre-print data from "India's largest efficacy trial" showed that Covaxin demonstrates 93.4% effectiveness against severe symptomatic Covid-19 cases. On the other hand, Covaxin provides 65.2% protection against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) strain, currently the most predominant Covid-19 variant in India, it said.The World Health Organization keeps a close watch on all the vaccines which are on the pipeline for emergency listing, Swaminathan said, adding that the agency is awaiting more data for a final say on the matter.Speaking on the Covid-19 situation in India, the WHO chief scientist said that the government should focus on primary immunisation of at least 60-70% of its population. The focus should not be on booster shots but on broadening the scope of primary vaccination, she said. Only after a sizeable population has been vaccinated can India draw inspiration from countries like the United Kingdom, which have moved on to focusing on booster doses.Most of the world, except some districts in the United States, has recently seen a spurt in Covid-19 cases while there has been no reduction in the death toll, Swaminathan noted.Notably, Bharat Biotech's Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin has till now not found a place in the World Health Organization's emergency-use listing (EUL) of vaccines. The lack of endorsement from WHO has been hampering travel plans for individuals as many countries are only accepting vaccines approved by the public health body.Covaxin is one of the three vaccines which are currently being used in India for inoculation of people against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The vaccine is developed by Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Serum Institute of India's Covishield and Russia's Sputnik V are the other two vaccines that have been administered to Indian citizens so far. Moderna's Covid-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine is expected to reach India this week, reported news agencies. However, discussions are still going on over indemnity waivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-to-get-who-nod-soon-chief-scientist-says-covid-19-vaccine-trial-data-looks-good-101625796269980.html

The matter was earlier adjourned till July 9 by the Rouse Avenue district court in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, as the court was only hearing 'urgent' matters.The case relates to irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds to the tune of ₹305 crore in 2007, at a time when P Chidambaram served as the Union minister of finance in the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case on May 15, 2017, and the former finance minister was arrested two years later, on August 21, 2019. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) also arrested P Chidambaram on October 16, later that year, in the related money-laundering case.However, the Congress leader was granted bail in the CBI case six days later on October 22 while in the ED case, he got bail on December 4, 2019. Following the clearance of his bail application by the Supreme Court, he was released from the Tihar Jail a day later, on December 5.Both P Chidambaram and his son Karti, who was also arrested in the matter in 2018 and later granted bail, were summoned by the Delhi court on April 7 this year, after it took cognisance of the ED chargesheet in connection to their alleged role in the INX Media money laundering case.The chargesheet by the ED was filed under section 3 (money laundering) read with section 70 (offenses by companies), which is punishable under section 4 (punishment) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chidambaram-likely-to-face-court-hearing-today-in-inx-media-case-101625793417887.html

"Saddened by the assassination of President Jovenel Moise and the attack on First Lady Martine Moise of Haiti. My condolences to the family of President Moise and the people of Haiti," PM Modi posted on Twitter.PM Modi also tagged the interim Prime Minister of Haiti Claude Joseph in his tweet.Moise was assassinated at his private residence by a group of unnamed gunmen on Wednesday. After the assassination, Haiti declared a state of emergency of 15 days and launched a manhunt to nab the killers.As of Friday morning, the police have arrested at least 28 people, out of which two are of American origin. Twenty-six others are Colombians, national police director-general Leon Charles said at a news conference."We will strengthen our investigation and search techniques to intercept the other eight mercenaries," Charles also said in the briefing.On Thursday, police also tracked down a house of suspected assassins near the scene of the crime at Petionville in Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, where Moise was staying with his wife.Officials in mostly French and Creole-speaking Haiti had also said that the assassins appeared to have spoken in English and Spanish.The police are also working to ascertain the motive of the killing. Moise took office in 2017, since then he has faced mass protests against his rule - first over corruption allegations and his management of the economy, then over his increasing grip on power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-sends-condolences-to-haiti-over-assassination-of-president-jovenel-moise-101625794070834.html
09-07-2021||India||Mumbai, Hyderabad airports prepare for resumption of UAE flights: Report||Ahead of resuming flight services to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), airports in India are preparing contingency measures to cut the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in their premises, reports said, adding that a rush of passengers headed for Dubai and other parts of the Gulf nation is to be expected once the flights become operation. According to a report by Gulf News, the international airports at Mumbai and Hyderabad are gearing up for the UAE flight services, equipped with rapid PCR and lab testing.Flights to Dubai were set to resume on June 23 but were later rescheduled owing to the coronavirus disease situation. The UAE first suspended air travel to and from India in April as the latter battled a devastating second wave of Covid-19; the ban was later extended till July 6. According to the latest updates, flights from India to Dubai and Abu Dhabi are set to resume on July 15 and July 21.The Mumbai airport is keeping its premises sanitised at all times and has also instituted a rapid PCR-testing facility, that provides results in just 13 minutes, reported Gulf News, citing an unnamed official of the Mumbai International Airport (MIA) familiar with the development. “We also have a lab right inside the airport to help the passengers get the report at the earliest,” the report quoted the official as saying. “We already have the facilities at the departures as well as the arrivals and we have ample counters to meet requirements,” the airport official was quoted.On the other hand, the Hyderabad airport, too, has partnered up with Mapmygenome, a Covid-19 testing lab certified by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), the report said, adding that the coronavirus testing facility at the Hyderabad airport will operate 24 hours a day all seven days of the week.There is no clarity yet on whether the India-UAE travel channel will once again be pushed back, the report mentioned, citing the airport spokesperson, who said that the reopening of the airline travel route will depend on timely clearance provided by the UAE government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-hyderabad-airports-decked-up-ahead-of-restarting-uae-flights-report-101625788330114.html
09-07-2021||India||Second Covid-19 wave lingering, or early signs of 3rd?||India faced a severe second wave of Covid-19 infections starting February. The seven-day average of daily new infections rose 36 times between February 11 and May 9, which is when the second wave peaked. Daily new cases have since fallen sharply, but the latest statistics underline the need for caution. This is all the more important given the anecdotal accounts of Covid-inappropriate behaviour from many places, especially tourist destinations. Here are four charts that explain this.1. New infections are not rising, but they also are not falling fast enoughThe 7-day averages of daily and active Covid-19 cases continue their downward trend after having peaked on May 9, 2021. However, two months since the second wave's peak, the infection’s trajectory in India has seen a worrying development. There has been a slowdown in the downward trend of cases and a slight increase in positivity rate. Worse still, daily new cases have been increasing over the past few days, although it is premature to label this the beginning of the next wave without a clear increase in 7-day averages.On June 24, the 7-day-average of daily and active cases in India was 53,123 and 683,544 respectively. Two weeks later, on July 7, these numbers were 42,547 and 486,415, the lowest since the peak of the second wave. This shows that we are still on the downward path of the second wave. To be sure, the latest numbers are much higher than the lowest number of daily new cases (10,988) and total active cases (138,837) seen after the peak of the first wave.What is worrying about the current situation is that the nature of the infection's curve changed a month ago. The 7-day average of new cases was declining at the rate of 6.7% per day on June 2. New cases are declining at a much slower rate now. The daily fall in 7-day average of new cases was 0.96% on July 7. The rate of decline of active cases has similarly decreased from 5.23% on June 9 to 1.8% on July 7.2. Rise in positivity rate is a cause for concernWhile new cases continue to fall, the positivity rate has already reversed its falling trajectory. The seven-day average of daily positivity rates hit a high of 22.76% on May 9. It then declines and reached a low of 2.19% on July 2. This number has increased slightly in the past week. On July 7, the 7-day average of daily positivity rate was 2.27%. While this increase is small and recent, this definitely raises a red flag.3. The situation at the state levelThe all-India numbers hide the divergence across states. The 7-day average of new cases has been rising in six small north-eastern states and Kerala. Positivity rates have risen in 11 states and UTs over the last week. There are 4 states, where the 7-day average of positivity rate was higher than 10% on July 7, and another four where it was 5%-10% . A rise in positivity rates means the number of cases will continue to rise.4. Districts in other states too affectedOut of 707 districts for which data is compiled by How India Lives (Delhi’s districts are merged as one), the 7-day average of cases has increased in 63 districts between June 20 and July 6; 36 of them are from the eight north-eastern states, and 18 from Kerala, Maharashtra, and Odisha. But cases have increased in a few districts even in other states in the past two weeks.The lack of publicly available daily district-wise positivity rates that can be read together with the cases in those districts continues to be an important constraint in red-flagging vulnerable districts before it is too late.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-covid-19-wave-lingering-or-early-signs-of-3rd-101625785189287.html
09-07-2021||India||Give plan to comply on oath: Delhi high court to Twitter||The Delhi high court on Thursday pulled up Twitter for its delay in appointing the resident grievance officers, making it clear that the social media company cannot be given eight weeks to meet the terms of the new Information Technology (IT) rules, and said the Union government was free to take action if the company did not comply.Twitter had sought eight weeks to appoint permanent grievance officers and to set up a liaison office in India, a request the court denied.“No, no... I am not giving eight weeks,” said justice Rekha Palli, while adding: “I am not going to protect you… You have also not set up a liaison office which was another requirement under the Rules”.Senior advocate Sajan Poovaya, representing Twitter, told the court that it was not seeking any protection. “The consequence (of non-compliance) is that the protection to intermediaries falls off. I’m not seeking any protection,” he said.Poovaya said the company was reserving its right to challenge the rules for now, to which the judge said: “You have the right to challenge but till the Rules are there, they’re there for everybody.”Close to 10 entities – tech companies, news websites, advocacy groups and private individuals – have challenged the new IT rules. While some, such as Facebook-owned WhatsApp, have challenged specific clauses, others, like Carnatic musician TM Krishna, have argued that the rules in entirety violate multiple provisions of the Constitution.The government has said that the rules are an important tool to protect the rights of Indian users and compel the digital companies to respect Indian rules and regulations.“While Twitter is striving to comply with the 2021 Rules, Twitter reserves its right to challenge the legality, validity, and vires of the Rules, and Twitter’s submissions regarding compliance are filed without prejudice to its right to challenge the Rules,” a document filed by Twitter in the high court said.Twitter on Thursday informed the high court that it appointed an interim chief compliance officer (COO) on July 6 as a contingent worker through a third party contractor, who is a resident of India, and it would require eight weeks to replace the position with a permanent employee.The social media intermediary also said that it is in the process of making an appointment of an Indian resident as its interim resident grievance officer (RGO) and expects to do so on or before July 11.The company also added that it intends to employ an interim nodal contact officer within two weeks and a regular employee within eight weeks.On yet another compliance requirement, which mandates big social media companies to publish a compliance report, the company promised to do so by July 11, the government’s deadline.Twitter’s submission came after the high court on July 6 asked the social media intermediary to give a deadline for appointing the three grievance redressal officers. The court had warned Twitter “will be in trouble” if it doesn’t comply.It had also pulled up the company for “misleading” the court and giving “wrong impression” on the appointment of a regular grievance officer. The court took exception to not being informed that an earlier appointment of the resident grievance officer was only on interim basis.Proceedings in the high court started with senior advocate Poovaya telling the court that his client was making all out efforts to comply with the new IT Rules. He said that usage of “interim” would not lessen or minimise the responsibilities on these officers.The high court, however, said: “Tomorrow you may take benefit of “interim”. This (your stand) is neither in the letter (to the Centre) nor in an affidavit.”Responding to a query of court, Poovaya said the officers have been appointed in interim because they do not have a permanent address in India and some tax issues might crop up. To this justice Palli said, “Okay, but I am not going to protect you.”Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, for the Centre, objected to the reply filed by Twitter and said that the appointments made could not be permitted through a third party.“This is not diplomatic parlance. We want accountability, full accountability of great servitude. It can’t be left in half-way house via third party…They’ve talked about making appointments through a third party. What is this third party? Where is it coming from? Let’s say I am a pharma or an IT company in the US…No court would give them leeway like this. I have to be in 100% compliance with the Rules,” Sharma argued.When Poovaya said that the Centre cannot hold them for contempt for the contents of their affidavit, the court observed: “I am not going into that right now, but you are already in contempt. You had said something in the last hearing, now you are going back on it and trying to salvage the situation maybe.”The court noted that Twitter has not filed an affidavit but has given a short memo signed by the counsel in which they stated to fully comply with the Rules, as long as there is no stay.It granted two weeks’ time to Twitter to file hard copies of the notarised affidavit of a competent officer, along with the affidavit of the officer already stated to have been appointed and the persons who are being appointed.Since early 2021, the company has had multiple disputes with the government, beginning with tweets relating to the farm protests that the government sought to be taken down. In recent weeks, former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has publicly spoken against Twitter for its content moderation practices, while cases have been filed against Twitter’s executives over user content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-plan-to-comply-on-oath-delhi-high-court-to-twitter-101625784988511.html
09-07-2021||India||Don’t be complacent, single mistake can derail fight against Covid: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned his council of ministers on Thursday that complacency could derail India’s fight against Covid-19, and a single mistake could have far-reaching impact and weaken the fight to defeat the virus, according to people aware of the developments.At the meeting of the expanded council of 77 members, Modi also asked the ministers to be punctual, learn from their predecessors, and focus on public service. The event came a day after Modi rebooted his council, dropping 12 ministers, inducting 36 new faces, and promoting seven.Modi said India’s fight against the pandemic was on track but expressed concern at the persistently high number of cases from Maharashtra and Kerala, said a person privy to the details of the meeting.According to the person quoted above, the PM said that over the past few days, pictures and videos of crowded places were being circulated and people were seen roaming without masks or social distancing. “This is not a pleasant sight and it should instil a sense of fear in us,” Modi was quoted as saying by the person quoted in the first instance.The PM said India’s fight against the pandemic was powered by frontline workers and was underway with full vigour. He also said that India was steadily vaccinating a substantial percentage of its population and testing was also consistently high.In the past, the PM has urged people to not let their guard down against the pandemic and adhere to Covid safety protocols. At the meeting too, the PM said that everyone must remember that the threat of Covid-19 was far from over and many nations were seeing surges in infections, said the person quoted above.He told the ministers that their aim should not be to instil fear but request people to keep taking all possible precautions so that India can move beyond the pandemic.A second person aware of developments said Modi asked ministers to reach office on time and channel their energies on ministerial work.He also said new ministers should not make unnecessary statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-be-complacent-single-mistake-can-derail-fight-against-covid-modi-101625784908337.html

It also cleared a proposal to extend a flagship ₹1 lakh crore fund to agriculture produce marketing committees (APMC), the backbone of farm trade in the country.“Important decisions regarding agriculture and farmers’ welfare have been taken in today’s Cabinet meeting,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The virtual meeting of the 30-member Cabinet took place a day after Modi dropped 12 ministers, inducted 36 new faces, and promoted seven in the first major reshuffle of the council of ministers of his second term.The briefing was addressed by Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, and health minister Mansukh Mandaviya.Mandaviya, who took over from Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday, said the Centre will provide ₹15,000 crore and states ₹8,123 crore in the new package that will be implemented jointly across 736 districts to improve medical infrastructure at primary and district health centres. Projects under the plan will be implemented within nine months.“In April 2020, the first package of ₹15,000 crore was announced by the government; it has been utilised well and the results are also for all to see,” said Mandaviya.Around 240,000 normal medical beds and 20,000 intensive care unit beds will be created, of which 20% percent will be earmarked for children, he added. Storage facilities for oxygen and medicines will also be created at the district level.“This scheme aims to accelerate health system preparedness for immediate responsiveness for early prevention, detection and management, with the focus on health infrastructure development, including for paediatric care, and with measurable outcomes,” said a government statement. To ensure there is no oxygen supply shortage, provisions will be made in each district to have 10,000-litre storage facility.Earlier this year, the government faced criticism from the public, judiciary and opposition parties as cases and fatalities rose sharply during the second wave this summer. Hospitals ran out of oxygen supplies, leaving patients gasping and life-saving drugs were in short supply.The Cabinet also decided to extend the ₹1 lakh-crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to APMCs, which are government-run market yards for buying and selling farm produce. The fund is primarily aimed at creating durable farm assets, from warehouses to processing plants. The fund can now be utilised by APMCs to modernise market facilities used by farmers to sell their produce.“There should be no apprehension about APMCs. Some people have said that the new farm laws will lead to the end of APMCs. This is not true. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund can now be used to strengthen APMCs and will place more resources at their disposal,” Tomar said.The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund is designed to address longstanding investment gaps in the rural assets because of its concessional rates. All of the country’s 12 public-sector banks and nine private lenders are part of the fund.“I want to appeal to protesting farmer unions to end their protest and to hold discussions. Government is ready for discussions,” Tomar said.The fund, which figured in the ₹20 lakh crore first stimulus package to deal with the Covid crisis in 2020, aims to offer medium-to-long term debt financing for investment in farm projects.It provides loans on easy terms totalling ₹1 lakh crore over four years, starting with a sanction of ₹10,000 crore for 2020-21 and ₹30,000 crore each for the next three financial years.Borrowers get an interest subvention, where part of the interest is paid by the government, of 3% per annum up to a loan limit of ₹2 crore for a period of seven years.Tomar said that as part of changes made to the fund, investors and institutions will qualify for multiple loan accounts if they invest in more than one project up to a ceiling of 25 projects provided they are planned in different areas.“Indian agriculture has always depended more on subsidies than investments. The new fund will help correct that. It is important that the fund is managed in a way that farmers are able to achieve scale and connect with markets efficiently,” said Ananth Kumar of the TN Agriculture University.Last year, the government passed three contentious farm laws that quickly triggered a controversy with farm unions from foodbowl states alleging that the legislation will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants with greater bargaining powers at poor prices instead of government-run markets, which offer assured prices for cereals.The government rejected the charges, saying the laws will bring competition and widen farmers’ market access. Despite assurances, cultivators have been sitting at Delhi’s borders in protest against the laws for nearly eight months.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said farmers are ready to talk with the government but without conditions. “They are imposing conditions that we should go to them for talks. They say that they can amend the laws but will not scrap them. Farmers have not been protesting for eight months so that they can follow the government’s orders,” Tikait told ANI.As part of the health infrastructure plan, the government will support to all major central hospitals and other institutions of national importance.The hospitals include Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital; RIMS, Imphal; NEIGRIMS, Shillong; PGIMER, Chandigarh, and JIPMER, Puducherry, for repurposing 6,688 beds for Covid-19 management.National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) will also be strengthened by providing genome sequencing machines, besides sanctioning scientific control room, epidemic intelligence services and Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) secretariat support.At present, only 310 district hospitals are implementing hospital management information system that collates data coming from hospitals, and as per the plan government will provide support to all district hospitals for its implementation.“We also look at integrating digital health systems scaling up of use of telemedicine services in the country,” said Mandviya.Money will also be allocated for improving the information technology system, including strengthening the central Covid-19 war room, country’s Covid-19 portal, 1075 Covid help lines and the CoWIN platform that is the backbone of Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system, said the government statement quoted above.Dedicated paediatric units will be created in all 736 districts and also paediatric centre of excellence in each state. Of the 20,000 intensive care unit beds planned for the public health care system, 20% will be paediatric ICU beds, said the statement .“For the rest we will try to follow a hybrid model wherein ICU beds are designed in such a way that it can be utilised for both adults and children… support would also be provided to establish bigger field hospitals (50-100 bedded units) depending on the needs at tier-II or tier-III cities and district headquarters,” said Mandviya.Experts said strengthening health care delivery system at the grassroots level is crucial.“It is important to have a robust health care system in place in villages and small towns and if that gets strengthened than it will significantly reduce burden on tertiary hospitals,” said Dr KK Talwar, former director, PGI Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-team-starts-with-focus-on-farm-health-101625783922741.html
09-07-2021||India||News broadcasters association moves HC against new IT rules||The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) Thursday said it has filed a plea in the Kerala high court challenging the new IT rules on the ground that they give government authorities “excessive powers” to “unreasonably and impermissibly restrict” the freedom of speech and expression of the media.In a statement, the NBA said the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines & Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, are ultra vires to the Information Technology Act, 2000 apart from being violative of Article 14 (equality before law) and 19(1)(g) (right to freedom to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business) of the Constitution.It said the challenge is to Part III (Code of Ethics and Procedure and Safeguards in relation to Digital Media) of the IT rules as they create an “oversight mechanism giving the executive unfettered, unbridled and excessive powers to regulate content of digital news media”.“The grievance redressal mechanism created and the powers delegated have a ‘chilling effect’ on the content of the media. The writ (petition) also states that the executive by creating such a structure, has made inroads into judicial power and vested itself with powers reserved exclusively for the judiciary and such exercise of power is without jurisdiction,” the statement said.It said the petition has also challenged the new rules as the IT Act does not contain any provision for dealing with “content” of any programme and therefore, the rules are ultra vires the parent Act.Several digital news media platforms have already challenged the 2021 IT rules in various high courts and even the Centre has approached the Supreme Court seeking to transfer all such pleas to itself.The 2021 rules regulate the functioning of online media portals and publishers, over-the-top platforms and social media intermediaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/news-broadcasters-association-moves-hc-against-new-it-rules-101625783025538.html
09-07-2021||India||Kerala continues to reel under Covid||Kerala’s pandemic woes continue with the state, on Thursday, reporting 13,722 new cases of Covid-19 (a little over a third of the 45,892 cases the country recorded) with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 10.83%.Experts have warned the government that things could get worse unless it imposes more restrictions on movement and activities, and then enforces them.A central team visiting the state is also believed to have asked the state to do this, but state health minister Veena George on Thursday denied reports that the team expressed concern. “We have briefed them and they expressed satisfaction over our efforts,” she said.Daily cases in the state have risen by almost 50% from last week, and its TPR has stayed above 10% for at least three weeks. The national TPR is around 2.5%.For the past 10 days at least, Kerala has been the only state in the country reporting more than 10,000 daily cases.“The state has to increase tests drastically.A mere lockdown won’t do. It needs a grassroots level containment strategy,” said public health experts Dr SS Lal, who has previously worked with the World Health Organization (WHO).What is worrying health experts is that the trajectory of infections in the state has shown no downward trend . “It seems the behaviour of the virus in Kerala is turning into a nightmare for experts. We need an in-depth study and we have to compare its case pattern with other states,” said another expert Dr NM Arun.Experts blame the state’s low testing rate, its continued obsession with cheap antigen tests, and the recent assembly elections.If there’s a bright spot it is that there are no signs of overcrowding or panic in hospitals. Some of the temporary first line treatment centres were closed down for want of patients and there is no shortage of oxygen also. Doctors say many patients prefer home isolation, but health workers say that has actually contributed to the spike on account of poor quarantining and social distancing practices. Health workers said that in rural areas many jump the home quarantine and infect family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-continues-to-reel-under-covid-101625782811149.html
09-07-2021||India||Grenade found in west Delhi drain during clean-up draws NSG team from Manesar||For over nine hours on Thursday, police officers on the road outside Nasirpur, an urban village in Delhi’s Sagarpur, were on high alert. Until late Thursday evening, the police team were waiting for officers from the National Security Guard (NSG) headquarters in Manesar to reach this nondescript village in a south-western corner of the Capital.A drain cover on the footpath, with sand bags next to it, and police teams guarding it, were the focus of attention as curious passersby peeked to check what had been discovered at the spot — an old grenade, rusty on the outside, with parts of its surface chipped away by the years.It wasn’t the police who first discovered the suspicious device.On Thursday morning, a sanitation worker, cleaning drains as part of the civic body’s annual de-silting exercise before the monsoon, saw a round object in the drain.A police officer who spoke to the cleaner said the man initially thought it was some sort of a metal ball. He checked with other workers, and they thought it looked like something they had seen in Hindi films — a hand grenade with the “safety pin” on.Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police(south west), said: “At 11.55pm, we received a distress call on the 112 number about a sanitation worker discovering a grenade while cleaning a drain under the walkway. Immediately, the station house officer of the area rushed to the spot along with district bomb disposal team and found the old, corroded grenade at the spot. The district ballistics team safely placed it away from the crowded area, in an open space. Area around it has been buttressed using makeshift sandbags. A local police guard is posted there to ensure that no one goes near the grenade.”Singh said police asked for the NSG’s assistance to ascertain the make and model of the grenade. Police suspect the grenade could be several decades old. They have no idea yet how it got there.Till late Thursday evening, the NSG commandos were yet to reach the spot.“We have been told the NSG team has left Manesar. There is nothing to worry. It is totally safe. It is an old grenade. It has the marking HE 36. Our officers wasted no time in checking it out on Google. We were told it isn’t in use these days. We alerted our senior officers, issued an alert and they have asked for the NSG. The situation is kind of funny but there is a protocol, and we have to follow it,” said an officer HT spoke to around 9pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grenade-found-in-west-delhi-drain-during-clean-up-draws-nsg-team-from-manesar-101625781960125.html
09-07-2021||India||Facebook must appear before Delhi assembly riots panel, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Thursday held that Facebook must appear before a Delhi assembly committee to respond to queries regarding its role and other aspects of the February 2020 Delhi riots, as it emphasised that the social media intermediary cannot escape responsibilities after becoming a “power centre” that can “polarise public debates” and “influence vast sections of opinions”.“Facebook cannot excuse themselves from appearing pursuant to the new summons issued to them on February 3, 2021... Facebook is a platform where political differences are reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their very business,” said the bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.At the same time, the court clarified that the peace and harmony committee of the Delhi assembly cannot become a “prosecuting agency” which can hold people guilty and order filing of charge sheets in the riot cases. The Facebook executive will be at liberty not to answer questions relating to law and order and police, while such a refusal cannot lead to any coercive step by the assembly, said the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.The bench dismissed the petition filed jointly by Facebook and Facebook India head Ajit Mohan against the summons issued to Mohan by the Delhi assembly committee, which is headed by Aaam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha, noting that the committee had authority to seek attendance of “non-members” of the assembly as well and to ask them to depose on oath on a subject within its jurisdiction.Underlining that Delhi assembly was as good as any other state assembly, with the only exception of absence of legislative powers on land, police and public order, the top court rejected Facebook’s contention that it cannot be compelled by any committee of the parliament or the state assembly to participate in an inquiry and that its move to appear before a parliamentary panel last year on information technology was a “business decision”.“As per their own acknowledgement, they would only appear before any committee if it served their commercial and operational interests, as it did when they appeared before the parliamentary committee. But if their business interests are not served, they seek a right to stay away. Such a stand is completely unacceptable to us. Facebook has the power of not simply a hand but a fist, gloved as it may be,” said the bench in its 188-page judgment.It bench, however, pointed to certain statements made on the alleged collusion of Facebook in the Delhi riots by the Chadha during a press conference in August last year, and said that “such statements are hardly conducive to fair proceedings before the Committee and should have been desisted from”.While Facebook and Mohan were represented through senior advocates Harish Salve and Arvind Datar, the Delhi government had senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and advocate Shadan Farasat to argue for the government and the committee. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared for the central government, which supported Facebook in saying that the summons could not be issued for want of legislative competence - an issue that the court called “premature”.Holding that lawmaking is not the only business of a legislative assembly, the bench underscored the role of an assembly committee in assisting the legislature in various issues of governance and said that Facebook, with their expanded role as an intermediary, “can hardly contend that they have some exceptional privilege to abstain from appearing before a committee duly constituted by the assembly.”The court further termed the Facebook’s petition plea “premature” and “speculative” since the Facebook executive was yet to appear before the committee to understand the ambit of questioning, and therefore, it said, issues of privilege power, right to free speech and silence, right to privacy etc. were “pre-emptory” and a “preventive endeavour”. It further said that the privilege power of the Delhi assembly was not just a statutory power but a constitutional one, on par with any other state assembly.Highlighting that the “unfortunate violence” that broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020 had left 53 people dead and several hundreds injured, the bench underlined that the need to go into this incident, both from a legal and social perspective, cannot be belittled.“The capital of the country can ill-afford any repetition of the occurrence and thus, the role of Facebook in this context must be looked into by the powers that be..the assembly being a local legislative and governance body, it cannot be said that their concerns were misconceived or illegitimate. It is not only their concern but their duty to ensure that ‘peace and harmony’ prevails,” said the court.Thus the committee, said the court, has the power to go into the incident and issuance of summons is key to this investigative exercise, which cannot be sidestepped by Facebook on the premise that it is an “outsider” which does not want to be drawn into a political divide.“Facebook is a platform where such political differences are reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their very business. As noticed earlier, their role is not as innocuous as they are seeking to contend. Similarly, we cannot accept the plea that an assembly must confine itself to the core function of legislation. This would be unreasonably restricting the role of an elected body,” held the bench.About the scope of the inquiry by the committee, the court said it would undermine the very purpose of a vital democratic polity if it were to say that informed deliberation in relation to the best measures through which online mass hate and violence in their geographical jurisdiction can be addressed would not be within the committee’s area of competence.Chadha welcomed the judgment. “The court has reaffirmed and acknowledged the important role of the committee of peace and harmony. We will study the judgment, and shall thereafter continue the proceedings in terms thereof. The committee, like other legislative committees of the assembly, is keen on continuing a genuine deliberative process on issues of concerns in the NCT of Delhi with full participation of all concerned,“ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-must-appear-before-delhi-assembly-riots-panel-says-supreme-court-101625779814520.html
09-07-2021||India||Delhi weather: Another hot day ahead; mercury may drop slightly||The national Capital is likely to have another heatwave day on Thursday, as per forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, forecasters say that the maximum temperature is expected to drop slightly from today, which may bring relief from the ongoing heatwave conditions in the city.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was 42.6 degrees Celsius (°C), six degrees above normal for this time of the year. According to IMD forecast, on Thursday also, the day temperature is likely to hover around 41°C.In the plains, heatwave days are classified as when the maximum temperature crosses 40°C, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5°C.Scientists said that the maximum temperature is likely to subside now that the monsoon is gradually progressing over the northwest region, including Delhi.“By Friday, there are chances of thundershowers, which will intensify on July 10-11. Hence, a further drop in the day temperature is expected by July 10, bringing much relief from the soaring heat and humidity,” said a senior IMD official.The IMD had on Monday revised the dates for monsoon arrival in Delhi and parts of northwest and central India to July 10. The latest it has arrived in the past 17 years for which IMD has data is on July 9 in 2006. So, this year is likely to make a record in terms of the most delayed onset over Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-weather-another-hot-day-ahead-mercury-may-drop-slightly-101625779117658.html
09-07-2021||India||Delhiwale: Here's to companionship||Rickshaw puller Syyed lives alone.That’s not entirely correct, he clarifies. “I’m not completely alone. I have a saathi (companion).”Syyed explains that at night he sleeps on his rickshaw. “I park it on the pavement… many other rickshaw wale of the area sleep the same way, on the passengers’ seat of their (respective) rickshaws, which are parked in one long row... we are friendly with each other.”This conversation is unfolding one late morning near central Delhi’s Ansari Road.And now Syyed opens up about the aforementioned saathi—Bhuriya. “It’s not bhuriya, an old woman, but bhuriya, the brown coloured.”Syyed’s Bhuriya is a stray dog. Every night she sleeps on his rickshaw’s floor-board, or underneath the vehicle, depending on her mood.Their friendship goes back to several years ago. Syyed, a UP native from Bulandshahr, has been in the city for a decade. He arrived first in the area, and Bhuriya appeared much later. Their friendship solidified gradually. “I would give her roti and biskut, or whatever else I would be eating, and she would come to me whenever she felt hungry.” Soon, she started to come to him even when she wasn’t hungry.Bhuriya is nowhere to be seen at the moment.“Nahin nahin, she must be here somewhere.”Syyed calls out to Bhuriya. The dog appears as if out of air. She leaps towards Syyed’s rickshaw, raises her forelegs and plops her head on Syyed’s lap, who is sitting on the rickshaw’s much higher passenger seat. Syyed picks her up and places the dog on his lap. Bhuriya’s tail is flapping wildly, like a fish out of water. Tapping Bhuriya’s happy face with his hand, Syyed responds to a query, confirming that he daily buys Mother Dairy milk packets for the dog. “Bhuriya looks after me, so I look after her.”Following a long pause in which he chats with Bhuriya in their own special language, their eyes locked into each other’s gaze, Syyed says that most of his daily earnings are spent in Bhuriya’s food, and in his nightly liquor consumption. He believes money will never be a problem to him. “If I give to others, God will give to me.”He now kisses Bhuriya, who continues to look delighted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-here-s-to-companionship-101625778917463.html

09-07-2021||India||Police question activist Aisha Sultana in Kochi||Thiruvananthapuram The Lakshadweep police on Thursday questioned activist and filmmaker Aisha Sultana in Kochi in connection with the sedition case. The filmmaker, however, alleged it was part of a bigger plan to harass and torture her. She said the island police descended on her flat without any notice and questioning continued for many hours. “It was least expected. I have to rush from my shooting site after my brother informed about it. It is part of the harassment and torture plan,” she later told media persons in the port city. Two weeks back she had appeared before the island police in Kavartti and they questioned her for five days. Sultana landed in trouble after she made a remark in a TV panel discussion in early June that the union government’s decision to relax Covid-19 restrictions and appointment of the new administrator Praful Khoda Patel were a bio-weapon against the people of the archipelago. On June 11, the Kavaratti police registered a case against her under sections 124 (A) (sedition) and 153 (B) (acts against national interests) of the Indian Penal Code. The case was based on the complaint of Lakshadweep BJP president C Abdul Khadar Haji who said her words were in bad taste and had hurt many. Though Sultana later expressed regrets over her words the union government took a strong position saying that her words were used widely by foreign media to portray the country in bad light. The Kerala high court had granted anticipatory bail to her but it refused to quash the case without hearing all parties concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-question-activist-aisha-sultana-in-kochi-101625774426150.html
09-07-2021||India||Court rejects plea for probe into graft charges against Karnataka CM||Bengaluru A city court on Thursday dismissed a complaint for investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering against Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, his family and others, citing absence of valid sanction. “Private complaint filed by the complainant under Sec. 200 of Cr P.C. (Code of Criminal Procedure), and interim application filed by the complainant under Sec. 156(3) of Cr.P.C., are not maintainable in the absence of valid sanction and accordingly dismissed,” the city civil and sessions court judge said in the order. The case was filed by Abraham TJ, an activist and the president of the Karnataka Anti-Graft and Environmental Forum at Bengaluru, against Yediyurappa, his family members and senior government officials, alleging bribe payments made to the tune of ₹12.5 crore to award a private company the contract for a housing project to be taken up by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). Yediyurappa’s son BY Vijayendra and grandson Shashidar Maradi, cabinet minister ST Somashekar and at least two high-ranking BDA officials among others were listed as respondents in the case. Abraham, in his petition, stated that he had approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in November last year, but to no avail as the government probe agency closed the complaint two months later without any formal inquiry into the allegations. However, the court observed that the private complaint is not maintainable in the absence of valid sanction and, accordingly, dismissed it. Saying that he will approach the Karnataka high court in this case, Abraham told HT that he suspected the “court’s judgment was influenced by the CM.” The complainant has also alleged that the bribe money was routed through at least seven “shell companies” owned by Yediyurappa’s family in Kolkata. The petition stated that all these companies are located on the same street and have their accounts in the same branch of the Corporation Bank in south Dum Dum area of Kolkata. The petitioner has also claimed that the discovery might only be the “tip of the iceberg” and that the chief minister and his family have amassed huge amounts of ill-gotten wealth or “proceeds of crime”. The reprieve in the case has come at a time when Yediyurappa and his family have been at the receiving end of sharp criticism and allegations of large-scale corruption, some of which from his own party legislators, including Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal) and AH Vishwanath among others. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command has been trying to sort out differences among the party leaders in the state, with insiders saying an attempt was being made to replace Yediyurappa before the 2023 assembly elections in Karnataka. While the chief minister had recently said he would accept any decision of the high command, the 78-year-old Lingayat leader has managed to handle the discontent, albeit for the time being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-rejects-plea-for-probe-into-graft-charges-against-karnataka-cm-101625774006015.html
09-07-2021||India||Virbhadra Singh: Congress stalwart, Himachal’s Raja Sahib passes away at 87||Shimla: Six-time Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh, who crafted a distinguished political career spanning fifty years before getting embroiled in financial irregularity charges in his final term, died in Shimla on Thursday. He was 87. A scion of the Rampur-Bushahr royal family and popularly known as Raja Sahib, Singh was a tall leader of the Congress and also served as a Union minister. The veteran leader breathed his last at the Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) in Shimla at 3.40 am, senior medical superintendent, Dr. Janak Raj, said.“Popular for his affable and grounded nature, he remained close to people brought about far reaching positive changes through his administrative acumen,” Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said in her condolence message.“He was one of the tallest stalwarts of the Congress party and remained a dedicated Congressperson throughout,” she added.Born on June 23, 1934, Singh was educated at Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, St Edward’s School, Shimla, and Bishop Cotton School, Shimla, before he graduated with an honours degree in English from St Stephen’s College, DelhiSingh began his political career at 27 with the Lok Sabha elections in 1962. He went on to serve as a member of Parliament for four more terms, in 1967, 1971, 1980 and 2009.His first stint as chief minister came in 1983 when the previous Congress government, helmed by Ram Lal Thakur, was mired in controversy. Singh successfully contested the byelections from Thakur’s turf of Jubbal Kotkhai in 1983 and 1985 and won over his loyalists.Such was his popularity that he was re-elected as chief minister in 1993, 2003 and 2012. He also won the Lok Sabha election in 2009 and served as Union minister of steel and later as minister of micro, small and medium enterprises.Singh faced corruption allegations later in his political career and faced a case for owning assets disproportionate to his known sources of income during his stint as Union minister from 2009.Singh spent most of the time in his last tenure as CM, between 2012 and 2017, shuttling between Delhi and Shimla, battling money laundering charges.

Jammu, too, must get adequate representation in the assembly,” Raina said.The panel, led by Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai, is on a 4-day trip to J&K to interact with leaders and officials before the mega exercise of redrawing constituencies in the union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfreeze-24-pakistan-occupied-kashmir-seats-j-k-bjp-to-delimitation-commission-101625770827598.html
09-07-2021||India||Afghanistan situation to figure in India-Russia talks today||The situation in Afghanistan, forthcoming India-Russia meetings, and bilateral cooperation in security and defence will figure in talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on July 9.Jaishankar is currently on a three-day visit to Russia, during which his discussions with his interlocutors are expected to cover the entire range of bilateral issues, including cooperation in the fight against Covid-19, and various regional and international developments.The talks with Lavrov will be Jaishankar’s main engagement in Moscow, and the Russian foreign ministry said on Thursday the two sides will compare notes on “major global and regional issues, including the political process in Afghanistan, settlement in Syria [and the] situation around the Iranian nuclear program”.The two sides will also discuss cooperation at the UN, Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) “in the RIC format”, the Russian foreign ministry said, referring to the Russia-India-China grouping.In an indication of the differences between India and Russia on the Indo-Pacific concept, the Russian foreign ministry said the discussions are also expected to touch up “approaches to the formation of reliable and indivisible security architecture in the Pacific and Indian oceans”.Lavrov has been openly critical of the Indo-Pacific concept, which now forms a key part of India’s foreign policy and cooperation under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue format (which includes the US, Japan and Australia). Last December, Lavrov had said Western powers have adopted an “aggressive and devious” policy to engage India “in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies”.India has dismissed these concerns by saying the Indo-Pacific is an inclusive concept that can even be joined by Russia.The Russian foreign ministry noted that interaction with India was “successfully developing in all areas in line with a special and privileged strategic partnership, including political dialogue, security, trade and economic, military-technical, scientific, cultural and humanitarian ties”.It added that the foreign ministers are expected to discuss “key directions of the Russian-Indian relations, taking into account the previously reached agreements and upcoming contacts, in particular at the highest and high levels”.The annual India-Russia Summit is slated for later this year, while a meeting of the bilateral inter-governmental commission on trade, economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation will be held in Delhi in August, and a meeting of the inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation will be held in Moscow in November.The Russian foreign ministry further said the two countries share a similar vision of a “model of an emerging more fair and equitable polycentric world order”, and “demonstrate the similarity or proximity of positions on the most important issues of peace and security”.Jaishankar’s visit to Moscow is a follow-up to the trip by Lavrov to New Delhi in April.Besides holding talks with Lavrov, Jaishankar will also meet deputy prime minister Yuri Borisov, his counterpart for the inter-governmental commission on trade, economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation, and the chairman of the state Duma committee on international affairs, Leonid Slutsky.Jaishankar also delivered a speech on “India-Russia ties in a changing world” at the prestigious Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-situation-to-figure-in-india-russia-talks-tomorrow-101625773058901.html
09-07-2021||India||Six terrorists eliminated in three encounters in J&K||Six terrorists, including three from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), were killed in three separate encounters with security forces in Kulgam, Pulwama and Rajouri on Thursday. Two soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer, were killed in a fierce gun battle in Rajouri, while they were foiling a major infiltration bid along the Line of Control, officials said. The terrorists opened fire and lobbed hand grenades at the search-and-destroy patrol seeking proactive engagement with the terrorists in Dadal forest area, leading to a gunbattle in which two terrorists from Pakistan were killed, the spokesman said.In the operation, naib subedar Sreejith M and sepoy Maruprolu Jaswanth Reddy received fatal injuries. 4 militants killed in Pulwama, Kulgam Four militants, including three from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), were killed in two separate encounters with security forces in South Kashmir’s Pulwama and Kulgam districts. Based on specific input about the presence of terrorists in the Puchal area of Pulwama, a joint cordon and search operation was launched by police, CRPF and the Army on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, a police spokesperson said.“During the search operation as the presence of terrorists was ascertained they were given repeated opportunities to surrender, however, they fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party which retaliated leading to an encounter,” he said. In the ensuing encounter, two militants were killed and their bodies were retrieved from the site of the encounter, the spokesperson said.They have been identified as Kifayat Ramzan Sofi, affiliated with the LeT, and Inayat Ahmad Dar, affiliated with Al-Badr outfit. An AK-47 pistol and a pistol was recovered from their possession. The militants killed in Kulgam were planning to carry out attack on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway. “During naka checking, when a suspicious vehicle was signalled to stop by the naka party, two terrorists who were boarding the vehicle came out from the vehicle and started firing indiscriminately upon the joint naka party. However, the alert party retaliated the fire effectively, leading to the elimination of two terrorists on the spot,” the spokesperson said.The slain militants were identified as Nasir Ahmad Pandith and Shahbaz Ahmad Shah, both affiliated with the LeT.“As per police records, all the killed terrorists were part of groups involved in various terror crimes regarding which several terror crime cases stand registered against them. Arms, ammunition and other incriminating materials were recovered from both the encounter sites,” he said.Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar has congratulated the police and security forces for conducting successful operations in a professional manner without any collateral damage.On Wednesday, a Hizbul Mujahideen(HM) militant commander, Mehrajuddin Halwai , was killed hours after his detention by security forces in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. Police said that he was killed in an encounter after he was taken to locate his hidden weapon from a hideout where he allegedly picked up his rifle and started firing on forces personnel.Since January, around 68 militants have been killed in Kashmir in different operations with the forces including some top commanders of different militant groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-terrorists-eliminated-in-three-encounters-in-jk-101625773106802.html
09-07-2021||India||‘Baseless propaganda’: India on Pak claim on Lahore attack role||New Delhi: India on Thursday dismissed as “baseless propaganda” Pakistan’s claim that a bombing in Lahore last month was masterminded by India’s Research & Analysis Wing, and said that Pakistan should instead focus on rooting out terrorism emanating from its soil.Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf contended on Sunday that the “main mastermind” of the car bomb attack near Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed’s home in Lahore on June 23 belonged to RAW. Yusuf also accused India of sponsoring terror activity on Pakistani soil.Asked about these allegations at a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “It is not new for Pakistan to engage in baseless propaganda against India.”Bagchi added, “Pakistan would do well to expend the same effort in setting its own house in order and taking credible and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from its soil and terrorists who have found safe sanctuaries there.”The world community, he said, is “well aware of Pakistan’s credentials when it comes to terrorism”.Bagchi said, “This is acknowledged by none other than its own leadership which continues to glorify terrorists like Osama bin Laden as martyrs.”The remark was an apparent reference to Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s refusal to answer a question during an interview last month on whether he considered slain al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden a “martyr”.Three people were killed and more than 20 others injured in the car bombing near Hafiz Saeed’s home at Johar Town in Lahore last month. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.Pakistan’s NSA Yusuf told a news conference on Sunday that there allegedly links to India in the financing and execution of the attack. However, he didn’t provide any detailed information to back up his contentions, and only said that Pakistan had gathered “concrete evidence and intelligence” in this regard.Yusuf, who addressed the media along with Pakistan’s information minister Fawad Chaudhry and Punjab police chief Inam Ghani, further claimed that reports of a drone attack on the Jammu air force station last month were an apparent attempt to deflect the world community’s attention from the car bombing in Lahore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baseless-propaganda-india-on-pak-claim-on-lahore-attack-role-101625772928532.html
09-07-2021||India||Abhilash Tomy seeks funds to reattempt race that nearly proved fatal for him||In the 75th year of the country’s Independence, a champion Indian sailor will attempt a feat that almost killed him three years ago --- an enormously challenging solo and non-stop circumnavigation race that bars the use of modern technology.But Abhilash Tomy’s quest for sailing glory faces a funding hurdle; he needs to raise up to ₹4 crore to get through to the 2022 edition of the quadrennial Golden Globe Race (GGR).Struggling to find sponsors for the around-the-world race, the former navy commander has decided to take a shot at crowdfunding to be able to compete in the gruelling event, an endurance test like no other in the world of competitive sailing.“I could not finish the 2018 edition of the race because of an accident. It’s been in my head for a long time. I am ready for the unfinished business. I have launched a crowd-funding campaign to arrange funds for a boat and several other associated expenses,” Tomy said over phone from Goa.He has launched a fundraising campaign on the Ketto crowdfunding platform, and fondly describes his supporters as “crew” who stand a chance “to be a part of a race around the world.”Tomy suffered a debilitating back injury on September 21, 2018, after rough seas and powerful winds in the southern Indian Ocean , one of the remotest spots on Earth, crippled his yacht, SV Thuriya. He was rescued 70 hours later.“I did not suffer from any post-traumatic stress disorder after the accident. There are no fear issues. I was doing fairly well until the storm took Thuriya down. I regard my participation in GGR-22 as a fitting tribute to the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence,” he said.Before the September 21 accident, Tomy was in the third position among 11 international participants and had sailed more than 10,500 nautical miles since the race began on July 1, 2018, from a port in France.That was the 50th year of the race that commemorates Robin Knox-Johnston’s feat in 1968, with participants required to operate under the same conditions, even navigating using charts and the stars.“This time it’s going to be even harder as participants will be given only 25 litres of fuel compared to 120 litres in 2018. I kept all the fuel for power generation. This time I will be dependent on sun and winds to charge batteries. The good thing is that participants will be allowed to carry cameras this time,” said Tomy, who took premature retirement from the navy in January 2021.Tomy became the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe on board his previous boat Mhadei, solo, non-stop and unassisted, in 2013. At the end of the five-month-long voyage, the President of India received Tomy and his boat at the Gateway of India in Mumbai. He was awarded India’s second-highest peace-time gallantry award, Kirti Chakra, for the achievement.Tomy has raised around ₹1.5 lakh on the crowdfunding platform over the last two days against a goal of ₹3 crore. He launched the campaign on July 6.“It all boils down to how much money I can raise. There are costs associated with getting a boat, its refit, entry fee for the event, technical managers and other expenses. I have approached some corporate houses too but haven’t had any response so far,” he said.Tomy first announced that he would take part in GGR-22 at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit-2019. Speaking at the 17th edition of the summit, he gave details of the harrowing moments that abruptly ended his participation in GGR-18 but thrust him into the spotlight for surviving an ordeal that tested the limits of human endurance.“When the boat turned upright after the second knockdown, my wrist was stuck on wires connecting the mast. At one point, the strap of my watch broke, and I fell nine metres on a piece of aluminium called the boom. Then I fell to the deck on my back. I cleaned up some of the broken equipment, but half an hour later, I could not stand,” said Tomy of the moments that turned out to be the point when he broke his spine in four places.When a rescue team --- a coordinated effort of four nations --- finally reached him, his first thought was that he was hallucinating.“After 48 hours of sleep deprivation, hallucination is common. When I heard the knock, I thought this could be a hallucination and I must be prepared for that. But then they were there, real people — and I told them you are like angels to me,” he said at the summit.Now he needs more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhilash-tomy-seeks-funds-to-reattempt-race-that-nearly-proved-fatal-for-him-101625772647522.html
09-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle may delay first data privacy law||India’s first data privacy law faces further delays as several members of a parliamentary committee, including its head, have been made ministers, weeks before its crucial report was expected to be presented to parliament during the Monsoon Session.The draft Personal Data Protection law was introduced in parliament in December, 2019 and is meant to provide the legal framework for the right to privacy of Indian citizens. But it was soon referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee to iron out several contentious issues.Members of the committee, people aware of the process and legal experts say replacements will now need to be appointed before the JPC report can be tabled.“The draft report remains to be circulated among members of the panel,” said a person aware of the developments, asking not to be named.The 30-member committee (which has two vacancies) includes Meenakshi Lekhi, who is the head, Ajay Bhatt, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Bhupender Yadav, and Ashwini Vaishnaw. These five were inducted in the government as ministers on Wednesday, which means they no longer can be part of the committee.The JPC got an extension first till the Winter Session last year, then until the first week of the second half of the Budget Session this year, and finally until the Monsoon Session this month. The committee has met various stakeholders, including industry representatives and civil society members.The bill covers the cross-border transfer of data and the use of personal data by government and private companies, and lays down penalties for entities that jeopardise the right to privacy of Indian citizens, which was held as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in August, 2017.The scope of the report is believed to have been expanded to cover not just personal data protection but also non-personal data. The panel’s report will aim to address “reasonable purposes for data sharing, exemptions for government agencies and sensitive personal data”, a person familiar with the matter said.Congress MP Manish Tewari, who is a member of the panel, alleged the report is stuck because “there is pressure on the government” from social media companies. “It has been seven months since deliberations of the committee closed. The chair made the committee members sit during the worst phase for Covid because she wanted to complete the report early. The draft is yet to be circulated not because she has not made the draft report, but obviously, since there is pressure from the social media companies on the government to not have a data protection law,” he said.“Ravi Shankar Prasad (former electronics and information technology minister) has been sacrificed at the altar of pleasing the social media giants. It is clear that social media companies are more powerful than the government.”Lekhi and Prasad did not respond to requests for a comment on these positions.Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh said he requested for the draft report of the bill to be circulated to its members. “Now, chairperson has become a minister along with 3 members. What happens now to committee & draft report? The new ministers had much to say on the Bill!” he said.Former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary said since it is a committee report, there is a sense of urgency to it. “If the Speaker wants, he can appoint a new chairperson today.”He added the procedure to be followed will depend on whether the chairperson has directed the secretariat to circulate the report. Achary said in that case, it will have to circulate a copy before a new chair is appointed.“Otherwise, the new chairperson will have to issue the directions,” he said. “The vacancies in the panel will be filled up once the parliamentary affairs minister gives the names of the new members to be added to the panel.”According to Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, Raman Chima, “A reminder that if an MP is appointed a Minister, they have to immediately leave any parliamentary committee and new folks appointed,” he said. “Ultimately of course, it’s a topic of extreme contestation as to whether on the really big issues of the present Government of India the individual ministers have much say beyond what the civil service and establishment connected to the PM’s office, Home Ministry, CabSec want.”Kazim Rizvi, founding director, The Dialogue, concurred with Chima and said that there might be a delay in appointing a new chairperson, “but we cannot ascertain for sure”.“Vacancies in the Committee can be filled by appointment or election by the House, based on a motion or the nomination by the Speaker,” he said. “Since ministers cannot hold membership to the standing committees, we will have a new chairperson of the JPC. The chairperson of the Committee has to be appointed by the Speaker from amongst the members.”HT reached out to the ministry of electronics and information technology but did not get an immediate response. This copy will be updated once the ministry responds||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-reshuffle-may-delay-first-data-privacy-law-101625772399368.html
09-07-2021||India||Experts count on Bhupender Yadav to tackle environmental challenges||Environmentalists and former bureaucrats on Thursday welcomed the appointment of Bhupender Yadav as the new Union minister for environment, citing his understanding of complex issues surrounding the environment and the climate crisis.On Thursday morning, Yadav started his first day in office by participating in a plantation drive, following which he held a meeting with senior officials of the ministry to review ongoing projects and issues.“Assumed charge of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (@moefcc) today. The PM Sh @narendramodi ji’s govt is committed to sustainable development. I wish to be able to ensure India [attains] those goals,” he said in a Twitter post.A senior environment ministry official said: “He seems soft spoken and more understanding of complex issues surrounding environment and climate change.”A lawyer and former national secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Yadav is also called the “Committee Man” due to his history of chairing several parliamentary committees on critical issues such as the Rajya Sabha Select Committee on Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015, among others.Yadav co-authored a book, titled “Supreme Court on Forest Conservation”, with environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta in 2011 on the legal aspects of forest conservation in India.“Its good that a lawyer has taken charge of the ministry. The ministry was circumventing the parliamentary process through various office memorandums and orders. I really hope he addresses that first. Given his background in law, he can help improve the functioning of the ministry. He has been associated with various environmental movements and has taken up environmental cases so he knows the issues very well. He has chaired the highest number of parliamentary committees also,” said Dutta.Over the past few years, the Prakash Javadekar-led ministry, faced widespread public backlash over various controversial decisions.The draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, published on March 23, 2020, has been in the eye of the storm over certain clauses, which can weaken the process of environmental appraisal of industries and infrastructure projects. On July 8 last year, the Delhi Police had sent a notice to youth climate group Fridays for Future, under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for sending multiple emails to Javadekar against the draft EIA 2020. Later, the Delhi Police termed the notice a clerical error.The ministry has, so far, received over 200,000 objections and comments on the draft EIA 2020, which are being assessed by a committee.“With the change in guard in the MoEFCC, let’s hope that the high-handedness and arrogance will give way to humility and rational decision-making benefitting forestry,” said Anup Nayak, former member secretary, national tiger conservation authority (NTCA) in a Twitter post.At present, several large infrastructure projects, including township planning in the fragile Andaman and Nicobar Islands; the Char Dham road project through Himalayas in Uttarakhand; hydropower projects in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley and mining in Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand forests, are being considered by the environment ministry.According to officials, the ministry has also started amending almost all environmental legislations to ensure they meet current requirements.The ministry’s wildlife division has prepared a cabinet note to amend the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which is yet to be cleared by the cabinet; a similar note on the amendment to Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 has also been finalised after circulating it internally among ministries.Recently, the ministry called for expressions of interest from consulting agencies, firms, and joint venture consortiums to prepare a new draft amendment to the Indian Forest Act, 1927. A private law firm is preparing a draft environmental management act which will subsume the Air Act 1981, Water Act 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and serve as an overarching law particularly for all infrastructure and industry projects.“I think we have reasons to maintain hope. He is an advocate with knowledge of environmental law and being one of the cadres he may listen to people’s voices. It’s an opportunity for the NDA to clean up the damage done through various dilutions in the past seven years,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, Chhattisgarh based lawyer who is working on cases related to Hasdeo Arand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-count-on-bhupender-yadav-to-tackle-environmental-challenges-101625772391387.html
09-07-2021||India||Will ex-ministers get roles in states, party?||Wednesday’s ministerial council reshuffle, in which 12 faces were dropped from the Union council of ministers, has led to speculation that some of them could be given organisational roles in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).According to party functionaries aware of the details, some of the former ministers could be offered gubernatorial positions, a few may have roles in the party’s national team, while others are likely to continue as members of Parliament and contribute to party work in their respective states.“There are a few gubernatorial positions where the incumbents are set to complete their term over the next few months such as in Punjab and Delhi and later in 2022 in states such as Assam and Tamil Nadu. Some of the senior members could be considered for these posts,” said a functionary who asked not to be named.Thawar Chand Gehlot, 73, one of the senior most leaders who was in charge of the social justice and empowerment ministry and the leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, was appointed Governor of Karnataka on Tuesday; and there is speculation that two other senior ministers, Prakash Javadekar (70) and Santosh Gangwar (72) may also be elevated as Governors.“Gangwar is a seasoned party man with considerable influence among the OBCs in Uttar Pradesh, so in the next few months the party is likely to use his expertise in drawing up the election blueprint in the state. Javadekar could also be roped in to help with the state elections coming up in 2022, as he has the experience of being in-charge of state polls,” said a second functionary on condition of anonymity.However, the functionaries also indicated that Javadekar may be given a role among the party’s national office-bearers.The people cited above said that the BJP leadership is counting on the organisational experience of some of the senior members to strengthen the organisation and its outreach. “Some of the ex-ministers joining the national team will bring heft to it,” said the first functionary.Former minister for Law & Justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad, is also among those who may get a position in the national office-bearers team. With the elevation of national general secretary Bhupender Yadav as Cabinet minister, there is a key vacancy in the team of national general secretaries. There are eight national general secretaries in the BJP and, as per the party constitution, there can be nine.“The party follows the norm of one person, one post. So the slots that will fall vacant in the national team can be filled with the ex-ministers. The party can have 15 national vice presidents and currently there are only 12; with the elevation of Annpurana Devi as minister, the number will now be 11. Similarly, there are 12 national secretaries instead of 15,” said the second functionary.There was no clarity on whether former health minister Harsh Vardhan will be made a part of the national team, or drafted to help the party unit in Delhi, where the BJP has lost heavily to the Aam Aadmi Party in the last two assembly elections. Vardhan held the position of Delhi unit president in 2014, and was the party’s chief ministerial candidate for that year’s state polls.Former HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and Sanjay Dhotre, who are said to be in poor health, are expected to be given time to recuperate. While a former minister said it is for the party to take a call on how it wants to use them, the first functionary quoted above said not getting organizational roles, will not mean a “demotion”.“There is a system of allowing younger and newer people to step ahead. Besides in 2004, after the BJP did not return to power at the centre, seniors who had been ministers such as Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan and Rajnath Singh were included as national general secretaries in M. Venkaiah Naidu’s national team. It is a process,” said the second functionary.The party will also have to name a new leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha after Gehlot’s elevation. The senior-most leaders in the Upper House, who are in contention for the post are BJP president JP Nadda, and Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan and Nirmala Sitharaman. “There has been a precedent that the post is given to a Cabinet minister; we will have to see if the party follows that,” said a third functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ex-ministers-get-roles-in-states-party-101625772026808.html
09-07-2021||India||Twitter must follow law of the land: IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw||The government’s new minister for electronics and information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday said the law of the land is supreme, and Twitter will have to fall in line with the new social media and intermediary guidelines.Vaishnaw’s remarks suggest he could continue his predecessor’s strong stance against the US-based company, which is yet to complete compliance requirements mandatory under the new rules.“Law of land is supreme, Twitter must follow rules,” the Union minister said, according to a ministry spokesperson.“Whoever is a citizen of India and those who stay in India will have to abide by the laws of the country,” he said while addressing journalists at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters.Twitter, separately, told the Delhi High Court that it will appoint a grievance redressal officer in keeping with the new guidelines within eight weeks after the bench asked it to put on oath its stand in the matter, giving it two weeks’ time.The ministry submitted in the court that if it did not comply, it will lose the safe harbour protection for user content under section 79, of the IT Act – which means it could become liable for content that users create.Minister of state for MeitY Rajeev Chandrashekhar also told reporters that the issue will be addressed by the ministry and the new minister. “I have just taken the charge,” he said. “The ministry doesn’t operate on a unilateral basis and this has nothing to do with individual views and opinions. The ministry will sit with the new Union minister and address all these issues.”Vaishnaw’s predecessor Ravi Shankar Prasad was locked in an escalating conflict with the social media company for over a month and half now. All clauses of the new guidelines came into effect on May 25, which included the appointment of an India-based grievance redressal and nodal officer and a compliance officer.The ministry asserted that Twitter failed to appoint a compliance officer, and its grievance officer and address were not in keeping with the rules which demanded an Indian resident and local address. Prasad’s ministry threatened Twitter with the loss of safe harbour, which provides the company protection from action against third party content.The government’s battle with Twitter began over blocking access to several accounts that carried a controversial hashtag, including accounts of activists and media professionals. Twitter refused to cede space on the implementation of its policies, as it said it was defending free speech.The company, in turn, raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines, prompting a strong response from the government which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.Twitter was also targeted by the government when it tagged posts by prominent BJP politicians Sambit Patra and Vinay Sahasrabuddhe as manipulated media, and briefly locked out Prasad from his account over an alleged copyright infringement.The new IT minister joined the BJP as recently as 2019 after becoming a member of the Rajya Sabha. Vaishnaw, 51, has served as the private secretary to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004, after serving a brief stint with the Prime Minister’s Office during Vajpayee’s term in 2002. He was educated at MBM Engineering College, Jodhpur, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Wharton Business School. In 2006, he also served as the deputy chairman of Goa’s Mormugoa Port Trust.“Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modiji’s vision is to transform the lives of the poor, marginalized communities, farmers, middle classes, youth, women and weaker sections of the society... Railways, Communication and Technology touch the lives of all Indians. I will work to fulfil the Prime Minister’s vision,” a government statement quoted Vaishnaw as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-must-follow-law-of-the-land-it-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-101625771832237.html
09-07-2021||India||ED probe against him politically motivated, says NCP’s Eknath Khadse||Another senior leader from Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is in trouble. Eknath Khadse, former revenue minister, was questioned by the enforcement directorate (ED) for nine hours in the alleged money laundering case on Thursday.Khadse joined the NCP in October last year and has been facing investigation by the central agency since December 2020, two months after leaving the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On Wednesday, his son-in-law Girish Choudhary was arrested by ED in the same case. “In my view all this started after I joined NCP by leaving BJP… The case is politically motivated. Efforts are made to frame me in it by any means. For the last eight days, a message has been going viral on social media in Jalgaon (district) that something related to me is about to happen. The way (BJP) activists are aware of the ED action in advance indicates that it is a conspiracy but I’m ready to face it,” Khadse told reporters outside ED office on Thursday morning.He said that Maharashtra and the entire country is watching what is going on. The case has been probed five times by different agencies. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has given him a clean chit by submitting a C-summary report. “The land I bought is privately owned and not of MIDC. The corporation has not completed the process of acquisition. They have neither paid the compensation nor taken its possession,” Khadse stressed.“Khadse’s induction in NCP has irritated the BJP which is using central agencies to frame him in a case. He is innocent and we are sure he will come out clean,” said Jayant Patil, state NCP chief. Patil said that a commission formed by the erstwhile the BJP-led government has also given him a clean chit.Khadse is under scrutiny for allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal in Bhosari near Pune. The plot was bought by his wife Mandakini and son-in-law in 2016 for ₹3.75 crore against the prevalent market rate of ₹30 crore. According to the ED officials, Khadse and his family fraudulently purchased the said land, despite having knowledge that it was reserved for Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), so that they could claim the compensation of more than double the market rate when the MIDC acquired it.He would be the third NCP leader who would be going behind the bars on corruption charges, if arrested. Before him, senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal and Gularao Deokar have faced arrest over corruption charges. Bhujbal is currently out on bail and is holding food and civil supplies portfolio in the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government in the state.Besides, one more NCP leader and former home minister Anil Deshmukh is also facing an investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED over charges of extortion made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh has moved the Supreme Court seeking protection from coercive action in a money laundering case.In 2016, Bhujbal, also former deputy chief minister, was also arrested in a money laundering case and was in jail for two years before he got bail on health grounds in May 2018. He was arrested by ED for allegedly receiving kickbacks worth crores for awarding various government contracts, including the Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi.Before him, Deokar, former minister and a NCP leader from Jalgaon district, was arrested in May 2012. He spent around three years behind bars before getting bail. He was found involved in a 1997 housing scam related to the construction of 11,000 low-cost houses in Jalgaon in north Maharashtra and was convicted by a sessions court in 2019, along with 47 others. Deokar was a member of the Jalgaon Municipal Council from 1995 to 2000 when the scam took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-probe-against-him-politically-motivated-says-ncp-s-eknath-khadse-101625771514415.html

It was reopened recently.Both Baranarayan and Dhanpur fall in the Sonamura sub division of Sepahijala district. “Our party offices at Baranarayan and Dhanpur were destroyed after Pratima Bhowmik took oath as Union minister. We need not to say more,” said Left Front convener Bijan Dhar.BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharjee said: “Why didn’t they file a complaint in the police station? We guess that their own people did this to blame us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-cpm-alleges-2-of-its-offices-vandalised-by-bjp-101625771608764.html
09-07-2021||India||Modi stresses need for modern, flexible education models||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday interacted with directors of top centrally-funded technical institutions and stressed on the need to develop “innovative” and “flexible” education models to meet future needs, and make India a “hub for research and development”.A statement issued by the Prime Minister Office (PMO) said Modi emphasised the need to adapt higher and technical education to keep in tune with the changing environment and emerging challenges.“This requires the institutions to reinvent and re-evaluate themselves, develop alternative and innovative models in accordance with the present and future needs of the country and society... There is a need to progress towards education models that are flexible, seamless, and able to provide learning opportunities as per requirements of the learners,” Modi said at the virtual interaction, adding that access, affordability, equity and quality should be the core values of such education models.The interaction was attended by over 100 heads of institutes, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Indian Institute of Science. It was also joined by newly-elected Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and ministers of state for education.Officials who attended the meeting said Modi was briefed on the ongoing research and development (R&D work) at these institutions and on the improvement in the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years.“Digitisation of higher education can play a big role in increasing GER, and students will have easier access to good quality and affordable education,” Modi said.GER is a statistical measure used in the education sector to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level.The Prime Minister lauded the R&D work carried by these institutions towards meeting challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.“Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when we celebrate 100 years of Independence. We need to focus on developing futuristic solutions in fields of education, healthcare, agriculture,defense, and cyber technologies,” he said.The Prime Minister also spoke on the need to develop an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages.“Had an enriching interaction with Directors of leading IITs and @iiscbangalore during which we exchanged thoughts on a wide range of subjects including making India a hub for R&D (Research and Development), innovation and popularising science among the youth,” Modi tweeted after the interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-stresses-need-for-modern-flexible-education-models-101625771312532.html
09-07-2021||India||Uttarakhand to review decision to stop Kanwar Yatra amid Covid-19||Uttarakhand on Thursday decided to review its decision to stop all Kanwar yatra devotees from entering the state this year, prompting experts to caution about a steep surge in Covid infections if safety protocols are violated.The decision on the yatra, which sees millions of people travel through several states by foot to the holy town of Haridwar, came a day after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath cleared the event and asked Uttarakhand to allow the procession.On Tuesday, the state government had decided not to allow the yatra over fears of a third Covid wave and increasing cases of delta variant in the state. The last Kanwar yatra was held in 2019 and roughly 30 million pilgrims reached Haridwar, as per official records.A senior official privy to the developments said chief minister Pushkar Dhami met senior officials on Thursday to discuss Kanwar yatra.“It was decided that state government will first hold talks with other states from where Kanwariyas come on how to conduct the yatra amid fears of the third wave, how the millions of pilgrims would be tested and whether there should be a cap on the numbers this time. The final call [on how to allow the yatra]will be taken after talks in a day or two,” said the official quoted above.Ashok Kumar, director-general of police (DGP) Uttarakhand, who was present in the meeting, said that Kanwar yatra was discussed in the meeting. “Various aspects of the yatra were discussed and pros and cons were weighed,” he said.This is the first major administrative decision by Dhami, who took charge on July 4. His predecessor, Tirath Singh Rawat, resigned on July 2 amid controversy over his administration’s decision to allow the Mahakumbh in Haridwar and large-scale fraud in testing during the holy event.Both Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party and are scheduled to go to the polls early next year.On Tuesday, the state government had issued an order stating that Kanwar pilgrims from neighbouring states won’t be allowed to enter Haridwar.Uttarakhand Police also held meeting with senior police officials of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab. Kumar had told his counterparts to publicise the government order on the ban and ask pilgrims from their states not to come to Haridwar.The state police had also decided to seal the borders of the state from July 22 to ensure Kanwariyas don’t enter Haridwar from Uttar Pradesh or Himachal Pradesh.But on Wednesday, Uttar Pradesh allowed the yatra from July 25. Adityanth also asked UP officials to coordinate to Uttarakhand administration and resolve any lingering problems.The fortnight-long Kanwar yatra is an annual pilgrimage of Shiva devotees -- known as Kanwariyas -- to Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand to fetch the water of the Ganga and carry it back to local temples. Devotees come from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh to Uttarakhand.The yatra was cancelled last year due to Covid and is usually held from July 23 to August 6.Uttarakhand government received sharp criticism from experts and the judiciary over its decision to allow full-scale organisation of the Mahakumbh, which saw 9.1 million people participate in violation of Covid norms and distancing guidelines. Roughly six million of these was in April at the height of the second wave and officials in many other north Indian states traced local infection surges to Kumbh returnees. The administration is probing if 100,000 rapid antigen tests at the event were faked.On June 28, the Uttarakhand high court also lashed out at the state government for allowing the Char Dham yatra and stayed its cabinet decision in this regard.Dr DD Choudhary, senior member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Uttarakhand said allowing Kanwar Yatra at this juncture will be a disaster. “The Kanwar yatra has the potential to spread the third wave like wildfire. It just needs few infected Kanwars to spread the Delta plus variant, which has also been detected in Uttarakhand now,” the doctor said.Rajesh Shivpuri, Garhwal-based political observer, said allowing millions of pilgrims when the country is readying to battle the third wave can be dangerous. “Every aspect should be considered before allowing Kanwar pilgrimage. It won’t be easy to manage Kanwariyas even if Kanwar yatra specific SoP is issued and restrictions are put in place,” he said.Suryakant Dhasmana, senior vice president of Uttarakhand Congress, criticised the state government’s U-turn. “Everyone knows what happened in Mahakumbh, what mess they have left behind, and how they endangered the lives of millions of people through fake Covid tests. During Kanwar yatra, which is mostly unorganised, with people come from different states, how can they manage such huge numbers at a time when they should be readying for third wave?” he asked.However, traders in Haridwar welcomed the decision. “All religious, festive baths and pilgrimages are being held in UP, then why not in our Uttarakhand. Right now, the Covid wave has come down sharply and the state is reporting few daily cases. There is no rationale in keeping the ban on the yatra,” said Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal Haridwar district president Sunil Sethi.(With inputs from Sandeep Rawat from Haridwar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-review-decision-to-stop-kanwar-yatra-amid-covid19-101625770859293.html

09-07-2021||India||Officials in rail minister’s office to work in 2 shifts to keep up with him||New Delhi: Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw ordered officials and staffers in his office to work in two shifts to keep pace with him. The first shift will start at 7am, an order by his office said hours after he took charge on Thursday.“Hon’ble MR (Minister of Railways) has directed that all the officers and staff of MR Cell will work in two shifts i.e. 7:00 hrs-16:00 hrs and 15:00 hrs -12:00 midnight with immediate effect,” the order said, formalising nine-hour shifts in his office.The 50-year-old bureaucrat-turned-politician from Odisha was inducted into the cabinet in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet reshuffle exercise nearly two years after he was elected to the Rajya Sabha on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket.Vaishnaw, who is known to work till midnight, was allocated the ministry of railways, the ministry of communications, and the ministry of electronics and information technology.“There are lots of synergies in the three and I will be working to ensure that his (PM Modi’s) vision is implemented,” Vaishnaw told reporters as he took charge.Vaishnaw, an engineer by training, worked as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer for over 15 years after getting masters degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur). He later went to Wharton University in the USA to pursue an MBA and after some time after completing the course quit government service so that he could quickly pay off the loans.On his return, after working for top firms, he set up his own automotive components manufacturing units in Gujarat and at one point, even lived out of a container “as I wanted that factory to come out in record time”, he told HT in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-in-rail-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-s-office-to-work-in-2-shifts-to-keep-up-with-him-101625770526494.html
09-07-2021||India||Have right to suspend any account that violates terms: Twitter to high court||Social media firm Twitter on Thursday told the Delhi high court that it can suspend the account of any individual user found in breach of their service agreement, and that it has a “contractual obligation” to do so.The company, in response to a plea by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde challenging the suspension of his Twitter account, said that its services are “purely in the nature of a voluntary service” which it “provides to its users in a commercial capacity”.The social media intermediary also said there was no element of public function involved, and it was not obligated to render its service to further the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.“…the provision of services on Twitter is pursuant to a contractual obligation which the petitioner (Hegde) has signed up for, and the said contract gives Respondent No 2 (Twitter) the right to suspend an account if it is in violation of the user agreement and its policies. This shows that Respondent No 2 is merely discharging its contractual obligations,” Twitter said in an affidavit filed on Wednesday.“…the provision of service of Twitter is in no matter relatable to any function of the State carried out in its sovereign capacity; Its service is not in any manner a State protected monopoly, since there are multiple other such service providers which are intermediaries discharging similar functions,” the reply added.It also said that its services extended beyond the territorial boundaries of India, and it cannot be said that the platform owed a duty to the Indian public to facilitate free speech and expression.“For any activity to be classified as a public duty, it is necessary that a positive obligation is cast to discharge that duty. Efforts which are purely voluntary cannot be said to have the necessary public element in them,” Twitter told the high court.In December 2019, Hegde moved the high court challenging the permanent suspension of his account --“@sanjayuvacha”, from November 5, 2019 — alleging that the move was “arbitrary”, illegal as contrary to Twitter’s rules.According to the petition, Hegde’s account was suspended for allegedly re-tweeting two posts on the micro-blogging site.One of the posts was that of Kavita Krishnan, secretary of All India Progressive Women’s Association and member of CPI(ML) politburo who had shared Gorakh Pandey’s poem “Unko phaansi de do” in 2019.Hegde had re-tweeted the post with the caption “Hang Him”, an English translation of the poem’s title, the plea read.The second post was a picture of August Landmesser which Hegde was using as his profile header/ cover photo for over a year.The plea also contended that the suspension of account was a violation of his right to free speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (a)of the Indian Constitution.Advocate Pranjal Kishore, appearing for Hegde, sought directions to the Centre to frame guidelines to ensure that online speech is not arbitrarily censored by social media firms such as Twitter. He also sought restoration of the account.The petitioner argued that since Twitter imparts a public function, which is being a social media platform, facilitating the exchange of information and ideas, the plea was maintainable.Opposing this stand, Twitter said that its services were covered under the Information Technology Rules, and there was a mechanism provided under it, in case a user is aggrieved by any act or omission by an intermediary.Twitter has been in the eye of controversy over the past few months. On May 20, it labelled a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra “manipulated media” prompting a Delhi Police investigation. The special cell of Delhi Police questioned Manish Maheshwari, managing director of Twitter in India, in late May.The company then missed a May 25 deadline to comply with the new guidelines for intermediaries and social media firms, and an official in the IT ministry previously told HT that the company would lose the protection it enjoyed as an intermediary under the country’s IT law as a result.The Ghaziabad Police has been wanting to question Maheshwari over a video clip that went viral last month. The police believe Twitter did not do enough to halt the circulation of the clip which they believe misrepresents the nature of an attack on an elderly Muslim man as a communal hate crime. The Karkataka high court gave the Twitter executive protection from arrest and told the Ghaziabad Police that they could question him virtually, a ruling that has since been challenged in the Supreme Court.“Respondent No 2 (Twitter), in accordance with the IT Act and applicable rules has a grievance redressal mechanism and the petitioner’s recourse is to file a complaint on the said portal. The petitioner (Hegde), by filing this writ petition, is attempting to give a purely contractual dispute the colour of a public function allegedly being performed by it solely to make it amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the Court,” the reply by the social media firm said.Senior advocate Pavan Duggal said that even though the two parties are engaged in a contractual obligation, the agreement would not hold water in any court if it is in violation of the laws and the rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. If Twitter has suspended any account, then the IT Rules mandate that it has to be transparent and the site must spell out the reason for suspension, he said.The matter will now heard on August 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-right-to-suspend-any-account-that-violates-terms-twitter-to-high-court-101625769948730.html
09-07-2021||India||Tomy seeks funds to reattempt race that nearly proved fatal for him||NEW DELHI: In the 75th year of the country’s Independence, a champion Indian sailor will attempt a feat that almost killed him three years ago --- an enormously challenging solo and non-stop circumnavigation race that bars the use of modern technology. But Abhilash Tomy’s quest for sailing glory faces a funding hurdle; he needs to raise up to ₹4 crore to get through to the 2022 edition of the quadrennial Golden Globe Race (GGR). Struggling to find sponsors for the around-the-world race, the former navy commander has decided to take a shot at crowdfunding to be able to compete in the gruelling event, an endurance test like no other in the world of competitive sailing. “I could not finish the 2018 edition of the race because of an accident. It’s been in my head for a long time. I am ready for the unfinished business. I have launched a crowd-funding campaign to arrange funds for a boat and several other associated expenses,” Tomy said over phone from Goa. He has launched a fundraising campaign on the Ketto crowdfunding platform, and fondly describes his supporters as “crew” who stand a chance “to be a part of a race around the world.” Tomy suffered a debilitating back injury on September 21, 2018, after rough seas and powerful winds in the southern Indian Ocean , one of the remotest spots on Earth, crippled his yacht, SV Thuriya. He was rescued 70 hours later. “I did not suffer from any post-traumatic stress disorder after the accident. There are no fear issues. I was doing fairly well until the storm took Thuriya down. I regard my participation in GGR-22 as a fitting tribute to the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence,” he said. Before the September 21 accident, Tomy was in the third position among 11 international participants and had sailed more than 10,500 nautical miles since the race began on July 1, 2018, from a port in France. That was the 50th year of the race that commemorates Robin Knox-Johnston’s feat in 1968, with participants required to operate under the same conditions, even navigating using charts and the stars. “This time it’s going to be even harder as participants will be given only 25 litres of fuel compared to 120 litres in 2018. I kept all the fuel for power generation. This time I will be dependent on sun and winds to charge batteries. The good thing is that participants will be allowed to carry cameras this time,” said Tomy, who took premature retirement from the navy in January 2021. Tomy became the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe on board his previous boat Mhadei, solo, non-stop and unassisted, in 2013. At the end of the five-month-long voyage, the President of India received Tomy and his boat at the Gateway of India in Mumbai. He was awarded India’s second-highest peace-time gallantry award, Kirti Chakra, for the achievement. Tomy has raised around ₹1.5 lakh on the crowdfunding platform over the last two days against a goal of ₹3 crore. He launched the campaign on July 6. “It all boils down to how much money I can raise. There are costs associated with getting a boat, its refit, entry fee for the event, technical managers and other expenses. I have approached some corporate houses too but haven’t had any response so far,” he said. Tomy first announced that he would take part in GGR-22 at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit-2019. Speaking at the 17th edition of the summit, he gave details of the harrowing moments that abruptly ended his participation in GGR-18 but thrust him into the spotlight for surviving an ordeal that tested the limits of human endurance. “When the boat turned upright after the second knockdown, my wrist was stuck on wires connecting the mast. At one point, the strap of my watch broke, and I fell nine metres on a piece of aluminium called the boom. Then I fell to the deck on my back. I cleaned up some of the broken equipment, but half an hour later, I could not stand,” said Tomy of the moments that turned out to be the point when he broke his spine in four places. When a rescue team --- a coordinated effort of four nations --- finally reached him, his first thought was that he was hallucinating. “After 48 hours of sleep deprivation, hallucination is common. When I heard the knock, I thought this could be a hallucination and I must be prepared for that. But then they were there, real people — and I told them you are like angels to me,” he said at the summit.Now he needs more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tomy-seeks-funds-to-reattempt-race-that-nearly-proved-fatal-for-him-101625769927125.html
09-07-2021||India||Violence mars filing of papers for block panchayat chief in UP||Incidents of firing, clashes, verbal duels between opponents and accusations of obstructions in filing papers were reported in 17 different blocks in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday, when filing of nominations for the post of block panchayat heads at 825 blocks across 75 districts were held, senior police officials said.Additional director general of police (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar, however, said the incidents were reported from only 14 places.He added that directives have been issued to district police authorities to ensure stern action against troublemakers. Stating that incidents of violence were reported away from nomination centres, Kumar admitted that it did cause law and order trouble, following which cases were filed.The ADG also said that extra police arrangements have been ordered for Friday, when candidates can take back their nominations, and on Saturday, when voting will take place to elect the block panchayat chiefs.Another police official said major trouble was reported from Sitapur’s Kasmanda block, where supporters of Bharatiya Janata Party and independent candidates scuffled while returning from the nomination centre. He said the incident led to firing between the supporters, in which three people suffered bullet injuries and were rushed to Lucknow for further treatment.A local resident in the area, however, alleged that the incident took place even as police personnel were present at some distance from the nomination centre. A video of Sitapur violence, which has gone viral, purportedly shows police personnel running for shelter amid indiscriminate firing by troublemakers. HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.In an incident, reported in Unnao’s Purwa block, the son of a BJP candidate alleged that the Samajwadi Party candidate in the block along with her supporters attacked and robbed him while he was returning home on Wednesday night. It led to a confrontation between supporters of the BJP and SP outside the nomination centre.In Ambedkar Nagar, former Bahujan Samaj Party minister Lalji Verma accused BJP candidate Tejaswi Jaiswal of snatching nomination form from his hand and misbehaving while he was going to extend support to another candidate at Tanda block.In Bahraich and Kannuaj, there were reports of stone-pelting between opponent groups, but no major injuries were reported, police said. Similar confrontations and verbal duels were also reported from Mainpuri, Siddarthnagar, Jaunpur, Ayodhya, Bulandshahr, Bijnor, Siddarthnagar, Amroha, Jhansi, Gorakhpur, Pilibhit and Basti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-mars-filing-of-papers-for-block-panchayat-chief-in-up-101625769543309.html
09-07-2021||India||Give plan to comply on oath: HC to Twitter||The Delhi high court on Thursday pulled up Twitter for its delay in appointing the resident grievance officers, making it clear that the social media company cannot be given eight weeks to meet the terms of the new Information Technology (IT) rules, and said the Union government was free to take action if the company did not comply.Twitter had sought eight weeks to appoint permanent grievance officers and to set up a liaison office in India, a request the court denied.“No, no... I am not giving eight weeks,” said justice Rekha Palli, while adding: “I am not going to protect you… You have also not set up a liaison office which was another requirement under the Rules”.Senior advocate Sajan Poovaya, representing Twitter, told the court that it was not seeking any protection. “The consequence (of non-compliance) is that the protection to intermediaries falls off. I’m not seeking any protection,” he said. Poovaya said the company was reserving its right to challenge the rules for now, to which the judge said: “You have the right to challenge but till the Rules are there, they’re there for everybody.” Close to 10 entities – tech companies, news websites, advocacy groups and private individuals – have challenged the new IT rules. While some, such as Facebook-owned WhatsApp, have challenged specific clauses, others, like Carnatic musician TM Krishna, have argued that the rules in entirety violate multiple provisions of the Constitution. The government has said that the rules are an important tool to protect the rights of Indian users and compel the digital companies to respect Indian rules and regulations. “While Twitter is striving to comply with the 2021 Rules, Twitter reserves its right to challenge the legality, validity, and vires of the Rules, and Twitter’s submissions regarding compliance are filed without prejudice to its right to challenge the Rules,” a document filed by Twitter in the high court said.Twitter on Thursday informed the high court that it appointed an interim chief compliance officer (COO) on July 6 as a contingent worker through a third party contractor, who is a resident of India, and it would require eight weeks to replace the position with a permanent employee.The social media intermediary also said that it is in the process of making an appointment of an Indian resident as its interim resident grievance officer (RGO) and expects to do so on or before July 11.The company also added that it intends to employ an interim nodal contact officer within two weeks and a regular employee within eight weeks.On yet another compliance requirement, which mandates big social media companies to publish a compliance report, the company promised to do so by July 11, the government’s deadline. Twitter’s submission came after the high court on July 6 asked the social media intermediary to give a deadline for appointing the three grievance redressal officers. The court had warned Twitter “will be in trouble” if it doesn’t comply.It had also pulled up the company for “misleading” the court and giving “wrong impression” on the appointment of a regular grievance officer. The court took exception to not being informed that an earlier appointment of the resident grievance officer was only on interim basis.Proceedings in the high court started with senior advocate Poovaya telling the court that his client was making all out efforts to comply with the new IT Rules. He said that usage of “interim” would not lessen or minimise the responsibilities on these officers.The high court, however, said: “Tomorrow you may take benefit of “interim”. This (your stand) is neither in the letter (to the Centre) nor in an affidavit.”Responding to a query of court, Poovaya said the officers have been appointed in interim because they do not have a permanent address in India and some tax issues might crop up. To this justice Palli said, “Okay, but I am not going to protect you.”Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, for the Centre, objected to the reply filed by Twitter and said that the appointments made could not be permitted through a third party.“This is not diplomatic parlance. We want accountability, full accountability of great servitude. It can’t be left in half-way house via third party…They’ve talked about making appointments through a third party. What is this third party? Where is it coming from? Let’s say I am a pharma or an IT company in the US…No court would give them leeway like this. I have to be in 100% compliance with the Rules,” Sharma argued.When Poovaya said that the Centre cannot hold them for contempt for the contents of their affidavit, the court observed: “I am not going into that right now, but you are already in contempt. You had said something in the last hearing, now you are going back on it and trying to salvage the situation maybe.”The court noted that Twitter has not filed an affidavit but has given a short memo signed by the counsel in which they stated to fully comply with the Rules, as long as there is no stay.It granted two weeks’ time to Twitter to file hard copies of the notarised affidavit of a competent officer, along with the affidavit of the officer already stated to have been appointed and the persons who are being appointed.Since early 2021, the company has had multiple disputes with the government, beginning with tweets relating to the farm protests that the government sought to be taken down. In recent weeks, former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has publicly spoken against Twitter for its content moderation practices, while cases have been filed against Twitter’s executives over user content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-plan-to-comply-on-oath-hc-to-twitter-101625769868227.html
09-07-2021||India||Experts count on Bhupender to tackle environmental challenges||New Delhi Environmentalists and former bureaucrats on Thursday welcomed the appointment of Bhupender Yadav as the new Union minister for environment, citing his understanding of complex issues surrounding the environment and the climate crisis.On Thursday morning, Yadav started his first day in office by participating in a plantation drive, following which he held a meeting with senior officials of the ministry to review ongoing projects and issues.“Assumed charge of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (@moefcc) today. The PM Sh @narendramodi ji’s govt is committed to sustainable development. I wish to be able to ensure India [attains] those goals,” he said in a Twitter post.A senior environment ministry official said: “He seems soft spoken and more understanding of complex issues surrounding environment and climate change.”A lawyer and former national secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Yadav is also called the “Committee Man” due to his history of chairing several parliamentary committees on critical issues such as the Rajya Sabha Select Committee on Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015, among others.Yadav co-authored a book, titled “Supreme Court on Forest Conservation”, with environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta in 2011 on the legal aspects of forest conservation in India.“Its good that a lawyer has taken charge of the ministry. The ministry was circumventing the parliamentary process through various office memorandums and orders. I really hope he addresses that first. Given his background in law, he can help improve the functioning of the ministry. He has been associated with various environmental movements and has taken up environmental cases so he knows the issues very well. He has chaired the highest number of parliamentary committees also,” said Dutta.Over the past few years, the Prakash Javadekar-led ministry, faced widespread public backlash over various controversial decisions.The draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, published on March 23, 2020, has been in the eye of the storm over certain clauses, which can weaken the process of environmental appraisal of industries and infrastructure projects. On July 8 last year, the Delhi Police had sent a notice to youth climate group Fridays for Future, under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for sending multiple emails to Javadekar against the draft EIA 2020. Later, the Delhi Police termed the notice a clerical error.The ministry has, so far, received over 200,000 objections and comments on the draft EIA 2020, which are being assessed by a committee.“With the change in guard in the MoEFCC, let’s hope that the high-handedness and arrogance will give way to humility and rational decision-making benefitting forestry,” said Anup Nayak, former member secretary, national tiger conservation authority (NTCA) in a Twitter post.At present, several large infrastructure projects, including township planning in the fragile Andaman and Nicobar Islands; the Char Dham road project through Himalayas in Uttarakhand; hydropower projects in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley and mining in Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand forests, are being considered by the environment ministry.According to officials, the ministry has also started amending almost all environmental legislations to ensure they meet current requirements.The ministry’s wildlife division has prepared a cabinet note to amend the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which is yet to be cleared by the cabinet; a similar note on the amendment to Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 has also been finalised after circulating it internally among ministries.Recently, the ministry called for expressions of interest from consulting agencies, firms, and joint venture consortiums to prepare a new draft amendment to the Indian Forest Act, 1927. A private law firm is preparing a draft environmental management act which will subsume the Air Act 1981, Water Act 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and serve as an overarching law particularly for all infrastructure and industry projects.“I think we have reasons to maintain hope. He is an advocate with knowledge of environmental law and being one of the cadres he may listen to people’s voices. It’s an opportunity for the NDA to clean up the damage done through various dilutions in the past seven years,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, Chhattisgarh based lawyer who is working on cases related to Hasdeo Arand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-count-on-bhupender-to-tackle-environmental-challenges-101625769325839.html
09-07-2021||India||Afghanistan situation to figure in India-Russia talks tomorrow||New Delhi: The situation in Afghanistan, forthcoming India-Russia meetings, and bilateral cooperation in security and defence will figure in talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on July 9. Jaishankar is currently on a three-day visit to Russia, during which his discussions with his interlocutors are expected to cover the entire range of bilateral issues, including cooperation in the fight against Covid-19, and various regional and international developments. The talks with Lavrov will be Jaishankar’s main engagement in Moscow, and the Russian foreign ministry said on Thursday the two sides will compare notes on “major global and regional issues, including the political process in Afghanistan, settlement in Syria [and the] situation around the Iranian nuclear program”. The two sides will also discuss cooperation at the UN, Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) “in the RIC format”, the Russian foreign ministry said, referring to the Russia-India-China grouping. In an indication of the differences between India and Russia on the Indo-Pacific concept, the Russian foreign ministry said the discussions are also expected to touch up “approaches to the formation of reliable and indivisible security architecture in the Pacific and Indian oceans”. Lavrov has been openly critical of the Indo-Pacific concept, which now forms a key part of India’s foreign policy and cooperation under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue format (which includes the US, Japan and Australia). Last December, Lavrov had said Western powers have adopted an “aggressive and devious” policy to engage India “in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies”. India has dismissed these concerns by saying the Indo-Pacific is an inclusive concept that can even be joined by Russia. The Russian foreign ministry noted that interaction with India was “successfully developing in all areas in line with a special and privileged strategic partnership, including political dialogue, security, trade and economic, military-technical, scientific, cultural and humanitarian ties”. It added that the foreign ministers are expected to discuss “key directions of the Russian-Indian relations, taking into account the previously reached agreements and upcoming contacts, in particular at the highest and high levels”. The annual India-Russia Summit is slated for later this year, while a meeting of the bilateral inter-governmental commission on trade, economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation will be held in Delhi in August, and a meeting of the inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation will be held in Moscow in November. The Russian foreign ministry further said the two countries share a similar vision of a “model of an emerging more fair and equitable polycentric world order”, and “demonstrate the similarity or proximity of positions on the most important issues of peace and security”. Jaishankar’s visit to Moscow is a follow-up to the trip by Lavrov to New Delhi in April. Besides holding talks with Lavrov, Jaishankar will also meet deputy prime minister Yuri Borisov, his counterpart for the inter-governmental commission on trade, economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation, and the chairman of the state Duma committee on international affairs, Leonid Slutsky. Jaishankar also delivered a speech on “India-Russia ties in a changing world” at the prestigious Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-situation-to-figure-in-india-russia-talks-tomorrow-101625742745162.html
09-07-2021||India||India must adapt to changing times, adopt new tech: Hardeep Puri||New Delhi India needs to adapt to changing times, adopt new technologies and be in consonance with the transition taking place across the world, said Hardeep Singh Puri as he took charge of the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas on Thursday.“As we transform towards a $5 trillion economy, energy availability and consumption will be of paramount importance. My focus will be on increasing domestic production of crude and natural gas, in line with the Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. I will also work towards development of a natural gas-based economy in the country and increase the share of natural gas in the primary energy mix of the country to 15% by 2030 as announced by the PM,” said Puri, who is also the Union minister in charge of housing and urban affairs.Puri, a 1974-batch Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, has been put in charge of the nation’s energy security as the country undergoes an energy transition, with several new-age fuels in play.“The work of this ministry touches each and every citizen in the country directly or indirectly. The energy issues in this ministry have immense potential and several challenges. The need to adapt to changing times, adopt new technologies and to be in consonance with the energy transition taking place across the world, provides a fascinating opportunity,” he added.A Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh, Puri took charge of his new office in the presence of his predecessor Dharmendra Pradhan, who has now been given the education portfolio.“Today, I feel honoured by the trust reposed in me by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji, who has made me the Cabinet minister of this important ministry. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan ji’s are big shoes to fill,” said Puri.“In the last seven years, a number of path-breaking reforms and initiatives have been ushered in the sector. I would strive to take them forward, and fulfil the expectations of the Prime Minister, our people and the country,” he added.The new minister of state in the petroleum and natural gas ministry, Rameswar Teli, also took charge of his new office on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-adapt-to-changing-times-new-tech-hardeep-puri-101625736144659.html
09-07-2021||India||Twitter must follow law of the land: IT minister||New Delhi: The government’s new minister for electronics and information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday said the law of the land is supreme, and Twitter will have to fall in line with the new social media and intermediary guidelines.Vaishnaw’s remarks suggest he could continue his predecessor’s strong stance against the US-based company, which is yet to complete compliance requirements mandatory under the new rules. “Law of land is supreme, Twitter must follow rules,” the Union minister said, according to a ministry spokesperson. “Whoever is a citizen of India and those who stay in India will have to abide by the laws of the country,” he said while addressing journalists at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters. Twitter, separately, told the Delhi High Court that it will appoint a grievance redressal officer in keeping with the new guidelines within eight weeks after the bench asked it to put on oath its stand in the matter, giving it two weeks’ time. The ministry submitted in the court that if it did not comply, it will lose the safe harbour protection for user content under section 79, of the IT Act – which means it could become liable for content that users create. Minister of state for MeitY Rajeev Chandrashekhar also told reporters that the issue will be addressed by the ministry and the new minister. “I have just taken the charge,” he said. “The ministry doesn’t operate on a unilateral basis and this has nothing to do with individual views and opinions. The ministry will sit with the new Union minister and address all these issues.”Vaishnaw’s predecessor Ravi Shankar Prasad was locked in an escalating conflict with the social media company for over a month and half now. All clauses of the new guidelines came into effect on May 25, which included the appointment of an India-based grievance redressal and nodal officer and a compliance officer. The ministry asserted that Twitter failed to appoint a compliance officer, and its grievance officer and address were not in keeping with the rules which demanded an Indian resident and local address. Prasad’s ministry threatened Twitter with the loss of safe harbour, which provides the company protection from action against third party content. The government’s battle with Twitter began over blocking access to several accounts that carried a controversial hashtag, including accounts of activists and media professionals. Twitter refused to cede space on the implementation of its policies, as it said it was defending free speech. The company, in turn, raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines, prompting a strong response from the government which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”. Twitter was also targeted by the government when it tagged posts by prominent BJP politicians Sambit Patra and Vinay Sahasrabuddhe as manipulated media, and briefly locked out Prasad from his account over an alleged copyright infringement. The new IT minister joined the BJP as recently as 2019 after becoming a member of the Rajya Sabha. Vaishnaw, 51, has served as the private secretary to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004, after serving a brief stint with the Prime Minister’s Office during Vajpayee’s term in 2002. He was educated at MBM Engineering College, Jodhpur, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Wharton Business School. In 2006, he also served as the deputy chairman of Goa’s Mormugoa Port Trust.“Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modiji’s vision is to transform the lives of the poor, marginalized communities, farmers, middle classes, youth, women and weaker sections of the society... Railways, Communication and Technology touch the lives of all Indians. I will work to fulfil the Prime Minister’s vision,” a government statement quoted Vaishnaw as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-of-land-supreme-twitter-will-have-to-follow-rules-it-minister-101625735484916.html
09-07-2021||India||Karnataka veteran who made it to Modi’s council||Bengaluru: When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliament member A Narayanaswamy was denied entry into Paavgada village in Karnataka’s Tumakuru district in May 2019 because he is a Dalit, he refused to file a police complaint despite the humiliation. Narayanaswamy insisted it was more important to educate people than arrest them and won the village residents over. The residents welcomed him back to the village a day later as the lawmaker from the reserved constituency of Chitradurga, around 200 km from Bengaluru, wanted to highlight the poor condition of the schools in the region and encourage works under the Corporate Social Responsibility there.Narayanaswamy, 62, who is otherwise known for maintaining a low profile, hit the headlines through his gesture. He was back in the news on Wednesday when he was named as the minister of state for social justice and empowerment as part of the biggest reshuffle ever in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s council of ministers.Born on May 16, 1957, Narayanaswamy served as a four-time member of the Karnataka assembly between 1998 and 2013. He was also the chief whip of the BJP in the assembly for a year in 1998. Narayanaswamy was first made a state Cabinet minister in 2010. He has also served as a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources.“In these constituencies, elected legislators cannot afford to antagonise the upper castes. So that is probably among the reasons why he (Narayanaswamy) could have toned down his response to it. This dynamic is something that Dalit and ST MLAs reckon with across reserved political constituencies in the country,” Chandhan Gowda, a social scientist from Institute For Social and Econmic Change (ISEC) said. Ashwathnarayan’s elevation is seen as part of the attempt to provide representation to Dalits in Karnataka, where 2,327 cases of murder and other cases of atrocities were reported against the members of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities from April 2020 to March 2021 as per the official data. In 2019, 1,504 such cases were registered, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau.Karnataka is known for its prowess in technology, start-ups, aerospace, but the dark underbelly that the caste discrimination represents particularly in the state’s rural areas often goes unnoticed. The number of atrocities cases registered is believed to be low and the conviction rates are even lower. Due to the mediation by powerful and influential leaders, such cases often go unreported.Five of the 28 Lok Sabha constituencies are reserved for SCs and two for STs in Karnataka, where polls are due in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/known-to-keep-a-low-profile-narayanswamy-gets-a-place-in-union-cabinet-101625734345097.html
09-07-2021||India||Cabinet reshuffle may delay 1st data privacy law||India’s first data privacy law faces further delays as several members of a parliamentary committee, including its head, have been made ministers, weeks before its crucial report was expected to be presented to parliament during the Monsoon Session. The draft Personal Data Protection law was introduced in parliament in December, 2019 and is meant to provide the legal framework for the right to privacy of Indian citizens. But it was soon referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee to iron out several contentious issues. Members of the committee, people aware of the process and legal experts say replacements will now need to be appointed before the JPC report can be tabled. “The draft report remains to be circulated among members of the panel,” said a person aware of the developments, asking not to be named.The 30-member committee (which has two vacancies) includes Meenakshi Lekhi, who is the head, Ajay Bhatt, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Bhupender Yadav, and Ashwini Vaishnaw. These five were inducted in the government as ministers on Wednesday, which means they no longer can be part of the committee. The JPC got an extension first till the Winter Session last year, then until the first week of the second half of the Budget Session this year, and finally until the Monsoon Session this month. The committee has met various stakeholders, including industry representatives and civil society members. The bill covers the cross-border transfer of data and the use of personal data by government and private companies, and lays down penalties for entities that jeopardise the right to privacy of Indian citizens, which was held as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in August, 2017. The scope of the report is believed to have been expanded to cover not just personal data protection but also non-personal data. The panel’s report will aim to address “reasonable purposes for data sharing, exemptions for government agencies and sensitive personal data”, a person familiar with the matter said.Congress MP Manish Tewari, who is a member of the panel, alleged the report is stuck because “there is pressure on the government” from social media companies. “It has been seven months since deliberations of the committee closed. The chair made the committee members sit during the worst phase for Covid because she wanted to complete the report early. The draft is yet to be circulated not because she has not made the draft report, but obviously, since there is pressure from the social media companies on the government to not have a data protection law,” he said. “Ravi Shankar Prasad (former electronics and information technology minister) has been sacrificed at the altar of pleasing the social media giants. It is clear that social media companies are more powerful than the government.”Lekhi and Prasad did not respond to requests for a comment on these positions.Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh said he requested for the draft report of the bill to be circulated to its members. “Now, chairperson has become a minister along with 3 members. What happens now to committee & draft report? The new ministers had much to say on the Bill!” he said.Former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary said since it is a committee report, there is a sense of urgency to it. “If the Speaker wants, he can appoint a new chairperson today.” He added the procedure to be followed will depend on whether the chairperson has directed the secretariat to circulate the report. Achary said in that case, it will have to circulate a copy before a new chair is appointed. “Otherwise, the new chairperson will have to issue the directions,” he said. “The vacancies in the panel will be filled up once the parliamentary affairs minister gives the names of the new members to be added to the panel.”According to Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, Raman Chima, “A reminder that if an MP is appointed a Minister, they have to immediately leave any parliamentary committee and new folks appointed,” he said. “Ultimately of course, it’s a topic of extreme contestation as to whether on the really big issues of the present Government of India the individual ministers have much say beyond what the civil service and establishment connected to the PM’s office, Home Ministry, CabSec want.”Kazim Rizvi, founding director, The Dialogue, concurred with Chima and said that there might be a delay in appointing a new chairperson, “but we cannot ascertain for sure”. “Vacancies in the Committee can be filled by appointment or election by the House, based on a motion or the nomination by the Speaker,” he said. “Since ministers cannot hold membership to the standing committees, we will have a new chairperson of the JPC. The chairperson of the Committee has to be appointed by the Speaker from amongst the members.”HT reached out to the ministry of electronics and information technology but did not get an immediate response. This copy will be updated once the ministry responds||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-protection-report-may-be-delayed-as-house-panel-members-become-ministers-101625727144414.html
09-07-2021||Today's||The reshuffle is meant to secure Brand Modi||Commentators falling back on the usual tropes to understand the changes to the new Narendra Modi Cabinet have predictably fallen short.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its supporters have wanted the focus to be on the new entrants, the technocrats and professionals, the women, and the caste rainbow, media attention has invariably remained focused on the exits. But if there is any one message that emerges from the ministerial reshuffle, ironically, it is this. Ministers have never mattered less in the politics of India. Since the ascent of Narendra Modi in 2014, the country’s electoral choices, at least on the national stage, have been moving towards a presidential variation on a parliamentary democracy. Without a strong and compelling protagonist at the heart of the story, it is almost impossible to script an imaginative political drama any longer, whether in the states or at the Centre. This may seem counter-intuitive in the face of such significant alterations to the council of ministers. But think about it. The removal of 12 ministers has one singular aim — to insulate Brand Modi from the perceived inefficiencies, failures and controversies of his government. With these changes, the Prime Minister’s (PM) aim is to keep his own story unsullied and to suggest that, as the man in the lead role, he was let down by his supporting cast. That Harsh Vardhan has been shown the door in the aftermath of the lethal second wave is a no-brainer. Yet, everyone knows that the accountability for the callousness and clumsiness of government response, especially in the early stages, can hardly be placed at his door alone. As health minister, Harsh Vardhan was bumbling and incompetent for sure, but was hardly empowered enough to take many of the critical decisions, whether on vaccine procurement or the cancellation of mass congregations. Therein lies a tale.Amid mass graves of abandoned Covid bodies, anger among BJP voters over shortage of oxygen and intensive care unit beds, and soaring fuel prices, these changes to the Cabinet appear to be the PM’s attempt to reclaim the narrative at a time when the electoral consequences of the pandemic are still unclear. It is hard to believe that either Ravi Shankar Prasad or Prakash Javadekar, in charge of the information technology and information & broadcasting ministries respectively, had taken on big tech companies such as Twitter or formulated contentious new digital content guidelines without specific nudging from the top. Many theories have been put forth to understand their removal, including the need to keep Washington on India’s side. Perhaps the ministers showed less finesse and sophistication than was needed and brought embarrassing global attention to their mandates. But in their exits, the brutal truth of realpolitik is once again on display — sycophancy does not make you any less dispensable. With the next election three years away, and Covid-19 dragging the BJP into unchartered waters, more than anything less, the PM’s attention will be taken up by the outcomes in state assemblies. Brand Modi needs a win in Uttar Pradesh in 2022 to remain unchallenged. The number of ministers from UP (15) and Gujarat, both due for assembly polls. tells only half the story. The elaborate caste configuration of the Cabinet reinforces the growing mandalisation of the BJP’s politics. The carefully engineered representation seeks to shrug off the Brahmin-Bania tag. With its emphasis not just on Dalit representation, but also on the middle castes, the party understands that the Other Backward Classes (OBC) vote is the layer over which Hindutva politics has to be constructed. Three decades ago, VP Singh, the crafty former PM, posited the politics of social justice in opposition to the politics of Hindutva. Caste-based parties of UP and Bihar were the main bulwark that stood against the BJP juggernaut with LK Advani at the steering wheel. Today, history has turned full circle. Advani is out in the wilderness and the BJP can weld OBC politics with hard Hindutva, depending on the state and the circumstance. Till the Opposition is able to throw up an alternative national personality to take on Brand Modi, one around which a different play can be scripted, this will remain the main import of the Cabinet expansion.

09-07-2021||Today's||Dowry: The persistence of a social evil||Three deaths, 10 days, 60 years of an anti-dowry law. Cold numbers that tell you not just about the pervasive power of dowry, but its spread to states where it was relatively unknown.The deaths over 10 days of Vismaya (22), Archana (24) and Suchithra (19) following alleged violence over dowry in Kerala, the state with the best gender indices — literacy, maternal mortality, sex ratio — has revived an old conversation on an ancient malaise.There is one dowry death somewhere in India every hour, records the National Crime Records Bureau. An examination of 40,000 marriages in rural India between 1960 and 2008 by a World Bank report finds that dowry’s taint has spread amongst Sikhs and Christians who now have higher average dowries than Hindus and Muslims.Also Read | Gender pay gap leads to fewer female candidates on the ballot: StudyThe traditional justification for dowry is that it is a “compensation” to daughters who otherwise would have no share in their fathers’ assets. This is rubbish because a daughter has no control over her dowry or even a say on how it is spent or distributed. For instance, a family might use the daughter-in-law’s dowry to boost the daughter’s dowry and improve her marriage prospects.Furthermore, Hindu daughters now have equal inheritance rights as sons to ancestral property. It’s another matter that the law remains largely on paper and, anecdotally, one hears of daughters signing away their rights to maintain “good relations” with their brothers. But in theory, if the law gives daughters the right to inherit, what is the need for dowry?At the core of the issue lies not inheritance or even dowry but the status of women as invisible beings who live in the shadows of families, lurking unseen in kitchens, stripped of autonomy and agency. Our value lies in our ability to work as unpaid slave labour, produce offspring (male, obviously, since the family name cannot possibly be passed on to women) and protect the patriarchy.We have to ask if we love our daughters enough. Or is this a love that is conditional on their obedience? Even today, 95% of marriages are arranged by parents. If daughters choose to exercise agency, or God forbid, break caste and religious endogamy,then all hell can break loose. This is not an exaggeration. Look at “honour killings”. Look at “love jihad” laws that presume daughters, even adult daughters, are easily led astray and incapable of making decisions for themselves.And, if a daughter chooses not to marry at all, we are aghast. After all, she must go to her “own” home and fulfil her destiny as a dutiful wife and mother.You cannot fight dowry in a silo. You need awareness campaigns. You need legislative action and activism by community leaders to enable the inheritance of all women. You need to excise everyday sexism and misogyny, starting from school books. And you need to allow daughters to marry whoever they choose — or no one at all.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dowry-the-persistence-of-a-social-evil-101625833111170.html
09-07-2021||Today's||India’s federal balance collapsed in the second wave||In the early days of the pandemic, federalism, with its decentralised approach, was considered an obstacle in the battle against Covid-19. Instead, a swift and centralised response was seen as key to defeating the virus. Many took to this view when the pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of the United States (US), a large federal country, despite its advanced health care system. A segment of political analysts warned the US government to abandon the rigid dual federal system where health is an exclusive domain of states and local governments. They cited China’s swift response in Wuhan as proof of the efficacy of a centralised response. Among large federal systems, in early 2020, India was projected to be staring at a tsunami of infections and deaths. Yet, India proved the prophecies wrong. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government led from the front, state governments, including states ruled by non-BJP forces, notwithstanding the temporary loss of power and autonomy, joined hands with the Centre. Also Read | Hetero Labs seeks emergency nod for Covid-19 drug MolnupiravirWhile the pandemic overwhelmed many well-endowed nations in Europe and large federal countries such as the US and Brazil, India proved a global outlier in the early phase. Unlike its federal peers that witnessed bitter acrimonies among key constituent units, India saw relatively healthy cooperation on key areas of pandemic management.Importantly, the federal leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi (unlike the US under President Donald Trump and Brazil under Jair Bolsonaro) largely heeded to science and experts. While many states faced a challenging situation, purposeful and coordinated support from the federal government contained the outbreak. What was more striking was that in record time, India was able to overcome the acute shortages of PPE kits, health infrastructure and essential drugs, which the country also generously supplied to all over the world. India also emerged as an early mover in producing vaccines. By the end of 2020, India appeared to be in control of pandemic.A few months later, the entire edifice of India’s Covid management turned upside down as a new and more contagious variant began spreading. A combination of triumphalism, complacency, and a top political leadership focused on assembly elections, led to a raging second wave that sent shock waves among key institutions tasked to manage pandemic. Many states and big urban centres such as Delhi were completely overwhelmed, with health systems barely withstanding to mounting infections. In short, India’s reputation of having better managed the initial wave of pandemic came to tatters.While there were a set of complex reasons for such a weak response, a contributory factor was also the breakdown of Centre-state cooperation. While this cooperation was instrumental to the successes in first wave, as infections exploded and overwhelmed the health care apparatus and associated support systems, the Centre and the states scurried for cover by blaming each other. As the public outcry mounted against the federal government and its leadership, the latter conveniently put the onus on the states, citing health as a state subject. States hit back, accusing the Centre for vacillating on vaccine procurement and for its discriminatory approach.Yet, the single biggest reason for the dramatic failure in the second wave was an absentee federal leadership that played a decisive role in the first wave. A wavering federal leadership led to chaos as states fought with each other, and with the Centre, over supply of oxygen and medicines,forcing the Supreme Court to supervise the matter.Nowhere did the central leadership come across as more vacillating than the vaccination policy. As the country faced acute vaccine shortages, some states demanded autonomy to procure vaccines on their own. The Centre quickly acceded to the demand, which analysts called impractical given the cut-throat global competition for vaccines. This, along with differential pricing of vaccines, became a major bone of contention in India’s federal structure as the Centre and states accused each other for the slowdown in India’s vaccination drive. Again, it required the highest court’s intervention to end the deadlock. While the impasse finally ended with Centre taking back the ownership on vaccination, it hugely damaged the trust and cooperation that had been built among the two pivotal stakeholders of federalism in the first wave. Of course, India is not alone in witnessing a strain in its federal system. The pandemic has tested the limits of federal systems across the world. Established federal countries such as the US, Germany, and Canada, too, struggled in the initial waves. In particular, the US, with its highly diffused and decentralised responses, largely accentuated by the vacillating federal leadership under Donald Trump’s presidency, struggled to control the surge of infections. After assuming office in January, the Joe Biden has shown what difference a purposeful federal leadership can make.Thus, most of the federal countries learned their lessons quickly and put up more effective responses in the subsequent waves of pandemic. India, which excelled so well in first wave, went the other way and forgot the lessons of the first wave. Both the Centre and the states let their guards down and allowed the pandemic to overwhelm the health system. Still, it is not too late for do the necessary course-correction. From global examples, it is clear that the onus clearly lies with the federal government. In a national emergency, it has to win the trust of states and lead from the front all the time.Niranjan Sahoo and Ambar Kumar Ghosh are with Observer Research FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-federal-balance-collapsed-in-the-second-wave-101625831670785.html
09-07-2021||Today's||The Taste with Vir | Dilip Kumar: The Last Icon||For most of us, the passing of Dilip Kumar is a tragic event, the end of an era. We know that he was one of the greatest actors – in international terms, even -- of the 20th century.But what we may forget is that Dilip Kumar was much more than an actor. In many ways, he was an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of a post-Independence generation that dreamt of an India that overcame the divisions of religion and progressed to take its place as one of the great nations of the world.In the 1950s, when the term nation-building was in vogue, and Dilip Kumar was already a big star, Jawaharlal Nehru enlisted him for the task of helping build up morale in the young nation. He fronted several social welfare programmes, starred in patriotic short films and appeared at events designed to promote national integration or to raise funds for the armed forces. He did all this for free; it never occurred to him to ask for money when it came to patriotic causes.There was, of course, always an elephant in the room. In the years immediately following Partition, Dilip Kumar was the most popular Muslim in India. He was as popular as all of today’s Khans put together and far more respected. Nehru used him to demonstrate that though Pakistan was a Muslim homeland, India was a secular country where Muslims could rise to the very top and be loved by all Indians regardless of their religion.Dilip Kumar was happy to help but always slightly awkward when people mentioned his religion. How did it matter that he was a Muslim? Why couldn’t he just be treated as another Indian, he would ask?But, of course, it did matter. He was born Yusuf Khan and all his friends called him Yusuf. He changed his name, it was widely believed, to appeal across the religious divide. He always denied that interpretation. Many names had been considered, he said, and he almost chose the name Jehangir, but Dilip Kumar just sounded better.Well perhaps.But it is hard to deny that throughout his career, his Muslimness never ceased to matter. I first met him when I was a small boy and the censors were demanding scores of cuts in his film Ganga Jamuna. My father was his lawyer and he was shocked to find that one of the cuts demanded was that the last words of the character played by Dilip Kumar should be cut. The words were “Hey Ram” and the censors said they could not accept him saying those words on screen.My father pushed the point and the censors finally came back with a weak explanation. Well, they said, the character was a dacoit. How could he use the same last words as Gandhiji? Finally, and with bad grace, the censors conceded the point.ALSO READ | The Taste with Vir Sanghvi: The Strange High Command CultureFor all this, Dilip Kumar never took the easy way out. I have been searching my memory but I cannot come up with a single Muslim he played on screen with the exception of Salim in Mughal-e-Azam. He was an Indian, he said, and he would not be tied to any particular religion or community.But that was not how everybody else saw it. In the early sixties, the Calcutta police arrested a young man who they said was a Pakistani agent. They recovered a diary from him which included the names of many Muslims, including Dilip Kumar. A team arrived in Mumbai, raided the house of these Muslims on the grounds that they might all be spies. Even Dilip Kumar was not spared. They came to check if there was a secret transmitter in his house that he used to communicate with his Pakistani handlers! For a time, it even seemed possible that he would be arrested.It is worth remembering that all of this happened when Nehru was prime minister. Even then, there was no dearth of prejudice. Decades later, the Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Nirupam launched an attack on Dilip Kumar’s so-called divided loyalties and said to me in an interview that Dilip Kumar’s expenses were met by Pakistan. Nirupam’s reward was to be granted admission to the Congress, where he became Rahul Gandhi’s favourite.So no single party has a monopoly on communal prejudice.The last time I interviewed Dilip Kumar was for HT Brunch when Mughal-e-Azam was re-released a decade or so ago. His health was already failing but he was eager to talk. As always, he did not dwell on the bad times and the prejudice. He had earned the love of Indians across all communities, he said. Why talk about his bad times?He had, almost throughout his life, a curiously detached view of his career. He often acted as though Dilip Kumar the star was a different person from him. I met him in the early 1980s on the sets of Kranti, one of the films that launched his comeback as a sort-of-character actor. I asked him why he took the role. (The film was horrible). He said, “Well, I thought about it. And if it is the beginning of a new chapter for Dilip Kumar, then it has to be the kind of cinema that works today.”In his heyday, he was famously choosy, making just one film a year and (it was said) taking control of the movie from the director and the scriptwriter. This meant that he made some very good movies. But there were also many stinkers.Often his reasons for turning down films seem flawed in retrospect. The British director David Lean pushed him to play Sharif Ali in Lawrence of Arabia. Dilip Kumar turned down the film arguing that he would not be convincing as an Arab. The part went to Omar Sharif who became a star.When I asked him if he regretted that decision, he was philosophical. “How do you know the film would have been a hit if I had taken the role?” he smiled. “I would have been so unconvincing that I could have sunk the film!”He outlived all of his contemporaries but even at the end, when he was old and frail, lovingly cared for by his wife Saira Banu (“ever since I was a school girl”, she once told me, “my ambition was to marry Dilip Kumar”), he never gave up on the things he believed in.He still talked about patriotism, about the future of India and about communal harmony. By then ‘nation-building’ had become a punch line and ‘secularism’ had fallen from favour.But not for Dilip Kumar. Till his last breath, he believed.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-dilip-kumar-the-last-icon-101625643221800.html
