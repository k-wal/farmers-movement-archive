24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sunset Boulevard: Stray thoughts on turning 70||Though birthdays and anniversaries are an annual reminder of the passage of time, yet sometimes the amount of time that has elapsed may take one by surprise.One may chance upon a grey strand of hair one relaxed morning or look into the mirror in disbelief like the stunned emperor Shah Jahan and find that all their hair has grayed overnight. The sight makes one realise that they are no longer that young. It has been wisely said that nothing is quieter than the sound of hair turning grey or dropping of sand particles in an hourglass.When I think back on my journey so far, on my 70th birthday, I can heave a sigh of satisfaction as life has treated me well and I have had my way most of the time. For me, time has always moved silently, almost stealthily.When my youth evaporated and the middle years started melting into old age, I hardly noticed, except for adding another year to my score on each birthday.There were certain stray incidents that stuck out, which made me realise, albeit with a hint of surprise, that I had crossed a specific age barrier.One evening, almost three decades ago, I was returning from my office in Shimla when I saw a jean-clad girl walking with quick steps slightly ahead of me. A perfect hourglass figure, her silky hair was undulating in the air in rhythm with her sprightly gait. Dying to catch a glimpse of her face, I quickened my pace. I walked past her and turned my head sideways to look at her. I was greeted by a cheerful smile, “Good evening, Uncle!” she said. She turned out to be the charming daughter of our next-door neighbor. Uncle? Had I heard her right? It was the first time that a young girl had addressed me as ‘uncle’. That evening I woke up to the fact that I was on the threshold of middle age.A few years before my retirement, I was casually chatting with a younger colleague, a probationary officer at our bank. Somehow the discussion segued to Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984. I was describing to him the precise moment the news of the brutal murder was broken to me at a remote branch in an obscure village of Himachal Pradesh. I was enjoying the calm, sunny landscape of the Sutlej Valley through my window, while attending to some official correspondence, half listening to the radio commentary on the Indo-Pak cricket match in progress at Lahore. Suddenly, the commentary was interrupted, the play being abandoned to broadcast the news of the Prime Minister’s death.After narrating the episode, I asked my colleague, in a conversational tone, where he was at that historical moment. The officer hesitated a bit before replying, “I am afraid, I had not heard of Mrs Gandhi at the time.”I could not believe it, “Why so?”“At that time, I must have been studying in nursery or in kindergarten cramming my nursery rhymes,” the officer said, with a pleasant laugh. Mildly shocked, I realised that a gap of more than 25 years separated me from my colleague and, what’s more, the autumn of my life was just round the corner.And, lastly, a couple of years ago, I went to New York to be with our daughter’s family for a while. She welcomed us at the door of her apartment holding her three-month-old baby and exclaimed, “Meet your grandpa, Kaya! But not before he washes his hands!” Grandpa? The realisation of entering the last phase of life came to me as a jolt. But I got over it a few moments later with that bundle of joy in my lap.(The writer is a Shimla-based freelance contributor)parmar.ranbir@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sunset-boulevard-stray-thoughts-on-turning-70-101627150578650.html

Police said the suspect befriended the girl on a social networking mobile platform.The suspect, identified as Rajeev Garg, has been arrested while his tenant, Ram Mohan alias Gautam Sharma, to whom he allegedly sold the girl, is still absconding, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj said that the girl’s parents filed a kidnapping complaint at a west Delhi police station on May 30, and said that she had left home a day before saying that she was going to her friend’s house. With help from the anti-human trafficking unit, police obtained and analysed the girl’s call records which revealed frequent telephonic conversations with a number traced to Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior and Bhind. Police said the location of that particular phone was found in Delhi on the day the girl went missing.“Our team tracked the movement of the mobile number and caught its user, Rajeev Garg, from Bhind on July 22. He led the team to his house from where the girl was rescued... The team returned to Delhi with Garg and the girl,” said DCP Bhardwaj.In her statement, the girl said that she came in contact with Garg on the social networking app where the latter’s profile name was listed as Mahi Garg. She claimed she blocked Garg’s number when she came to know of his identity a few weeks later.“However, Garg contacted her through another number and emotionally manipulated her into unblocking his number and continue the friendship. He also convinced her to meet him at Madhuban Chowk in Delhi on May 29, from where he lured her to his hometown in Bhind,” the DCP said.According to police, Garg allegedly physically and sexually assaulted the girl in Bhind for some days and later reportedly sold her to his 30-year-old tenant, Ram Mohan alias Gautam Sharma, for ₹50,000.Police said Mohan, who wanted to marry the girl as his first wife had left him, absconded when the police raided the house.Investigators added that Garg earlier spent seven months in jail in a domestic violence case after his wife, who is now separated from him, filed a case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-rescue-16-year-old-who-was-kidnapped-sexually-assaulted-sold-for-marriage-101627150457567.html

At present we have started the carpentry work to get the rooms ready for the museum installation along with working on curation and other areas. Due to Covid-19 crisis, even the restoration work in the building allotted for the museum had come to a halt due to lack of labourers and other factors and we were only handed the museum in the second week of July,” said Kishwar Desai, chair at TACHT.“If there is no third wave, we should have the Partition museum ready by early January, in time for Republic Day. It is challenging as we have to maintain all Covid protocols, including wearing masks and ensuring physical distancing. We are also trying to ensure that our workers are vaccinated on time,” she said.The museum is likely to have 10 galleries housing around 200 artifacts, including letters, certificates, clothes, utensils and photographs belonging to those who migrated to Delhi from across the border during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition.The site, which will also be developed as a cultural hub, will contain three museums related to the history of Delhi and the changes brought about by events and individuals. While the first one – Partition museum – is expected to be ready in January next year, a second museum on Mughal prince Dara Shikoh and a third on medieval and ancient antiquities from the Delhi state archaeology department will come up later.“Our curation is almost done. Acquiring a few artifacts got held up because people had to send it from different cities and the lockdown made it difficult. But we are now in the process of getting them as the Covid-19 situation looks better,” Desai said. The trust is also collaborating with Ambedkar University’s Centre for Community Knowledge which will provide some of the narratives and oral histories for the museum.From a century-old land deed scripted in Urdu, including information on a piece of land in Jhang, Pakistan, to a wedding card from 1947, TACHT has also collected various bare basics that people managed to bring with them, such as clothes, utensils, letters, documents, photographs and certificates, while hurriedly trying to cross the border during the Partition, which left two million people dead and displaced 10 to 20 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/work-delayed-due-to-covid-partition-museum-opening-pushed-to-republic-day-next-year-101627150456310.html

If the shops were made using poor grade cement, is it the fault of the shopkeepers or the MCD which constructed it? The BJP-ruled MCD is conniving with the builder mafia and has similar plans for all such 39 markets in Delhi so that it can fill its pockets with crores of rupees before leaving the MCD next year,” said Bhardwaj, addressing a press conference.The Delhi BJP and officials from the north MCD did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapclaims-north-mcd-planning-to-demolish-shops-in-gaffar-market-construct-new-complex-101627150397085.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi LG grants city top cop detention powers under NSA; Officials call move ‘routine’||Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi has issued a notification, granting the newly appointed Delhi Police Commissioner Balaji Srivastava the powers of a detaining authority to detain anyone under the National Security Act. The notification that was issued on Thursday has authorised the police chief to excercise the powers for three months -- from July 19 till October 18 this year. “In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (3) of section 3, read with clause (e) of Section 2 of the National Security Act, 1980, the Lt Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi is pleased to direct that during the period July 19, 2021 to October 18, 2021, the Delhi Police Commissioner may also exercise the powers of detaining authority under sub-section (2) of the section 3 of the aforesaid Act,” the notification read. Senior government as well as police officials said that this notification is a routine procedure that is followed whenever a new police chief of Delhi Police is appointed. Since the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) doesn’t provide the magisterial powers (powers of a detaining authority) to the Delhi Police Commissioner under the NSA, the L-G, who is the competent authority, issues a notification to grant that powers to the police chief, officials said. “The Delhi police sent the file and it was cleared from the home department and then the LG office in no time. It is a routine thing. This keeps getting renewed vide a notification once in every 3-6 months,” said a government official.Explaining the procedure followed while detaining anyone under the NSA, a senior police officer said that this Act is used under the circumstances, where a person with his actions may cause a public disorder thereby posing a threat to the national security. “Under the NSA, a person can be put under preventive arrest in jail for a maximum period of one year. There is no provision for registering a first information report (FIR) for making the preventive arrest,” the officer said. The officer further said that when any police team plans to book anyone under the NSA, the team collects information about the person and his antecedents of the last 10 years and them put up a formal request before the police commissioner. The police chief reviews the file and after proper verification he takes the decision on whether to book the person under the NSA or not. “Once the commissioner approves the prevention detention of the person, the matter is then sent to the review committe comprising of three High Court judges. The review committe has the powers to approve or disapprove the police chief’s preventive detention order. But that is done only when the committe is not convinced with the allegations or evidence collected against the person,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-lg-grants-city-top-detention-powers-under-nsa-officials-call-move-routine-101627150396323.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||Nearly 70k jabs given in Delhi as Covishield second doses push up city’s numbers||The vaccination drive in Delhi picked up pace slightly on Saturday with nearly 70,000 jabs being administered. The increase in the number of shots given, however, was driven by the second dose with more than twice the number of people getting their second shot as did the first, according to data on government’s CoWIN portal.There were just over 21,000 first doses administered as compared to over 48,400 second doses till 7pm on Saturday, the data shows. The city has been administering more second doses than first for the fourth day on Saturday.This is because those who received their first Covishield dose became eligible for their second one this week, the government stopped using Covishield doses for the first shot, and only 20% of the Covaxin stock is being used for the first shot.“This trend is likely to continue for this month and the first week of August after which we expect that more doses would become available to Delhi. As for Covaxin, we will be using a small proportion of the available doses for first dose because the supply is irregular and we do not want to be in a situation where we do not have enough vaccine for second dose,” said a senior official from West district.Other than Covaxin and Covishield, many private vaccination centres in Delhi have also been administering the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. In less than a month since the introduction of the vaccine in Delhi, just short of 30,000 doses have been administered, according to CoWIN data. The supply of Sputnik V is also likely to pick up with several Indian companies starting to manufacture it.So far, 7.28 million Delhi residents have been partially immunised, meaning one in three residents have received at least one jab of the vaccine. And, 2.3 million or 11.5% of city residents have been completely vaccinated.“A significant proportion of the population in Delhi has already been exposed to the infection; and we know that natural infection provides better and longer immunity. So actually we need to vaccinate a small proportion of people here. In contrast, in places like Kerala there is still a significant proportion of susceptible population left because they actually followed Covid appropriate behaviour. The infections there are likely to remain high for some time and people there need to be vaccinated quickly,” Dr Sanjay Rai, head of the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nearly-70k-jabs-given-in-delhi-as-covishield-second-doses-push-up-city-s-numbers-101627150336242.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court denies bail to ISIS sympathiser||The sessions court on Friday refused to grant interim bail to Anees Ansari, arrested in October 2014 for allegedly plotting to blow up American School of Bombay located at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). The court, however, expedited his trial.Ansari, who worked as associate geographic technician in a private company before he was arrested for being a sympathiser of ISIS ideology and plotting an attack in the city, had moved plea for interim bail earlier this year citing pandemic situation and delay in the trial.The prosecution objected to the plea, claiming the accused was part of the conspiracy to attack the school. The prosecution relied upon the conversation exchanged between the accused and one Omar Elhaji which, it said, was sufficient to show the intention of the accused to cause terror in the country and to attack on American schools and foreign nationals residing in Mumbai.The court, after hearing both the sides, observed, “Prima facie there is evidence that the applicant/accused was involved in anti-social activities while doing his job in a private company. No doubt the applicant/accused is well educated and an intelligent student, there is every possibility to indulge in similar activities and action which may cause obstruction to the prosecution case if he is released on bail.”The court further noted that the prosecution has so far examined 22 witnesses and only two to three witnesses are remaining to complete the trial. The court, after hearing the prosecution case, also expressed the apprehension that releasing the accused on bail might prejudice the trial.“Considering the conduct of the accused, if the accused release on bail, the possibility of tampering further evidence and remaining absent after expiry of the temporary bail cannot be ruled out,” the court observed while rejecting the plea. The court, however, has ordered to expedite the trial in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-denies-bail-to-isis-sympathiser-101627150096818.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||ACB arrests Parbhani DySP, constable in ₹2-cr bribery case||The anti-corruption bureau officials have arrested a Parbhani based sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) - a deputy superintendent of police rank officer, and his sub-ordinate for allegedly demanding ₹2 crore bribe from a businessman.An audio clip of the businessman’s conversation with his deceased friend’s wife had gone viral in Parbhani district and based on the viral clip the accused policemen had threatened to take legal action against the businessman and had demanded money for not taking the action.The ACB later seized ₹25 lakh in cash from the SDPO’s Dadar residence.The arrested policemen are identified as Rajendra Pal, 55, SDPO, Shelu division, Parbhani and Ganesh Chavan 37, police Naik, Shelu division. The complainant in the case is a businessman and his friend had died in a road accident on May 3. A case of causing death by negligence and rash and negligent driving was registered at the Selu police station in Parbhani district in connection with the accident, and one person was also arrested in the case. The complainant businessman wanted to console his friend’s wife and hence he had called her from one of his employee’s phones. “The telephonic conversation between them got recorded in the employee’s phone and later he sent it to his colleagues and the audio clip went viral in the entire district,” said an ACB officer.“Some content of the audio clip was little objectionable and based on this audio clip the accused, SDPO Pal, had contacted the complainant businessman and summoned him to his office on July 9.“Pal threatened the businessman of strict legal action based on the viral audio clip and demanded ₹2 crore for not registering a case against him,” said ACP Neelam Waval, ACB spokesperson. After bargaining by the complainant, the matter was settled at ₹1.5 crore. Since then Pal has been regularly calling the businessman and threatening him to pay or else face the case. But as the businessman did not want to pay, he approached ACB.The complainant didn’t trust local authorities, hence he came to Mumbai and submitted a complaint to DG, ACB in Mumbai on Thursday. ACB Mumbai unit was put on the job and after verification of the complaint the ACB Mumbai team went to Parbhani and late in the evening on Friday arrested Chavan while accepting ₹10 lakh as the first instalment of the bribe amount. Pal too was arrested on early Saturday morning, said ACP Waval.Following the arrests, Pal’s Dadar residence was searched and ₹25 lakh in cash was seized. He has other houses and searches are being conducted there as well, Waval added.Soon proceeding for amassing disproportionate assets would also be commenced against Pal, said another ACB officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/acb-arrests-parbhani-dysp-constable-in-2-cr-bribery-case-101627150096210.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Didn’t know anything about my husband’s businesses: Shilpa Shetty||The property cell of Mumbai Police’s crime branch on Friday evening recorded the statement of actor Shilpa Shetty for around two hours at her Juhu residence. Police said the actor told them that she did not know anything about her husband Raj Kundra’s businesses, as she was most often busy with her own work. The police said the actor broke down while recording the statement.Shetty told property cell officers that she never interfered with Kundra’s businesses and added that it was only through news reports that she came to know about the allegations levelled against him. Police officers are, however, sceptical about her claims as the actor was once on the board of directors of one of the companies, Viaan Industries, owned by her husband. A police officer said they may record her statement again, if required. But prima facie, they have not found any involvement of the actor.Police said Shetty appeared upset and had an argument with Kundra when he was taken to Juhu for house-search on Friday evening. “She was upset after the argument and looked sad and even cried later when crime branch officers recorded her statement,” said an officer.Meanwhile, crime branch officers on Saturday found a hidden almirah at Kundra’s Juhu house.The police said the almirah was kept in a cavity covered by a wall and added that they have found several files in it and have started analsying them.“We are checking what files they are,” said a police officer.He added they are now in the process of appointing expert forensics and financial auditing firm to analyse and audit Kundra’s accounts. Police officers said Kundra has deleted a lot of material such as videos and other accounting details from his computers, after the case was registered in February 2021 and nine arrests were made.They are also investigating if the money received by Kundra through some foreign banks such as United Bank of Africa is money earned from betting or through his earnings or were earnings from Hotshots subscriptions.Property cell arrested Kundra in connection with a purported pornography racket busted by the police in February 2021. Ten others, including Kundra’s close associate Umesh Kamat and his IT support provider Ryan Thorpe, have been arrested in the case.Meanwhile, Enforcement Directorate (ED) sources said the anti-money laundering agency is likely to probe into the alleged money laundering aspects of the porn racket case in which Kundra is named as a prime accused. The agency would also check if Kundra or his associates were involved in any alleged violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). But, the agency has not yet registered any case so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/didnt-know-anything-about-my-husband-s-businesses-shilpa-shetty-101627150036886.html

The police and fire brigade reached the spot and removed the six people trapped in the lift.NM Joshi Marg police said the incident took place around 5.45pm at a construction site of Lalitambika Builders at erstwhile Ambika Mills compound. “The building is owned by Lalitambika Builders and they had hired a contractor,” said Prataprao Bhosale, senior inspector, NM Joshi Marg police station.The workers have been identified as Avinash Das, 35; Laxman Mandal, 35; Bharat Mandal, 28; and Chinmay Mandal, 33 while the two others are yet to be identified.The building is a twenty-storey structure with two towers — one for the people who have been rehabilitated and the other is sale component building.“They were working near the car parking and were coming down in the lift used to take up construction material. The lift wire snapped and it crashed from the seventeenth floor. The fall was sudden and speedy, due to which five people died at the spot and one person, Laxman Mandal, is critical and has been admitted at KEM Hospital,” said Bhosale.Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir, who visited the spot along with minister and local MLA Aaditya Thackeray, said, “It’s a very unfortunate incident. Locals and other workers rushed the injured to the hospital. However, five of them had already breathed their last.”The police said the site supervisor has also died in the incident. “We are inquiring into the incident and will record the statements of all people and then register a case in the matter against those found responsible for negligence, if any,” said Bhosale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-die-in-lift-collapse-at-construction-site-in-mumbai-101627149977321.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||No Covid-19 deaths in Delhi for 2nd time in a week||The city reported no Covid-19 deaths for the second time in a week on Saturday. Delhi also added no Covid-19 deaths last Sunday (July 18), the first time that happened since March 2 this year, when cases ebbed after the third wave in November, and before the fourth wave spike between April and May.The Capital also added 66 more cases of Covid-19, at a positivity rate of 0.09%. The test positivity rate is a vital parameter to understand the scale of an outbreak in a region. Experts believe the spread of the infection to be under control when the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for over two weeks. The number in Delhi has been below this threshold for over two months now.So far, the infection has killed 25,041 people in the city and affected over 1.43 million people since the first case was reported on March 2 last year.“Most people in Delhi – over 80% -- have been exposed to Covid-19 so far and are well protected against a second infection. It is unlikely that the city will experience a severe wave again. Unless, the virus mutates to completely evade immune response,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-covid-19-deaths-in-delhi-for-2nd-time-in-a-week-101627149976194.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra scores a perfect 100% for ICSE, 99.94% for ISC||Results for Class 10 (ICSE) and Class 12 (ISC) were announced by the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on Saturday afternoon. Students and schools had every reason to cheer with many scoring near-perfect scores and the overall success rate of ICSE students in Maharashtra standing at 100%.A large number of state schools witnessed an increase in the number of students scoring 90% and above. Authorities at Bombay Scottish School, Mahim, confirmed that 84.7% of their ICSE batch scored above 90% this year. “The students are very happy with the overall results. Even our Class 12 batch has done very well; 70% of the batch scored above 90%,” said Sunita George, principal.“Last year, around 100 students had scored over 90%. This year, 150 of the 290 students have managed this feat. We had focussed on internals throughout the year and that helped better the overall score,” said Alice Vaz, principal, Ryan International School, Kharghar. She added that students were also worried about the status of exams and ensured they performed well through the year, despite online lectures.As per information shared by CISCE, the all India success rate for ICSE stood at 99.98% this year while the same for Maharashtra schools is a perfect 100%. Similarly, the all India success rate for ISC stands at 99.76% and the same for Maharashtra is 99.94%. West region has a 99.9% success rate in ICSE this year.“Class 12 students have been in a fix for the past two years, because most students aiming at professional courses have already started preparing for the same for the past three four years, and with Covid-19 in place, all their plans are now in limbo. While the overall performance of Class 12 students is really good compared to previous few years, their fate still depends on their performance in the state and national-level entrance exams for higher education,” said the principal of a school in south Mumbai.This year, Class 10 and 12 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. CISCE based their results on the average marks of papers/subjects scored by the candidates in various tests/examinations conducted by schools in current and previous academic year (2019-20 and 2020-21) as well as assessment marks (project and practical work for Class 10 and 12) to derive the final outcome.“This year was extremely difficult one for the entire country, and in spite of the severe crisis, our schools and students have gone out of their way to do well. The data submitted by schools was analysed by a team of reputed statisticians from some premier institutions around the country along with senior officials of CISCE,” said Gerry Arathoon, secretary, CISCE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-scores-a-perfect-100-for-icse-99-94-for-isc-101627149919009.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Students still worried about FYJC CET||A week after the Maharashtra state board announced results for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students boasting of an unprecedented 99.95% success, the announcement of ICSE results with a 100% success rate has brought the focus back on the upcoming optional common entrance test (CET) exam for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions. Despite very good individual marks, Class 10 students are now worried about CET exam which is scheduled to take place on August 21.“Unlike previous years when our marks was only dependent on the final exam, this year the result considers our performance throughout the year and the previous academic year as well. Despite a year of anxieties, we are still facing an unsure future, which is very nerve wracking,” said Anshita Rajan, an ICSE student who scored 99.04%. This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead formulated based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. According to the circular released by the state board earlier this week, an optional CET exam based solely on SSC syllabus and consisting of multiple choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks will be conducted. This two-hour paper will be conducted in physical mode on August 21 from 11am to 1pm, and registrations for the same have been stalled due to technical glitches.“How can the state call this parity when the syllabus for the CET exam is based only on state board curriculum? ICSE syllabus for subjects like social sciences, maths and science is very different from what is taught in state board schools; so how are we supposed to compete with state board students when we haven’t studied the same curriculum?” asked Tanisha Rai, an ICSE student.Last month, a Class 10 ICSE student approached the Bombay high court seeking help in this matter. The student’s petition points out the ‘bias’ against students of other boards and the added stress for students therefore. The court this week asked the state board to consider conducting the CET with syllabus of ICSE and cbse boards as well, the board is yet to respond to this as yet.“After assuring us that admissions to junior college seats will be conducted in an unbiased way and from the manner in which the exam is being conducted, it seems the board wants to give a bigger advantage to state board students. We are hoping this unfair deal turns around with the court’s help,” said Saroj Sinha, another ICSE student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-students-still-worried-about-fyjc-cet-101627149916201.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Do not murder Le Corbusier’s legacy||After the Partition in 1947, Lahore, the former capital of the British province of Punjab, became a part of Pakistan and Chandigarh was conceived as its replacement. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who selected the site, which would become the urban city of Chandigarh in 1948, believed that the city should be a symbol of the nation’s faith in the future. Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, who was the icon of European architectural modernism at the time, was invited to help remake India’s national ideal. Around 28,000 acres were acquired after displacing 58 villages and around 21,000 locals. Le Corbusier was commissioned to design Chandigarh in November 1950, and in October 1953 Chandigarh was formally opened by the Prime Minister. In April 1964, Le Corbusier made his last and 23rd trip to India. The Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952 and the Building Rules, 1952 were enacted in relation to the development and regulation of the new capital of Punjab. The first major test of these laws came when The Tribune, on April 30, 1960, reported that the defence minister was planning to purchase around 2,000 acres north of Sukhna Lake for around ₹29 lakh for building a military cantonment. Le Corbusier wrote to Nehru saying that he could not “permit this decision which would ruin the town planning principles of Chandigarh.” On November 4, 1960, The Prime Minister directed the then Punjab chief minister Partap Singh Kairon to not “overrule Corbusier” as “his opinion is of value.” In Chandigarh’s Le Corbusier: The Struggle For Modernity In Postcolonial India, Vikramaditya Prakash says that a 10 franc bill issued by the Swiss government had Le Corbusier’s portrait on it with superimposed layers of Le Corbusier’s elevation of the Secretariat building at Chandigarh on it. India’s national pride came to be shared by the Swiss as well Clearly, as Prakash put it, the Swiss were not commemorating the Indian building, “they were reclaiming what they perceived to be their own legitimate Swiss heritage.” Our national pride was thus shared by the Swiss as well. In the words of Norma Evenson, who authored the book Chandigarh, the basic idiom of Chandigarh was established at the beginning as the architecture of one or two-storey brick houses built in terrace formation. She says that to control the character of development, a system of zoning plans showing building lines, building zones, protected areas, trees and so on were to be a part of the legal conveyance of land as binding on the buyer as the building bylaws. A covered roof sheltered called a ‘barsati’ was the top floor. The two-storey height of government and private houses that could accommodate a single family was the norm in all the zoning plans made under the 1952 rules. Ravi Kalia Chandigarh -The Making Of An Indian City says that some of the problems listed in the regional plans were fast-depleting underground water resources, soil erosion and flooding along rivers in the vicinity, shortages in housing and office space, poor communications and road links and the deteriorating ecological balance of the region with rapid industrialisation. Do not change the marvellous landscape: Le Corbusier to Nehru He writes that these developments started long ago, but as long as Le Corbusier lived, he fought hard to preserve the character of the city that he had planned. Nearly 10 years after starting work on Chandigarh, he wrote to Pandit Nehru, saying “the construction of the Capitol and its lateral elements has brought to Chandigarh such a marvellous landscape, which no city in the world possesses. Let us not destroy it.” Today, the landscape of the city is being rapidly changed by the UT administration. It is encouraging builders and property brokers to build apartments and flats. The old residential houses are being demolished and reconstructed as apartments that will be sold for exorbitant prices to those who can afford them. The increased number of family units in one dwelling house will multiply by at least three. All amenities and public facilities will remain the same. The biggest victims will be drainage and sewerage. Water and electricity are already scarce. The depleting water table will sink further. The legacy of Le Corbusier will be dishonoured and the city will be ruined. Who will build another Chandigarh? If we cannot commemorate the memory of Le Corbusier by keeping this unique city intact, let us at least not allow builders and brokers to plunder it. The legacy was not meant to be murdered. The most befitting conclusion can be found in the writings of Norma Evenson: “In the final analysis, a city is not the creation of its planners: it is the creation of its keeping through time. A city planner is not God and cannot bring life into existence, and however much he might have wished it, Le Corbusier could not turn a provincial Indian capital into another Paris. The cities we love were not planned for this, but have come to be loved through the workings of time, circumstance and perhaps just the right combination of luck and human destiny. At present, Chandigarh, represents a generous investment of courage and hope, of talent and devoted effort, and it will continue to require such investments. If Chandigarh is ever to become a true city, however, it will be only when its people have given it a history, when it has become free of its planners to acquire a destiny of its own. Ultimately, the people of Chandigarh must achieve the city they deserve.” Both Le Corbusier and Pandit Nehru are no more. The legacy of the city and its proud place in Indian history lives on. If we have to live in it, it has to be as it was conceived. Let us not watch its slow erosion and destruction by builders and brokers who will reduce it to buildings of glass, steel, bricks and stone. anilmalhotra1960@gmail.com (The writer is a Chandigarh-based lawyer and author.

24-07-2021||Mumbai||Toll from floods, landslides in Maharashtra touches 112||At least 112 people have died and 99 others are still missing in Maharashtra, officials said on Saturday after days of heavy rain in the Konkan and Western Maharashtra region triggered flooding and landslides in several districts.Nearly 135,313 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas in nine districts that were hit by landslides and floods on Thursday and Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said.“A total of 112 people have lost their lives due to heavy rains till Saturday morning (in Maharashtra). These include 52 in Raigad, 13 in Satara, four in Mumbai and nearby areas, one in Pune, 21 in Ratnagiri, seven in Kolhapur, 12 in Thane and two in Sindhudurg. 99 people are missing till Saturday morning,” the deputy CM said.Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, however, put the death toll much higher. “138 deaths have been reported due to floods and other rain-related incidents,” he said, earlier in the day.The toll is likely to increase, with heavy rainfall stalling rescue operations in several areas. Till Saturday evening, a team of the police and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) alone, recovered at least 86 bodies47 in Raigad district’s Taliye village, 28 bodies in Satara district and 11 in Ratnagiri.According to official data, 890 villages in nine districts have been affected since Thursday.The state government “will see no such incidents happen in the future”, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said after a visit to Taliye village in one of the worst-hit Raigad district.“The state government will see no such incidents will happen in future and even if they happen, no human life will be lost in future. In order to achieve this, the state government will have to rehabilitate all the villages located at hillslopes and foothills. The residents of such villages will be resettled at safer places,” Thackeray said after reviewing the ground situation in Taliye.A portion of a hillock flattened most of the Taliye village late on Thursday, burying at least 32 houses. Till Saturday, the landslide claimed 49 lives. At least 50 people are still feared trapped under the debris.The chief minister said the state government will also prepare a water management scheme to reduce the instances of flooding. “We have started working on formulating a water management scheme to overcome the flood situation in the state. It will ensure management of excessive water collected in catchment areas of dams due to heavy rains which often result in floods following discharge from dams,” Thackeray said.Western Maharashtra’s Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli districts, which are among the worst affected by the flooding, also saw massive devastation due to flooding in 2019.Teams of the local administrations and the State Disaster Relief Force, along with NDRF, Coast Guard, Navy and Army, are undertaking rescue operations in the affected areas.The NDRF has enhanced the number of its teams from 26 to 34 for the operations, a spokesperson said Saturday.“In view of the severity of the situation, additional eight NDRF teams have been airlifted from Kolkata and Vadodara base which are being deployed in affected areas of Maharashtra,” the spokesperson said.The force is tracking the India Meteorological Department’s weather forecast and the Central Water Commission’s report with regard to Mumbai and coastal districts of the Konkan region in Maharashtra that are witnessing heavy rainfall since the last few days, the spokesperson said, after residents in several areas complained about the slow pace of the rescue work.Apart from the rescue operations, the administration is struggling to restore water and electricity supply and arrange food and medicines in affected areas.The government is planning to distribute ration kits, including rice, pulses and kerosene in the affected areas, the deputy CM told mediapersons.Pawar also announced a financial assistance of ₹5 lakh each to the kin of the victims, while the Central government has announced ₹2 lakh each.While flood water in many Konkan areas is receding, the discharge of water from dams led to further overflowing of some rivers and rise in flood water levels in many areas of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, officials said.IMD, meanwhile, has forecast a reduction in rainfall intensity over the next 24 hours. “Further reduction in rainfall intensity is very likely along the west coast, including Konkan, Goa and adjoining interior Maharashtra, during the next 24 hours,” the IMD said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/toll-from-floods-landslides-in-maharashtra-touches-112-101627149172443.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||Cinemas, spas, pools to open with restrictions in Delhi||Multiplexes, swimming pools, spas, auditoriums and entertainment parks will be allowed to open in the national capital from Monday, while the Delhi Metro and public buses will operate with 100% seating capacity, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) said on Saturday, effectively relaxing most restrictions after a decline in Covid-19 cases following a deadly fourth wave of infections in the national capital.In an order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, DDMA also relaxed the cap on the number of guests at weddings and funerals. Previously, up to 50 people were allowed in weddings, while 20 were permitted in funerals. From Monday, 100 guests will be allowed for both gatherings.Under a lockdown that was imposed on April 20, when the city was well into its fourth wave of infections, a curfew was imposed except for specific activities (such as going to buy groceries and medicines, or for going to a hospital or airports/railway stations). The lockdown restrictions were gradually eased with the decline in infections.Cinema halls, multiplexes, auditoriums and assembly halls will be allowed to run with 50% seating capacity. Swimming pools and entertainment parks have also been allowed, while sports complexes can be opened for members, even as no spectators will be allowed. Religious places will continue to remain prohibited for visitors. Business-to-business exhibitions can also be held from Monday, but such events will be restricted to business visitors only, according to the order.Spas have been allowed to open with a set of guidelines. The order said that all employees, especially the masseuse, should either get both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine or should undergo RT-PCR tests every fortnight. It also said that clients will have to sign an undertaking of being Covid-19-negative. Personal protective equipment (PPE) apart from face shields and masks will have to be worn by the therapist/masseuse if the treatment is of more than 30 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cinemas-spas-pools-to-open-with-restrictions-in-delhi-101627148934999.html

At around 3.20 pm, he asked the cops to stop as he wanted to use the toilet.“After getting down from the police van at Simulia, he tried to snatch the gun from the sub-inspector and flee. To control the situation, the escort team opened fire on him. One bullet hit him in the stomach and another in the leg. He was then rushed to the district headquarters hospital in Balasore. He succumbed to his bullet injuries in Balasore district headquarters hospital,” said Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissioner Soumendra Priyadarshi.Additional district medical officer (ADMO), Balasore district, Mrutyunjay Mishra said Hyder had arrived at the casualty wing of Balasore district headquarter hospital in a critical and ‘gasping condition’. “He died within four to five minutes upon arrival. The post-mortem will make it clear how many bullet injuries did he receive,” he said. The post mortem is likely to be conducted on Sunday.In April this year, Hyder, serving a life sentence in a case of murder, escaped from a government medical college cum hospital in Odisha after drugging the policeman in charge of his security. He was arrested 5 days later from Sangareddy district of Telangana.Accusing the police of staging a fake encounter, Hyder’s wife Haseena said usually during a police encounter a criminal gets bullet injuries in the legs and not on the head or the abdomen.“Police took my husband out of the jail and killed him mid-way claiming that he made escape attempts. The jailor and others were involved in the killing. In Odisha, cops always fire at the knee, not at the heart or the head,” she alleged.Demanding justice for her husband, Haseena said she was not aware of the shifting of her husband from Choudwar jail to Baripada jail. “For 16 years my husband was lodged in jail and every time I cooperated with the police. Even when he escaped from the jail custody in April this year, I fully cooperated with the cops,” she said.Former Odisha DGP Sanjeev Marik demanded a probe into the encounter and questioned the manner in which the criminal was shot. “Was he handcuffed and chained in the waist while being taken to Baripada jail from the Chowudwar jail?” he asked.Hyder was a renowned name in Odisha’s underworld in the late 90s due to his ability to execute crimes. In the 1980s, he started out as a rickshaw puller in Kendrapara town and later worked as a truck driver. He soon got involved in petty thefts and formed a gang with two other criminals Syed Usman Ali alias Tito and Suleiman.In 2005, he became a known name in the underworld after killing Sk Chuna, brother of his friend-turned-foe Suleiman. He was arrested from Nagpur for the murder and was awarded life imprisonment in 2011. However, he got out on parole and with the help of Tito, he got Suleiman, the most educated among the three, shot dead on a road in 2012. Hyder and Tito, however, soon fell out and bayed for each other’s blood.Hyder was again arrested and was later sentenced to life in 2015 over the kidnapping and murder of mines trader Rashmi Ranjan Mahapatra. Though he was in jail, police officials said he was known to plan and execute crimes from inside the jail....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-gangster-killed-in-police-encounter-while-being-shifted-to-one-jail-from-another-101627148657850.html

The system will capture speeding vehicles, those driving on the wrong side as well as vehicles not allowed on the highway, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/automated-system-to-record-traffic-violations-101627148293511.html
24-07-2021||Gurugram||MCG officials booked in embezzlement case get new roles in civic body||An executive engineer and an assistant engineer of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), booked by the police on Friday for allegedly forging documents to embezzle funds, were given new roles amid an administrative reshuffle on Saturday, a senior official of the civic body said.“The transfers of both the executive and assistant engineers were done as they had been deputed at their respective locations for nearly two to three years. All such officials who have been posted at one location for a long time have been transferred across the MCG to bring greater efficiency in the day to day workings, and approach matters with a fresh perspective,” said Ahuja. On Saturday afternoon, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja issued an order transferring various officials of the engineering wing for “smooth functioning” of the MCG.As per the order, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, the executive engineer was given charge of MCG wards 29, 26, 25 and 27, and areas falling under the newly extended municipal area, between Sector 58 and Sector 70A. The assistant engineer, meanwhile, was given charge of electrical works in MCG’s Zone 1 and Zone 3.The two engineers, along with another executive engineer, junior engineer and three contractors, are alleged to have forged the signatures of councillors and issued fake work-satisfactory certificates in November last year.The Haryana Urban Local Bodies (ULB) and state home minister, Anil Vij, during a surprise visit to MCG’s Sector 34 office on Thursday, took cognisance of the issue and recommended registering an FIR against the four MCG officials and three contractors.On Friday, based on a complaint from MCG chief engineer TL Sharma, an FIR was registered against the four MCG officials and three contractors for criminal conspiracy, breach of trust by public servant, forgery, forgery of valuable security, forgery for purpose of cheating, using forged document and attempting to commit offences, under sections 120B, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 511 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sadar police station.“Based on the directions of the Haryana government, an FIR was registered against the violators. Until the Haryana government gives any further order stating that the officials have to be suspended or terminated, they will continue to fulfil their duties in the MCG,” the senior MCG official cited above said, requesting anonymity.The MCG’s engineering wing is divided into eight zones. The four MCG officials were deputed in MCG’s zones 4 and 7 at the time of the alleged misappropriation of funds.Once a localised project is completed, the MCG’s engineering wing needs a work-satisfactory certificate from the local ward councillor, based on which project payments are made to the contractor concerned for completing the job.In November last year, at least 12 fake certificates came to light, which bore forged signatures of at least 10 councillors, based on which payments were made by the four MCG officials to the three contractors for projects such as road and drain repairs, and laying new sewerage lines.The projects in question were either not started or at a nascent stage but payments were made in excess of the work done, which violates the MCG’s norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-officials-booked-in-embezzlement-case-get-new-roles-in-civic-body-101627148417483.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra likely to breach 200,000 mark in this month; Covid tally reaches 194,218||Maharashtra reached close to 200,000 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 days. The state on Saturday recorded 6,269 fresh infections pushing the count to 6,258,079. The tally of active cases reduced to 93,479 as 7,332 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. The state saw 224 casualties. To date, the state has reported 194,218 cases and by Sunday it may breach the 200,000 mark of cases this month. The daily cases in the state have slightly reduced as it has started reporting between 6,000 to 8,000 cases from this week. On Thursday, 6,753 cases and 167 casualties were reported. Last month, it clocked a total of 316,283 cases.Experts are of the view, the state administration should not let down the guard until there is a significant drop in daily cases, as the drop in daily cases is very slow in the second wave.Between June 14 and July 18, the state was reporting 8,000 to 10,000 cases a day, except a few days when less than 8,000 cases were reported.“We are incredibly slow in terms of decline in daily cases this time. Covid cases are reducing and it is an encouraging thing but we are still not near normal. We will have to keep up with our vigil until the cases come down significantly. Maharashtra has beaten up the period for the decline in cases compared to other states. Where cases have significantly reduced in other states, the process is still going on in the state,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force and director, critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund.This is despite the state government imposing stricter norms by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three after cases of Delta-plus variants were found last month. The first two levels having maximum relaxations were removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on June 25. But daily cases are reducing at a very slow pace.On Saturday, Mumbai clocked 410 cases and reported a total 733,754 cases to date. It also recorded nine fatalities taking the toll of 15,827.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 198,088 samples and had a positivity rate of 3.16%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 13.42%, according to the data issued by the state health department.Maharashtra reached close to 200,000 cases in the last 24 days.It has also vaccinated 338,348 doses on Saturday, according to the data available on Co-WIN portal. In the last over six months, 41,199,192 doses have been administered in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-likely-to-breach-200-000-mark-in-this-month-covid-tally-reaches-194218-101627148235968.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 16-year-old raises ₹2 lakhs to vaccinate transgender community||Sia Sehgal, a 16-year-old student from Hill Springs International School, Tardeo, has become the first teenage donor recorded with Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) to procure and donate Covishield vials for the mass immunisation programme for members of the transgender community. On Saturday, 120 members were administered their first jab at the free vaccination drive, for which, the teenager raised ₹2 lakhs. Sehgal took up the initiative on getting to know that many members of the community are shying away from vaccination due to lack of awareness and stigmatisation. “Since I wanted to help the community, I contacted the heads of the transgender community and sensitised them about the need for vaccination through Zoom video calls. When they agreed to get vaccinated, I contacted different organisations like InHarmony, Triveni Samaj Vikas Kendra and I-TECH who helped me raise the fund for procuring the vials and organising the camp,” said Sehgal who raised ₹2 lakhs within the last two weeks and bought the vaccines from HCG-ICS Khubchandani Cancer Centre. On Saturday, I-TECH along with MDACS organised a vaccination camp for transgenders at Triveni Samaj, Malwani, Malad. “She is the first teenage donor who helped to vaccinate transgenders. We organised the camp to facilitate the vaccination. It is quite inspiring how she raised the money and helped in the free vaccination,” said Santosh Suryavanshi, technical specialist from I-TECH India that works in association with MDACS. Sehgal plans to organise another vaccination camp for the beneficiaries for their second dose. “Many transgenders claim that they face stigma which discourages them from getting vaccinated. Considering they are a vulnerable group of the population, it is our responsibility to ensure that they are fully vaccinated,” she said.In fact, on Saturday, many transgenders were sceptical about the efficiency of the vaccination. Sia had to counsel and explain the benefits of being inoculated.“Taking one step at a time, I am hoping to encourage many more members of the transgender community to come forward and safeguard themselves. I feel fortunate to be heard and helped to make this drive a success,” she added.Sharing her experience, Varshabhai Dhokalia, a transgender from Khar, said when she went to BKC jumbo centre in June to take her first dose, she faced discomfort due to continuous stigmatisation from fellow beneficiaries.“We are always being mocked. While I was standing in the queue for the shot, people were staring and laughing at me. Someone even passed a comment that the vaccination was only for males and females,” said Dhokalia. “This discourages us from going to these centres for vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-16-year-old-raises-2-lakhs-to-vaccinate-transgender-community-101627148175963.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||MMRDA, Cidco to hand over 519ha of mangroves to Maharashtra govt||Just two days before World Mangroves Day on July 26, the state forest department’s mangrove cell announced the imminent handover of 519 hectares of mangrove land by the City Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for declaration as ‘reserve forest’ under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, pursuant to long-pending directions of the Bombay high court (HC). HC in September 2018, responding to public interest litigation (PIL) by the Bombay Environment Action Group, had ordered that mangrove lands under various government bodies be transferred to the forest department for safekeeping.An independent state-level committee comprising the additional chief secretary, revenue, principal secretary, environment department, and forest secretary (which is mandated by the HC to oversee the Konkan divisional commissioner’s compliance with its orders) met on July 13 this month in the presence of secretaries (urban development departments I and II) and representatives of Cidco and MMRDA. The Konkan divisional commissioner is also the head of a separate mangrove committee comprising independent members. “Cidco has agreed to hand over 219 hectares of mangroves in Panvel and Kamothe, Raigad district, through the collector’s office. The transfer will happen soon. The MMRDA confirmed that it has 300 acres that need to come under protection, mostly in Mumbai suburban district. The specifics of the transfer are being discussed,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell, speaking at a webinar organised by NGO NatConnect Foundation. A Cidco official said their transfer is likely to happen in the next week itself.According to a fresh PIL filed by NGO Vanashakti earlier this year after public authorities failed to comply with the HC order, there were about 1,500 hectares of mangroves that had to be transferred to the state government. The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), which also comes under the charge of state environment minister Aadtiya Thackeray, was the first to comply with the HC’s directions in April this year by handing over 466.72 acres of mangroves Manori and Gorai creeks. This area has been brought under the ambit of Section 20 of the IFS (1927) after all private claims over the land were resolved by a settlement officer. Earlier in June, another 1,036 hectares of mangroves were transferred to the state government in Thane taluka and Mira-Bhayander in Thane district after being notified as a reserve forest in January 2021. APCCF Tiwari confirmed that there are yet another 100 acres in Thane whose “handover is under process”.The only public authority, to which the HC’s instructions apply and which does not come under the state’s administrative control, is the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), which has to technically hand over 916 hectares of mangroves at the time of the BEAG PIL’s first interim order in 2005. “JNPT has not yet made any commitment on how many mangroves they will be handing over and when” Tiwari confirmed. Instead of transferring the same 916 hectares land to the mangrove cell, JNPT in a recent affidavit denied any non-compliance with the HC’s instructions and said that the Maharashtra Remote Application Centre (MRSAC) for a fresh demarcation of its mangrove area, which would be transferred after the assessment. BN Kumar, founder, NGO NatConnect, said, “While it is a positive step, Cidco and MMRDA have conducted their assessment of mangroves which has been accepted by the state. Once demarcated, the identified mangroves will simply be handed over. There should be a separate independent assessment to make sure there are no discrepancies in what the authorities are claiming.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-cidco-to-hand-over-519ha-of-mangroves-to-maharashtra-govt-101627148115957.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||Partition museum opening pushed to 2022 R-Day as Covid halts work||The inauguration of the first Partition museum in Delhi, which was slated for Independence Day this year, has been pushed to Republic Day next year as the Covid-19 crisis halted on-site work between April and July, said officials.The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust (TACHT), which set up a similar museum in Amritsar in 2017 and is managing the Delhi project, resumed work on setting up the museum earlier this month at the Dara Shikoh Library Building in Kashmere Gate, inside the Ambedkar University campus.“We started on-site work around two weeks ago. At present, we have started the carpentry work to get the rooms ready for the museum installation along with working on curation and other areas. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, even the restoration work in the building allotted for the museum came to a halt due to a shortage of labourers and other factors. We were only handed the museum in the second week of July,” said Kishwar Desai, chair at TACHT.“If there is no third wave, we should have the Partition museum ready by early January, in time for Republic Day. It is challenging as we have to maintain all Covid-appropriate protocols, including wearing masks and ensuring physical distancing. We are also trying to ensure that our workers are vaccinated on time,” she said.The museum is likely to have 10 galleries that house around 200 artefacts, including letters, certificates, clothes, utensils and photographs that belong to those who migrated to Delhi from across the border during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition.The site will also be developed as a cultural hub, with three museums related to the history of Delhi and the changes brought about by big events and key individuals.The first one — the Partition museum — is expected to be ready in January next year. A second museum on Mughal prince Dara Shikoh, and a third on medieval and ancient antiquities from the Delhi state archaeology department, will come up later.“Our curation work is almost done. Acquiring a few artifacts got held up because people had to send it from different cities and the lockdown made it difficult. But we are now in the process of getting them as the Covid-19 situation looks better,” Desai said.The trust is also collaborating with Ambedkar University’s Centre for Community Knowledge which will provide some of the narratives and oral histories for the museum.From a century-old land deed scripted in Urdu, including information on a piece of land in Jhang, Pakistan, to a wedding card from 1947, TACHT has also collected various basics that people managed to bring with them, such as clothes, utensils, letters, documents, photographs and certificates, while hurriedly trying to cross the border during the Partition, which left two million people dead and displaced another 10 to 20 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/partition-museum-opening-pushed-to-2022-r-day-as-covid-halts-work-101627147987609.html

24-07-2021||Other||TDRF team carries out rescue work at Taliye village||A team of 13 personnel from the Thane Disaster Response Force (TDRF), an emergency response organisation formed on the lines of the National Disaster Rescue Force (NDRF), has been sent to the landslide-affected Taliye village in Mahad. By Saturday evening, the TDRF team had pulled out a total of eight dead bodies from underneath the debris. The deceased included three minors, including a seven month old baby boy. At least 42 people have died so far and 40 others are missing after a portion of a hillock came crashing down and buried 32 houses in the village. The NDRF has sent several teams to Taliye and search and rescue operations are currently under way.The TDRF is a squad of 33 personnel working under the purview of the Thane Municipal Corporation to respond to emergencies in the Thane district and nearby areas. TMC officials said that the team of 13 personnel, including 12 rescue workers and a driver left in a minibus along with Thane Guardian Minister, Eknath Shinde, and Mayor Naresh Mhaske on Friday afternoon.“The TDRF team reached Mahad at around 11pm on Friday and began their work early on Saturday morning. They have pulled out three dead bodies from under the rubble so far” Santosh Kadam, head of the TMC’s Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC), said.Kadam added that the decision to send only 13 personnel was taken because some manpower was needed on standby in Thane in case of any emergencies as Thane, too, has been lashed by incessant rain for the last few days.Meanwhile, the TDRF team has several challenges to contend with. “There is no network at the site of the disaster, and hence, communication with the team is not continuous. Every once in a while, one of them has to come out of the village to find a network so that they can send updates to us. Besides, the sun has come out after several days of rain, which means the mud will start hardening even as the team is working,” Kadam said.He added that the team will stay in Mahad for as long as it is deemed necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tdrf-team-carries-out-rescue-work-at-taliye-village-101627147996648.html

24-07-2021||Delhi||LG gives Delhi top cop NSA detention powers||Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal has issued a notification granting the newly appointed Delhi Police commissioner Balaji Srivastava powers to make detentions under the National Security Act (NSA), a move that senior officials said was routine and periodic. The notification, issued on Thursday, authorises the police chief to exercise the powers from July 19 till October 18 this year.“The Delhi Police commissioner may also exercise the powers of detaining authority under sub-section (2) of the section 3 of the aforesaid Act,” said the notification.Senior state officials and police officers said the notification is part of routine procedure followed whenever a new police chief is appointed in the Capital. Since the Code of Criminal Procedure doesn’t provide magisterial powers (of a detaining authority) to the police commissioner under the NSA, the LG, who is the competent authority, issues a notification to grant those powers to the police chief, said officials.Shrivastava took the reins after his predecessor SN Shrivastava retired on June 30 this year.“The Delhi Police sent the file, which was cleared by the state home department and then the LG’s office in no time. It is a routine matter. This keeps getting renewed through a notification every three to six months,” said a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-gives-delhi-top-cop-nsa-detention-powers-101627147844125.html

24-07-2021||Patna||73% develop antibodies against Covid-19, Bihar inches closer to herd immunity||Bihar could be close to a herd immunity threshold against Covid-19 as 73% of the population has reported a prevalence of antibodies against the virus either from past infection or through vaccination, officials said. Herd immunity means enough people have gained immunity against a disease to block most transmission. “A seropositivity of 73% is a good sign for Bihar. This means that only 27% people are now susceptible to contracting the virus of which some may become serious during the anticipated third wave of the pandemic,” said vice-president of the Indian Association of Public Health, Dr CM Singh, also professor and head, community and family medicine at AIIMS-Patna, and its medical superintendent. “A seropositivity of over 70%-80% helps to develop herd immunity. However, since the virus is mutating very fast, there is a possibility of people getting re-infected and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour has to be followed. In case of re-infection, the symptoms will be mild in the 73% population, who have already developed antibody either by contracting the virus earlier or through vaccination,” added Dr Singh. Buxar reported the highest seropositivity of 83.8%, followed by Madhubani 77.1%, Arwal 73.7%, Begusarai 72.7%, Muzaffarpur 65.3% and Purnia 65% in Bihar’s six districts sampled among 70 across 21 states in India by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) during the fourth serological survey between June 14 and July 6. Bihar reported higher seropositivity as compared to the national average of 67.6%. As many as 335 of the 400 general population sampled in 10 clusters of Buxar were found to have been infected from coronavirus at some stage. Buxar shot into the limelight when 82 corpses, floating in river Ganga, were fished out in May, during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. The National Human Rights Commission had taken cognizance of it and issued notice to the Centre and the governments of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, seeking an action-taken report. On May 17, the Patna high court (HC) flagged inconsistency in death figures related to Buxar mentioned in separate affidavits filed by the state’s chief secretary and the Patna divisional commissioner. This forced the state government to undertake a verification of deaths which culminated in the state reporting a 73% spike in Covid-19 deaths as its death count went up by 3,951 post-verifications. The state’s cumulative Covid-19 toll jumped to 9,375 on June 8, as against 5,424 reported a day earlier. The state’s Covid-19 death toll was 9,635 on Friday.Similarly, 327 of the 424 samples tested positive in Madhubani; 303 of the 411 samples were positive in Arwal, 303 of the 417 tested in Begusarai were positive; 264 of the 404 samples tested positive in Muzaffarpur while 265 of the 408 samples tested positive in Purnia. Muzaffarpur reported 0% seroprevalence during the first serological survey in May last year. Buxar then reported 1.25%, followed by 1% each in Arwal and Madhubani, Purnia 0.75% and Begusarai 0.25%. Arwal reported the highest seroprevalence of 26.20% during the third survey in December. Buxar was next with 26.07%, followed by Madhubani 24.5%, Muzaffarpur 21.70%, Purnia 21.01% and Begusarai 15.01%. The state’s cumulative seropositivity was 0.7% during the first survey undertaken between May 17 and 20 last year. This meant that only 17 out of the 2,400 people surveyed developed antibodies (immunity) against SARS-CoV-2, said an epidemiologist. The seropositivity rate in Bihar increased to 7% during the second survey between August 21 and 26 and went up to 22.41% against the national average of 24% during the third survey between December 20 and 25. ICMR director-general and secretary to the government of India, Professor Balram Bhargava, shared the findings of the fourth serological survey with Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit on Friday. Around 3,000 blood samples were collected from the six districts and sent to the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. The survey, conducted in the state between June 20 and 25, was to ascertain the prevalence of antibodies, called seroprevalence or seropositivity, against SARS-CoV-2. State health officials, including those in the State Health Society, which looks after the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) under the National Health Mission, chose not to respond to phone calls or text messages. Officials at the ICMR’s Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna, were also mum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/73-develop-antibodies-against-covid-19-bihar-inches-closer-to-herd-immunity-101627143977697.html

According to Thackeray, who visited the landslide-affected Taliye village in Raigad district, said a comprehensive plan is being worked out to people living in risky terrain to safe places. He said that a policy would be formulated for management of water as parts of the state, especially the western Maharashtra region, witnesses floods during monsoon due to rise in river water levels. “Instructions have been given to officials to prepare a detailed rehabilitation plan for such vulnerable populations across the state in view of such incidents of landslide which have now become frequent phenomenon,” Thackeray said, while addressing mediapersons on Saturday. Thackeray said flooding is witnessed in western Maharashtra during monsoon due to rise in water level of rivers. Hence, a policy would be formulated for management of water in this region. He said his government will expedite the process of rehabilitation and compensation of the flood-affected people. Ratnagiri and Raigad districts bore the maximum brunt of the rain fury and the resulting floods. On being asked about assistance from the central government, he said, “We are getting all the help from the Centre.

When asked about the delay in relief, the chief minister said that all rescuers have reached the locations and started the work. “However, there may be a few places where they reached late or other equipment could not reach because of difficulties due to rain and difficult terrain,” he said. Several relatives of the missing persons complained to the CM about delay in rescue and relief operations. Thackeray said, “We are with you in this time of grief and will take care of everything”. The CM announced ₹5 lakh compensation each for the kin of those who lost their lives in the landslides caused by torrential rainfall. The state will also incur the costs of treatment for those injured, he added. A day before the CM’s visit, PM Narendra Modi had a telephonic discussion with CM Thackeray and tweeted, “Anguished by the loss of lives due to a landslide in Raigad, Maharashtra. My condolences to the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery. The situation in Maharashtra due to heavy rains is being closely monitored and assistance is being provided to the affected,” it added. Till the time of filing this report, 44 victims have been dug out of the wet marsh in the village and around 80 persons were still missing according to information shared by the district administration.

24-07-2021||Pune||Govt to address demand of villagers in landslide-prone areas of Pune district for relocation: Pawar||Pune: As the rescue operation is still being carried out in Raigad and Satara districts after the deadly landslide incidents, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that some villagers of Pune district living in landslide-prone areas are demanding relocation. According to the district records, there are 23 villages in Pune district which come under landslide-prone areas. Pawar said such villages can be relocated just like the rehabilitation is done after the construction of dams. Pawar claimed that the Taliye village in Raigad district where almost 40 houses were buried under the soil on Thursday evening, was not in the landslide-prone area. Pawar said the locals in landslide prone areas were warned in advance and some were shifted to safe place. “Nine districts are heavily suffering from heavy rainfall. They are Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Raigad, Thane, Mumbai, Pune, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. I would like to tell the people that Taliye in Raigad district was not in an area which was prone to landslides. People who were living in landslide prone areas were alerted by the Raigad district administration and some were shifted to the safe locations.” “District officials have informed me that some villages are demanding to be relocated. Earlier, when they were asked about this, locals were unwilling and gave reasons that their farms are nearby. But now they are thinking about safety as the incidents of landslides are coming into light. Such villages can be rehabilitated on new lands just like the procedure is done after the construction of dams. The state government is ready for that,” Pawar said at a press meet in Pune on Saturday. After heavy rains on July 22 and July 23, 420 villages in Pune districts have been affected. The incidents of landslides on roads were recorded in villages in hilly parts in Bhor, Maval and Mulshi tehsils. Pawar said the villages in risk can be rehabilitated like Malin was reset after the tragic landslide incident a few years ago. “In Raigad district, around a thousand people have been relocated,” said Pawar. State administration informed that by Saturday morning almost 90,000 people from the worst-affected 9 districts had been relocated. Most numbers are from Kolhapur and Sangli districts. According to Pawar, the flood situation in Kolhapur and Sangli remained a concern as the Panchganga and Krishna rivers were flowing above the warning levels. Kolhapur partially submerged, floodwater flows 5-ft above Mumbai-Bengaluru highway The state administration has evacuated 90,000 people from the worst-affected nine districts and relocated them to safety. Most numbers are from Kolhapur and Sangli districts. According to Ajit Pawar, the flood situation in Kolhapur and Sangli remained a concern as the Panchganga and Krishna rivers were flowing above the warning levels. “Warning level in Sangli is at 45, but the water level is at 49. In Kolhapur, the warning level is at 43, but the water level is at 53. Water is being discharged from Koyna dam. We have requested the Karnataka government to release water from the Almatti dam, so the swollen rivers could return to normal. They are doing it. 40,882 people in Kolhapur district and 42,573 from Sangli district have been shifted to safe places,” said Pawar. Pawar assured that the government would give financial aid in the flood-hit areas after the punchnama is completed. Pawar said the flood situation in Kolhapur and Sangli remain a matter of concern as the rivers in these districts have crossed danger mark and water from the dams in Krishna banks has to be released because of the excessive rains in the free catchment areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/govt-to-address-demand-of-villagers-in-landslide-prone-areas-of-pune-district-for-relocation-pawar-101627142055305.html
24-07-2021||Pune||Bad weather hit rescue operations in Maha||Taliye (Raigad): The hope of finding survivors in Maharashtra’s Taliye, and Satara’s Mirgaon, Dhokawale and Ambheghar is fading away as heavy rainfall continued to stall rescue operations for the third consecutive day. Till Saturday evening, a joint team of residents, the police and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) recovered at least 71 bodies — 47 in Taliye, 13 in Satara and 11 in Ratnagiri, while around 56 people still missing. Satara district collector Shekhar Singh said heavy rain and high flow of water gushing through nearby hills have hampered rescue operations. In Taliye, a local resident said loose mud, bad weather and difficult terrain have prevented NDRF’s efforts to resuming digging for search and rescue. At Taliye, Sandhya Malusare, who lost her mother, father, and six other relatives, said she survived since she lives in a neighbouring village. “This is the biggest tragedy of my life and I have lost many of my family members... the administration is very slow in carrying out the rescue and search operations.” Mahendra Pol, a local resident, said people do not have the wherewithal to carry out evacuation, search and rescue operations. “Fortunately, my family members were saved...but others were unlucky. Yesterday (Friday) and the day before (Thursday), there was a slow rescue process while today (Saturday) it has not even started properly.” The locals said they have been left to fend for themselves. “Even police are helpless, and many villagers are missing. The government is not sensitive. Police are not visiting the spot. The rescue operation has been delayed. Whatever bodies have been recovered was due to the efforts of locals,” said a resident. The NDRF said they were facing issues related to access and logistics. “...three teams of 25 persons are carrying out search operations. ...the area is waterlogged and very remote. Approach and access to the village are tough and difficult. It is a mud hillock and since we are working, there is a risk of the mudslide. So, we are working very carefully to avoid another tragedy,” said NDRF commandant Anupam Shrivastava. Collector Nidhi Choudhari said the additional collector, three tehsildars and NDRF is carrying out operations at the spot. “It involves a tough terrain as it (the village) is surrounded by valleys from both sides. The road to the village was washed away. It is nature’s fury and unimaginable for us. There were access issues yesterday (Friday) and we had to clear the landslide debris to reach the village. The challenge is that we have to trace the bodies.” Choudhari said the district has nine extremely landslide-prone and 80 mild landslide villages. “This village (Taliye) is not among them. We have conducted the geological survey of the district and the village does figure on the landslide-prone village. We conduct studies to find out the vulnerable villages and plan accordingly to make life safe for the villagers as part of our disaster management preparedness.” The opposition parties have also criticised the government over the slow rescue operation. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Pravin Darekar said around 40-50 persons are still missing, and the administration has failed to respond to the situation. “Heavy rainfall, waterlogging, and disrupted connectivity are hampering the operations in the village. The tragedy must be viewed seriously by the state and the administration must ensure timely relief and evacuation of the victims.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bad-weather-hit-rescue-operations-in-maha-101627140795168.html

Expressing shock at Tomar’s statement that the Centre did not have any record of the farmers who had died in the ongoing Kisan Andolan on the borders of Delhi, former union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, “This anti-farmer attitude of the NDA government is responsible for the plight of farmers.” She added that farmers had not only been stonewalled for eight months, but even their dead were not being recognised. “The SAD condemns this anti-human attitude and requests the agriculture minister to apologise to the farmers for this statement and assure the country that the ‘annadaata’ will not be humiliated in this manner again in Parliament,” Harsimrat added. She added that the NDA government was functioning in a dictatorial manner in Parliament and had not even cared to conduct any study to ascertain the apprehensions in the minds of farmers about the three farm laws. “Tomar’s assertion that no study has been conducted on this issue proves that this government is committed to fulfilling its pact with the corporations and will not even take any feedback from farmers on the three farm laws. This is against the very essence of democracy,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tomar-should-apologise-for-feigning-ignorance-on-farm-stir-deaths-sad-101627139960554.html

Under Mukhyamantri Gram Parivahan Yojna (MMGPY), 350 ambulances have been handed over to the beneficiaries while 800 ambulances will be purchased by October.”Under MMGPY, two people belonging to backward classes from each block are given a subsidy, which amounts to 50% of the cost of the vehicle or a maximum of ₹2 lakh on the purchase of an ambulance.Kumar also believed that CNG buses would help in minimising pollution in the state capital.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said that initially, 20 diesel-driven buses were converted into CNG.He said, “Newly launched buses are the state’s first CNG buses. Last year, 20 diesel-driven buses were retrofitted with CNG kits for conversion. We aim to convert all government-run diesel-driven buses to CNG by March 2022.”A senior transport official, said, “The CNG buses are equipped with modern facilities like GPS, CCTV, panic button, mobile charging points and route display boards. Altogether 10 buses would ply on the Gandhi Maidan-Danapur Bus Stand route, 14 on Gandhi Maidan-Danapur Railway Station, 17 on Gandhi Maidan-Bihta. Bus fare would vary from ₹5 to 45 depending upon distance.”About ambulances at subsidy, Agarwal said, “We received around 3500 applications for purchasing ambulances under MMGPY. Of the total applications, 954 applicants were selected by the subdivision committee. In the first phase, 350 ambulances have been handed over today. We aim to provide subsidy on 1,086 ambulances under the scheme by December.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-transport-dept-launches-50-cng-buses-350-ambulances-101627139655039.html

The Congress high command has prepared this agenda, after listening to grievances of MLAs, with the chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh tasked with implementing it. Some of the key issues that appear on the document are justice in desecration cases, power tariff, drugs and bureaucratic red tape. “We have no option other than this to move forward. Punjab’s future depends on it,” said Sidhu, referring to the agenda, at a public meeting in Chamkaur Sahib, the constituency of Punjab cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi. He was given a rousing welcome in the town. “Every MLA, MP and worker is a guardian of this 18-point agenda and it has to be implemented,” Sidhu added, flanked by Punjab Congress Committee working president Kuljit Singh Nagra and Channi. “Every Punjabi wants justice in the beadbi (desecration) case of the Guru Granth Sahib,” Sidhu said, also referring to the drug menace in the state, adding that all Punjabis wanted the big fish to be named and caught.On the high power tariff, he said, “Why did we enter into a power purchase contract at ₹18 a unit, when it is available at ₹2 per unit. This, at a time, when we know that every year, solar power rates are declining by 20%. Why is Punjab paying between ₹7 and ₹18 per unit. Why should power not be bought from the national grid? We need answers.”He added that he was with the farmers, and wanted them to win their long-drawn battle against the Centre’s three farm laws. “I will contribute in whatever way the farm unions ask me to, and will ensure their success.

According to local administration, there are around 42 houses in the village and most were buried under the soil after a portion of the nearby hillock gave away on Thursday evening. The locals, with the help from a team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the police have so far pulled out 42 bodies with around same number of people still missing. A nine-month-old and another 11-month-old infant are among those missing. Theirs mothers, according to Sunetra Pawase, a nurse working at a local preliminary health centre, were found dead during the search and rescue operation. “The entire village was vaccinated last month. We have done two deliveries in this village. Two infants are still missing. I have seen all the small children from the village. There was a small girl in this village who used to come with me while I would visit the village. Yesterday, I found her dead, lying on her stomach which is very painful,” said Pawase. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited Taliye village on Saturday afternoon when he assured locals of all possible help. “Sir, we thought we would get all help on second day, but nothing came forward. It’s the third day and search and rescue operation hasn’t picked up pace,” said a youngster, whose sister was missing. The chief minister assured of speedy rescue efforts. Dr Abhijit Chavan and his wife Dr Bhagyashree were the first to reach the spot to provide relief to victims on Friday. Bhagyashree, who works in the PHC, said she was treating two pregnant women who had recently delivered babies “The deliveries took place at our hospital and their young ones are missing,” she said. The Chavan couple has been closely connected with the village and the entire village used to visit their clinic for medical check-up. The medicos are known for conducting successful deliveries of patients from the village. “We have found bodies post which we conducted spot post-mortem. Still many bodies are there and we pray to God that at least one person should be traced alive. It became difficult to identify the bodies. The scene at the spot was horrendous as corpses were found dismembered as hands and legs were strewn apart due to the impact of the gushing rainwater. We did on the spot autopsy and handed over the bodies to their relatives. The bodies were totally decomposed and it is very difficult to get the bodies intact,” Dr Chavan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vaccinated-for-covid-a-month-ago-taliye-s-hope-of-recovery-buried-in-landslide-101627139475607.html
24-07-2021||Patna||73% develop antibody against Covid as Bihar inches closer to herd immunity||Bihar could be close to a herd immunity threshold — when enough people will gain immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus, to block most transmission — as 73% population has reported prevalence of antibodies against the virus either from past infection or through vaccination. Buxar reported the highest seropositivity of 83.8%, followed by Madhubani 77.1%, Arwal 73.7%, Begusarai 72.7%, Muzaffarpur 65.3% and Purnia 65% in Bihar’s six districts sampled among 70 across 21 states in India by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) during the fourth serological survey between June 14 and July 6. Bihar reported higher seropositivity as compared to the national average of 67.6%. As many as 335 of the 400 general population sampled in 10 clusters of Buxar were found positive to coronavirus at some stage. Buxar had shot into the limelight when 82 corpses, floating in the Ganga, were fished out in May, during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. The National Human Rights Commission had taken cognizance of it and issued notice to the Centre and the governments of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, seeking an action-taken report. The Patna high court (HC) had earlier on May 17 flagged inconsistency in death figures related to Buxar. The HC had expressed its displeasure over inconsistency in figures of death in Buxar, mentioned in separate affidavits filed by the state’s chief secretary and the Patna divisional commissioner. This forced the state government to undertake a verification of deaths, which culminated in the state reporting a 73% spike in Covid-19 deaths, as its death count went up by 3,951 post-verification. The state’s cumulative Covid-19 toll jumped to 9,375 on June 8, as against 5,424 reported a day earlier. The state’s Covid-19 death toll was 9,635 on Friday. Similarly, 327 of the 424 samples tested positive in Madhubani; in Arwal 303 of the 411 were positive, 303 of the 417 tested in Begusarai were positive; 264 of the 404 samples tested positive in Muzaffarpur while 265 of the 408 samples tested positive in Purnia. Muzaffarpur reported 0% seroprevalence during the first serological survey in May last year. Buxar then reported 1.25%, followed by 1% each in Arwal and Madhubani, Purnia 0.75% and Begusarai 0.25%. Arwal reported the highest seroprevalence of 26.20% during the third survey in December. Buxar was next with 26.07%, followed by Madhubani 24.5%, Muzaffarpur 21.70%, Purnia 21.01% and Begusarai 15.01%. The state’s cumulative seropositivity was 0.7% during the first survey undertaken between May 17 and 20 last year. This meant that only 17 out of the 2,400 people surveyed developed antibodies (immunity) against SARS-CoV-2, said an epidemiologist. The seropositivity rate in Bihar increased to 7% during the second survey between August 21 and 26 and went up to 22.41% against the national average of 24% during the third survey between December 20 and 25. ICMR director-general and secretary to the government of India, Prof Balram Bhargava, shared the findings of the fourth serological survey with Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit on Friday. Around 3,000 blood samples were collected from the six districts and sent to the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. The survey, conducted in the state between June 20 and 25, was to ascertain the prevalence of antibodies, called seroprevalence or seropositivity, against SARS-CoV-2. “A seropositivity of 73% is a good sign for Bihar. This means that only 27% people are now susceptible to contracting the virus of which some may become serious during the anticipated third wave of the pandemic,” said vice-president of the Indian Association of Public Health, Dr CM Singh, also professor and head, community and family medicine at AIIMS-Patna, and its medical superintendent. “A seropositivity of over 70%-80% helps to develop herd immunity. However, since the virus is mutating very fast, there is the possibility of people getting re-infected and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour has to be followed. In case of re-infection, the symptoms will be mild in the 73% population, who have already developed antibody either by contracting the virus earlier or through vaccination,” added Dr Singh. State health officials, including those in the State Health Society, which looks after the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) under the National Health Mission, chose not to respond to this reporter’s phone calls or text messages. Officials at the ICMR’s Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna, were also mum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/73-develop-antibody-against-covid-as-bihar-inches-closer-to-herd-immunity-101627139475015.html

The expressway has decreased travel time between Delhi and Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, which was 3 hours and more while travelling via NH58, to merely 45 minutes. Work on rapid rail is also going on and hopefully, the first phase would be operational by 2023. It would convert into a metro after entering Meerut. The Delhi-Meerut Expressway and rapid rail would also reduce travelling time from Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha and other districts to Delhi. Commuters from Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar will also reach Delhi in much less time.Observers say these and other projects in the western UP region may top the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s development agenda on which it intends to fight the forthcoming assembly elections in the state.The party had announced that the forthcoming elections in UP would be fought on issues of nationalism and development and projects being carried out in the Meerut region would certainly be on top to woo voters in the western UP region, people familiar with the matter said.BJP MP from Meerut, Rajendra Agarwal, said that the party had done a lot of developmental work in the area and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, rapid rail and Metro were flagship projects which would benefit not only Meerut but almost the entire region.He said that the party would certainly convey the benefits of these developmental activities to people and claimed, “People extended their support to the BJP and we hope they would continue the same after assessing its work.”Agarwal said that the speedy and easy connectivity of west UP districts with the national capital would help in strengthening business and opening new avenues of growth and development in the region.Opposition leaders, however, are ready to downplay the claims of the BJP. Samajwadi Party district president in Meerut, Rajpal Singh, accused the BJP of projecting previous governments’ projects as their own to mislead people. He said that the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and rapid rail projects were originally Congress’ projects while the Metro Rail project was floated by the Samajwadi Party.He said the BJP promised airport and ring road to Meerut which were still a distant dream and there were many other projects which were promised but didn’t come into existence.“They are champions in misleading people and would continue doing it in forthcoming elections but we will expose their lies,” said Singh.A trader, Amit Sharma, who owns an automobile showroom and has other businesses, said that despite many controversies in BJP’s governance, these development projects would give the party an edge over others because traders and people were demanding speedy connectivity to Delhi for years.On opposition parties’ allegations that most of the projects were conceptualized and planned during the previous government, Sharma said, “The credit goes to those who deliver”. He, however, said that the ongoing farmers’ movement may dent the BJP in western UP. Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions of western UP have 71 assembly and 14 Lok Sabha seats. During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party won all 14 seats but could not win 6 seats in the Moradabad region in the 2019 elections. In the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP won 51 out of 71 constituencies in 14 districts of Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/developmental-work-may-give-bjp-an-edge-in-west-up-say-observers-101627139356288.html

He had been remanded to judicial custody and lodged at a jail in the adjoining Aurangabad district,” he said.Sale and consumption of liquor is banned in Bihar where the Nitish Kumar government had brought in a stringent prohibition law six years ago.“Manjhi died at the jail on Friday. As the news reached here, residents of his village squatted on the highway blaming the death on physical torture. When a police party tried to pacify them, they turned violent,” said Pandey.The SDPO said the constable, Kanti Devi, 54, was hit by a vehicle as she was trying to control the mob and succumbed to injuries while being rushed to a hospital.“The agitators indulged in heavy stone-pelting and fired a few shots from unlicensed firearms. Several police personnel have received grievous injuries. We have arrested five people in this connection. A heavy deployment of police is in place to keep the situation under control,” Pandey said. The family has been demanding ₹25 lakh compensation and a government job for the next of kin of the deceased.According to another police officer, circle inspector (Jehanabad) Bhavesh Mandal, the angry mob caught hold of Kanti Devi and started beating her with lathis and sticks.

Leaders of farmer outfits claimed that the removal of hoardings symbolised voters’ anger against successive governments, who felt cheated as regime after regime failed to bring development and employment.

If farmers are not allowed to enter Delhi, people will not allow leaders of political parties to come into villages. Our main opposition will be against the BJP, as its leaders passed anti-farmer laws in Parliament. The SAD and Congress leaders have not fulfilled their promises,” added Shadihari.Randhir Singh, a youth leader, said even after Navjot Singh Sidhu’s coronation as th Punjab Congress chief, there will be no change in the life of common man. “The Akali got votes in the name of Panth.

The serosurvey was conducted between June 16 and 20.While Covid-19 antibodies were found in 85.53 per cent of healthcare workers, the overall sero prevalence in those districts is 65.12 per cent. Ganjam topped the chart with 70.9 per cent sero prevalence, Rayagada and Koraput came at second and third place with 63 per cent and 61.3 per cent, respectively.Mohapatra said the serosurvey report was satisfactory compared to the national average of 67.6 per cent. “People developed antibodies due to direct exposure to Covid-19 in both the first and second waves and after getting vaccinated against the virus. Senior citizens and healthcare workers have mostly developed antibodies as they were vaccinated in the first phase,” he said.He said 50-60 per cent of the children surveyed were found to have developed antibodies. They are likely to have got the infection from their parents or other family members.RMRC director Sanghamitra Pati said the antibodies are likely to continue for at least 16 weeks.Like the rest of the country, Odisha was hit hard by the second wave of Covid-19 with the state reporting 12,852 cases on May 22.

During monsoon, anti-personnel mines drift away from their place and pose a threat to soldiers on the LoC.The deceased soldier has been identified as Sepoy Kamal Dev Vaidya, a native of Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh.“On the night of Friday, Sepoy Kamal Dev Vaidya was on operational duty in Krishna Ghati Sector. While moving during the duty, Sepoy Kamal Dev Vaidya was critically injured in an accidental mine blast. He was immediately evacuated to the nearest medical facility but later succumbed to his injuries,” said a defence spokesman.Sepoy Kamal Dev Vaidya, aged 27 years, belonged to village Ghumarwin in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh. He is survived by his mother Vanita Devi.“Sepoy Kamal Dev Vaidya was a brave, highly motivated and sincere soldier. The nation will always remain indebted to him for the supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,” said the spokesman.Meanwhile, a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) marked dummy aeroplane balloon was also recovered near the LoC in the KG sector on Friday. However, nothing incriminating was found from it. It was the seventh such aeroplane shaped balloon found in J&K, Punjab and Rajasthan since March this year.On March 30, a similar balloon with the letters PIA written on it was found in Mendhar in Poonch. Similar balloons were found in the Hiranagar area of Kathua on March 9 and in Gharsana, Rajasthan on March 11. On March 16, it was recovered in the Bhalwal area of Jammu and ten days later on March 26, another similar balloon was found at Dera Baba Nanak, Batala in Punjab. Three days later on March 29, it was again recovered in the Kanachak area of Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/soldier-dies-in-mine-blast-along-loc-in-j-k-s-poonch-101627134016279.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||‘Maharashtra to bring plan to relocate people living in hilly areas in view of landslides’: CM||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said in view of the incidents of landslide, the state government would come up with a plan to permanently relocate people living in hilly areas and rehabilitate them to safer places. According to Thackeray, who visited landslide-affected Taliye village in Raigad district, a comprehensive plan is being worked out for people living in risky terrain to safer places. He also said that a policy would be formulated for the management of water as parts of the state, especially the western Maharashtra region, witnessing floods during the monsoon due to the rise in river water levels. “Instructions have been given to concerned officials to prepare a detailed rehabilitation plan for such vulnerable populations across the state in view of such incidents of landslides which have now become a frequent phenomenon,” Thackeray said while addressing media on Saturday. Thackeray further said, flooding is witnessed in western Maharashtra during the monsoon due to the rise in the water level of rivers. Hence, a policy would be formulated for the management of water in this region. He said his government will expedite the process of rehabilitation and compensation of the flood-affected people. Ratnagiri and Raigad districts bore the maximum brunt of the rain fury and the resulting floods. On being asked about assistance from the central government, he said, “We are getting all the help from the centre. The Army, the Navy and the Airforce are helping the state government in carrying out the rescue operations,” he said. The CM, along with his cabinet colleagues Eknath Shinde, Anil Parab, Aditi Tatkare and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, visited Taliye and inspected the landslide-hit area. As many as 42 bodies were recovered while over 40 are still missing. When asked about the delay in relief, the chief minister said that all rescuers have reached the locations and started the work. “However, there may be few places where they reached late or other equipment could not reach because of difficulties due to rain and difficult terrain,” he said. Several relatives of the missing persons complained to the CM about the delay in rescue and relief operations. Thackeray assured them saying, “We are with you in this time of grief and will take care of everything”. The CM also announced ₹5 lakh compensation each for the kin of those who lost their lives in the landslides caused by torrential rainfall. The state will also incur the costs of treatment for those injured, he added. As many as 40 homes in Talai village were buried under a hillock which came crashing down on the locals on Thursday afternoon due to incessant rains. A day before the CM’s visit, PM Narendra Modi held a telephonic discussion with CM Thackeray and tweeted, “Anguished by the loss of lives due to a landslide in Raigad, Maharashtra. My condolences to the bereaved families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery. The situation in Maharashtra due to heavy rains is being closely monitored and assistance is being provided to the affected,” it added. Till the time of filing this report, 44 victims had been dug out of the wet marsh in the village and around 80 persons were still missing according to information shared by the district administration. The chief minister assured all assistance to the victims and relatives of those who lost their lives during floods. “You will be taken care of. Don’t worry,” he told the villagers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-bring-plan-to-relocate-people-living-in-hilly-areas-in-view-of-landslides-cm-101627132696294.html

24-07-2021||Patna||Nitish Kumar reiterates demand for caste-based census||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday reiterated his demand for a caste-based census, saying it will help in better decisions for the people’s development and welfare. “We will request the Centre that a caste-based census should be done at least once,” said Kumar. “I have been saying for a long time that once caste-based census must be done, as it will give a clear idea about the population of different castes. It will help in planning for them. An attempt was made in 2010 but it was not done properly. It was completed in 2013 but never published.”Kumar said they have shared their thoughts about a caste-based census in the House in February 2019 and 2020. He said it will help expand the benefits of government schemes and make it easier to work for development.In 2019, the Bihar assembly passed two resolutions favouring a caste-wise census in 2021 and for continuing with the old 200-point roster system, which treats the university as the unit, for job quotas while opposing the 13-point system that treats the department as the unit. In 2020, ahead of the state elections, the assembly passed resolutions against the National Register of Citizens and for the caste-based census in 2021. The Centre has said, as a matter of policy, there will be no enumeration as per caste other than that for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) for the census. It has cited the provisions of the Constitution and reservation of seats for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and in the assemblies as per their proportion in the population. Kumar’s emphasis for a caste-based census is based on the proposal of the Justice Rohini Commission for the sub-categorisation of reservation for Other Backward Class (OBCs). The commission was set up in 2017 and has recommended splitting 27% reservation for the OBCs into different categories for equitable distribution of benefits among different sub-castes to ensure that the benefits reached the really deprived sections. After several extensions, the panel submitted its report in February 2021 dividing 2,633 OBC castes on the Central list into four sub-categories for splitting the 27% quota into 2, 6, 9, and 10%. India’s last caste census was conducted 90 years ago in 1931. Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav questioned Kumar what the ruling Janata Dal (United) or JD (U) will do if the Centre does not consider the caste census. “JD (U) has a stake in the Centre now with a cabinet minister. Why did JD (U) still have to persuade the Bharatiya Janata Party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-reiterates-demand-for-caste-based-census-101627125076049.html
24-07-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Giving AI a cutting-edge impact||EDGENeural.ai is a deep-tech startup ushering in a new AI paradigm by building an AI-based platform that can, the company claims, automatically craft robust, scalable and efficient deep neural networks for EDGE devices. It brings AI in the hands of every developer to make the adoption of AI faster, smarter, and secure. The startup is currently backed by the NVIDIA Inception Program, T-Hub, StartupIndia, Microsoft for Startups, and Nasscom DeepTech Club 2.0In the beginningDhairya Badiyani and Sarvesh Devi, both from Satara district, studied engineering in Pune. After completing undergrad, both went to the US for further studies, and a few years later returned to form their own startups. However, they did not know each other until they joined an independent startup – Badiyani as its cofounder and Devi as the chief technical officer (CTO). While that startup got acquired in August 2019, the duo started a joint venture, and founded EdgeNeural.ai in December 2019.Badiyani has been fascinated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2009, after he was introduced to the field by his project guide from MIT Pune. Devi was working as a software developer until the 2008 recession and then moved to Silicon Valley for exposure. Deploying AI on EDGE devices Computing, deploying AI models (algorithms) on resource-constrained EDGE devices is a challenge for all companies. Deploying AI models on an EDGE device means understanding complexities of hardware so that the algorithm runs efficiently. Explaining the challenges faced by companies, Badiyani says, “Expertise on hardware and software is needed while developing any AI-based product or solution. This is the most difficult combination any company would want to work on. There are companies which are only into hardware, or only into software. The idea of EDGENeural was born out of the desire to face these challenges by combining hardware and software with expertise in AI. We want to simplify coupling hardware and software, specifically for building AI applications.”Pandemic challengesSays Devi, “In January 2020 we started facilitating AI on EDGE. Then Covid hit and the entire world was shut down. We realised, bringing something futuristic in to pandemic times was going to be difficult. During Covid, touchless technology came into picture and we assumed that the timing was right. We got associated with some institutes that wanted facial recognition technology that could be deployed across any platform – mobile, computers, cloud infrastructure or a standalone EDGE device. We created an attendance tracking application using facial recognition. Within a month we were able to sign hundred users for our facial recognition-based attendance tracking. “Within three months the customer base went up to 500. We were able to quickly able to build prototype, start testing and deployment. Our facial recognition algorithm worked with or without mask, with 95 per cent accuracy. We did something that helped us survive that phase, but our heart was in building a platform enabling companies to build AI for EDGE devices, and make that journey easy.”Badiyani said, “We focussed on the EDGENeural platform idea. We did a lot of market research. We were able to generate a good amount of data points confirming that deploying AI on EDGE devices is really a big concern in the ecosystem. It was a trigger for us that we need to pivot; facial recognition can go on if needed, but this is the future and we have to solve this problem so that adoption increases.”On the EDGE of a cloud Cloud is a centralised architecture where the entire data sits there and the data processing also happens there. It is dependent on internet connectivity and the response time is longer. One can’t rely on cloud infrastructure for time-critical applications. Decision- making capacity on the device itself is the next step. Badiyani claims, “Every industry will adapt to EDGE where time is critical, device is remote and there is poor or no internet connectivity. EDGE brings in advantages of local processing, data security and faster response time. We do not have to rely on internet connection. Only the critical data which needs to be post-processed can be sent, but the rest of the decision making can happen on the device.”EDGENeural platformSays Badiyani, “EDGENeural platform is a developer tool. Our customer would typically be a solution provider or solution builder or a system integrator. We will provide our platform and they will be able to build AI models for the EDGE infrastructure.”Devi adds, “A typical timeline to build an EDGE AI product prototype takes anywhere between three and six months. It takes another six months for a ready product or a solution. With this huge timeline, the process becomes very complex. With our platform, we can reach prototype stage in a month and production stage in the same quarter.”“We want to make EDGENeural globally available so that enterprises or developers or AI engineers can utilise our platform and build efficient AI models on smaller EDGE computing devices. The platform is under development. All three modules – training, optimisation and deployment – are ready with us. We are stitching them together so that it becomes a developer tool. Any developer can train and optimise the model, specifically to what hardware they want to build towards and deploy,” explained Dhairya.There are other complimentary features on the platform like version-based controls for AI models. “AI is a continuous improvement and development lifecycle. Every time a new set of data comes in, training comes into picture, deployment comes into picture,” he added. Says Devi, “We can reduce time-to-market for a product on an EDGE AI solution by two to five times. Also, considering various parameters, we can enhance the performance of AI models by up to seven times. Accuracy of model is not compromised, while improving performance. We can also reduce the cost by 75 per cent – the cost reduction is in terms of bringing experts who can build EDGE AI solutions and the recurring cloud infrastructure cost.”Badiyani says, “We have recently signed up our first paying customer. We have closed the deal and development is happening now. Three customers are in line. We are doing Proof of Concept (POC) with a bunch of other companies. All these are India-based companies. In the first quarter we are focussing on India as a market, and then in the next or third quarter our goal is to bring on US clients and grow globally.”Funding Raising funds was very interesting journey, says Badiyani. “We want to build a global company, a developer company which will require good team. The company was bootstrapped until March 2021. The product was in alpha version at that time. We showed our capabilities to investors. Being very futuristic, initially we got some resistance. We took it as a good feedback, we evaluated, fine-tuned what we are trying to build. Even the business model that we had proposed initially evolved. It took us sive months to close our first investor in February 2021 - High Net Worth Individuals (HNI) based in the US, with a technology background. This is the first investment –that we received.”“Followed by that, we were in conversation with our existing lead investor Anicut. Primarily, they wanted to move forward. Being a technology driven company, it was not just about money, but also about what more value investors can add to the company. Our lead investor like Venkat Raju is a seasoned entrepreneur especially in the AI domain. We thought he could help us accelerate growth. The market for EDGE AI is not just limited to India. US, Europe, and APAC markets are also worth exploring. Within a span of a month-and-a- half, we were able to bring in investors for the amount we wanted to raise. This seed round was the first institutional fund we accessed,” Badiyani adds.The amount raised by EDGENeural during the seed round is undisclosed. Says Badiyani , “The startup was initially bootstrapped and we had invested $40,000 which gave us a runway of about a year. Devi and I were not taking any salary. After funding, our goal is to bring in more team members and people from varied backgrounds in AI, Edge computing, and hardware. Considering all this, we have now a runway of around 15 to 16 months.”Future plans“Being a tech company, creating IP and strategic partnerships is going to be play very crucial role in terms of growth of EDGENeural. Currently we are a six-member team and we also have two interns. Now our plan is to grow the team and heavily invest in building the technology. Our first beta product release is expected to happen by December 2021. We want to support more and more hardware on the platform for maximum usability. This will be our journey for the next six months,” says Devi. EDGENeural revenue model Explaining the revenue model, Badiyani says, “At present, Python is most preferred language for building AI algorithms and solutions. There are around 8.2 million python developers around globe. It is estimated that 35 per cent of these will be working on AI algorithms in the near future. Our goal/target is to cater to five per cent of those, which would give us a market of 150k to 200k python developers.”“Our platform is a tool that will be subscription based. It will be per user, per month or an annual subscription model. We are estimating that in the coming few years, if are able to bring on 150k to 200k python developers onto our platform, we can reach up to $5.6 million monthly recurring revenue,” Badiyani claims.“We will have two versions. The community version will be free for users for research or trial basis. The enterprise version pricing would start from $849 per month. Pricing will vary on features selected,” he adds. Investors’ speak“As investors, we see a lot of value in the technology created at EDGENeural.ai, which in turn will unlock new opportunities for many businesses across different industries. What impressed us most was a strong and unique business model – one that is easily scalable in India and beyond.”-Ashvin Chadha, co-founder, Anicut Angel Fund“Edge Computing has a massive market opportunity, but its adoption has been stymied by developers forced to make significant compromises with tools and technologies built in a different era and/or repurposed from cloud (hub) centric architectures. EDGENeural’s platform should help accelerate and fully realise the potential of Edge computing. We are looking forward to being a part of EDGENeural for the long term and accelerating growth as well as building a global company.”-Venkat Raju, entrepreneur and investor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-giving-ai-a-cutting-edge-impact-101627124654737.html
24-07-2021||Pune||At 646 mm, Jor village records higher rainfall than Mahabaleshwar||Jor village, located at least eight kilometres from Mahabaleshwar recorded 646 mm rainfall in 24 hours ending Friday morning, according to Mahavedh, a public-private partnership (PPP) project which measures rain at Jor. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) does not have an observatory at Jor village to measure rainfall. The rainfall was higher than that in Mahabaleshwar, a famous hill station in Satara district, which recorded 594.04 mm rainfall during the last 24 hours, creating a new record. In 48 hours, the hill station recorded a whopping 1,074.4 mm rainfall, according to IMD. “This is the highest 24 hours rain ever recorded in Mahabaleshwar’s history. In the last 48 hours Mahabaleshwar reported a whopping 1,074.4 mm rainfall, which is also very high,” said Vineet Kumar, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Heavy rains in the Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani belt of western ghat has mostly contributed to the flood situation in neighbouring Ratnagiri and Raigad districts as rivers such as Vashisthi and Savitri originate in the same area. Similarly, heavy rain in the Koyna dam catchment area near Mahabaleshwar has increased water levels of the Koyna and Krishna rivers, inundating many areas in Sangli and Kolhapur. According to IMD officials, active offshore troughs and strong westerly surges were the main factors that led to intense rainfall in the hill stations. The hill station, every year, receives extremely heavy rain. Wherein the average July rainfall is 3,182 mm. July and August are the wettest months in Mahabaleshwar during the monsoon season with a total average of 5,530 mm rainfall. Annually, the hill station records an average of 5,710 mm of rain.The hill station is located at 1,439 m above mean sea level in the Western Ghat which makes it ideal for high-intensity rainfall. The strong westerly winds and the shear zone running through Maharashtra make Mahabaleshwar most favourable for very heavy spells along the hilly terrains. Meanwhile, Kolhapur district recorded 147 mm rain which is the highest rainfall recorded in 24 hours in July during the last ten years, IMD stated. The IMD stated that very intense clouds were observed over parts of Raigad district and adjoining areas of Roha, Bhira, Matheran Shrivardhan, Thane district, Kalyan, Ratnagiri district, Dapoli, Harnai, Chiplun, Satara and Pune Ghat areas.Latest radar observations from Goa radar indicates moderate to intense clouds over areas including Kolhapur, Satara, Pune, parts of south Konkan too including Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/at-646-mm-jor-village-records-higher-rainfall-than-mahabaleshwar-101627124474955.html

24-07-2021||Patna||PM Modi says Darbhanga airport is becoming imp contributor to Bihar’s progress||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the Darbhanga airport was becoming an important contributor to Bihar’s progress, acknowledging the good response it has received ever since starting operations last year under Central government’s UDAN scheme, aimed to boost regional air connectivity. The PM’s observation came in response to a Tweet by a man who thanked the PM for giving Darbhanga civil aviation facility. “Happy to know! We are working towards boosting connectivity and comfort as far as the aviation sector is concerned. As for Darbhanga airport, it is becoming an important contributor to Bihar’s progress”, wrote PM Modi.It was in response to a Tweet by one Mukund Jha who wrote: “For the first time I am boarding a flight with My Father. Thank you @narendramodi ji for giving the airport to Darbhanga.” Jha also posted photos with his father before boarding the plane and after getting seated inside,Jha’s bio on the micro blogging site indicated he was president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in south Kolkata.“BJP in 2014 promised to give us [an] airport and they kept that promise and built one airport,” he said in another post on the matter.His post drew over 5,300 likes within a few hours and his followers tally increased by a couple of hundreds.Meanwhile, one of threads praised the PM saying, “The vision of NaMo govt in improving connectivity and giving us airports such as Darbhanga and Pakyong in Sikkim and 4 upcoming airports in Ladakh, international airport in northeast is absolutely laudable (sic). Hope every major town of India has airport and rail connectivity.”A couple of others put out Tweets demanding civil aviation facilities at other major cities in Bihar such as Purnia and Bhagalpur. Flight operation at Darbhanga airport was launched on November 8 last year. As of now, SpiceJet and IndiGo are connecting the city with Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata besides Hyderabad.According to the Airport Authorities of India, on Friday, Darbhanga airport witnessed movement of 18 flights and 2,155 passengers. Acquisition of 78 acres of land for the construction of a permanent terminal building and installation of navigational facility is pending with the state government.

24-07-2021||Pune||Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar hints at relaxations in Pune||Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar hinted on Saturday that Pune was likely to get some relaxations from Covid containment measures beginning Monday as per a decision taken in the weekly Covid review meeting. He added that a final decision will be taken after a ministerial meeting on Monday post consultations with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “In the Covid review meeting there was [a] consensus to give some relaxations from Monday such as increase [the] timing of shops’ [operation hours] till 7 pm. I will conduct a meeting on Monday in Mantralaya. I will talk to the CM as well. A positive decision will be taken for shops and restrictions on weekends,” said Pawar.

In Kevanale in Raigad, 11 bodies were recovered from a landslide scene. Seven people were killed in multiple landslides in Satara district and 30 more were missing. In Ratnagiri’s Posare, three persons were killed after a portion of hillock collapsed while 14 persons were still reported missing. In a statement, the Chief Minister’s Office said landslides were reported at 10 places. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced financial assistance for the landslide-hit people. In Taliye, rescuers pulled out bodies from the debris manually as heavy rain and difficult terrain prevented earth moving machinery from moving to the spot. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the villagers were alerted and moved to safer locations in anticipation of heavy rains. He added the India Meteorological Department had issued a red alert. “We had relocated villagers of Taliye a few days back to safer location considering the risky terrain. However, the locals moved back to the same place before the landslide.”Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari said around 32 houses were buried under the landslide and around 10 persons survived with minor injuries. “Based on the information from locals and survivors, we can say almost 30-35 people are still feared trapped. We have pressed more rescuers into service.”While the landslide struck on Thursday evening, rescue operations started only by Friday morning due to visibility issues. Satara district Collector Shekhar Singh said, “We have recovered six bodies so far while 30 persons are still missing. The search operation is underway on war-footing though heavy rains in many parts are creating hurdles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-landslide-rescue-operation-hampered-by-rain-101627101913389.html
24-07-2021||Mumbai||Shilpa Shetty questioned, Raj Kundra's police custody extended: 10 points||Actor Shilpa Shetty was questioned by the Mumbai Police’s crime branch on Friday in connection with the alleged porn racket involving her husband Raj Kundra. A local court in Mumbai extended Kundra's police custody till July 27. Kundra was arrested on July 19 by the police under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act.Raj Kundra was arrested by the Mumbai Police on Monday night for allegedly creating pornographic films and publishing them through mobile applications. The Mumbai Police have said they have arrested a total of 11 people, including Kundra, so far for their alleged involvement in the crime. Kundra has moved the Bombay High Court challenging magisterial remand order. Here's what we know so far:1. A crime branch team took Raj Kundra to his Juhu residence on Friday where they recorded Shilpa Shetty’s statement. During the search, police seized a laptop from the house.2. Police said the actor was the former director of Viaan Industries, from the premises of which the racket was being handled by Umesh Kamat, a close associate of Kundra. Kamat has also been arrested.3. A court in Mumbai extended the police custody of businessman Raj Kundra and his associate, Ryan Thorpe, till July 27 in the case.4. The police, while seeking further custody, claimed in the court that Kundra had plans to sell 119 adult films for $1.2 million to a person. Separately, an investigation officer said that the police also wanted to probe the alleged transfer of funds from a sports betting firm based in South Africa into Kundra's bank account.5. The police told the court they found during their probe that Kundra set up Armsprime Media Pvt Ltd, which through London-based Kenrin Pvt Ltd bought the Hot Shots app to upload "objectionable videos" on social media. Kundra's phone contained WhatsApp chats regarding Kenrin and its financial transactions.Also read | Raj Kundra paid police ₹25 lakh to evade arrest: Report6. The police wanted to probe if this deal went through and the videos were transferred. They added that searches at the accused's office led to the seizure of 51 obscene videos.7. An employee who handled accounts of Hot Shots told investigators that between August 2019 and November 2020 it earned a net profit of GBP 4,000 to 10,000 per month, police said.8. Since Thorpe allegedly directed the company's employees to remove all data related to the Hot Shots app after a case was registered in February this year, sections of IPC related to "destruction of evidence" have been added to the case, the police said.Also read | Mumbai Police recover 70 porn videos made on Raj Kundra's order: Reports9.

24-07-2021||Dehradun||‘Ties of brotherhood?’: Judge pans cops in custody death case, orders CBI probe||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand high court has ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over the probe into the death of a Haldwani jail prisoner in March this year after his wife alleged he died after being beaten by four prison guards.The high court also told the state government to consider transferring Nainital senior superintendent of police Preeti Priyadarshini and initiating departmental action against her for not filing a first information report (FIR) on the wife’s complaint. The court said the FIR was filed on May 26, more than 45 days after the custodial death on March 6 on the orders of the district’s chief judicial magistrate.“The written words in the judgments of the courts and the provisions of right to life, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution, will remain dead letter, if action against erring police officers are not taken by the administration,” justice Ravindra Maithani said in his 16-page verdict that also asked the administratiion to transfer the circle officer of Haldwani and the four prison guards accused in this case.Incidentally, it was on the complaint of the wife accusing him of aggravated sexual assault of a child in the first place that the man was arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on March 4 and sent to Haldwani sub-jail. On March 6, he was brought dead to the hospital. The official account was that he fell but the autopsy recorded his 10 injuries in some detail.His wife, however, filed her first complaint after a prisoner, Rahul Shrivastav, phoned her after his release on March 13 and told her that four prison guards, Devendra Prasad Yadav, head guard, Kriti Nainwal, Devendra Rawat, Harish Rawat, brutally thrashed her husband that led to his death. The verdict detailed how the woman approached different authorities to seek investigation into her husband’s murder but was stonewalled by the police. It also recorded how the police at one point cited a magisterial inquiry into the custody death as one reason though there was no bar on registering the FIR.The Haldwani circle officer did inquire into the death on the SSP’s orders but the court spotted many gaps.“Is it ‘ties of brotherhood’ that the matter was not promptly lodged? Is it ‘ties of brotherhood’ that instead of lodging FIR, SSP Nainital ordered for inquiry by CO Haldwani? Is it ‘ties of brotherhood’ that CO Haldwani concluded after enquiry that the statement of eyewitness Rahul Srivastava does not find corroboration? Is it ‘ties of brotherhood’ that CO Haldwani, while recording its conclusion, did not even examine the doctor who conducted the post mortem and noted the injury?” justice Maithani asked, referring to a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that spoke of police personnel preferring to “even pervert the truth to save their colleagues”.The high court also ordered that the four guards at Haldwani sub-jail be immediately transferred to some place outside the district “to ensure fair investigation otherwise within those four walls of Sub-Jail Haldwani perhaps nobody would dare to speak the truth and only witness would be those stone walls which unfortunately cannot”.“The instant case is not an ordinary case. Allegations are of custodial death. It is against Guards of Sub-Jail, Haldwani. Deceased entered Sub-Jail, Haldwani hale and hearty with no wounds on his body. But, when he was taken out from Sub-Jail, Haldwani on March 6, 2021 and taken to Base Hospital, Haldwani, he was declared brought dead…according to the petitioner, she approached everyone in order to lodge the FIR …the SSP, declined to lodge the FIR…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ties-of-brotherhood-judge-pans-cops-in-custody-death-case-orders-cbi-probe-101627093092759.html

Heavy rains will be driven by strong winds of speed 50-60kmph gusting to 70kmph, which have been forecast as very likely over the southwest and westcentral Arabian sea and along and off the Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa coasts, IMD said on Friday.As Maharashtra continues to grapple with the heaviest downpour it has seen in the last 40 years, the meteorological department raised red alerts for several regions in the state, indicating that heavy rainfall will continue for the next few days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government has roped in the Indian Army to assist the local administration in flood-affected areas.The fairly widespread rainfall over the region with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are very likely to continue over the west coast for the next two to three days with a reduction thereafter, the IMD predicted on Friday. However, isolated extremely heavy falls are also very likely over Konkan, Goa and the adjoining ghat areas of central Maharashtra during July 23 and July 24 with reduction thereafter, the IMD said.Also read: Over 60 killed as west India hit by heavy rainParts of Maharashtra like Satara have already been issued a red alert in the view of extremely heavy rainfall for the next 24 hours. The intense rainfall is expected to pound the hilly ghat areas of western Maharashtra.Extremely heavy rainfall was likely to occur at isolated places in the ghat sections of the Satara district, the IMD said. Issuing an orange alert for Pune and Kolhapur, the IMD said "heavy to very heavy rainfall" is likely in isolated places in the ghat areas of the two districts.National and state highways like Pune-Bengaluru, Goa-Mumbai and Kolhapur-Ratnagiri are shut for the past two days, as many roads and villages have submerged in floodwaters. On Friday, the Western Railway cancelled at least six trains for Saturday in the areas affected by the heavy rainfall and landslides.The severe rainfall and flooding in the region have disrupted the collection and distribution of milk and the brand Gokul, owned by Kolhapur Zilla Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh (KZSDUS), said there will be no supply of its milk pouches to Mumbai as Maharashtrian districts like Kolhapur, Sangli remained affected due to flooding."The milk collection was largely affected on Thursday and Friday due to downpour in western Maharashtra and Konkan.

An order issued by the General Administration department (GAD) said mobile phones should be used only if necessary for official work. Indiscriminate use of mobile phones in office maligns the government's image, the order said, without any reference to the spyware row. Text messages should be used more if mobile phones are to be used at all and conversation through these devices should be as little as possible, it added. The use of social media through mobile devices during office hours should be limited, the government said. Personal calls on mobile phones should be answered by stepping out of office, the `code of conduct' further said. The order also said that conversations on mobile phone should be "polite" and carried on "in low voice", keeping in mind people in the vicinity. But calls from elected representatives and senior officials must be answered without delay. Mobile phones should be on silent mode during official meetings or inside the chambers of senior officials. Similarly, Internet browsing, checking messages and use of ear phones should be avoided on such occasions, the government advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/use-mobile-phones-for-office-work-only-if-necessary-maha-govt-tells-employees-101627087833697.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sales at Chandigarh nurseries finally pick up||With monsoons finally making a comeback and Covid cases dropping significantly, nurseries in the city which were reeling under losses are finally reporting an increase in sales.Ranbeer Sood, manager of Durga Nursery at IT Park Road, Manimajra, said business had been hit as rains stopped in the region after mid-June. Now, they are expecting a resurgence. “People buy different varieties of plants during this season, especially ones with medicinal qualities like aloe vera. Mostly senior citizens, largely women, prefer to buy them. Other than families, many companies also buy saplings in bulk as part of social development plans,” said Sood.Rajinder Vashisht, owner of Dashmesh Nursery in Manimajra, said, “We used to earn about ₹10 lakh per month before the pandemic outbreak. However, sales have now dropped by 80% and we average around ₹2 lakh per month.” The UT forest department is also conducting various drives to supply saplings to residents as a part of annual Van Mahotsav celebrations.With lockdown restrictions being eased, Chandigarh residents have also started going back to nurseries. Sakshi Arora, a resident of Sector 19, said, “I have been buying plants for a long time, especially on special occasions such as birthdays of my family members. I buy saplings from Durga nursery and prefer snake or rubber plants, which absorb pollutants and act as defence against airborne allergies.”Many people also grow their own vegetables in their kitchen yards, for which they purchase saplings. Hira Lal Narang, 60, a resident of Sector 18, said, “I have always been health-conscious. I prefer kitchen gardening and grow vegetables like eggplant, green beans and spinach in my backyard as most vegetables that we buy from markets are sprayed with pesticides”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sales-at-chandigarh-nurseries-finally-pick-up-101627075870550.html

Now the fact that we have to take online classes along with offline classes doesn’t sit right with us. Teachers cannot be expected to teach throughout the day. We will approach the UT administration asking them to allow only online or offline classes for private schools,” said HS Mamik, president of the Independent Schools’ Association, Chandigarh.Mamik, who is also the chairman of Vivek High School in Sector 38, said the school was currently closed for summer vacations and a decision regarding reopening will be taken in August. “Meanwhile we have sent feedback forms to parents and will take a call depending on how many agree to send their wards to school,” he added.Assistant director of St Xavier’s Senior Secondary School, Sector 44, Naresh Handa said, “Due to optional attendance, a sense of complacency is sure to come up in students, who won’t want to come in for physical classes. Later, it will be taxing for teachers to clear their doubts again. The administration should issue clear instructions and seek inputs of parents directly before taking a final call.”Live classes a solutionSt Kabir Public School in Sector 26 is one private school that reopened for physical along with government schools on Monday. Currently physical classes are underway for Classes 11 and 12, while those for Classes 9 and 10 will begin on July 26. Administrator Gurpreet Bakshi said, “We have started hybrid classrooms that involve teachers teaching in the class and students at home participating virtually. This saves our teachers’ effort and is working well.”Attendance increasing in govt schoolsFour days into the first week of classes resuming at government schools, students’ attendance has improved from 10% to 15%, officials said. Class 9 has the highest attendance of around 20%, followed by Class 10 with 15% and Class 12 with 10%. Classes for Class 11 haven’t started yet. “We hope that the numbers will increase significantly by next week. Our primary concerns are following the Covid protocols while making sure that academics don’t suffer,” said Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, UT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pvt-schools-on-the-fence-about-reopening-to-meet-admn-101627073652406.html

We request the concerned authorities to expedite the process.”When contacted, a senior official of GMADA said, “Though the draw of lots to be held on April 27 this year was deferred, we will be holding another one soon.”The IT City is spread over 1,722 acres in Sectors 66B, 82A, Sectors 83A and 101A adjoining the Airport Road.

If cautiously administered, an additional one dose can be extracted from every vial, which can be used as the 11th dose.Between May 1 and July 13, the Chandigarh health department had administered additional 5,671 doses by effective usage, whereas the Punjab health department had wasted 13,613 doses, the data shows.The union ministry further said that between May 1 and July 13, a total of 2.49 lakh doses had been wasted in India while 41.12 lakh extra doses had been extracted beyond the labeled quantity. “Regular review meetings are being held with states and UTs to review all aspects of vaccination drive including vaccine wastage,” the letter reads.Average weekly inoculations go up in UTAs the set deadline for vaccinating the eligible population with at least the first dose draws near, the weekly Covid vaccination average has improved in the city.In the last week ending on July 22, 9,227 people were inoculated with both the doses daily. This is the highest weekly vaccination average since the beginning of the drive in January this year.In June, on an average 6,200-6,500 doses were administered to people per day, on most of the days.According to the latest electoral list, around 7.1 lakh people are eligible to be jabbed in Chandigarh. The UT health department aims to vaccinate the entire eligible population, with at least the first dose, till August 15. As of Friday, 80% of the eligible population had taken the first dose; 23% have been fully vaccinated.Dr Amandeep Kang, UT director, health services, said, “Since the 18 to 44 age group became eligible for the vaccination in May, the numbers have improved in Chandigarh. Also, the UT health department is making unique efforts in reaching out to people. Daily, 15 mobile vaccination vans are visiting different areas. We have converted two air-conditioned buses into vaccination buses, to facilitate people at their doorsteps.”Dr Kang further said that evening vaccination camps at the UT’s four government hospitals and camps in public places including Sukhna Lake, were also receiving a good response and over 500 people were getting vaccinated there daily.The UT health department expects to meet the vaccination target till the set deadline, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-vaccine-wastage-in-chandigarh-as-5-671-extra-doses-extracted-from-vials-101627073171284.html

For final findings, the new committee would have looked at these cases. The Delhi government set up a committee on May 27 that could award up to ₹5 lakh compensation for deaths due to oxygen shortage. But, the LG disbanded the committee on May 21,” said Jain on Friday.The first committee being referred to is a four-member committee constituted by Delhi government in end-April on the orders of the Delhi high court that examined the deaths of 21 patients at Jaipur Golden hospital in the intervening night of April 23 and 24. The committee said that the deaths were due to “respiratory failure” and not because of a shortage of oxygen.This comes days after the Union health ministry in Parliament said that no state reported any fatality due to oxygen shortage, as Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accusing the Centre of “lying”.“If I say there were deaths due to oxygen shortage, you would ask me how many, who were these people, which hospital were they admitted to. We would have been able to provide all this data if the committee had been formed,” said Jain.The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, at the time, justified the move, since a similar committee was constituted weeks ahead of the city administration’s order, on the direction of the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/junked-panel-would-have-re-examined-all-o2-deaths-in-city-jain-101627071953106.html

Some of the MPs, who were out of station, would sign it on Monday. She was the chairperson of the TMC. She has also been unanimously chosen as the chairperson of the TMC parliamentary party with effect from Thursday,” O’Brien said at a press conference in New Delhi.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was quick to take a swipe at the TMC.“It is an obvious decision. TMC is a one-woman party and that is Mamata Banerjee,” state BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said. Friday’s announcement comes a month after TMC’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who is seen as the in-charge of the party’s expansion plans, announced that the TMC would expand footprint in other states ahead of the 2024 national polls to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha said: “Usually the leader of a party’s parliamentary party is a MP. But any party can do anything, It is their decision.” O’Brien, however, said: “Mamata Banerjee is a seven-time MP. She has the experience, insight, vision and the feel to guide the parliamentary party. She has been doing this and we were taking her guidance. She was just a call away. We are only formalising the reality.”The TMC chief will camp in Delhi next week. While she already has an appointment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Banerjee is also expected to meet a host of other political leaders.Even though Mamata Banerjee was defeated by Adhikari by a margin of 1956 votes, she took oath as the chief minister for the third time. She now has to get elected from an assembly seat within six months in a by-election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/formalising-the-reality-says-tmc-on-naming-banerjee-parliamentary-party-s-chair-101627071670156.html

Lodged under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51B of the Disaster Management Act, the FIR did not name anyone.“So far the case is against unidentified persons. We are scanning the footage to identify the violators,” said superintendent of police (SP, City), Ketan Bansal. Just four days ago, on July 19, the UT administration had banned gathering of more than five persons for processions, protests or rallies in the city, other than at the Sector-25 rally ground, in the wake of the attack on the city mayor and a senior BJP leader.The number of people at other social gatherings is capped at 200 as part of Covid restrictions. Who is to be blamed? Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who oversaw preparations for the event, claimed it was held after taking permission from the UT administration and all senior police officers were also present. However, SDM (Central) Harjit Singh Sandhu maintained that no approval was sought from the SDM office.Hitting out at the Congress, Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood questioned, “Will the Congress take the responsibility if the third wave hits the city? They should be ashamed of themselves for endangering the lives of city residents when the second wave has just subsided. A symbolic takeover would have sufficed.”Chander Mukhi Sharma, a senior AAP leader, said, “The Disaster Management Act and Section 144 prohibitory orders were grossly violated. It seems the administration has imposed these restrictions only to curtail local protests under the pressure of the BJP.”ALSO READ: Cold war ends as CM Amarinder Singh and Navjot Sidhu meet, sip tea togetherResidents, too, took to social media, slamming the administration and police for allowing the blatant violations. “Shame on Chandigarh administrator.

24-07-2021||Other||Chandigarh’s glorious past presents a tense future||Corbusier wasn’t against high-rise development Le Corbusier was always in favour of high-rise apartments as is evident from his ideas on Radiant City and his proposal for Redevelopment of Paris. He always envisioned a sector with a single high-rise mix-use tower for the population, and kept rest of the land vacant for agricultural and recreational use. When he actually got the chance to implement his ideas in Chandigarh, in the 1950s, our country didn’t have enough funds to invest in vertical infrastructure. In order to execute his urban ideas, Corbusier had proposed that Phase I, which consisted largely of low-rise low density government housing, be demolished and new high rise, high density development be carried out. But that was never done. Though some of the southern sectors have got such buildings, most of it poorly executed. Kamal Passi, ChandigarhNorthern sectors already bursting at the seams with PGsAt present, there is no bar on renting out houses to any number of tenants or converting it into a paying guest accommodation, subject to certain conditions. In most one kanal houses of the northern sectors, at least seven to eight rooms have been rented out to different individuals on single or double-sharing basis. So there are more than 15 tenants in such houses. It is far better to have just three families as owners than having so many tenants, especially in terms of burden on the infrastructure. Vinod Chadha, ChandigarhPreserve Chandigarh’s original character Chandigarh is a great experiment of modern urban planning and architecture which had a significant impact on development of cities and towns in the states of Punjab and Haryana. Chandigarh administration should never of allow the rise of apartments over bungalows/independent dwelling units and must protect Le Corbusier’s Chandigarh, a world renowned City Beautiful. Instead, the administration should embark on preserving the city’s original character and at the same time, improve the city infrastructure and beauty through modern technology and urban renewable mechanism. As far as the growing population’s housing needs are concerned, the massive development in SAS Nagar (Mohali) & Panchkula will help resolve it. HS Bhogal, MohaliDo away with north-south divide Considering the affordable housing needs of people, the Apartment Act should be allowed in Chandigarh. Besides, it will help families legally divide the property and sell / mortgage / reconstruct etc without the consent of all stakeholders. If apartments can come up in the southern sectors, which are now seeing a high population density and added burden on infrastructure, the why can’t it be allowed in Northern sectors. How can a city have two set of rules, presumably one for the rich and the other for the poor. Maj RS Virk, ChandigarhDon’t kill city’s soulChandigarh is a special city and is known all over the world for its architectural character and quality of life for its residents. It cannot be compared with Delhi or any other city in India and it enjoys a special status of being the first fully planned and best livable city. Allowing flats in place of bungalows will indirectly kill the soul of the city as it is already bursting at its seams. The increase in FAR in marla category houses, and increased FAR in commercial buildings in various stages has already done more than enough in increasing population density of the city. Only people with vested interests, such as builders and developers, want to change the character of the city.Ashwani Sabharwal, ChandigarhCity will lose its heritageCity Beautiful’s layout plan by Le Corbusier is one of the best architectural and design works in India. But if the UT administration allows any construction of apartments over bungalows, Chandigarh will lose its heritage. Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhDevelop townships around cityDevelopment should be proportional. There is already a shortage of parking space, water scarcity, and electric cuts. If subdivision of residential plots or floor-wise ownership is allowed, these problems will only accentuate. Instead of overloading the city, towns around Chandigarh should be developed.Renu Saigal, via emailAllow apartments, but with ridersApartments may be allowed in Northern Sectors to meet the growing population’s housing needs, subject some conditions. The plot area should be at least four kanal, only 40% coverage may be allowed for construction, basement and ground floor should be allowed for parking only, only four-storeys should be allowed.Subhash Chander Swami, via emailMove with the timesLe Corbusier’s Chandigarh was planned keeping in mind the population at that time. But now the population has increased manifold. In addition, now it is surrounded by satellite towns of Mohali and Panchkula. Hence, the need of hour is to allow the rise of apartments.Subhash Chugh, via emailCan’t allow independent housing in rapidly growing cityThe population of the city has been risen from 10.5 lakh in 2011 to nearly 12 lakh in the last decade. In a rapidly growing city, the administration cannot build so many independent houses. The conventional approach is to displace poor residents and destroy their homes to make way for new development. But this has an adverse effect on the already living population. Thus apartments in northern sectors must be allowed.SK Khosla, ChandigarhDon’t be averse to changeBlind adherence to any practice or provision howsoever good, must not hinder any endeavour to make it better and in tune with evolving needs and aspirations. Things do not change; we change and changing for the better sustains life. Rise of multi-storeyed apartments over a bungalow in northern sectors of Le Corbusier’s Chandigarh, will be to the detrimental to neighbours in bungalows nearby. Nonetheless, apartment complexes should be allowed where ample open space is available. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaCan’t absorb more people hereOn one hand, we talk about the traffic problems, installing air purifiers, looking for solutions to minimise pollution in the city, both noise and traffic, trash management, and on the other hand we talk about absorbing more population into Chandigarh. I believe it is not justified since this will disrupt the beauty of the city. The city has already been pushed to the lowest level as far as beauty is concerned. How can we disgrace it more.Anju Mohan, PanchkulaLe Corbusier’s legacy needs to be protectedWith the ever-burgeoning population hitting the roof, problems of residents have multiplied too. The administration shall have to take a clear stand so as to protect and preserve the rich legacy of Le Corbusier as the misplaced plan is set to spoil the heritage of the city. The administration needs to maintain a status quo if it wants Chandigarh to enjoy the ‘City Beautiful’ tag. Ramesh Dhiman, Chandigarh Solve existing problemsBefore making way for new population, Chandigarh need to find a solution for the existing problems such as parking hassles. The problem is not of population but that of mismanagement. So the government should make necessary arrangements to tackle the crisis.Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Don’t make city a concrete jungleAny city has to evolve over time while also keeping its culture and ethos intact. Chandigarh is one such city which needs preservation of its heritage so that future generations can count on its beauty in years to come. The UT administration should avoid making the City Beautiful a concrete jungle. The design and layout of apartments designed by Le Corbusier should be retained as they add aesthetic value to the city. High-rise apartments in the city should not be allowed as they would steal the beauty of Chandigarh. In order to meet the demand of the growing population we have to satellite townships with modern transport facilities. Much more is there to solve the problem than spoiling an excellent piece of urban design , that is Chandigarh.Dr Anil Kumar Yadav, via emailCity infrastructure need a complete over overhaulA city’s needs change over time and evolving to fulfill it is termed development. In our City Beautiful, the rising population needs more space for houses. To meet these needs, the authorities must allow the construction of apartment buildings in the place of bungalows while retaining our marvellous heritage. For this, some of the city’s old sectors should be designated as heritage sectors where such construction should not be allowed. Construction of apartment buildings over the debris of bungalows should be approved in the other sectors. This should be considered an opportunity to have a complete overhaul of the city’s infrastructure.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhWith times, requirements have also changedUT administration should allow the rise of apartments over bungalows in Le Corbusier’s, Chandigarh to meet the growing population’s housing needs. First of all, everyone cannot afford a bungalow and apartments are a more convenient option. Apartments score highly over bungalows as they are easier to sell because of relatively lower ticket sizes and the convenience of ownership. Both apartments and bungalows offer their unique living quotients and one must choose based on their taste, investment philosophy and financing options. Population change leads to a changing demand for housing. With the continuous increase in population there should be several housing options. Ishita Nara, via emailAllow apartments, but preserve green beltYes, high-rise apartments must be allowed to meet the needs of the continuously growing population, though the green belt of Chandigarh and pollution norms should not be compromised. Parking issues can be resolved by planning parking spaces in newly emerging high rise apartments. Karan Gaba, PanchkulaRetain character, ethos of cityCities evolve with times but Chandigarh, being unique, must retain its character and ethos as envisaged by its founders. There won’t be any limit to need-based changes and commercial exploitation that would lead to city losing its character and unique architectural spaces. Division of a residential plot to carve out apartments or flats is a clear cut violation that should not be allowed. However the demand for more residential units could be accommodated by allowing multistory construction in sectors bordering Mohali and Panchkula where we already have a landscape with high-rise apartments.DS Banati, MohaliDevelop the peripheryWe need to keep growing. Keeping in mind the beauty of Chandigarh one thing that comes to our mind is the uniqueness of its architecture. The basic plan of Chandigarh should not be disturbed. If the city has to expand and absorb in the growing needs of the population then periphery should be developed.Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaPlanned upgrade of cityBeing India’s first planned city, the union territory is one of the cleanest in the country and is famous for its quality of architecture and urban planning. To keep up with the growing population and requirements of the city, the civic authorities designed the master plan of Chandigarh that will help them to regulate development and building activity. As per projections, Chandigarh will have a population of around 14.5 lakh by 2021 and over 20 lakh by 2030, which will further strain infrastructure — roads, power, water, sanitation, education, transport and housing. So, there is need to upgrade the city’s infrastructure. Khushboo Singla, ChandigarhGreen apartmentsChandigarh’s heritage and legacy needs to be preserved in line with Le Corbusier’s plan, but certain areas now need change according to the modern requirements, be it parking needs or high rise apartments. With the population growing rapidly in Chandigarh, the development of high rise apartments should be approved. Rather models of modern cities like Singapore can be studied for the same by developing high-rise apartments in a green way, which will help in maintaining the city’s character as well.Supneet Moyer, Chandigarh Preserve legacy with a touch of modernisationChandigarh is a modern, beautiful and famous city in the World. Presently the city does not have sufficient housing for its population. Necessity is the mother of invention. So multi-storey apartments should be allowed but care must be taken to ensure the city’s original character is protected rigorously. It is true that change is never easy but always possible as per requirement. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliDon’t ruin the beauty of the City Beautiful.A large population is the reason behind the ideology of the apartment system in Chandigarh. Chandigarh has been known for its beauty, layout, and architecture. Nehru’s dream can’t be shattered in a single go. Government is doing work on its toes to bring a decrease in the population. If it happens, the population would no longer be a problem. Even if the above fact is ignored, a decision to enforce the apartment system will rob the city of its beauty and charm. Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhLaunch economical, environment-friendly housing schemesWith a surge in population due to migration, housing demand in the city is rising. Housing schemes launched by CHB in the past were too costly and beyond the reach of a common man. Too much interference by bureaucrats, councillors and ministers put all the projects in limbo on pretext of preserving the beauty of the city. Much land is available with the Chandigarh administration, which needs to launch economical, environment friendly, disaster resistant housing schemes. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliApartments a more practical choice Chandigarh city beautiful was designed and planned on geometric pattern by famous French architect Le Carbusier. All roads run parallel and perpendicular to each other. With the increase in population of the city, need was felt to go in far apartment (flat system), because bungalows take a lot of space, upkeep and regular maintenance problems. Multi-storey apartments occupy less space, and are easy to maintain. Further, as we now have nuclear families, apartments are a more practical choice.Col TBS Bedi (Retd), MohaliReader of the weekAdapt to the changing timesThe UT administration should allow the rise of apartments in Chandigarh to meet the growing population’s housing needs. Since the concept of joint families is slowly fading away, apartments will serve the needs of nuclear families. An added benefit is that the maintenance of apartments is comparatively easier and thus a more practical option for those who lead fast-paced lives. These days, people are also going for luxury apartments, which come with in-built facilities such as swimming pools, jacuzzi etc, and have supermarkets, playgrounds, and medical facilities within the township. Household issues such as electricity, water, and gas are easy to sort since the societies mostly use joint connections. Aarushi Mishra, ChandigarhExpert takeSkylineApartments can be allowed but not at the cost of city’s skyline. Development has to take place but the architectural heritage should also be safeguarded. SD Sharma, senior architect, Chandigarh heritage conservation committee’s sub-group chairman Vertical expansionAmid shooting property rates, rampant population growth and space constrains, the need of the hour is to facilitate the Master Plan- 2031 for calculated vertical expansion. This would help solve the problem of housing in terms of space, suitability and budget. Salil Dev Singh Bali, lawyer (associated with this case in HC) Study the demandWhile we need additional housing, preserving the city’s heritage is equally important. Currently, we don’t have any studies on the actual housing demand in the city. Academic institutions can undertake such studies and come up with design solutions to cater to higher density housing needs.Dr Sangeeta Bagga, principal Chandigarh College of Architecture Phase out single-storeysThe rise of apartments in Chandigarh is the need of the hour and the city can be expanded now. Also, single-storey government accommodations should be phased out and new multi-storeyed buildings should come up in its place.

24-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Fond memories of the village||Many of us in this city can trace our roots to a village. Praveen Lal is no different. The shoeshine man lives with his wife and four kids in west Delhi’s Dwarka, “but my true home is my village.”In his late 20s, Mr Lal left his ancestral land more than a decade ago “but I’m still connected to it and go back every year to do my share of work in the family’s farm fields.”His parents and siblings live in Biawar, a rural hamlet near Ajmer, in Rajasthan. This morning Mr Lal is sitting on the dusty floor of Connaught Place, softly calling out to passersby to get their shoes polished. No one is stopping.“We have a pond in our village, where I learnt swimming as a child... it continues to be full of water, clean water, and even today men in the village go there for a dubki (dip) — you instantly feel fresh.”Though there is always the option for a quick bath under the handpump that almost each household has, he confirms.Mr Lal’s village is ringed by low hills and “the area has all sorts of trees, but I don’t remember having fruit trees from which we could have had guavas or ber for free.”Sometimes, here in Delhi, Mr Lal closes his eyes and thinks of Biawar. “The first image I always see is of our mandir.” The white marble Ramdevji Maharaj temple stands at the top of a hill to reach which “you have to climb more than 500 steps.” On stepping inside, Mr Lal immediately sits down on the temple floor to recover his depleted energy. “It’s a meethi thakaan (sweet exhaustion)... resting in the mandir is more peaceful than sleeping on your own bed.”Mr Lal and his family visit the village every year during holi. Now, swinging his head on both sides of the colonial-era colonnade, he mutters that “it’s difficult to imagine that a place like my village is in the same world in which Delhi is… they both have nothing in common.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-fond-memories-of-the-village-101627070267796.html

They were all deployed in pickets and hit by speeding vehicles.Of the three Air Force officers, two of them died in the same aircraft wreckage incident in Arunachal Pradesh in 2019, and the third officer died in a MiG-21 aircraft crash in the Kangra Hills in Himachal Pradesh in 2018, the chief minister’s office said in a press statement.“The Kejriwal government will give a ‘Samman Rashi’ of ₹1 crore each to the family of six bravehearts of Delhi who lost their lives in the line of duty.

24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidelights: Sidhu’s installation as PPCC chief||VIPs’ struggle for entry Senior Congress leaders, including outgoing president Sunil Jakhar, cabinet ministers Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, former minister Rana Gurjeet Singh and a number of MLAs, were badly stuck among the crowd of party workers at the gate of the Congress Bhawan. They had to persuade cops on duty to clear way. Some MLAs even argued with the police personnel. Rawat’s ‘balancing’ act All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Congress’ Punjab affairs Harish Rawat referred 79-year-old Capt Amarinder Singh as “buddha sher” with the heart of a king and termed Sidhu as a dynamic leader. Covid protocols go for a toss Among the hundreds of party workers and leaders at the Congress Bhawan, only a few wore masks. Maintaining social distancing was near impossible. The chief minister was seen wearing a mask which he lowered during his speech. Taking the higher seats! As the crowd jostled with each other for seats and many from the back couldn’t see the leaders on the dais, some Congress workers climbed the trees at the Congress Bhawan courtyard for a better and uninterrupted view. Sidhu ‘the scarecrow’ “I will act as a 6-foot-4-inch scarecrow for the anti-Punjab elements,” said Sidhu while addressing the party workers, inviting cheers from the crowd. Much to their amusement, he also sang a parody, “Chat te tota behan nahi dena, Badal, Majithia rehen nahi dena”, leading to another round of cheering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidelights-sidhu-s-installation-as-ppccchief-101627069571982.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Amid cheers from the crowd, Sherry at his fiery best||Navjot Singh Sidhu reinvigorated the party cadres with his speech on Friday as they responded warmly to his words on the day he took over as the president of the Punjab Congress. Executing a bat stroke in the air with a flourish before heading to the rostrum, Sidhu told the packed house that the Congress was united and his aim was to work towards giving power back to the people, inviting a loud applause from the crowd, comprising mainly party workers gathered from across the state. “All Congress workers in Punjab have become the party’s state unit chief today. There is no difference between a leader and a worker,” Sidhu said. Dharam Singh, a Congress worker who had come all the way from Moga said Sidhu connects strongly with the party workers and hopefully “they (workers) will get their due under his leadership”. However, Sidhu, who broke the ice with the chief minister earlier in the morning over tea, touched the feet of former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and former PPCC chief Lal Singh on the stage, but not Amarinder. In his speech, Sidhu was very clear about his well-wishers, saying, “Jede mera virodh karde hai, ho mainu behtar bnange. Jede mere honsla-afzayi karde hai…Bhaji Sukh (Sukhbinder Sarkaria), Randhawa Saab (Sukhjinder Randhawa), Bibi Ji (Rajinder Kaur Bhattal), Rawat Ji...ae saare… kidda kidda naam levan (while pointing his hand towards the stage)… mera suraksha kwachh ne”. Addressing the gathering, Amarinder praised Sidhu’s family and recalled how Sidhu’s father, late Bhagwant Singh, had asked him (Amarinder) to enter politics. Earlier, Jakhar in his speech took potshots at the Amarinder government and even went on to say that bureaucracy ruined the Congress-led state government in Punjab. “I feel Akalian nu red carpet maar gya (referring to inauguration of Golden Plaza at Golden Temple during the previous SAD-BJP regime). Red-tapism killed our government. Bureaucracy ruined us,” said Jakhar. He said a message should go out from the government against the red-tapism in next six months. “The party’s route for national revival goes via Punjab-2022. In Punjab, party’s road to regain power goes via Bargari. We need to deliver justice in sacrilege cases at any cost,” said Jakhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-cheers-from-the-crowd-sherry-at-his-fiery-best-101627069210078.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Capt, Sidhu break ice over tea before installation ceremony||Putting up a united show after months of acrimony, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu bonded over high tea at Punjab Bhawan in Chandigarh on Friday morning before the cricketer-turned-politician took charge as state Congress president. Capt Amarinder Singh had invited all Punjab Congress MLAs, MPs and former PPCC chiefs for tea at Punjab Bhawan at 10am, an hour before the time fixed for Sidhu’s installation as the new Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief. The CM’s invite came on Thursday afternoon soon after Sidhu reached out to Capt Amarinder Singh through two of the four working presidents, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Sangat Singh Gilzian. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat kept a close eye as Capt Amarinder and Sidhu sat side-by-side. Sidhu had reached Punjab Bhawan but left the complex a couple of minutes before Amarinder arrived. Senior leaders from Amarinder group said Sidhu kept Amarinder waiting at the table for nearly 10 minutes and showed up only after Rawat rang him up. However, Sidhu camp claimed he had gone to perform ‘ardas’. “Such a pleasure seeing you here, Sir! I was already here. But had left only a few minutes before to perform ardas,” Sidhu told the chief minister as he reached the main table where Rawat and Amarinder, along with other senior leaders, were waiting for him. Sidhu’s usual flamboyance was muted as he greeted the chief minister with folded hands longer than usual. He tried to sit across the table but was persuaded by some ministers and Rawat to sit beside the chief minister. Former PPCC chiefs HS Hanspal, Partap Singh Bajwa, Lal Singh, MPs Manish Tewari, Jasbir Singh Dimpa, Santokh Chadudhary, Mohd Sadiq and Preneet Kaur were present. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu didn’t turn up. Ministers loyal to Captain, including OP Soni and Vijay Inder Singla, shared the table with the CM and Sidhu, while those belonging to the ‘Majha-Express group’ — Tript Bajwa, Sukhjinder Randhawa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria — sat elsewhere. Sidhu, in his trademark maroon Pathani suit with a coordinated scarf, was occasionally seen exchanging peasantries with Amarinder. At times, Rawat involved both the leaders in conversation. The two were together for more than half-an-hour before they left for the Punjab Congress Bhawan in Sector 15, Chandigarh, for Sidhu’s installation ceremony, in separate vehicles. A senior Congress functionary, who was present at the high-tea, requesting anonymity, said, “Both the leaders sat together as a formality; they were not comfortable at all. Let’s see what happens next.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-sidhu-break-ice-over-tea-before-installation-ceremony-101627069031214.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Govt says no record of farmers’ deaths: Tomar||The government has no record of farmers who have died during the agitation at Delhi’s borders against three new farm laws since 2020, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar informed Parliament on Friday. Tomar also said the government has not undertaken any study to ascertain the apprehensions in the minds of farmers about the three farm laws. Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since eight months in protest against the three laws. Out of them, a small group of 200 farmers are now staging a protest at Jantar Mantar in central Delhi after getting special permission. Asked if the government was aware of the total number of farmers who have died during farm protest since 2020, Tomar said: “The Government of India has no such record.” However, the central government during discussions with farmers’ unions had appealed to them that children and elders, especially women, should be allowed to go home in view of the cold prevailing at that time and the Covid-19 situation, he said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha. Further, in a separate reply, Tomar said: “No study has been undertaken to ascertain the reasons for apprehensions created in the mind of farmers on account of these farm laws.” However, the Centre has proactively undertaken efforts to reach out the farmers to remove their apprehensions, he added. Asserting that the government is serious and sensitive towards farmers’ issues, the minister said the Centre has been engaged in active discussions with the farmers’ unions. So far, 11 rounds of negotiations have been held between the government and agitating farmers’ unions to resolve the issues, he added. In all the rounds of discussions, the government has stressed that instead of insisting on repealing the laws, the farmer unions should discuss about their concerns on specific clauses so that their issues can be resolved, he added. “During various rounds of discussions, the government continuously requested the farmers unions to discuss the provisions of the farm laws, so that if there is an objection to any provision, the advancement can be made towards resolution of those. But the farmers’ unions insisted only on the repeal of the farm laws,” he said. The last round of talks between the government and unions was held on January 22. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26. The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions. The committee has already submitted its report. ‘43 held, 5 cases registered so far during farm protest’ Delhi Police have arrested 43 persons and registered five cases so far during the ongoing farmer agitation against the Centre’s farm laws, Tomar informed Parliament on Friday.Tomar, in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, said the action against the mischievous persons falls under the purview of Delhi Police.As informed by Delhi Police, 43 persons have been arrested during the farmers’ agitation so far and five cases registered, he said.The investigation is pending in four cases, while trial is pending in one case, he added.On losses incurred by the government due to the protest, Tomar said the agitation led to the inconvenience to the public because of road blockage and other agitation activities.Also, deployment of police personnel for law and order arrangements led to government expenditure, he said. “But loss cannot be quantified...,” he noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-says-no-record-of-farmers-deaths-tomar-101627068971109.html

More than 16 people have died in rain-related incidents. Moreover, eight Covid-19 patients in Khed, Ratnagiri died owing to disruption of oxygen supply due to flooding. Four people were killed in a house collapse in Govandi. Of the 70 missing, 30 are from Raigad, 26 from Satara and 14 from Ratnagiri. More than 85,000 people in districts in Konkan and western Maharashtra have been shifted to safer places.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to carry out an aerial survey of the flood-affected Chiplun and Khed on Saturday. Rescue work continued in Chiplun, Mahad and other parts of Konkan that saw several areas submerged in floodwater. Floods and poor connectivity affected the work. While Ratnagiri administration was struggling to deal with flooding in areas like Chiplun and Mahad as well as incidents of landslide, there were allegations that the toll increased due to the delay in beginning the rescue work. The death toll in Taliye landslide reportedly increased as the district administration failed to reach to the village more than 18 hours after the incident happened around 5 pm on Thursday. The rescue team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) reached the spot on Friday afternoon. “We reached before any government official took note of the horrific incident. Had the rescue operation started in time, more lives could have been saved,” said leader of opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar. Padmashri Bainade, resident deputy collector, Raigad, however, said the rescue operation started early morning. “The area was submerged in 15-ft high water. We had deployed eight teams on Thursday night, but there were difficulties in reaching the spot. The teams waded through 4-ft water in morning and began the operation. The NDRF team which started from Pune yesterday afternoon was stuck midway because of a landslide and roads being washed away. The rescue operation will go on at night too, with the help of generators and floodlights.” Makarand Deshmukh, deputy collector, Konkan Division, said the rescue operation of people trapped in the debris and stranded in floodwater was on in full swing in Raigad, Ratnagiri and other parts of Konkan. “We will begin the punchanamas to assess the losses,” he said. NDRF team reached Mirgaon using boats and rescued 221 from the flooded areas. Minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said 15 people in Ambeghar and 12 in Mirgaon are feared trapped. “In Kondavale, a few families have been trapped under the debris. The rescue teams of the NDRF faced difficulties in reaching the spot because of the flooding on Friday morning,” he said. More than 1,250 people were rescued in Chiplun in the past two days from more than 12-ft high water on Thursday. “Discharge of water from Koyana dam in Satara, high tide and heavy rainfall led to flooding on Thursday. Chiplun registered rain of more than 600 mm in 24hours until Friday morning. The water in almost all parts of Chiplun has receded, barring a few places below sea level. Rescue teams of Coast Guards, NDRF, Army, Indian Air Force and local NGOs were involved in operations,” said an official from district collectorate. Many people in the Chiplun market were stranded on the roofs and terraces of their homes for more than 15 hours. Of the 18 companies of rescue personnel, with 45 personnel each, 14 have been deployed in nine districts, including Ratnagiri (4), Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Palghar (1 each), Raigad, Kolhapur, Thane (2 each). Two companies each of the SDRF have been deployed in Nagpur and Raigad. Rescue teams of Navy, Army, Coast Guard have also been deployed in Chiplun and Khed, the tehsils in Ratnagiri that has witnessed flooding. Two helicopters of Indian Airforce participated in the rescue operations in Chiplun, where hundreds of people were stuck on the roofs and terraces of their homes since Thursday morning. The state has requested for more number of teams of the central agencies, including NDRF, Navy and Army for the rescue operation. Thackeray spoke with union home minister Amit Shah requesting him for assistance in rescue operation. Thackeray reviewed the situation from the control room at Mantralaya on Friday morning. “Heavy rainfall is expected to continue for the next two to three days in parts of the state as predicted by the IMD. District administrations have been directed to take all steps to ensure safety of the people,” he said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar spoke with defence minister Rajnath Singh and requested him for the assistance from Army, Navy and Air Force. “The defence forces have already been roped in the rescue operations, but the DCM has requested for more help in the wake of the prediction of heavy rainfall over next two days. The union minister has assured him with additional deployment for the districts which have reported downpour and landslides. To coordinate with the central government for the deployment of the central forces, Aseem Gupta, principal secretary of relief and rehabilitation department has been appointed as the nodal officer,” said a statement issued by the office of DCM. Pawar has also directed guardian ministers of respective districts to stay put in the districts and oversee the relief and rehabilitation operations. The flooding led to washing away of the bridges and roads in many districts. The state administration was forced to shut many state and national highways for vehicular traffic. Pune-Bengaluru,Mumbai-Goa, Ratnagiri-Kolhapur highways have been shut for traffic. Many travellers to neighbrouring Karnataka, Goa have been stranded on their way. The milk supply to cities like Mumbai is expected to be affected on Saturday as collection of milk was badly hit in the flood-affected areas. “Against the daily collection of 1.3 million litres, we could collect only 250,000 litres of milk on Friday. Besides, transportation was not possible as many highways are shut. We have decided to discontinue the supply to Mumbai on Saturday,” said Vishwas Patil, chairman of Gokul milk. Many villages in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Kolhapur were in the dark because of the disconnection of electricity owing to damage to the infrastructure. The discharge of the water from the Koyana dam in Satara was increased to more than 53,000 cusecs on Friday. The district administration has shifted villagers in the surrounding areas of Krishna, Werana rivers to safer places.

Relatives of one of the patients claimed their patient was not positive for Covid-19,” said Dr Sanghmitra Phule, district civil surgeon. Datta Bhadakwad, resident deputy collector, said, “There was no shortage of oxygen, but it could not be supplied due to power outage.

24-07-2021||Mumbai||Construction of Navi Mumbai Airport expected to begin from August: Adani||Construction work on the much-awaited ₹16,000-odd crore Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIAL), which is now under the management of Adani group, is expected to commence next month. According to the new developer, the airport is also likely to start functioning from 2024. “Adani Airport Holdings Ltd (AAH) will begin the construction of Navi Mumbai International Airport next month and the new airport will be commissioned in 2024,” Adani Group recently stated in its press release on taking over the management of both Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) and NMIAL.At present, land acquisition is completed, said public relation officer, CIDCO, adding they have received 99.6% project affected people shifted out of their own. CIDCO is the implementation agency for the new airport.The announcement assumes significance in view of the fact that in December 2020, the previous promoter of NMIAL had written to CIDCO stating the region does not need a second airport till 2024 due to Covid-19 impact on the aviation sector that had in turn impacted travel demand.Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer of Centre of Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), said, “It may be feasible for the Navi Mumbai airport to be completed by FY 2025 if the project is aggressively pursued. However, given that recovery of traffic to pre-Covid level especially in international sector, will be till FY 2024, revisiting project timelines may be beneficial to all parties concerned, including the state government,” Kaul added.In October 2017, then GVK Group-led MIAL said it had received the Letter of Award (LOA) from CIDCO to construct and develop the new international airport in Navi Mumbai, whose foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February 2018. The second airport in the Mumbai region was expected to open in December 2019 and the deadline was pushed to 2021. The passenger terminal building is being developed to initially have a capacity to handle 10 MPA (Million Passengers per Annum) and would be enhanced to 20 MPA.The airport will be located in Uran and will be the second airport in Mumbai Metropolitan region after the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in the Vile Parle suburb of Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/construction-of-navi-mumbai-airport-expected-to-begin-from-august-adani-101627068550814.html

24-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC dismisses plea of MLA Bains in rape case||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday dismissed a plea from Punjab MLA and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjit Singh Bains, booked for allegedly raping a woman. Bains had approached high court on July 12 seeking quashing of the July 6 order of a Ludhiana court in which registration of FIR against him was ordered on the complaint of a woman. Bains had pleaded that the trial court passed the order without proper application of mind and contrary to settled tenets of criminal jurisprudence. Dismissing his plea, the high court bench of justice Manjari Nehru Kaul said it did not find any infirmity in the order of trial court. “The mere registration of an FIR cannot be construed as an act, which might prejudice the petitioner (Bains) in any manner. The court is only required to examine the existence of a cognisable offence and direct registration of the FIR in case the necessary ingredients with respect to the cognizable offences are made out,” the bench observed. The FIR was registered on the allegations of a 45-year-old woman in Ludhiana. The woman had initially lodged a complaint against Bains eight months ago. The woman alleged that she had come into contact with the MLA in a property dispute case but she was trapped. The case was finally registered at the Division 6 police station on July 12 on court’s order. The high court said that trial court neither acted without jurisdiction nor can its decision be termed as an abuse of the process of law. “..the power under Section 156(3) CrPC is a statutory power conferred upon the magistrate giving rise to a statutory remedy in favour of a person aggrieved. It would rather be an act of abdication of his powers by a magistrate in case he does not take an appropriate decision and fails to exercise his jurisdiction in the event of an aggrieved person approaching him,” the court recorded. The bench also said that the allegations by the complainant woman cannot be disbelieved outrightly at this juncture and and the investigating agency cannot be stalled/stopped from conducting investigation into the allegations which prima facie reflect commission of a cognizable offence.“A perusal of the allegations ... sufficiently persuades this court that the ACJM, Ludhiana, had enough material before it to order registration of an FIR,” the bench said adding that a magistrate certainly had the jurisdiction to act under 156 (3) CrPC and the pendency of a petition before high court on same controversy will not take away that jurisdiction vested in him. At the time of trial court order a plea seeking registration of FIR was pending in HC also. To the argument raised by Bains that magistrate ought not to have expressed his opinion on the allegations leveled in the complaint, the court said that though it was not necessary for the trial court, to record reasons in “extenso” but the order revealed that the judicial officer had recorded only enough reasons to show that there was application of mind. “Hence, the above argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is somewhat misplaced as there is no prohibition on recording reasons by a magistrate,” the court said. SAD demands Bains’ arrestLudhiana: Following the high court order, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) demanded immediate arrest Bains. Terming the HC verdict as the victory of human rights, SAD leader Harish Rai Dhandha said police officials tried to save Bains.Senior SAD leader and former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said: “While the state machinery was denying justice a victim, it was the court of law that came to her rescue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismisses-plea-of-mla-bains-in-rape-case-101627068369842.html

24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Bargari sacrilege: Court issues arrest warrants against 3 dera national committee members||The court of judicial magistrate, Faridkot, on Friday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against three absconding members of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s national committee, who were named accused in two Bargari sacrilege cases by the Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT). Seeking arrest warrants of three Haryana residents — Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri — the SIT claimed that sacrilege was committed on their direction. They have already been declared proclaimed offenders (PO) in three other sacrilege cases as police have failed to nab them since 2018 when they were first named in cases connected to sacrilege incidents in Moga and Bathinda districts in 2015. Judicial magistrate Tarjani adjourned the hearing of the case to July 30. If the police failed to nab them, the court will initiate a proceeding to declare them POs in two cases wherein torn pages of a “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) were found scattered in Bargari and three derogatory posters were put up near gurdwaras at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages. The SIT said two derogatory posters were pasted near the Bargari gurdwara on the intervening night of September 24 and 25, 2015, by the accused dera followers on their directions. “Later, on their directions, pages of the “bir”, which was stolen from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015, were scattered at Bargari on October 12, 2015,” said SIT. Dera committee members missing link in case The three absconding members of the dera’s national committee are the missing link in three sacrilege incidents that sparked off state-wide protests in 2015. The teams probing the cases claim that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari (Faridkot), Malke (Moga) and Gurusar (Bathinda) were given by Bareta, Kler and Dhuri to the district dera committee members. In July 2020, The SIT had named Breta, Kler and Dhuri as accused in a case relating to the theft of a “bir” from a gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the “bir” were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari village. Torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were also found at Malke village in Moga district in November 2015 and Gurusar (Bhagta) village in Bathinda district in October 2015. “The trio had met Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in Nabha jail in 2019, and instructed him to steal the bir. Similarly, in Moga sacrilege case, they gave instructions to dera state committee members Pirthi Singh and Jatindervir, alias Jimmy, after which sacrilege was done by a dera follower at Malke and Gurusar villages,” said an SIT official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-court-issues-arrest-warrants-against-3-dera-national-committee-members-101627068130018.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu-Capt spat was drama to save Cong’s sinking ship: SAD||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday said the Congress had acted as per a script to divert attention from its failures and befool Punjabis and asked newly appointed state Congress president Navjot Sidhu to give timelines for fulfilling the promises made to the people instead of resorting to empty bluster. Addressing a press conference, former minister and senior SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema spat between Sidhu and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was a drama staged to save the party’s sinking ship by diverting people’s attention from the state government’s failures, said the SAD. He also condemned outgoing state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar for stating that the road to re-election of the Congress in Punjab ran through Bargari and Behbal Kalan, the places associated with the cases of sacrilege. The SAD said there could not be stronger proof of the party’s contention that the Congress had played politics on this issue in conjunction with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2017 and was going on the same dangerous road again on the eve of the 2022 assembly election. “It is now becoming increasingly clear that the quarrel between Sidhu and the chief minister was stage-managed to divert the attention of the people. An effort is being made to save the party’s sinking ship by effecting a change in the state Congress unit and a two month long drama was also played out with this in mind,” Cheema said. “It is clear now that the actual fight in the Punjab Congress was over distribution of the spoils of power. Now that a promise has been taken by the high command that the proceeds of corruption will be distributed equally, the warring parties have buried the hatchet and are claiming this as a victory,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhucapt-spat-was-drama-to-save-cong-s-sinking-ship-sad-101627068009755.html

The party high command has given you the responsibility of taking everyone along, he told Sidhu.“When I am talking of taking everyone along, I mean taking common workers along,” he added.“We have to make the Congress victorious in Punjab and Uttarakhand and pave the way for the formation of the party-led government at the Centre in 2024 under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,” said Rawat.Pointing towards Amarinder, who was sitting next to Sidhu, Rawat said he was in awe of his magnanimity. “You are one such person whom we always look up to for inspiration. The way you fought for farmers’ rights and poor sections and the way you have taken steps for the welfare of various sections needs to be lauded,” he said.“One thing I know is that a lion remains a lion, he never grows old. At heart, a lion remains a king,” Rawat said, stressing that he and Congress workers know that the CM will take everyone along and ensure the party’s victory.About Sidhu, Rawat said he has the quality of mesmerising all and he is dedicated to Punjab as well as the party.Congress MLA Pargat Singh said: “People have high expectations from us. Sidhu is my friend but at the same time, we have to deliver. I have always done politics of issues.” Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira described Sidhu as a “charismatic and popular leader” and said people had high expectations from him.“At the same time, Amarinderji is an experienced, farsighted and a visionary leader. We are happy that both leaders are on the same page and a positive message has gone out not only to Congress cadre but people of Punjab,” said Khaira.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/take-everyone-along-rawat-to-sidhu-101627067829863.html

Seven people, including persons from the neighbouring home, have also been injured in the incident due to the collapse.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials suspect that an additional floor built on the structure could have led to the collapse. In June, the civic body had served a notice to the family for structural violations. The victims have been identified as Neha Parvez Shaikh, 35; her sister Farin, 22; mother Shamshad, 45, and grandfather Mokar, 80. The Shaikhs owned a furniture shop on the ground floor of the structure, while they had moved into one of the floors above around less than a year ago, locals said.Wasim Mustafa, 25, who owns a shop 50 metres away from the crash site, said, “The family had recently done some repair work and added an additional floor. The house was a ground-plus-one structure, but they converted it into a ground-plus-two structure with a terrace. It was a structure that was constructed with the support of iron rods and not by the traditional method of having a proper foundation under the ground.”According to locals, there were over a dozen of relatives at the family’s house to celebrate Eid on Wednesday and Thursday. However, at the time of the incident, only six of the family were present inside the house.BMC officials said Shaikh and Mokar were declared dead on arrival at the civic-run Rajawadi Hospital, while Shamshad was brought in a critical condition and died a few hours later. Farin’s body was recovered from debris a few hours after the crash. She was rushed to the hospital, but the doctors had declared her dead. On collapsing, the house damaged the structure of two nearby houses and one on the opposite side, thereby injuring four occupants in them. Shahid Qureshi, 53, a neighbour of the Shaikh family, said, “They [the Shaikhs] had overloaded the house with a huge water tank on the terrace and constructed a room over there. They had also called a few guests for Eid celebrations, which may have added the load on the house. All our belongings have been destroyed as the BMC demolished our house due to safety reasons. But we are alive.”“When the collapse took place around 4am, there was a loud noise and smoke everywhere. We thought there was a blast, and we could not see anything. My brother and I went to the collapse site and started pulling out people from the debris. We have an ambulance in our area but couldn’t save four members from the Shaikh family as they were badly injured,” said Samir Sayyed, 38, another local.According to assistant civic commissioner Mahendra Ubale, the house was constructed around 10 years ago. “We have sent notices to owners of 300 structures in the area, including this house, before monsoon. The owner had done some violations recently. We’ll take action against the contractor who helped the owner commit structural violations and also verify if any action can be taken against the family members who are alive because the owner of the house has died.”Part of Antop Hill building fallsA portion of a ground-plus-five storey building in Antop Hill collapsed at 9.55pm on Friday. No injuries were reported in the incident. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) disaster management department, the building is located at Punjabi camp near Hari Manzil. BMC said the building was partially vacated and the part on the east side of the structure had collapsed. The fire brigade, ward staff and local police have been mobilised for aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-house-crash-kills-four-injures-7-101627067049173.html

24-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra was to sell 119 porn films for USD1.2 million: Mumbai Police||Actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra was about to sell 119 pornographic videos to a person for USD 1.2 million and created new mobile application named Bollyfame in January this year after his previous app, Hotshots, was dropped from app stores, the Mumbai Police has claimed on Friday while seeking further custody of Kundra. A metropolitan magistrate court accordingly extended police custody of Kundra and IT support provider Ryan Thorpe till July 27.Kundra and Thorpe were produced before a magistrate court on Friday afternoon, as their custody remand had ended. The property cell of Mumbai Police’s crime branch sought further custody, claiming that they have found WhatsApp messages in which Kundra discussed selling his stock of 119 porn films to a person for USD 1.2 million.Claiming that the two accused had destroyed evidence, the police have added section 201 of the Indian Penal Code for destruction of evidence against them.The prosecution said after Kundra’s arrest, police had seized his mobile phone wherein they found several chats with Pradeep Bakshi, owner of Kenrin Pvt Ltd. Police found a list of 119 movies which were to be sold to a person for 1.2 million US dollars. During one of his conversations with a man, Kundra had said he was a partner in Kenrin Pvt Ltd.Police further claimed that Kundra received huge sums in his YES Bank account from Mercury International, an entity engaged in online sports betting and casino gaming. The money came from the betting company’s account held with the United Bank of Africa, but police are yet to ascertain if these transfers were Hotshots earnings or money won by Kundra in betting and/or casino gaming.During analysis, the agency came across a WhatsApp group on which Kundra and Thorpe discussed deleting all information related to content of Hotshots, its email, portal, etc. It is suspected that the data was related to the app and was destroyed by Bakshi on July 21, soon after Kundra and Thorpe’s arrest.Police recorded statements of several staff members who worked with Kundra. They claimed that in February after the Mumbai Police registered a case in the matter, Thorpe had told them to remove all data related to Hotshots.The Mumbai Police further claimed that Thorpe created the new app, Bollyfame, in January this year, on the instruction of Kundra.The prosecution also said that they are also investigating Kundra’s accounts. The police found huge inflow of money in the accounts of accused from international accounts in dollars and pounds which are being analysed. The agency claimed much of the money is from a bank account of African company named Mercury International. Police suspect the money earned through Hotshots was laundered through this African company or he was involved in online batting racket.Police is now in the process of identifying and contacting the women seen in the videos.Cops record Shilpa Shetty’s statementMumbai Police’s crime branch on Friday recorded statement of actor Shilpa Shetty in connection with the alleged porn racket involving her husband Raj Kundra.

Now that they have done sero survey which shows over 66% population has developed antibodies, they should provide some guidelines to all states based on their data on what kind of relaxations can be given, based on age-group, etc.,” Tope said.Another health department official said the number of cases in the state has stabilised for some days now. “The curve has stabilised; it is neither going up nor declining. Many districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada, from where the second wave started in the state in February, are now showing negligible cases. The viral activity is concentrated in a few districts, but these are high population density areas, business hubs, so there is more mobility. This is also a time to be on guard so that it does not go up. With higher number of vaccinations, we can prevent the impending wave from being strong,” he said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra administered 426,024 vaccine doses on Friday till 8pm, taking the total count to 40,850,822. So far, 9,693,886 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated in the state, as per data on CoWIN portal. Tope added that he plans to meet newly appointed Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya over increasing the vaccine stock allotment to 1 million per day for Maharashtra. He said he has spoken to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to accompany him to make the plea in person in New Delhi soon.“Currently we are able to carry out 3 to 3.5 lakh vaccinations daily because we only get that much doses [from the Centre]. We want to take it to 1 million a day, as we have the capacity. We have requested the Centre, and I will go and meet Mandaviya ji along with Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis to help the state get 1 million doses a day,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-plans-relaxations-for-districts-with-weekly-covid-positivity-rate-below-01-101627066809118.html

This year alone, 21 people have died and 54 have been injured in 228 incidents of structure collapses.Authorities and experts have attributed the large number of structure collapses in Mumbai – especially during monsoon – to aged and dilapidated structures; unauthorised construction due to which it becomes impossible for authorities to verify if all construction standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been followed; delay in redevelopment of old buildings; or neglect toward their dilapidated condition due to lack of resources or nature of tenancy across the city.“In Mumbai’s case, multiple factors play a role in such disasters. For example, all three incidents this monsoon wherein residential structures collapsed resulting in casualties were unauthorised constructions. None of them collapsed because they were very old and dilapidated. However, Mumbai does have very old structures that face multiple issues while opting for redevelopment,” a senior civic official said. On June 10, a ground-plus-three storey structure collapsed in Malvani, killing 12. According to civic officials, three floors of the building were illegal, as permission was only given for a ground-level structure.“In case of unauthorised structures, the material used is not good. As they are not legal, SOPs are not followed. Many buildings are made to withstand one or two floors. Later, the residents add more floors above these structures, and it leads to mishaps,” the official quoted above added.At the beginning of monsoon, BMC released a list of 407 dilapidated structures across the city, of which 322 are private residential buildings. City-based senior architect Vilas Nagalkar said, “In most cases where a portion of a building, such as the gallery or staircase, collapses, it is because the structure is very old. Residential RCC (reinforced cement concrete) buildings have the approximate life span of 60 years. Many buildings in Mumbai have outlived their life span. If they are regularly attended to, it is okay. However, in tenanted buildings, no one invests in maintenance and strengthening. For rainfall experienced in Mumbai, water proofing needs to be done on the structure every 10 years, which hardly happens.”According to Nagalkar, in too many cases, original structures are built to withstand a ground-plus-one or two-storey load, but residents expand the structure later. The original frame is unable to bear the load from the additional floors. “In cases where construction is unauthorised, there remain no methods for checks and balances to ensure construction that procedures are aptly followed,” said Nagalkar. Hussain Indorewala, assistant professor with Kamla Raheja Architecture Institute, said, “With Mumbai’s buildings, it is not a linear problem with a simple solution. We need to study area-wise numbers of building collapses, and then determine if illegalities or unauthorised alterations to structures or the age of the building contributed to a collapse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bmc-99-deaths-in-4-yrs-due-to-structure-collapses-in-mumbai-101627066749111.html

A 39-year-old caterer who runs his business at Ashok Nagar, Waldhuni, in Kalyan turned out to be a saviour for such people. As all the roads to Ashok Nagar area were blocked, the civic authorities could not provide food to the residents. Officials from the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) then reached out to a caterer, Pradeep Jawale, who instantly provided food to around 500 residents of the slum area for free, on Thursday afternoon. He also provided food to others who had approached him throughout the day. “Whatever I could do, I did from my side thinking that people are hungry, and they should get food in these tough times. As my shop is located on the upper side of the slum, it was not flooded. I also reached out to some shops for groceries and cooked food with the help of my five co-workers,” said Jawale, who has been running the catering business from 12 years. “Initially our team tried to send food to the residents but there was no way to reach the area. I then remembered that there’s a caterer in the area and checked with him if he can prepare food for those affected. He agreed and immediately started preparing food and served them to the residents,” said Vasant Bhongade, ward officer, KDMC. “My children and I have taken shelter in a community hall in the area. Jawale managed to send me food on time. I could feed my children due to him,” said Takdil Nisa, 35, a resident of the area, whose house has been affected due to the flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/caterer-feeds-500-flood-hit-residents-in-kalyan-101627066570200.html

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma held talks in Shillong on Friday evening ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to Meghalaya on Saturday. According to a statement issued by Sarma’s office, during the discussion, Meghalaya claimed 12 disputed places between both states as theirs. On the other hand, Assam justified with documents that those places belonged to them. “After a detailed discussion, both the governments decided to adopt a pragmatic approach and move from status quo to solution. It was agreed to discuss all 12 places one by one and review claims,” the statement said. If possible, both CMs will visit all 12 places. Further, Sarma invited Sangma for the second round of discussion in Guwahati on August 6. The Assam-Meghalaya border dispute is over 4 decades old and there is contention between both states at 12 points along the 733-km boundary they share. Several rounds of talks have failed to solve the issue. The last round of talks on the border dispute between both states was held in April 2017“It was a very fruitful discussion. We came to a common understanding, and we are firm and committed to resolving the border dispute. In view of contradictory claims, there would be more discussion and review so that a lasting solution could be reached,” Sarma said after the meeting. “The border disputes between both states is a long pending issue. It would take some more time as well as consultation for an amicable and accepted solution to both the states,” Sangma said. Chief secretaries and other senior officials of both the governments were also present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-move-from-status-quo-to-solution-of-borders-disputes-assam-meghalaya-cms-101627066509729.html

As torrential rain hit Maharashtra on Thursday, causing floods in different parts of the state, the train connectivity of the city with the rest of India was also disrupted.Heavy rain led to landslide, mud and boulder falls across CR, particularly in the Bhor and Thul ghats between Ambernath and Lonavala and Titwala-Igatpuri railway sections. Pawan Express that was enroute Mumbai got stuck between a landslide at one end and track washout on the other end near the Kasara Ghat section, late on Wednesday night amid heavy, continuous rainfall. “We sent an engine to pull the express out of the ghat section and bring it to a nearby station. However, when the engine reached the spot, we noticed that the tracks had been washed out due to heavy rainfall,” said a senior CR official.A team of 50 CR officials were sent to the site, where they worked on track restoration by ballasting and laying of rail sleepers. After three hours, the team managed to restore the tracks.“The location presented a lot of challenges. There was no road approach, and it was raining heavily continuously, and there was low visibility as it was night. Breach restoration was done by mobilising all the resources, manpower and machines to make the track fit,” added the official.The train was safely moved to Igatpuri railway station at 6.00am on Thursday. CR located disruptions at 21 spots on Thursday due to waterlogging on railway tracks, washing out of tracks, boulders falling and rivers flowing over danger levels. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) operated 133 buses between Igatpuri, Kasara and Kalyan to ferry passengers back to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/16k-mumbai-bound-train-passengers-rescued-at-kasara-101627066389135.html

Katyal, who is residing in the US, the court said, is intentionally and deliberately avoiding the process of law and is absconding.The order to separate the proceedings was passed in “larger interest of justice” as his absence is delaying proceedings against others.

Yogi said, “We cannot allow teaching and learning to get hampered due to prolonged closure of schools because of pandemic. People will never forgive us if we are not able to impart education to students in this trying situation. Ultimately, it’s the taxpayers’ money that is being used. Teachers have to find out ways and means to impart quality education.”The chief minister expressed these views while distributing appointment letters to 6,696 assistant teachers at an event held at Lok Bhavan in Lucknow.This observation by the chief minister is in contrast to the demand made by all private school associations for reopening of schools. A meeting of all the private school associations of Uttar Pradesh was held on Lucknow on Friday to address various problems related to private schools like closure of schools for almost 500 days, various discrepancies of the RTE (Right to Education) Act and the proposal of bringing private schools under RTI (Right to Information) Act.Kulbhushan Sharma, president, National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA), said that UP was a pioneer in dealing with Covid-19, but while states like Bihar, Punjab and Haryana opened their schools, it was ironic that Uttar Pradesh schools were still closed.Anil Agarwal, president, Unaided Schools Association, said discussions can solve the most complex of problems.“We want to convince the authorities about our problems and issues in a peaceful, democratic manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/explore-ways-to-teach-students-in-small-groups-amid-pandemic-yogi-to-primary-schoolteachers-101627064830716.html

Gupta’s body was hidden below a commercial elevator shaft installed in Jain’s four-storey factory building, while Goel’s body was driven in the former’s SUV to near Jagatpur flyover in Wazirabad, nearly 10 km away, where the car was abandoned.Police said the trio then boarded an auto-rickshaw and returned to their respective homes, from where they were caught in the morning.According to police, Gupta ran a chemical factory in Shahabad Dairy and his friend Goel helped him in his business. They lived with their families in Rohini Sector-3.“During the interrogation, Jain revealed that he owed ₹20 lakh to Gupta but was unable to pay it because of the losses he suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Jain alleged that Gupta had been threatening him,” said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani.A senior police officer said that Goel’s body was found in the Fortuner SUV by Constable Ajay who was patrolling the streets in north Delhi’s Wazirabad around Thursday midnight.“The constable alerted the Wazirabad police station and a police team, along with forensic experts, arrived there. They opened the sack and found the body of a man with his throat slit and other stab wounds,” said the officer, who did not want to be named.A subsequent trace of the vehicle’s registration plates led police to Gupta’s house where his family informed investigators of his disappearance.During further inquiry, the officer said, it was learnt that in their last conversation with family members around 8.30pm on Thursday, Gupta and Goel had said that they were going to Jain’s factory to demand the payment of ₹20 lakh. Subsequently, Jain was called to the Wazirabad police station.“When we questioned Jain, he told us that Gupta and Goel had come to his factory but they left around 9 pm. But we inspected his office and found some blood spots. When confronted again, he broke down and confessed to killing Gupta and Goel, along with two of his employees. Jain showed us the elevator shaft from where we recovered the sack containing Gupta’s body. His two employees were also arrested and the sickle used in the murders was recovered,” the officer added.During the interrogation, the police said, Jain revealed that Gupta and Goel first arrived at his factory around 7 pm to demand the money. Gupta reportedly threatened him and the duo left after Jain sought an hour’s time. They returned again around 8.30pm and demanded the money but Jain and his two employees allegedly attacked and killed them, police said.“The three first brought down Goel’s body using the elevator and placed it on car’s rear seat. Since, the vehicle did not have space to accommodate both bodies, the trio left Gupta’s body below the elevator shaft and drove away. They abandoned the vehicle near Jagatpuri flyover, boarded an auto and returned to their home. They had thought of disposing of Gupta’s body on Friday night, if their crime was not detected by then,” the officer added.Gupta’s brother, Ashwani Goel, said Jain is their distant relative. “Jain had purchased a consignment from my brother and owed around ₹20 lakh. My brother had gone to demand the money when Jain and his employees killed him and Goel,” said Ashwani.Gupta is survived by his wife and three children while Goel has left behind his wife and parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/businessman-partner-murdered-in-delhi-over-20-lakh-debt-101627064709500.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||EWS admissions the latest flashpoint between Delhi govt, private schools||An association of private schools in the Capital said they will not follow the state education department’s orders on granting admission to all students from economically weaker sections (EWS) in entry-level classes irrespective of entries under the general category, arguing that the order violates the Right to Education (RTE) Act and a 2013 Delhi high court order in a similar case. Government officials, however, denied any violation.Till last year, private schools admitted one EWS student from the government’s list for every three admissions under the general category in entry-level classes (nursery, KG, and class 1), as part of the 25% reservation guaranteed to EWS/disadvantaged group (DG) students in entry-level classes under the RTE Act.On July 9, the Delhi directorate of education (DoE) said that private schools will have to admit all allotted EWS children irrespective of general category entries. It added that institutes which want an exemption from this rule because of fewer general admissions will need to seek the directorate’s permission after making efforts to fill all general seats.SK Bhattacharya, president of the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools (ACURPS), told HT that the DoE order violated RTE norms.“The Right to Education Act reserves 25% seats for EWS/DG children. If a school declares 140 seats and is able to admit only 100 students under the general category, the EWS admissions should be on the basis of those 100 seats where actual admissions have taken place and not on the basis of declared seats.”In a notice sent to Yogesh Pal Singh, deputy director of education (private school branch) on Friday, Bhattacharya quoted a 2013 Delhi HC judgment on a similar matter and wrote, “[the court noted] if the school attempts to admit as many students as the infrastructure available with it permits but is able to admit fewer students from the General category, it will be required to admit one-third of the number of General category students from amongst EWS category students.”In a case filed by Sovereign Public School in the Delhi High Court in 2013, the petitioner school stated that since it was able to fill only 51 out of 140 general seats, the school should be allowed to admit 17 EWS students instead of 38 seats cited by the education department. The court had allowed the school to do as it had “made attempts” to fill the general category seats.The 2013 high court order added, “If the petitioner-school made attempts to admit 105 students from the general category but was able to admit only 51 students, it cannot be compelled to admit more than 17 students belonging to Economically Weaker Sections of the society.”The notice sent by the private school association, a copy of which is with HT, also declared that all private unaided schools make “sufficiently reasonable efforts, depending upon their financial position and other means of infrastructure at their disposal” to fill the general category seats declared by them as asked by the court.“In the facts and circumstances narrated above, you are hereby put to notice that since the schools and the DoE are bound by the judgment of Delhi high court, which does not require any permission to be taken from the DoE, for making proportionate admissions in general and EWS category, the school shall be following the law as declared by the Hon’ble high court only. Your circular being in violation of the law and therefore, being null and void and non est is not binding,” Bhattacharya wrote in the letter.Despite repeated messages and calls, Singh did not respond for comment.However, a senior official of the education department, requesting anonymity, said the department did not violate any court order or the RTE Act.“The department has allowed schools to file for an exemption if they don’t have necessary general category admissions. This is necessary because we have to ensure schools are making genuine efforts to fill their general seats as cited in the order. Our order also stated that exemptions can be made if schools make the necessary efforts to fill general category seats,” the official stated.Acting on complaints of several EWS parents, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on June 30 directed all private schools in the Capital to ensure admissions to all EWS students allotted seats in private schools regardless of general category admissions. However, due to the drop in general category admissions during the, several schools said they were finding it tough to accommodate all students.Rajbir Kaur, principal of DAV Public School in Sector 7 Rohini, said that they were allotted 40 EWS students by the department this year as per their usual 140 seats. But so far, the school has only managed to admit 40 students under the general category due to multiple reasons including mushrooming of private schools in the vicinity, migration of families, and financial constraints due to the pandemic.“Schools have been hit hard during the pandemic. If we admit more EWS students who need to be provided with free books and uniforms without sufficient general category admissions, the burden of generating resources will fall on the fee structure of general category parents who have also been demanding concessions during the Covid-19 crisis,” she said.Experts said that this would mean that the struggle for EWS students would continue in the coming days. Ekramul Haque, who runs NGO Mission Taleem, said, “Despite the government orders, EWS students are still not being admitted in private schools which still cite the same 3:1 formula. Schools are using the government’s exemption order to play around the existing norms and deprive the children of their rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ews-admissions-the-latest-flashpoint-between-delhi-govt-private-schools-101627064708962.html

Delhi so far has 300 e-buses in the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) fleet,” the senior official, who asked not to be named, said on Friday.The Delhi government plans to have 1,000 operational e-buses in the city by mid-2022, which is part of a larger plan of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to add 4,000 buses to the city’s fleet by the end next year. Delhi currently has around 7,000 buses, including the DTC and cluster bus networks, in its public bus fleet. The plan includes standard floor and low floor buses -- some of them air conditioned.“With the proposed 400 new e-buses, Delhi is also likely to become the city with the largest fleet of e-buses. Currently, Pune has 600 e-buses in its fleet,” the official cited above said.Last week, the Delhi cabinet also approved initiating the bidding process for 160 low-floor air-conditioned buses. In January, the Cabinet approved funds for 1,000 low-floor buses but the tender and bidding processes were delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, said the senior official.The plan to procure e-buses is in alignment with the government’s electric vehicle (EV) policy -- notified last August as part of a long-term action plan against pollution -- which aims to ensure at least 25% of all registered vehicles in Delhi by 2023 are electric. The central government notified a similar scheme in 2019 -- Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India [FAME] Phase-II -- which aims to generate demand for electric and hybrid vehicles.The buses are supposed to comply with BS-VI emission standards, and will be equipped with GPS, CCTV cameras and panic buttons to enhance the security of women commuters. The government has set up a control room in Kashmere Gate for the real-time tracking of its fleet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-dept-nod-to-float-tenders-for-400-ebuses-101627064648955.html
24-07-2021||Delhi||DDMA orders closure of Tilak Nagar market till Tuesday||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has directed that the market in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar be temporarily closed from Friday till at least next Tuesday for alleged violation of Covid-19 regulations.It has also ordered the revenue department to survey the market area and check for encroachment by permanent shop owners as well as unauthorised street vendors, said an order issued by the DDMA on Thursday night, a copy of which HT has seen.The DDMA, in its order, cited inputs from enforcement teams and senior revenue department officers, who visited the market and observed that Covid-19 norms were violated on at least four occasions on July 7, 10, 17 and 22.“Amid possibility for third wave of Covid-19 pandemic and considering gross violation of health protocols under Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the market.... I do hereby order closure / shutting of Tilak Nagar market, comprising of Mall Road, Main Market, Mangal Bazar Road, Old Market and Fruit Market area with effect from July 23 to July 27,” said the order signed by the concerned sub-divisional magistrate.In the last three weeks, at least 20 markets in the city have faced similar crackdowns. They include large parts of Sadar Bazar, Laxmi Nagar market, Lajpat Nagar Central Market, Gaffar Market in Karol Bagh and several local markets in areas such as Madangir, Rohini and Nangloi.A lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19 in view of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, which overburdened the city’s health care system. As cases started declining, the DDMA relaxed the lockdown norms in a phased manner from May 31. Markets were allowed to open from mid-June but subjected to strict Covid-19 regulations such as mask compliance, observing social distancing, etc.Kapil Gandhi, president of New Market welfare association, Tilak Nagar, said: “There are encroachment issues in the market. We need better coordination from the authorities instead of such a crackdown.”“In the last few weeks, several markets have faced temporary suspension. It is unfair to put the entire burden of observing Covid-19 regulations on market welfare bodies. Local agencies and authorities too have responsibilities in this regard. We will meet the chief secretary soon to discuss the issue,” said Brijesh Goyal, president of Chamber of Trade and Industry -- a collective of market and trader welfare bodies based in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-orders-closure-of-tilak-nagar-market-till-tuesday-101627064589577.html
24-07-2021||Other||Vasant Enclave residents complain of waterlogging||Residents of south Delhi’s Vasant Enclave have complained of flooding in their area every time it rains, even a little, and asked civic authorities, especially the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), to fix the drainage issue.A video shared by the local resident welfare association (RWA) shows a manhole in the middle of the lane overflowing and the sewage water inundating the houses on the ground floor.“The problem has been there for years and aggravates during monsoon. When we approach the DJB, they do send their suction machines to pump out the water. The process takes times. Sometimes, when it rains incessantly, even the staff take time to enter the area. It is a serious concern that needs a long-term solution,” said Rajeev Nayan, president of Vasant Enclave Welfare Association.Residents blame the lack of a robust sewerage system in the adjoining Basant Gaon, an urban village, for the problem.O P Nagpal (75), who has been living in Vasant Enclave since 1982, said back then, the colony used to be one of the most sought-after neighbourhoods, but over the years, the living conditions have taken a turn for the worse.“The adjoining village is at an elevation and does not have a proper stormwater drainage system. Around five to seven years ago, the residents of the village somehow connected their sewer line with that of Vasant Enclave. When it rains, all the rainwater with the muck flows into the sewer line causing the manholes to overflow,” said Nagpal.“The population of the village grew over the years with more apartments and flats coming up in the area. As their sewerage system was not being able to take the sewage load, it was connected to the Vasant Enclave drain and hence the issue,” said Nagpal.Around two years ago, a separate sewer line for the village was planned and a few pipes had also been laid. However, the villagers opposed it and the work had to be stopped midway, he said.The RWA has sent a string of letters to the DJB requesting them to delink the sewer line from that of the village.In reference to a letter from the Vasant Enclave RWA, a senior DJB official said both Vasant Enclave and Basant Gaon are adjacent to each other and that the village is at a higher elevation. “There is no storm water drain in Basant Gaon, which is connected to Vasant Enclave’s sewerage system. During monsoon, rainwater running downstream accumulates in the low-lying areas of Vasant Enclave. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation has been requested to lay storm water drains to sort out the problem,” said the official adding that the DJB is going to replace the sewer line after monsoon.Manish Aggarwal, a BJP councillor from Vasant Vihar, said the drainage issue is a long-standing problem. “It is not possible to construct storm water drains along the sewer lines as the lanes in the village are too narrow. We have requested the DJB only to find a solution,” said Aggarwal.However, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from the area Pramila Tokas said two and a half years ago, she had got the work orders for laying a separate sewer line for the village and work had even started at the site. “Almost 25% work was done when a group of residents opposed the work and did not let it take off. It has been stuck since then. We have been planning to revive the project soon after monsoon,” said Tokas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vasant-enclave-residents-complain-of-waterlogging-101627064588970.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder by his side, Sidhu takes charge as Punjab Cong president||Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday took over as president of the Punjab Congress in the presence of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who said they will work together for the welfare of Punjab as the party sought to present a united front after months of infighting and ahead of the run-up to the assembly elections early next year.A day after he appeared to soften his stance towards Sidhu by deciding to attend the taking-over ceremony of the new Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee team, Singh struck all the right notes in his address to party workers, saying “It is your responsibility to support the party president.”After the Congress elevated Sidhu as the head of the party’s state unit, overruling the chief minister’s objections, yet maintaining that it would fight the 2022 elections under Singh’s leadership, a reconciliation was always on the cards -- although Singh’s aides said that this could happen only if Sidhu apologised for some of his very public statements against the chief minister. It wasn’t immediately clear whether an apology had been proffered.It also remains to be seen if the rapprochement survives a Congress victory in 2022, given that Sidhu has never disguised his ambitions. Still, it was all good cheer and bonhomie on Friday.Ahead of the ceremony, the two bonded over breakfast at Punjab Bhawan in Chandigarh.Tensions between Singh, 79, and Sidhu, 57, who quit the state cabinet in 2019, have simmered since that year but flared up in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book. That was under the Shiromani Akali Dal government headed by the Badals, and Singh was accused by some in the Congress as being soft on them.Sidhu quickly rallied support as leaders opposed to Singh coalesced around him and raised other issues as well -- the failure of the government to keep its 2017 election promises, and the dependence of Singh on some powerful bureaucrats. The Congress’ central leadership set up a three-member committee. The panel met around 150 functionaries – it also met Singh twice -- and submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on June 10. It rapidly became clear that Sidhu had the support of both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, both of who, it is believed, see him as the future of the party in the state.Sidhu was a BJP lawmaker who quit and almost joined the Aam Aadmi Party before signing up with the Congress in 2017.After taking charge at the state Congress headquarters, he said there was no difference between an ordinary worker of the party and its state unit chief. “Every Congress worker in Punjab has become the chief of the party’s state unit from today,” the Amritsar East MLA said.The cricketer-turned-politician said he would back the farmers protesting against the three farm laws. “I want to tell Punjab farmers that the biggest mission of my presidency is that the power of the government helps them and improves their lives. We shall make a difference, we have to make a difference. I want to tell farmers that their agitation is pious.”“Those oppositions, who speculated a rift in our party, look at us today, we are together and united,” he added.Sidhu also raised the Sacrilege issue, saying “CM Saab we have to resolve the (sacrilege) issue, then, we will be called true Sikhs… As President I resolve to take all these cases to a conclusion,” he announced to cheers from the partymen who were present in large numbers.In his address, Singh went down memory lane and recalled his old Patiala ties with Sidhu, saying: “I was commissioned in the army, the year Sidhu was born. When my mother asked me to enter politics, his (Sidhu’s) father helped me. I used to go to his house when he was about six years old.”“We will move together in politics. We have to think of Punjab’s welfare. When Sonia Gandhi told me that the party wants to make Sidhu as state unit chief, even then I had told the media that whatever decision Soniaji will take, will be acceptable to us.” the CM said.The chief minister took the opportunity to highlight his government’s achievements. “The state emerged number one in the fight against Covid and was rated first in primary education besides making the biggest contribution to the country’s food bowl,” he said.In his address, outgoing state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar referred to some of the issues and said: “We were hit by red tapism in our government. Our workers suffered due to that, but we still have time. We can course correct it even now.”Looking at All India Congress Committee general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, Jakhar said: “Rawat ji please tell Sonia ji that the revival of the Congress goes through Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-by-his-side-sidhu-takes-charge-as-punjab-cong-president-101627063809529.html
24-07-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh chief minister distributes appointment letters to 6,696 assistant teachers||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday distributed appointment letters to 6,696 assistant teachers recruited in the government schools against vacant posts of 69,000 assistant teachers, thereby completing their much-awaited recruitment process. “The appointment of new teachers will help in imparting quality education to students,” he said at the event held at Lok Bhavan in Lucknow. While congratulating the newly appointed assistant teachers, Yogi said the government and basic education department had completed the recruitment process with sincerity and fairness.Sending across a note of warning to all those who tend to vitiate the transparent recruitment process, the chief minister said the government had already vacated jails for all such unscrupulous elements.Targeting the previous governments in the state, the CM said, “The performance of basic schools of Uttar Pradesh is very high on the national standards of grading but some people do not like it. Before 2017, the buildings were in a dilapidated condition and if there were buildings, those were without teachers.”“Furthermore, if there were teachers, students were missing. The students did not have uniforms and children used to go to school barefoot. The whole department was just engaged in transfers and postings. Now when the process is transparent and the condition of government schools has improved to a large extent due to ‘Operation Kayakalp’, they are not liking it. The Opposition can’t digest the fact that the children of the poor are going to schools and getting quality education,” he added.“I am happy to inform you that our government has completed 52 months of its tenure. During this period, our government has given government jobs to more than 4.5 lakh youths in Uttar Pradesh. And no one can raise any questions on a single job. The recruitment process has been done in a transparent manner, with sincerity and complete integrity,” the CM said.Speaking on the occasion, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said the standard of government schools had been raised by the incumbent government. “Studying in a government school is no more ‘sarcasm’. Rather, the schools now have good buildings, good arrangements, cheap books for which the credit goes to the Yogi government. There has been a vast change in the education system,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-cm-distributes-appointment-letters-to-6-696-assistant-teachers-101627063330698.html
24-07-2021||Lucknow||BSP plays Ram temple card at Brahmin conference in Ayodhya, targets BJP||The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Friday played the Ram temple card to woo voters for the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. The elections are due early next year. Launching the statewide Brahmin conference in Ayodhya on Friday, BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said the saffron brigade had been raising funds for the construction of the Ram temple for the last 20 years. After the Supreme Court verdict of November 9, 2019, the foundation stone of the temple was laid in August last year. “Again, a countrywide donation drive was launched by various outfits run by the ruling BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). A year has passed, but there is no sign of the construction of the Ram temple,” he alleged. When the BSP formed a majority government in Uttar Pradesh in 2007, it constructed grand Dalit memorials within one-a-and-a-half years at various spots in the state, he said. After it forms the government in 2022, the BSP will force the organisations that have raised large funds for the Ram temple to expedite the construction works, he added. “The BSP government will ensure the outfits complete the construction of the Ram temple soon,” he said. Mishra alleged that the BJP was doing politics over the Ram temple. He said the BJP government came to power at the Centre in 2014 and in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, but Ram Lalla (child Ram) remained in a makeshift temple. While the process for the construction of the Ram temple started after the Supreme Court verdict, the deity remained in a makeshift temple, he said. [On March 25 last year, the deity Ram Lalla was relocated after 27 years from the makeshift temple to a pre-fabricated one within the Ram Janmabhoomi premises. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had attended the ceremony that took place on the first day of the nine-day Navratri festival]. The BJP made political gains from the Ram temple issue but was seeking donations for the construction of the shrine whereas the government spent large funds on the construction of statues in Gujarat, Mishra said. “The BJP has sidelined the local mahants, sadhus and priests (in Ayodhya) who have been associated with the Ram temple movement. The BJP should give details of the funds collected for the Ram temple, make public the details of the design and the architecture of the temple,” he said. He alleged that there was no transparency in the construction works. “The BJP has been exposed over the construction of the Ram temple,” Mishra said. He alleged that the BJP had deliberately slowed down the construction of the Ram temple to serve its political interests. Calling for people of all communities to support the BSP in the 2022 assembly elections, he said the BSP government will pave the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple soon. “The BJP should know that people of all castes and communities have faith in Ram Lalla,” he said. Mishra said the BSP will organise Brahmin conferences at “holy places” including Mathura, Vrindavan, Varanasi, Chitrakoot and Shravasti till October 15. The party will organise a massive Brahmin conference in Lucknow, he added. Mishra called upon the Brahmin community to support the BSP in the coming assembly election. The BSP formed a majority government in 2007 with the support of Brahmins and the BSP government, in turn, gave important positions to Brahmins in the government and the party organisation, he said. Brahmins who constitute 13% of the state’s population and Dalits who make up 23% of the population will ensure the formation of a majority BSP government again, he said. Alleging that Brahmins had been sidelined under the BJP government, Mishra alleged that “atrocities” on the community had increased. He recounted incidents of attacks on Brahmins in various districts of the state. He termed Khushi Dubey, wife of Amar Dubey, as a symbol of the BJP government’s alleged atrocities on the Brahmin community. Amar Dubey, an associate of Bikru ambush case prime accused Vikas Dubey, was killed in a police encounter in July last year. Eight policemen were killed in an ambush during a raid on Vikas Dubey’s house at Bikru village in Kanpur on July 2-3 night last year. A few days later, Vikas Dubey was also killed in a police encounter. Mishra said the BSP did not support attacks on policemen, but it would oppose the incarceration of a Brahmin woman for no fault of hers. “Khushi is forced to stay in a two-room shelter home with 48 girls,” he said. Khushi Dubey is lodged in a Barabanki shelter home since July 8 last year. Her family members alleged that she was not involved in the attack on the police personnel, yet the state government had put her behind bars. The BJP’s Brahmin leaders were forced by the state government to give statements against Khushi and other Brahmin victims, Mishra alleged. “The time has come for the Brahmins to mull over their dignity, security and progress. They should support the BSP for a share in power,” he said. Reacting to the BSP’s allegations, Bhartiya Janata Party state unit spokesperson Sameer Singh said, “The Bahujan Samaj Party has been promoting the politics of caste in Uttar Pradesh. The party has nothing to do with the dignity of the Hindu community or the development of Hindu holy places. The Ram temple is a symbol of faith and pride of the Hindu community. The BJP government is committed to the construction of grand temple and the construction of the temple is continuing in full swing. Chief minister Yogi Adityanth has launched several projects for the development of Ayodhya and other Hindu religious spots in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-plays-ram-temple-card-at-brahmin-conference-in-ayodhya-101627062129392.html

The centre comes at a time when Covid-19 vaccine inoculation is being undertaken on a war footing across the country. At the inauguration, Tope said that the centre will help reduce wastage and contamination of the vaccines, not only Covid-19, but also those used in routine immunisation. Tope said, “We have the capacity to inoculate 1.5 million people daily and a minimum of one million at least, on a daily basis, however, we get only three- to three-and-a-half lakh doses on a daily basis. We are expecting to get more doses soon. However, without enough vaccine doses we cannot vaccinate more people.” Tope added, “With such a centre in place, Pune has once again proved that it is steering the fight against Covid-19. The facility will help avoid health-related accidents like the Nashik oxygen leak which have to be avoided as it deals with life and death.” The National Cold Chain Research Centre (NCCRC), was established in 1982, but functioned in Pune as division centre and was later, in 2013, declared an autonomous institute under the state government by the Maharashtra public health department. In 2016, it was declared a national centre by the state government, following additional works. The 10-storied building is located near Naidu hospital on the Raja Bahadur mill road and has residential and research facilities. The centre will be involved in creating sessions to train cold-chain officials and experts not just from different states, but also from other Asian countries. The centre will also provide training with regards to equipment used in paediatric units like neonatal ICUs and will also draft manuals, SOPs and other educational content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-has-capacity-to-vax-1-million-a-day-but-not-enough-doses-available-tope-101627047607413.html
24-07-2021||Chandigarh||Kangana seeks memorial for Himachal’s apple pioneer Stokes||Actor Kangana Ranaut has urged the Himachal Pradesh government to build a memorial dedicated to Samuel Evan Stokes, later known as Satyanand Stokes, the American missionary who pioneered apple-growing in the state. Today, Himachal Pradesh’s fruit economy is pegged at ₹6,000 crore. But it all started with Stokes introducing viable apple cultivation at Barubagh in Kotgarh in 1916. The Delicious variety of apples are now grown in parts of Kullu, Shimla, Mandi, Sirmaur, Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti and Chamba districts. Also read: Future of country depends on what ideas students have, says Himachal governor“Stokes was not an Indian, but he fought for the country’s freedom and faced sedition charges from the British government. He was from a wealthy American Quaker family, he learnt Sanskrit, became a Hindu, set up a school and introduced apples to Himachal Pradesh,” Kangana, who is from the state, posted on her Instagram account. “Most Himachali farmers now earn from apple orchards but not many know about Stokes. I request chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to name one major landmark after Shri Samuel Stokes. We do this favour on ourselves as he followed Hinduism all his life and pitra puja (gratitude for ancestors) is of supreme importance in our culture and we must pay our respects to this being whose actions, hard work and foresight are giving employment to lakhs of people till today.” From leprosy mission to growing apples Stokes had arrived in Shimla in 1904 to join a leprosy mission. In 1905, when an earthquake ravaged Kangra and killed more than 20,000 people, he walked from village to village, helping the affected. In 1912, he visited Kotgarh and settled down there, marrying a local Christian girl, Agnes. Later, he entered Arya Samaj and changed his name to Satyanand. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, he joined the Congress and fought for India’s independence. Stokes wasn’t the first to introduce apple to the state, but it was his contribution that went a long way in transforming the apple economy. Captain RC Scot of the British army was the first to bring the fruit to the Kullu valley in 1870, but his variety was not viable economically. Stokes’ red, delicious variety was from Louisiana in the US. He made his apple orchard in 1919 on his Thanedhar estate and taught the techniques to locals. Apple transforming HP’s economy Apple is the most important fruit crop of Himachal Pradesh, which constitutes about 49% of the total area under fruit crops and about 79% of the total fruit production. The area under apple has increased from 400 hectares in 1950-61 and 1,12,634 hectares in 2017-18. The area under temperate fruits other than apple has increased from 900 hectares in 1960-61 to 28,369 hectares in 2017-18. The apple economy alone is pegged at ₹2,900 crore. As many as 450 cultivars (plants propagated through stem cuttings, not via seeds) of apple collected from all over the world, a majority from the United States, Italy, China and New Zealand are grown in seven districts of the state, namely Shimla, Kullu, Sirmaur, Chamba, Mandi, Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kangana-seeks-memorial-for-himachal-s-apple-pioneer-stokes-101627039330464.html

Dozens of trains in the region were delayed for up to 40 hours.Li Yongsheng was found Friday afternoon in a garage under the Jincheng International Plaza in Zhengzhou's Jinshui District, The Paper said. It said he was trapped when the garage flooded Tuesday and lay on a ventilation duct surrounded by floating cars.A photo on The Paper's website showed Li being guided by rescue workers through chest-deep water. It said he was hospitalized with a crush injury.On Saturday, skies were mostly clear but parts of Zhengzhou and other cities including Hebi, Xinxiang and Anyang still were under water.In Hebi, rescuers were moving people out of neighborhoods where water was up to two meters (six feet) deep, The Paper said.

We have made our best case and they have given their best assurance,” said the Foreign Secretary.Indian High Commissioner to the UK Gaitri Issar Kumar said that the Indian mission in London has been keeping the pressure on over the issue.“In the High Commission, the assessment is that the extradition has been decided, the only thing is this remaining legal process which they are duty bound to do because it is a judicial process,” she said.Meanwhile, Mallya’s bankruptcy case will return to the High Court in London on Monday, where a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) are pursuing a bankruptcy order against the 65-year-old businessman to recoup unpaid loans.Before he leaves for New Delhi on Saturday evening, the Foreign Secretary also confirmed that the first UK-India Consular Dialogue is scheduled for September, when a whole range of consular issues including easier student visa processes are to be discussed.“The first Consular Dialogue between the UK and India will take place in September. There are a number of consular issues, which is bound to be when there is so much people to people connect,” said Shringla.“I reminded them about a quick decision on the extradition of economic offenders such as Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi. I also pointed out that criminals like Jayesh Patel were in custody and he needs to be deported to India as soon as possible. He is here on fake identity documents, there is need for him to face justice back in India,” he said.While Nirav Modi is seeking permission to appeal against his extradition in the High Court in London, Jayesh Patel – wanted in India for murder and around 50 criminal offences – is fighting his extradition at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London since his arrest earlier this year.Among a range of consular and migration issues that came up during the Foreign Secretary’s UK visit, he also received an update on the Migration and Mobility Partnership (MMP), which had been signed between UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in May.“It was an important landmark decision by the two sides. The Joint Working Group that will get into the nitty-gritty and operational details of this partnership and how to operationalise it, will be meeting in August,” he said, adding that the MMP would lead greater two-way exchange of students and professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vijay-mallya-extradition-shringla-says-uk-govt-gave-best-assurance-101627146348544.html

About half of the US population is now fully vaccinated against Covid-19 but vaccine hesitancy has been a major impediment in the Biden administration’s goal to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.Over the past week, the daily average fatalities due to Covid-19 has surged 48% to 239 while hospitalisations are also on the rise. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that the Delta variant now accounts for 83% of all sequenced Covid-19 cases in the country, a sharp rise from 50% at the beginning of July. With the Delta variant rapidly spreading across the country, public health experts are urging the US CDC to recommend face masks even for fully vaccinated people.CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said the decisions on mask mandates could vary locally depending on vaccination rates and surge in Covid-19 cases. She acknowledged that the United States is “at another pivotal moment in this pandemic” as the country is witnessing a resurgence of the virus. However, the agency has not given any indication of bringing back federal guidelines on face masks for fully vaccinated individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-is-no-joke-biden-s-desperate-request-as-us-sees-another-covid-surge-101627146647077.html

According to the provincial meteorological department, In-Fa is currently located about 395 km southeast of Xiangshan County in Zhejiang, with a maximum wind force of 144 km per hour.The typhoon is expected to make landfall in the eastern or northeastern coastal areas of Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai, between the afternoon and night on Sunday. The storm had sustained winds of 155 kph (95 mph) with gusts up to 191 kph (120 mph) as it moved northwest away from Taiwan, the meteorological department said. Chinese authorities have issued a level III alert, the third-highest, for the typhoon.Also Read: Was awaiting death: Survivors share details of being stuck on China subway floodThe airport in the provincial capital of Hangzhou, southwest of Shanghai, cancelled 90% of flights on Sunday and was expected to cancel more on Monday, the newspaper Zhejiang Daily reported on its website. Large container ships were evacuated from Yangshan Port in Shanghai, fearing strong winds would reach 89 to 102 kph. Train service in parts of the Yangtze River Delta region around Shanghai will also be suspended from Saturday to Thursday, Xinhua said.

During its extended 44th session held online, the World Heritage Committee selected the cultural sites in Saudi Arabia, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK for World Heritage List, days after removing Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City from it.The inscription of sites on the World Heritage is scheduled to continue through 28 July. Dholavira, an archaeological site in Gujarat which represents the ruins of an ancient city of the Harappan civilization, and the Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways in Telangana will also be examined for inscription on Unesco’s list.Here are the five newly inscribed sites on World Heritage List:Ḥimā Cultural Area, Saudi ArabiaIt contains a substantial collection of rock art images depicting hunting, fauna, flora and lifestyles in a cultural continuity of 7,000 years. For centuries, travellers and armies have left rock inscriptions on the site, most of which are preserved in pristine condition, said Unesco. It is located at the oldest known toll station on an important ancient desert caravan route where centuries-old wells still produce fresh water.The Great Spa Towns of EuropeThis transnational site comprises 11 towns located in seven European countries: Baden bei Wien (Austria); Spa (Belgium); Františkovy Lázně (Czechia); Karlovy Vary (Czechia); Mariánské Lázně (Czechia); Vichy (France); Bad Ems (Germany); Baden-Baden (Germany); Bad Kissingen (Germany); Montecatini Terme (Italy); and City of Bath (UK). These towns, developed around natural mineral water springs, bear witness to the international European spa culture.“Together, these sites embody the significant interchange of human values and developments in medicine, science and balneology,” said Unesco.Also Read | These sites make the most of their Unesco World Heritage tagCordouan Lighthouse, FranceThis active lighthouse located near the mouth of the Gironde estuary in the Atlantic Ocean was built in white limestone dressed blocks at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries and was remodelled in the late 18th century. Calling it a masterpiece of maritime signalling, Unesco said that the monumental tower embodies the great stages of the architectural and technological history of lighthouses.Mathildenhöhe Darmstadt, GermanyThe neighbourhood in west-central Germany was established in 1897 as a centre for emerging reform movements in architecture, arts and crafts. The buildings were created by its artist members as experimental early modernist living and working environments and were expanded during successive international exhibitions in 1901, 1904, 1908 and 1914, according to Unesco.“Today, it offers a testimony to early modern architecture, urban planning and landscape design, all of which were influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and the Vienna Secession,” the UN agency said.Padua’s fourteenth-century fresco cycles, ItalyThe site, composed of eight religious and secular building complexes, houses a selection of fresco cycles painted between 1302 and 1397. While the fresco cycles were painted by different artists for different types of patrons, they maintain a unity of style and content.“As a group, these fresco cycles illustrate how, over the course of a century, fresco art developed along a new creative impetus and understanding of spatial representation,” said Unesco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-sites-in-saudi-arabia-europe-inscribed-on-unesco-s-world-heritage-list-101627142186418.html

Emirates said in a statement that any passenger who has been to these four Asian countries in the last 14 days will not be allowed to travel from anywhere to the UAE."UAE Nationals, holders of UAE Golden Visas and members of diplomatic missions who comply with updated COVID‑19 protocols, are exempt and may be accepted for travel," the Dubai-based airline said.Earlier this week, the UAE extended the ban on international flights from the four countries amid concerns over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority had suspended inbound flights from India to Dubai on April 24 in the wake of the deadly second wave of Covid-19."If your flight has been cancelled or impacted by route suspensions due to COVID‑19 restrictions, you don’t need to call us immediately for rebooking. You can simply hold on to your Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with us or your booking office to make new travel plans," said Emirates.The highest number of expatriates in the UAE are from India, followed by Pakistan and Bangladesh, making the aviation industry of the Gulf nation heavily dependent on visitors from these Asian countries. But the spread of deadly variants of concern prompted the UAE to suspend international flights as a precautionary measure. While the number of Covid-19 cases in India has declined in recent days, authorities around the world are still concerned about the spread of the Delta variant that could jeopardise the pandemic response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emirates-extends-flight-suspension-to-uae-from-india-pak-two-other-countries-101627137139982.html

"To curb violence and limit the Taliban movements a night curfew has been imposed in 31 provinces across the country," the interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The curfew will be effective between 10pm and 4am local time, and will not be imposed in Kabul, Panjshir, and Nangarhar, Ahmad Zia Zia, deputy interior ministry spokesman told reporters.With the withdrawal of US troops, Talibans have re-emerged as a resurgent force in Afghanistan. The militant group now claims to control half of the 400 provinces in the country, a claim that is yet to be verified.

The report also said that the group has now strengthened its positions ‘in and around’ Kabul from where it conducts attacks against minorities, activists, government employees and personnel of the Afghan National Defence and security personnel.'Afghanistan situation dangerous': Indian embassy in advisory for its nationalsThe report points out that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan has moved into other provinces and have formed sleeper cells in Nuristan, Badghis, Sari Pul, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Kabul. The sleeper cells were formed despite territorial, leadership, manpower and financial losses during 2020 in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces.Afghan mission will end on August 31: Joe BidenThe report highlighted that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) prioritised efforts to resurge and started recruiting and training new supporters. “Its leaders also hope to attract intransigent Taliban and other militants who reject the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States of America and the Taliban and to recruit fighters from the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and other conflict zones,” it said.US pledges $100 million in emergency aid for Afghan refugeesEstimates of the strength of ISIL-K range widely as one member state reported 500-1,500 fighters while another unit said it could rise to as many as 10,000 over the medium term. Another member state of the UN said that ISIL-K continues to be ‘underground and clandestine’. The report said Shahab al-Muhajir cooperates with Sheikh Tamim, who heads the al-Sadiq office. Tamim’s office is tasked with building networks to connect ISIL-K with ISIL presences in the wider region.Threat from the Al-QaedaAl-Qaeda continues to maintain its presence in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the eastern, southern and south-eastern regions, according to the Monitoring Team as reported in the 12th report to the Security Council Committee in June. The AQIS or Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent continues to operate under Taliban protection in Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces in Afghanistan. The report said that the AQIS is now led by Osama Mahmood, who is still unlisted. The AQIS consists of Afghan and Pakistani nationals but Indians, Bangladeshis and Myanmarese have also joined its ranks.Taliban offers peace deal, in exchange asks for Afghan President to be removedIt also said that Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s status remains unknown and he is suspected to be ‘alive but ailing’ in Afghanistan. The Al-Qaeda earlier this year tried to showcase al-Zawahiri in a video where he is seen threatening Myanmar but member states believe that dated footage was used which further adds to the ‘rumours of his decline or demise’. The report suggests that Al-Qaeda has suffered even more severe leadership attrition.The member states reported that Zawahiri’s successor could be Mohammed Salahaldin Abd El Halim Zidane aka Sayf-Al Adl. Al Adl is currently located in Iran, according to the report.As Taliban advances, Afghan military overhauls war strategy to limit losses“Sayf- Al Adl, his most likely successor, is reported to remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Member States differ as to what Al Adl’s options would be if he was called upon to succeed al-Zawahiri, but most assess that he would have to move and that basing himself in Afghanistan might not be an option,” the report said.Nearly 500,000 killed in a decade of Syria war: ReportSince the Taliban is committed to suppressing any international terrorist threat due to the agreements in the peace deal, the leadership succession process within Al-Qaeda remains complicated. Some member states cast doubt that Al Adl may not be travelling to Afghanistan to assume his role but might choose to base himself in Africa. The report highlighted that the ISIL and Al-Qaeda affiliates still continue to operate in central, south and southeast Asia notwithstanding key leadership losses in some cases and sustained pressure from security forces.Taliban tightens grip over Afghanistan; levies high taxes, recruits forcefullyPakistan’s Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) also is rising as a threat in the region and has led to a rise in cross-border attacks after the unification of splinter groups.

24-07-2021||World||US makes it harder for Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson to be called astronaut||When billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson went to space in their private suborbital flights earlier this month, the space tourists were called commercial astronauts by many. But the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has tightened its definition of the word “astronaut”, making it harder for people like Bezos and Branson to be called commercial astronauts.The FAA is the only US agency that awards astronaut wings to passengers on a commercial spacecraft since the Nasa and US military recognises only their employees as astronauts. On Tuesday, the agency published updated guidelines, eligibility, and criteria for the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program.According to the updated eligibility requirements, space explorers must go through the required training to be certified as an astronaut and fly beyond 80 kilometres above the Earth surface as a flight crew on a permitted launch or reentry vehicle. They also must have “demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety.”The updated guidelines were published the same day Amazon CEO along with three other crew members blasted off his Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo and touched down after about 10 minutes of flight. New Shepard was a fully autonomous spacecraft and didn’t have any Blue Origin staff onboard during its maiden human spaceflight.Watch: Jeff Bezos floats in space shuttle, passes Skittles in zero gravity | Blue OriginSince the flight was completely computer-controlled from Earth, Jeff Bezos and other space tourists didn’t contribute to human space flight safety during the flight. This means the four New Shepard passengers wouldn’t qualify for astronaut wings under the new FAA rules. While Branson and other passengers on SpaceShipTwo were designated by Virgin Galactic as crew members testing the spacecraft, it’s not clear whether they “contributed to human space flight safety.”However, founders of Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic could still be awarded honorary astronauts wings if the FAA believes their contribution to commercial human spaceflight “merits special recognition.” The associate administrator for Commercial Space Transportation (AST-1) has complete discretion in bestowing honorary wings for demonstrating “extraordinary contribution or beneficial service to the commercial human space flight industry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-makes-it-harder-for-jeff-bezos-richard-branson-to-be-called-astronaut-101627130334868.html

This technology is rooted in the protection of human rights – including the right to life, security and bodily integrity – and that’s why we have sought alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to make sure our products are respecting all fundamental human rights," it said which is a stand its executives still maintain.Without confirming, or denying, if the software was sold to India, the company had said that its "products are licensed to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime"."To protect the ongoing public safety missions of its agency customers and given significant legal and contractual constraints, NSO Group is not able to disclose who is or is not a client or discuss specific uses of its technology," the written statement had said.Amidst the latest controversy, Israel has established a committee to review the allegations of misuse of the NSO group's surveillance software and hinted at a possible "review of the whole matter of giving licences".“The defence establishment appointed a review committee made up of a number of bodies," lawmaker Ram Ben-Barak, the head of Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told Army Radio on Thursday.“When they finish their review, we’ll demand to see the results and assess whether we need to make corrections," Ben-Barak, who earlier was the former deputy head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, added. Israel’s priority was “to review this whole matter of giving licenses”, he stressed.NSO''s chief executive, Shalev Hulio, welcomed the move, telling Army Radio that he would “be very pleased if there were an investigation so that we’d be able to clear our name”.Hulio claimed that there was an effort “to smear the whole Israeli cyber industry".Ben-Barak noted that Pegasus had helped “expose many terror cells”, but “if it was misused or sold to irresponsible bodies, this is something we need to check".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nso-says-pegasus-helps-millions-to-sleep-well-at-night-walk-safely-on-streets-101627129375628.html

The participants were grouped on the basis of age groups and their blood serum, contained in test tubes, was exposed to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as to the P.1 variant, which is also called gamma, and was first found in Brazil.The study found that the youngest group (all participants in their 20s) had a nearly seven-fold in antibody response as compared to that in the oldest group (participants between 70 and 82 years of age), prompting the team to conclude that "the younger a participant, the more robust the antibody response."However, Tafesse and the team also stressed that despite the study, Covid-19 vaccines still appear effective enough to prevent infection and severe illnes among people across almost all age groups. "The good news is that our vaccines are really strong," he said.Tafesse further remarked that the research, in fact, highlights the need for everyone to get vaccinated against Covid-19. "Older people aren't entirely safe just because they are vaccinated. The people around them really need to be vaccinated as well," he concluded.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/older-people-have-fewer-antibodies-against-covid-19-study-101627126627871.html
24-07-2021||World||Pak Army deployed at Afghan border to stop conflict from spilling into Pakistan||Pakistan deployed its army personnel at forward positions along the Afghanistan border as Taliban forces continue to capture almost two-thirds of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and NATO troops, according to a report by Dawn.Pakistan minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that Pakistan soldiers have now replaced the Frontier Constabulary (FC), Levies Force and other militias from the frontline positions. US President Joe Biden earlier in June said that the United States will withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan by August 31 this year - a decade after it began a war in Afghanistan in retaliation to the 9/11 attacks.“Regular army troops are manning the border after replacing the paramilitary forces,” Ahmed was quoted as saying by Dawn. He said the decision was taken owing to the volatile situation across the border. He further added that the decision was taken to contain the influx of refugees, armed army personnel and militants from Afghanistan into Pakistan.“Paramilitary troops including the Frontier Constabulary, Levies, Rangers are deployed at the borders to deal with regular issues including illegal border crossing, smuggling. However, the current volatile situation (in Afghanistan) demands that regular military troops be deployed along the border,” Ahmed further added. Pakistan army spokesperson major general Babar Iftikhar said that the move to replace the paramilitary forces will help in preventing the conflict from spilling into Pakistan.People familiar with the developments told Dawn that Pakistan Army faces the challenge of not only stopping the inflow of refugees but also the inflow of Afghan army personnel as well as Taliban fighters. They also said that Pakistan fears that the conflict could spill over to the mainland if Taliban forces enter Pakistan following Afghan army troops due to the strong Taliban presence in areas bordering Pakistan. More than 1,000 Afghan army personnel fled to Tajikistan in July to escape clashes with the Taliban.Pakistan and Afghanistan governments are already at loggerheads after the Taliban took control of Spin Boldak border crossing. The Afghanistan Air Force also wanted to attack Taliban positions from the Pakistani side of the border. The proposal was met with disapproval from Islamabad.“Pakistan does not want to see any such situation when the Afghan air force might use our airspace without permission to attack Taliban and in retaliation the militants attack Pakistani positions creating a new issue,” experts told Dawn. The Pakistan government refrained from commenting on the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan and said that the conflict was an internal matter of Afghanistan and it has taken no sides.“It is time that the Afghan politicians and their military leadership learn to deal with their issues. We do not want to see that Pakistani soil is used in any way or by any side in the Afghan conflict, and we have assured the Afghan leadership of this policy,” Ahmed further added. Pakistan also said that it will not welcome any more refugees from Afghanistan.There are two key border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Chaman in Balochistan and Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa - along with several other small trading points.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-deployed-at-afghan-border-to-stop-conflict-from-spilling-into-pakistan-101627121706677.html

In Sydney, protesters were seen uprooting plants and picking bottles from the sidewalks and hurling them at the police, reported Bloomberg. Another crowd was captured on video, chanting “freedom freedom” and marching in the city’s central business district.David Elliott, police and emergency services minister for New South Wales, criticised the protesters, telling reporters that “these are the sort of people who are going to prolong this lockdown”. About 50 people have been arrested so far in Sydney. Rallies also took place in other cities like Melbourne. The actual number of protesters is not yet known but Elliot indicated around 3,500 people participated in the mass protests. “What we saw today were 3,500 very selfish boofheads,” he said.The protest organisers had dubbed the protest a "freedom" rally and publicised it on social media pages associated with vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories, reported AFP. Resentment has been growing amongst the masses over the Scott Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic. Most of the protestors were seen walking maskless and were carrying signboards with slogans like "Wake up Australia" and "Drain the Swamp".Millions of Australians have been put under lockdown as a combination of the Delta variant and slow vaccine rollouts have been leading to a rise in the number of cases. Australia has administered enough doses for just 21% of its population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.The country’s vaccination drive has slowed down further after a new advisory recommending the AstraZeneca jab only for those aged 60 and above was released last month. However, faced with mounting rates of infection and supply constraints of the Pfizer shot, the government’s technical advisory group has asked adults in the Sydney area to consider the AstraZeneca shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antilockdown-protesters-hold-freedom-rallies-in-australia-pelt-cops-with-plants-and-bottles-101627122092847.html

I have nothing to add for the moment.”“The visit of high-ranking Pakistani officials holds significance after a tragic incident in Upper Kohistan. Nine Chinese nationals working on the Dasu hydropower project were killed when a bus transporting them to the construction site met with an accident,” Pakistan’s Geo News said in a report on Friday.Islamabad has blamed hostile forces behind the bus explosion, which according to them, was carried out to create misunderstandings between Pakistan and China, the Geo News report claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remains-of-9-chinese-nationals-killed-in-pak-bus-explosion-returned-to-china-101627106413360.html

"The press reports of 18th July 2021 also appear to be an attempt to malign the Indian democracy and its well-established institutions," Vaishnaw said in Parliament.India, the minister said, has an "established protocol when it comes to surveillance... any form of illegal surveillance is not possible with the checks and balances in our laws and our robust institutions."Minister of state for external affairs Meenakshi Lekhi on Thursday said that the story on the alleged snooping through Israeli spyware Pegasus is "concocted, fabricated and evidence-less" and that the news reports based on it call for "defamation".When asked about the Pegasus snooping case in India, Thompson said:"We – I don't have any particular special insights into the India case.""I know this is a broader issue, but I will say that we've been, I think, quite vocal about trying to find ways for companies to be able to ensure that their technology is not used in these types of ways. And we will certainly continue to press those issues," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spy-technology-against-society-journalists-always-concerning-us-on-pegasus-101627103278443.html

They're aware of the duck, hold and cover when there's an earthquake.""We're checking low-lying areas in case there's a tsunami," he added.The Philippine seismological agency said it did not expect damage. And there was no tsunami warning or threat, according to the US Tsunami Warning System."It's not as strong compared to the previous quakes here -- there's no damage reported to us," said police Corporal Bernie Faderogao in nearby Mabini."Our sliding door was just slightly shaken but it didn't break."The archipelago is regularly rocked by quakes due to its location on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/magnitude-6-7-earthquake-rocks-philippines-no-tsunami-threat-101627086676449.html

24-07-2021||World||Do not set new global climate benchmarks, says Yadav at G20 meet||Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the world “should not be shifting goalposts and setting new benchmarks for global climate ambition” at the G20 Energy and Climate joint ministerial on Friday, referring to diplomatic pressure to announce a net zero emissions target by mid-century.In a session on ‘Paris Aligned Financial Flow’ at the ongoing G20 summit, India made an intervention stating that “the momentum of climate action can only be accelerated when there is enough support through means of implementation including finance and technology.” “We should not be shifting goalposts and setting new benchmarks for global climate ambition,” Yadav said at the summit according to a statement issued by the environment ministry on Friday.The United Nations is pushing for a global coalition committed to net zero emissions by 2050 which will cover all countries, Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary General had said in April ahead of Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate convened by the US.He also called on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to phase out coal by 2030, and 2040 elsewhere.Prime Minister, Narendra Modi announced the launch of India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 at the Leaders Summit on Climate. While not making any changes or upgrades to its commitments under the Paris Agreement, PM Modi underlined that India was already doing its part and that India’s per capita carbon emissions are 60% lower than the global average.Yadav maintained the same position and said there is a need to cut absolute emissions rapidly while taking into account the Paris Agreement which emphasised on respective historical responsibilities, delivery of promised climate finance and technologies at low cost keeping in perspective per capita emissions, differences in per capita GDP and the unfinished agenda for sustainable development.“India remains steadfast in its commitments to join and lead efforts to combat climate change within the multilaterally agreed convention and its Paris Agreement,” the environment ministry said in a statement adding that India has exhibited exemplary resolve by achieving its pre 2020 voluntary commitment of reducing emission intensity.“The issue of climate finance takes a critical shape as we accelerate the implementation of nationally determined contributions towards achieving goals of the Paris Agreement , and are severely affected by the social and economic impacts of the COVD pandemic. India has exhibited resolve through its pre-2020 climate commitments by achieving a 24% reduction in emissions, against our voluntary commitment of 20-25% by 2020,” Yadav said in his intervention.He also made it clear that India will accelerate action on climate change only when there is enough support from developed countries on finance and technology.“We will continue to focus on the implementation of our ambitious plans through concrete actions domestically as well as globally through international collaboration such as the International Solar Alliance, Coalition of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, etc. The momentum of climate action can only be accelerated when there is enough support through means of implementation including finance and technology,” he said.“For the G20 to take leadership in achieving the Paris goals as a block, the developed country members of the G20 have to take leadership in fulfilling the commitment of USD100 billion per year target. We have taken note of the recent finance support announcements of some G20 developed countries. However, a lack of action and ambition in delivering climate finance is impeding ambitious climate actions," India said highlighting that the current scale, scope, and speed of climate finance actions of G20 developed country members were not matching the expectations towards meeting the commitments.India made it clear that initiation of work on long-term finance by developed countries will provide a clear signal for developing country members of G20 to make bolder decisions and develop long-term strategies in curbing climate change.49 parties to the Paris Agreement representing 60 countries and 54.1% of global GHG emissions, have so far communicated a net-zero target according to Climate Watch.India reduced support to the fossil fuel industry by 4% from 2015 to 2019 even as the countries in the G20 forum of the world’s major economies are not walking the talk in addressing the climate crisis, a new BloombergNEF report released on Tuesday said. The G20 countries provided $636 billion in direct support for fossil fuels in 2019, which is just 10 less than that in 2015, it added.The report by BloombergNEF, a global research organisation, noted India has reduced the support, but it has 66 coal power plants in the pipeline. India is second only to China, which has 247 coal power plants in the making among G20 countries while Indonesia has 33.Most G20 countries have announced ambitious climate targets to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5-degree C compared to pre-industrial levels. But the report said they provided $3.3 trillion support for coal, oil, gas, and fossil-fuel power between 2015 and 2019. It added the sum could have funded 4,232GW new solar power plants or over 3.5 times the size of the current US electricity grid."India’s disappointment with the shortfall in climate finance is understandable. Recent emphasis on net zero targets to stay within 1.5 deg C warming may also feel like shifting of negotiating goalposts. But recent extreme events have shown that even small degrees of average global warming can lead to dangerous heat waves, floods, and cyclones. For India, scaling up renewable energy and nature-based solutions can bring new jobs and better health, but much depends on clean technology partnerships for industrial production," said Ulka Kelkar, director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-not-set-new-global-climate-benchmarks-says-yadav-at-g20-meet-101627072404772.html
24-07-2021||World||Vaccinated people make up 75% of recent Covid-19 cases in Singapore||Vaccinated individuals accounted for three-quarters of Singapore's COVID-19 infections in the last four weeks, but they were not falling seriously ill, government data showed, as a rapid ramp-up in inoculations leaves fewer people unvaccinated.While the data shows that vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases, it also underscores the risk that even those inoculated could be contagious, so that inoculation alone may not suffice to halt transmission.Of Singapore's 1,096 locally transmitted infections in the last 28 days, 484, or about 44%, were in fully vaccinated people, while 30% were partially vaccinated and just over 25% were unvaccinated, Thursday's data showed.While seven cases of serious illness required oxygen, and another was in critical condition in intensive care, none of the eight had been fully vaccinated, the health ministry said."There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected," the ministry said, adding that all the fully vaccinated and infected people had shown no symptoms, or only mild ones.Infections in vaccinated people do not mean vaccines are ineffective, experts said."As more and more people are vaccinated in Singapore, we will see more infections happening among vaccinated people," Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS)."It is important to always compare it against the proportion of people who remain unvaccinated...Suppose Singapore achieves a rate of 100% fully vaccinated...then all infections will stem from the vaccinated people and none from the unvaccinated."Singapore has already inoculated nearly 75% of its 5.7 million people, the world's second highest after the United Arab Emirates, a Reuters tracker shows, and half its population is fully vaccinated.As countries with advanced vaccination campaigns prepare to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, their focus is turning to preventing death and serious diseases through vaccination.But they are grappling with how to differentiate public health policies, such as mask wearing, between the vaccinated and those who are not.Both Singapore and Israel, for example, reinstated some curbs recently to battle a surge in infections driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, while England lifted almost all restrictions this week, despite high caseloads."We've got to accept that all of us will have to have some restrictions, vaccinated or not vaccinated," said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital in the Australian capital."It's just the restrictions are likely to be higher for those unvaccinated than vaccinated people, but that may still mean they have mask mandates indoors, for instance."The Singapore data also showed that infections in the last 14 days among vaccinated people older than 61 stood at about 88%, higher than the figure of just over 70% for the younger group.Linfa Wang, a professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, said elderly people had been shown to have weaker immune responses upon vaccination.In Israel, which also has a high vaccination rate, about half of the 46 patients hospitalised in severe condition by early July had been vaccinated, and the majority were from risk groups, authorities said.It was not immediately clear if the Singapore data reflected reduced protection offered by vaccines against the Delta variant, the most common form in the wealthy city state in recent months.Two doses of vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca are nearly as effective against Delta as against the previously dominant Alpha variant, according to a study published this week.Singapore uses the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in its national vaccination programme.Friday's 130 new locally-transmitted infections were off this week's 11-month high. The recent rise in cases prompted authorities to tighten curbs on social gatherings in the push to boost vaccinations, particularly among the elderly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-make-up-75-of-recent-covid-19-cases-in-singapore-101627069953748.html
24-07-2021||World||Search for bodies concludes at Florida condo collapse site||Firefighters on Friday declared the end of their search for bodies at the site of a collapsed Florida condo building, concluding a month of painstaking work removing layers of dangerous debris that were once piled several stories high.The June 24 collapse at the oceanside tower killed 97 people, with at least one more missing person yet to be identified. The site has been mostly swept flat and the rubble moved to a Miami warehouse. Although forensic scientists are still at work, including examining the debris at the warehouse, there are no more bodies to be found where the building once stood.Except during the early hours after the collapse, survivors never emerged. Search teams spent weeks battling the hazards of the rubble, including an unstable portion of the building that teetered above, a recurring fire and Florida’s stifling summer heat and thunderstorms. They went through more than 14,000 tons (13,000 metric tonnes) of broken concrete and rebar, often working boulder by bounder, rock by rock, before finally declaring the mission complete.Miami-Dade Fire Rescue’s urban search-and-rescue team pulled away from the disaster site Friday in a convoy of firetrucks and other vehicles, slowly driving to their headquarters for a news conference to announce that the search was officially over.At a ceremony, Fire Chief Alan Cominsky saluted the firefighters who worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site.“It’s obviously devastating. It’s obviously a difficult situation across the board,” Cominsky said. “I couldn’t be prouder of the men and women that represent Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.”Officials have declined to clarify whether they have one additional set of human remains in hand that pathologists are struggling to identify or whether a search for that final set of remains continues.If found, Estelle Hedaya would bring the death toll to 98.Hedaya was an outgoing 54-year-old who loved to travel and was fond of striking up conversations with strangers. Her younger brother Ikey has given DNA samples and visited the site twice to see the search efforts for himself.“As we enter month two alone, without any other families, we feel helpless,” he told The Associated Press on Friday. He said he gets frequent updates from the medical examiner’s office.Leah Sutton, who knew Hedaya since birth and considered herself a second mother to her, is worried that she will be forgotten.“They seem to be packing up and congratulating everyone on a job well done. And yes, they deserve all the accolades, but after they find Estelle.”The collapse also fueled a race to inspect other aging residential towers in Florida and beyond, and it raised broader questions about the nation’s regulations governing condominium associations and building safety.Shortly after the collapse, it became clear that warnings about Champlain Towers South, which opened in 1981, had gone unheeded. A 2018 engineering report detailed cracked and degraded concrete support beams in the underground parking garage and other problems that would cost nearly $10 million to fix.The repairs did not happen, and the estimate grew to $15 million this year as the owners of the building’s 136 units and its governing condo board squabbled over the cost, especially after a Surfside town inspector told them the building was safe.A complete collapse was all but impossible to imagine. As many officials said in the catastrophe’s first days, buildings of that size do not just collapse in the U.S. outside of a terrorist attack. Even tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes rarely bring them down.The disaster was one of the nation’s deadliest engineering failures. A set of overhead walkways collapsed at a Kansas City hotel in 1981, killing 114 people attending a dance. But that wasn’t the structure itself. A Washington, D.C., movie theater collapsed in 1922, killing 98. But that came after a blizzard dumped feet of snow on the flat roof.In the weeks after the collapse, a 28-story courthouse in downtown Miami, built in 1928, and two apartment buildings were closed after inspectors uncovered structural problems. They will remain shut until repairs are made.The first calls to 911 came at about 1:20 a.m., when Champlain residents reported that the parking garage had collapsed. A woman standing on her balcony called her husband, who was on a business trip, and said the swimming pool had fallen into the garage.Then, in an instant, a section of the L-shaped building fell straight down. Eight seconds later, another section followed, leaving 35 people alive in the standing portion. In the initial hours, a teen was rescued, and firefighters believed others might be found alive. They took hope from noises emanating from inside the pile that might have been survivors tapping, but in retrospect the sounds came from shifting debris.Rescue crews worked tirelessly, even when smoke and heat from a fire inside the building’s standing portion hampered their efforts. They persisted when the temperatures pushed into the upper 90s (35 Celsius) under the blazing sun, some toiling until they needed IVs to replenish fluids. They carried on when Tropical Storm Elsa passed nearby and dumped torrential rain. They left the pile only when lightning developed.The portion of the building that remained standing posed another grave threat as it loomed precariously above the workers. Authorities ordered it demolished on July 4.In the end, crews found no evidence that anyone who was found dead had survived the initial collapse, Cominsky said.The dead included members of the area’s large Orthodox Jewish community, the sister of Paraguay’s first lady, her family and their nanny, as well as a local salesman, his wife and their two young daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-bodies-concludes-at-florida-condo-collapse-site-101627069588754.html

One, VTimes, shut down last month, saying it lost advertisers and other business partners after the designation.The five individuals added to the list on Friday were from various outlets and included Mikhail Rubin, deputy editor of Proekt, an investigative news outlet that was declared "undesirable" on national security grounds last week.President Vladimir Putin's opponents see the moves against the media as part of a crackdown on the opposition before a parliamentary election in September. Denying a crackdown is underway, the Kremlin has described Russia's media market as vibrant, with many different outlets to choose from.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-declares-media-outlet-the-insider-a-foreign-agent-101627069207561.html
24-07-2021||World||US reports outbreak of 'untreatable' fungus Candida auris. All you need to know||US health officials on Thursday reported cases of untreatable fungus in two Dallas-area hospitals and a nursing home in Washington DC. Candida auris, a harmful form of yeast, is considered dangerous to hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical problems as it can cause bloodstream infection and even death.CDC’s Meghan Ryan said they are witnessing “clustering of resistance” for the first time in which patients seemed to be contracting infections from each other. A cluster of 101 Candida auris cases detected at the Washington DC nursing home included three cases that were resistant to all three kinds of antifungal medications.A cluster of 22 Candida auris cases in two Dallas-area hospitals included two with that level of multidrug resistance. The CDC has concluded that the infections were spread from patient to patient, unlike in 2019 when scientists concluded that the resistance to the drugs in three patients in New York formed during treatment.Also Read | Candida auris: Mysterious fungus that infected Covid-19 patients at US hospitalWhy is Candida auris a serious health threat?According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one in three patients with invasive Candida auris infection die. The US health agency has termed the emerging fungus as a serious global health threat.The CDC is concerned about the “superbug” because it is often multidrug-resistant, which means it is resistant to multiple antifungal drugs used to treat the infection. The difficulty to identify the infection using standard laboratory methods compounds the problem since misidentification may lead to wrong treatment.How to identify a Candida auris infection?Most people with serious Candida infections have underlying health conditions so it becomes more difficult to know if one has a Candida auris infection. Fever and chills are the most common symptoms of Candida auris infection and the symptoms do not improve even after antibiotic treatment for a suspected bacterial infection, as per the CDC.Scientists are still trying to figure out why Candida auris infections are resistant to antifungal medicines and why they started causing infections in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reports-outbreak-of-untreatable-fungus-candida-auris-all-you-need-to-know-101627068210560.html
24-07-2021||World||‘Havana syndrome’ sickened 100 CIA officers, says chief||About 100 CIA officers and family members are among some 200 US officials and kin sickened by the “Havana syndrome”, CIA director William Burns said on Thursday, referring to the mysterious set of ailments that include migraines and dizziness.The syndrome, with symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, migraines and memory lapses, is named after Havana because it was first reported by US officials based in the American embassy in Cuba in 2016. It has been reported that the unexplained phenomenon has caused sickness and even brain damage in US diplomats and intelligence officials in Cuba, China, Russia and some other countries.Burns, tapped by US President Joe Biden as the first career diplomat to serve as CIA chief, said in a National Public Radio interview that he has bolstered his agency’s efforts to determine the cause of the syndrome.He said among other steps, he tapped an officer who once led the hunt for Osama bin Laden to head a task force investigating the syndrome, and said he tripled the size of the medical team involved in the probe.The agency has shortened from eight weeks to two weeks the time that CIA-affiliated people must wait for admission to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he added.“It’s a profound obligation I think of any leader to take care of your people and that is what I am determined to do,” Burns said. He said a US National Academy of Sciences panel in December found that a plausible theory is that “directed energy” beams caused the syndrome. There is a “very strong possibility” that the syndrome is intentionally caused, and that Russia could be responsible, he speculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/havana-syndrome-sickened-100-cia-officers-says-chief-101627065070527.html
24-07-2021||India||Silver medal, golden girl||First day, first medal. That’s the piece of history Mirabai Chanu wrote for India as she thrust a 115kg barbell up above her with the practiced ease of a world beater. At the Tokyo International Forum, early in the morning of the first day after Olympics was declared open, Chanu won the silver in 49kg women’s weightlifting with a combined total of 202kg. It marked the first time that India has won a medal on the opening day of an Olympics, signalling what may turn out to be a landmark Games for the Indian contingent. Chanu lifted 87kg in snatch and 115kg — just four kilos less than her own world record — in the clean & jerk, behind only China’s Hou Zhihui’s total of 210kg. Zhihui is the world record holder in the category. Chanu’s coach Vijay Sharma’s booming voice resonated through the hall, as the diminutive lifter from Manipur ran to the backroom after her lifts to wrap herself around her 6ft2 father figure. Chanu is now only the second weightlifter from India to win an Olympic medal, after Karnam Malleswari won bronze at the 2000 Sydney Games. Someone from the coaching staff handed her a phone — on the other end was Jeremy Lalrinnunga and other teammates at their training base in Patiala, screaming and dancing with joy. Chanu broke into a jig herself. “Balle balle kiya!” she said, laughing. After the medal ceremony, Chanu came out to the media area, the silver around her neck. She held it and kissed it. “Medal bahut bhari hai, (the medal’s quite heavy),” she said, beaming throughout. “I wanted to win the gold, I tried, but I will accept the silver. “I am very happy, I have been dreaming of this for the past five years. I am very proud of myself right now. The first thing I will do is party!” she said. “Could not have asked for a happier start to @Tokyo2020! India is elated by Mirabai Chanu’s stupendous performance... Congratulations to her for winning the silver medal in weightlifting. Her success motivates every Indian,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.“Congratulations to #MirabaiChanu for our country’s first medal on the very first day. India is proud of her daughter,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter.If not for Chanu, this day could have gone very differently. Or rather, along more familiar lines. Indian athletes were involved in three other medal events on the opening day. In each of these, the Indians were strong contenders — Saurabh Chaudhary and Abhishek Verma, both ranked in the top three in the world, in 10m air pistol; Elavenil Valarivan (seeded No. 1 for Tokyo 2020) and world record holder Apurvi Chandela in 10m air rifle; and women’s world No. 1 archer Deepika Kumari and Praveen Jadhav in mixed team archery. Yet, it was not their day, sparking fears that this could be yet another Olympics where India would have to wait anxiously for a medal. Five long yearsAt the 2016 Rio Games, where Chanu had made her Olympics debut, everything had gone wrong for her. Of the six attempts given to lifters — three in snatch, three in clean & jerk — she had managed to complete just one lift in snatch. Three months ago at the Asian Championships, she had almost relived that horror, with two no-lifts in snatch. It’s the kind of thing that ends careers. Not for Chanu. “We have spoken so many times about that day in the Rio Olympics in these five years,” said coach Sharma. “Every time I would tell her that she is now a different athlete. It is that incident that has brought us where we are today,” he added. In Tokyo, if she was still haunted by those memories of Rio, she did not show it. From the moment her event started, Chanu’s body language was confident and relaxed. On her ears she wore gold earrings in the shape of the Olympic logo, gifted to her by her mother after her Rio experience. For her first attempt — 84kg in snatch — she stepped to the stage and bowed to the bar. Then, in one clean motion, Chanu had cleared the lift. She flashed her big smile. She was in control. She was ready to script her extraordinary tale of redemption. For her next lift, she cleared 87kg with comfort. She beamed. Only Zhihui, who also holds the world record for snatch, was lifting more. Chanu could not finish her last snatch, where she attempted 89, more than she had ever done. It didn’t matter much, because next up was clean & jerk, which Chanu has made her own. She cleared 110kg on her first attempt with such consummate ease that it looked like she was in training. By the time she was going for her second lift, set at 115kg, the entire field except Zhihui had already fallen away. In the end, the 7kg difference between Chanu’s best snatch (87kg) and Zhihui’s best (94kg) decided the medal. “The amount of discipline and commitment she has shown is extraordinary. You see how mentally strong she was today. That comes only with great hard work,” Sharma said. “During these rough times of the pandemic, when lives have come to an abrupt halt and mere survival has become an isolating task, victories such as yours will serve as a small reminder of the joy that hope and perseverance can bring,” read a letter addressed to Chanu by Abhinav Bindra, India’s only Olympic gold medallist. From Rio to the silver in Tokyo was a journey that involved meticulous training, a psychologist, fixing a bad back and realigning her posture with the help of Aaron Horschig, a former weightlifter who is now a renowned physical therapist and strength coach in the US, winning the world championship in 2017, gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, a bronze at the 2020 Asian Championships and becoming the world No 1. In a way, a medal in Tokyo was always within her strong grasp. But when it came — on a day when India were contenders in three other medal events but did not win in any of them — Chanu’s joy was infectious and may just be what the young Indian contingent needs as inspiration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/silver-medal-golden-girl-101627151056337.html

Now once again there is a flood-like situation,” Yediyurappa said. He added that despite facing these challenges he was able to carry out developmental works, in the Shivamogga district and his Shikaripura constituency.“I am satisfied that in the last two years we put maximum efforts into the development of Shivamogga district. The projects that are being inaugurated are evidence for it. I feel proud to say that through all-around development, I have made honest efforts to pay back to the people of Shivamogga district, and more specifically Shikaripura taluk, which gave me political birth,” he said.“I’m going”, is the between-the-lines message Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and workers in Karnataka have taken away from a series of recent statements made by Yediyurappa. He had visited Delhi last week to meet party leadership but sidestepped questions about the buzz over a leadership change in the state.On Wednesday night, he tweeted asking his followers not to indulge in any protests. “I’m privileged to be a loyal worker of BJP… I urge everyone to act in accordance with party ethics and not indulge in protests or indiscipline that is disrespectful and embarrassing for the party.”This was followed by a statement on Thursday, where he said that he would abide by any decision taken by the party leadership. Talking to reporters in Bengaluru, Yediyurappa said that everything will become clear after the event on July 26, commemorating the second-year anniversary of his government.“Amit Shah and our national president (JP) Nadda have immense faith in me. As you know, no one above the age of 75 years is given any posts or positions by the party. But considering my work, the national leadership has given me the opportunity to be in power till 78. I will finish two years as chief minister on (July) 26. My aim is to strengthen the party and bring our government back to power once again,” Yediyurappa said.The CM has the solid backing of the Lingayat mutts, which in the past have issued ultimatums against his removal. Seers from the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community are scheduled to hold a religious convention on Sunday during which they could push for the continuation of Yediyurappa’s tenure, political observers said.“This will be the first of its kind [convention] and deliberation on a host of issues that are faced down by various communities in the state will be discussed. Besides, discussions on the present political scenario could also be held,” Sri Dingaleshwar Swami, the seer of Balehosur mutt, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faced-many-challenges-but-satisfied-with-work-during-tenure-k-taka-cm-101627150816356.html
24-07-2021||India||Cinemas, spas, pools to open with restrictions||New DelhiMultiplexes, swimming pools, spas, auditoriums and entertainment parks will be allowed to open in the national capital from Monday, while the Delhi Metro and public buses will operate with 100% seating capacity, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) said on Saturday, effectively relaxing most restrictions after a decline in Covid-19 cases following a deadly fourth wave of infections in the national capital.In an order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, DDMA also relaxed the cap on the number of guests at weddings and funerals. Previously, up to 50 people were allowed in weddings, while 20 were permitted in funerals. From Monday, 100 guests will be allowed for both gatherings.Under a lockdown that was imposed on April 20, when the city was well into its fourth wave of infections, a curfew was imposed except for specific activities (such as going to buy groceries and medicines, or for going to a hospital or airports/railway stations). The lockdown restrictions were gradually eased with the decline in infections.Cinema halls, multiplexes, auditoriums and assembly halls will be allowed to run with 50% seating capacity. Swimming pools and entertainment parks have also been allowed, while sports complexes can be opened for members, even as no spectators will be allowed. Religious places will continue to remain prohibited for visitors. Business-to-business exhibitions can also be held from Monday, but such events will be restricted to business visitors only, according to the order.Spas have been allowed to open with a set of guidelines. The order said that all employees, especially the masseuse, should either get both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine or should undergo RT-PCR tests every fortnight. It also said that clients will have to sign an undertaking of being Covid-19-negative. Personal protective equipment (PPE) apart from face shields and masks will have to be worn by the therapist/masseuse if the treatment is of more than 30 minutes. Covid-appropriate behaviour will have to be strictly followed as is to be done in any other place, failing which the owner of the spa will face sealing and penal action under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act.Buses and the Delhi Metro are currently operating with 50% seating capacity. While this has been increased to 100%, no standing passengers will be allowed, the order said.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said that from Monday, all Metro coaches will allow around 50 people as against the existing rule of 25 people per coach. “DMRC will be further examining the revised guidelines issued today and if needed, detailed guidelines from the operational point of view will be worked out and communicated accordingly. As standing travel is still not permitted by the authorities, entry at stations will also continue to be regulated through identified gates as per the ongoing practice,” he said.DDMA has also lifted the 50% cap at gymnasiums and yoga centres. With Saturday’s order, nearly everything will be open from Monday in the national capital. Parks, restaurants, weekly markets and other markets were previously allowed to function.“It is further directed that the market trade associations, banquet halls, marriage hall associations, gymnasiums and yoga institute association, other trade associations and resident welfare associations shall also be responsible for ensuring compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviours by all shops, malls, markets, market complexes, offices, weekly markets, clinics, banquet halls/marriage halls and residents within their respective areas,” the order said.Delhi’s Covid-19 situation has been improving over the recent weeks. On Saturday, Delhi reported one Covid-19 death and 66 fresh infections. This comes days after the Capital recorded no daily death from Covid-19 for the first time since March 2, a landmark after the brutal fourth wave of infections between April and May that left thousands dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cinemas-spas-pools-to-open-with-restrictions-101627150457051.html

The incident which happened over a month ago on June 25 came to the police’s notice after the video went viral on social media. The police registered an FIR in this regard on Friday after the mother of one of the girls lodged a complaint.The girls, aged 13 and 16 years, were allegedly beaten by a group of at least 15 men who objected to the girls’ speaking over the mobile phones, a police official from Dhanpur told news agency PTI. The video showed a group of men abusing the two girls who were visibly frightened as those men surrounded them. After threatening those two girls, they began thrashing them, according to news agency PTI. HT could not verify the authenticity of the video.Police said that no complaint was lodged for almost a month but once the video came to the notice of the cops, they informed the girls’ family and an FIR was registered against 15 accused who hailed from Bhuvera and neighbouring Alindra villages at the Dhanpur police station, the police official said.The accused were booked under sections 143 and 149 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 504 (insult causing to break public peace) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and also under relevant provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. The police further added that efforts are on to nab the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teenage-girls-thrashed-by-15-men-for-speaking-on-mobile-phones-in-gujarat-101627147964531.html
24-07-2021||India||UAPA can’t remain in current form, sedition law must go: Ex-SC judges||Former Supreme Court judges Aftab Alam, Madan B Lokur, Gopala Gowda and Deepak Gupta on Saturday expressed concern over the misuse of anti-terror legislation in India while stressing it was time to do away with the law on sedition in the country.The remarks came amid outrage over the death of 84-year-old activist Stan Swamy, who was arrested under the anti-terror law in the Elgar Parishad case last year. He died in Mumbai earlier this month while his bail plea on health grounds remained pending before the high court there.Speaking at an online public discussion organised by NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR), the retired judges were unanimous in holding that the death of the tribal rights activist was an instance of how the anti-terror law was being misused.Swamy was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, (UAPA) for his role in what the National Investigative Agency (NIA) said was an alleged Maoist conspiracy that led to caste clashes near Bhima Koregaon village four years ago.Justice Lokur said Swamy’s demise was a result of “soft torture”. “...Why could he not be given medical treatment earlier? Isn’t that torture? It is soft torture. It is not physical torture where you beat up a person. But it is certainly a form of torture.”Justice Alam said: “Where has this most draconian law in world’s largest democracy taken us? The results are all there for us to see; it stares us in face in death of Swamy without a trial.”Justice Gupta said: “Father Stan Swamy, 84 years old, suffering from Parkinson’s disease... I mean are we not human? Have we lost all touch of humanity that this man required bail even if there is Sections 43D or 43E of UAPA?”“What is the purpose of bail? The purpose is that he should not influence and run away from justice. Court had adequate means to place such restrictions if Stan Swamy was granted bail. But what stands in way was Section 43D of UAPA,” the retired Supreme Court judge added.Section 43D(5) of UAPA makes the grant of bail extremely difficult. It lays down that an accused charged under UAPA shall not be released on bail if the court thinks there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such a person is prima facie true. The Supreme Court’s 2019 judgment in the case of Zahoor Ahmed Shah Watali also laid down that a court cannot go into the merits of a case or scrutinise admissibility of evidence at the time of deciding a bail plea, thereby lowering the bar for courts to examine the veracity of agency’s case.A few weeks back, Assam leader Akhil Gogoi walked out of jail after spending 17 months behind bars in connection with a case under UAPA against him over violent protests against a contentious citizenship law.The former judges said that Section 43(D)(5) of UAPA needed to be either amended or given a completely different interpretation by the Supreme Court, since it had become a tool to keep people incarcerated without trials.“Grant of bail is rendered almost impossible until the end of the trial which could take generations, a wholly unconstitutional interpretation of UAPA that strikes at the root of the fundamental right to life, personal liberties and speedy trial guaranteed under the Constitution. The Supreme Court judgment in Watali case needs to be reconsidered,” said justice Gowda.Justices Gowda and Gupta maintained that a law should be there to deal with terrorist activities but a vague definition of “terrorist activity”, as provided under UAPA, had to go.About sedition, as provided under IPC Section 124A, the retired judges said there was no place for the sedition law since the offence was already punishable under various laws.“.... This law should be shown the door as soon as possible,” said justice Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uapa-can-t-remain-in-current-form-sedition-law-must-go-ex-sc-judges-101627148628551.html

On Saturday, he said he faced several challenges from the day he took charge as the chief minister but he also expressed satisfaction over his term for he thinks he made honest efforts to better the lives of the people."From the day I took charge as the Chief Minister till now, I had to face several challenges like natural disasters that the state had never faced in the past and the corona pandemic, which ravaged lives. Now once again there is a flood-like situation," Yediyurappa said.July 26 could be his last day as the chief minister, he hinted earlier as he had said that he would do whatever the national leadership instructs him on July 25, which is tomorrow, on the eve of the completion of two years of the BJP government in Karnataka.'Supreme leaders will decide': Pralhad Joshi on if he would replace Yediyurappa"I am satisfied that despite all these (challenges), I have been able to take steps to improve the living standard of the people and their financial position. ...I thank the people for their support in facing the challenge," the chief minister said.Yediyurappa's long political career began as Purasabha president in Shikaripura, was first elected to the Legislative Assembly from Shikaripura in 1983 and went on to win eight times from there. This is his fourth stint as Karnataka's chief minister.This stint was mired in controversies as several BJP leaders have declared open rebellion against Yediyurappa and brought corruption charges against him. The "interference" of his son BY Vijayendra in the administration is also another strong allegation against the Yediyurappa government. Raghavendra is Shivamogga MP.After relinquishing the CM's chair, he will work for the party, Yediyurappa has said. "PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, and Nadda have a special love and faith towards me. You are aware that no position has been given to those who have crossed 75 years of age," the 77-year-old leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faced-challenge-since-day-1-says-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-ahead-of-possible-exit-101627147214829.html

Flood water started receding in most of the places in the southern states even though power supply remained disrupted in many regions.This week, around 140 people are said to have died because of heavy rains in India’s western coastal states and close to 1,50,000 people are in make-shift camps in three worst-hit states of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka where hundreds of villages are flooded.Officials said that the flooding seen in northern Karnataka and Goa was the worst since 1982, the heaviest rain in living memory. While in Karnataka, local ministers toured the flood-affected areas, in Goa, chief minister Pramod Sawant visited the flood-affected areas and assured compensation within fifteen days.Rain affected Goa and Karnataka have sought immediate Central assistance to carry out rehabilitation works. Goa sought ₹500 crore and Karnataka ₹1,000 crore. According to official estimates, more than 700 houses have been destroyed in Goa and more than 2,000 in Karnataka.Both Karnataka and Goa governments on Friday issued directions for restoration of power supply and road connectivity hit by several landslides in the two states. Work has also started to restore traffic on the Mumbai-Mangalore highway which was breached and blocked by landslides at several places.In Goa and Karnataka, both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress asked its workers to provide relief to the affected people. “Devastation caused by floods has caused huge losses. We demand [that] @goacm must give immediate cash compensation and a one month quota of essential commodities to the affected. Appreciate efforts of @IYCGoa to reach out to the needy with a helping hand,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat stated.As the water receded, the fear of water-borne diseases has also gripped the region.Karnataka health and medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar instructed health officials to take all precautions to prevent the outbreak of any disease in the flood-hit regions of the state. The health staff was instructed to spray disinfectant in places that are affected by floods, according to an official release.In Goa, CM Sawant instructed district officials to spray disinfectant in villages to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases and create awareness among people.“The second wave of Covid is not over yet. Ensure free masks and sanitisers are distributed to people in flood relief centres,” Sudhakar told the officials.The MeT department has predicted that the region will see reduced rainfall during the weekend as compared to the previous two weeks, which could provide relief to people and help government authorities restore essential services. The weather department has predicted heavy rainfall in the next 24 hours in Madhya Pradesh and parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-fury-with-water-receding-in-some-regions-threat-of-diseases-looms-large-101627146138933.html

Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who went to the UK on a two-day visit met UK foreign officials and said Mumbai, Delhi are "practically free of Covid"."Mumbai, Delhi, big cities are practically free of COVID. But we can’t rest on that situation because we are constantly vigilant, telling our citizens to take precautions so that we don’t have a third wave,” said Shringla, as reported by news agency PTI.Citing the example of France which has recently recognised Covishield as a valid vaccine, Shringla said, "I briefed them [UK officials] on the COVID situation in India. I pointed out that France had cleared visitors from India without quarantine if they are double vaccinated and have a negative test. The US has upgraded India in the travel scheme, encouraged the UK to do the same and they took note of it."India to Canada: Speed up study permits before new semester starts in SeptemberThe United States has recently lowered its travel advisory for India from no travel to reconsider travel. This is not regarding Indians travelling to the US as that is still restricted; this advisory is for US citizens wanting to travel to India. But the easing implies that India's improving Covid-19 situation has already been noticed internationally.India is on UK's red list which means Indians can't visit the United Kingdom and returning citizens have to undergo a compulsory 10-day quarantine to get entry.“The EU has said they will leave it to individual member states to decide and 14 EU countries have already recognised Covishield, two of them have also recognised Covaxin suo moto. We are now asking all countries that you recognise our vaccine certification on a mutual reciprocal basis, recognising the integrity of that process,” Shringla said on Covishield and Covaxin being recognised in European countries.Recently, Canada, the United Arab Emirates have extended flight ban from India. The flight ban was imposed when cases in India surged during the second wave of the pandemic. The ministry of external affairs said it is pursuing the issue of international travel with countries and there have been some positive steps.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-delhi-practically-free-of-covid-india-asks-uk-to-review-ban-on-international-flights-101627143055495.html

Indian nationals are not exceptions, and they additionally face a serious threat of kidnapping,” the advisory said.The alert warned of targeted attacks such as “roadside IED blasts and magnetic IEDs against civilian vehicles”, and called for caution during all vehicular movements. “All Indian nationals visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan are advised to exercise utmost vigilance and caution with regard to security at the workplace, place of residence and also during movement to their places of work. It is recommended that all types of non-essential movements be avoided,” the advisory stated.The advisory contained a new section calling on Indian media personnel travelling to Afghanistan to contact the public affairs and security wing of the embassy for a “personalised briefing including specific advice for the locale they are travelling to. It added, “This will not only help media persons make a better assessment of the risks involved but also make it easier for the embassy to render speedy assistance if needed.”This was a response to the killing of Indian photo-journalist Danish Siddiqui by the Taliban last week. The Pulitzer Prize winner was killed while covering clashes between Afghan troops and the Taliban at Spin Boldak, a border crossing with Pakistan in Kandahar province. Siddiqui was on an assignment embedded with Afghan security forces at the time.Indian nationals were also warned to strictly avoid travelling outside the main cities and movements during peak commuting hours. The advisory reiterated an earlier call for Indian companies operating in Afghanistan to make special security arrangements for Indian employees deployed at project sites. “While travelling on roads, maintain distance from possible targets like military convoys, vehicles of govt ministries/offices, high ranking officials, law enforcement agencies, and avoid visiting crowded markets, shopping complexes, mandis, restaurants and other public places. All essential movement may please be kept as discrete as possible,” the advisory said. Authorities in New Delhi have been closely monitoring all security-related developments in Afghanistan since the US administration announced plans to pull out all troops from the country by August. India evacuated some 50 diplomats and security personnel from Kandahar in Indian Air Force aircraft on July 10 after Taliban fighters seized key areas around the southern city. Currently, only the Indian embassy in Kabul and a consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif are fully functional. According to the external affairs ministry’s data, there are around 3,100 Indian nationals in Afghanistan, mostly engineers and staff working on hundreds of development projects. India is the largest regional donor in Afghanistan, with pledges of around $3 billion.The Taliban has enhanced efforts to wrest control of territory from Afghan government forces as the US continues withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. The Taliban have said that civilian and non-military foreign nationals, diplomats, embassies and workers of humanitarian organisations won’t “face any problems or security risks” from the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-security-alert-for-indians-in-afghanistan-warns-of-serious-threat-of-kidnapping-101627142119407.html

Here's what doctor says||People with high blood sugar level can get vaccinated against Covid-19 as there is no link between the vaccine and the sugar level, AIIMS Bhopal director Dr Sarman Singh has recently said in an interview with All India Radio. Keeping blood sugar levels in control is desirable for overall well being, but the Covid-19 vaccine will not interfere with the blood sugar level of an individual, Dr Singh said.In the wake of several post-covid complications that have been reported during the second wave of the pandemic, doctors have alerted people with high blood sugar as it increased the chance of mucormycosis infection.शुगर लेवल बढ़ा हुआ है, तो क्या वैक्सीन ले सकते हैं?#Unite2FightCorona | #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/kpHOGN76eH"Vaccine has no connection with sugar level. If the sugar level can be controlled, it is better to take such measures. But if your sugar level is very high, then it may happen that the pain at the injection site may remain longer," Dr Singh said.People with high blood sugar are also at a greater risk of contracting an infection from the vaccination site, the doctor said.A few sporadic incidents of blood sugar level increasing after vaccination has been reported from a few hospitals. Reports said a few patients witnessed a higher blood glucose level for almost a month for which some even required medical intervention. But there have not been enough cases to link the increase in blood sugar levels with vaccines. And not all patients who witnessed an increase required medical intervention to bring blood sugar level down.In its guideline, which was issued in March this year, the Indian Council of Medical Research said that people with diabetes are not at a greater risk of getting Covid-19, but they are in general at the risk of contracting an infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-people-with-high-sugar-level-take-covid-19-vaccine-here-s-what-doctor-says-101627136416946.html
24-07-2021||India||Indian scientists develop material that repair itself on mechanical impact||Scientists in India have developed material that may soon make it possible for damaged electronic components to repair themselves. The department of science and technology on Saturday said that researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata collaborated with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, to develop piezoelectric molecular crystals that repair themselves with the electrical charges generated by the mechanical impact on them.Daily use devices often break down due to mechanical damage, which decreases the life of the equipment and increases maintenance costs. In autonomous spacecraft, human intervention for the repair and restoration of an electronic component damaged by a mechanical impact is not possible. In such cases, minimal damage could leave costly equipment useless.Keeping such necessities in mind, scientists have developed piezoelectric molecular crystals that generate electricity under mechanical impact.“The piezoelectric molecules developed by the scientists called bipyrazole organic crystals recombine following mechanical fracture without any external intervention, autonomously self-healing in milliseconds with crystallographic precision,” the department said.Due to this unique property, the broken pieces of the component acquire electrical charges at the crack junction and the damaged parts attract each other for precise autonomous repair. The methodology for self-repair was initially developed by the IISER Kolkata team led by professor C Malla Reddy and professor Nirmalya Ghosh.The duo used a custom-designed state-of-the-art polarization microscopic system to probe and quantify the perfection of the piezoelectric organic crystals, said the DST. Professor Bhanu Bhusan Khatua and Dr Sumanta Karan of IIT Kharagpur separately studied the performance of the new materials for fabricating mechanical energy harvesting devices.“The material may find application in high-end micro-chips, high precision mechanical sensors, actuators, micro-robotics, and so on. Further research into such materials may eventually lead to the development of smart gadgets that self-repair cracks or scratches,” the department added.The study was published in the journal Science earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-scientists-develop-material-that-repair-itself-on-mechanical-impact-101627135269288.html
24-07-2021||India||'Farmers know how to teach a lesson': Rakesh Tikait's fresh warning to Centre||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday once again warned the Centre over the three legislations against which the farmers are holding protests. He said that farmers know how to teach a lesson to people who ignore them."The Kisan Parliament has awakened the deaf and dumb government. The farmer also knows how to run Parliament and teach a lesson to those who neglect him in the village. Nobody should forget that," Tikait, the spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said in a tweet posted .किसान संसद से किसानों ने गूंगी -बहरी सरकार को जगाने का काम किया है। किसान संसद चलाना भी जानता है और अनदेखी करने वालों को गांव में सबक सिखाना भी जानता है। भुलावे में कोई न रहे ।#FarmersProtest #FarmersProtest_AtParliamentHe also called on the farmers to be united "to save the soul and freedom of India".Tikait's comments came on the third day of farmers' protest near Parliament where monsoon session is being held. The sit-in, which the protesters call 'Kisan Sansad' began at Jantar Mantar on Thursday amid heavy security.The idea behind organising the 'Kisan Sansad' was to show that the agitation is still alive, farmer leaders said. The farmers have been protesting at Delhi border sites - Sighu, Tikri and others - for nearly eight months demanding the scrapping of the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year.As part of latest initiative, a group of 200 farmers, wearing identification badges and with flags of their unions in hand, visit Jantar Mantar demanding scrapping of the contentious farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).The plan is to hold agitation at Jantar Mantar till the end of the monsoon session on August 13 and observe the proceedings of Parliament. Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has, however, given farmers permission to hold protests at the site till August 9.Tikait had earlier said that farmers will protest against members of Parliament, be it of the ruling party or the opposition, in their constituency if they failed to raise their issues in Parliament.He also said that the farmers will pass a motion at the 'Kisan Sansad' on the cancellation of the three contentious farm laws.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers unions, has been spreading the protest against the three laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.This is the first time since the violence in the national capital during a tractor rally on January 26 (Republic Day) that the authorities have granted permission to the protesting farmer unions to hold a demonstration in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-know-how-to-teach-a-lesson-rakesh-tikait-s-fresh-warning-to-centre-101627129953791.html

The ED may take action anyandter Mumbai Police officially inform the central agency to probe the financial aspect of the case-- as that is the procedure.The crime branch of Mumbai Police arrested Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty's husband, businessman Raj Kundra on July 20 in connection with an alleged porn racket operating in Mumbai. In association with a London-based firm, Raj Kundra's company, owned by Kundra's brother-in-law, used to run an online streaming application that allegedly made porn videos. Kundra was sent to police custody till July 23, which now has been extended to July 27.A $1.2 million deal, 20 lakh subscribers: Mumbai Police's new revelations about Raj Kundra's businessAs Mumbai Police are investigating the case, several aspects are coming up. Police have said that the charges against Kundra and his associates are for making pornographic films and cheating people with the promises of Bollywood roles. Police have received complaints from women actors who have said that they were promised Bollywood roles and were forced to do those porn movies.The financial aspects are also being probed, regarding which the Enforcement Directorate can launch a separate investigation. Most of Kundra's transactions were with foreign firms and hence the ED may invoke charges under FEMA against Kundra.What are FEMA and PMLA?The Foreign Exchange Management Act relates to external trade, payment etc. Under this Act, foreign exchange related offences are civil offences.As the name suggests, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is to prevent money laundering. Under this act, the authority can confiscate property obtained for the laundered money.What are the financial irregularity charges against Raj Kundra?Mumbai Police have revealed that Raj Kundra was planning to sell 119 adult films to a foreign indivisual for a sum of $1.2 million. Police are also suspecting that the money earned through Hotshots app might be channelised into online betting as a South Africa-based sports betting firm transferred money into Kundra's bank account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-may-file-case-against-raj-kundra-for-financial-irregularities-101627127200642.html

24-07-2021||India||'Supreme leaders will decide': Pralhad Joshi on if he would replace Yediyurappa||Union minister Pralhad Joshi, whose name is doing the rounds as a successor of Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, on Saturday said no one has spoken to him about this and he was not aware that BS Yediyurappa has been asked to resign or not. Emphasising that he does not answer hypothetical questions with if and buts, Joshi said, "There is no high command in the BJP but national leadership. We got different leaderships from time to time. There was Rajnath Singh, after which Nitin Gadkari came, who was succeeded by Amit Shah and now J P Nadda is there. In the present situation, we have supreme leaders in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. They will decide."Joshi, however, is aware of the speculation going on in the media. "No one has spoken to me about it (succeeding Yediyurappa). It's only the media, which is discussing it. As no one has spoken to me, there is no need to react to it," he said, as news agency PTI reported.After refuting rumours of stepping down for weeks, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has recently hinted that the party's national leadership might have some different role for him. If there is a shift in power in Karnataka, it will happen after July 26 following the event of the BJP government completing two years in Karnataka. Yediyurappa has also hinted that he is likely to get any instruction from the national leadership on July 25.The speculative change in power in Karnataka will trigger a severe reaction from the Lingayat community as it has already warned that if Yediyurappa, Lingayat strongman, is removed from the CM's post, the party will have to risk losing the Lingayat community's support.Seers of the Lingayat community who have recently met Yediyurappa will hold a convention in Bengaluru on July 25. "We will discuss the current situation in Karnataka. All seers have given their blessings to him (Yediyurappa). Every government should work on its shortcomings," Dingaleshwara Swami, Balehosur Mutt, told ANI.Apart from Pralhad Joshi, few other names are also there in the guessing game that is going on in full swing after Yediyurappa met PM Modi, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh in Delhi last week. The list of the probables includes CT Ravi, BL Santosh, Murugesh Nirani, Arvind Bellad etc.Pralhad Joshi has been the MP of Dharwad, a city in northwest Karnataka, since 2004.

All you need to know||Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech on Friday cancelled its agreement with two firms for the supply of Covaxin as the Brazilian government had cancelled the deal following graft allegations. On Saturday, Brazil suspended the proposed clinical studies that the Indian vaccine maker was about to undertake in the country. This all happened in a chain reaction after the Brazilian government suspended its deal with Bharat Biotech to procure 20 million doses of Covaxin.Here is what went wrong in Bharat Biotech's Covaxin deal in BrazilIn November 2020, Bharat Biotech entered into an agreement with Precisa Medicamentos and Envixia Pharmaceuticals LL.C. Precisa, Bharat biotech's partner providing assistance, guidance, and support with regulatory submissions, licensure, distribution, insurance and conduct of phase III clinical trials, among others.Since Precisa was representing Bharat Biotech in Brazil so far and will not do so from now on, the clinical trial has to be suspended naturally.Graft allegation or partnership problem?The Bolsonaro government faced allegations of corruption regarding its agreement with Bharat Biotech which is still under investigation. Whistleblowers from Brazil's health department said there was pressure from higher authorities regarding the Bharat Biotech deal. It was also alleged that Pfizer was giving vaccines to Brazil at a cheaper rate. Following this, the deal was cancelled and the Brazilian government said that there was no corruption as no money was paid to Bharat Biotech. Bharat Biotech also confirmed that it has neither received any advance payment from the Brazilian government nor supplied any vaccine.Precisa is a Brazil-based firm while Envixia is registered in Dubai.As Bharat Biotech has now distanced it from these two firms, it has also brought some allegations without pointing any finger to any firm particularly. "We have recently been informed that certain letters purported to have been executed by executive of the company are being circulated online. We would like to emphatically state that these documents have not been issued by the company or its executives and therefore vehemently deny the same," Bharat Biotech said in the statement, issued on Friday.What now? Is Covaxin approved in Brazil?When the deal was on, it was claimed that Bharat Biotech's Covaxin received approval from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa on June 4. But later it was clarified that on June 4 Anvisa authorised exceptional import of Covaxin vaccine by the ministry of health for distribution and use under controller conditions.Now that the deal stands cancelled, Bharat Biotech said it will work with Anvisa diligently to complete the regulatory approval process."There are two processes of the company related to the regularisation of Covaxin in Brazil- an application for authorisation for emergency use and a protocol for conducting clinical research in that country. Based on the communication made by Bharat Biotech, Anvisa will reassess the processes underway at the Agency and adopt the relevant measures," Brazil's health regulator said, as quoted by news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-went-wrong-in-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-deal-with-brazil-all-you-need-to-know-101627119810764.html

He added one of the four befriended the girl through social media a few months ago. “He along with the other three friends came to Bagwalipokhar area on Friday evening to meet the girl. ...he called the girl to a local restaurant where its owner, after seeing them, informed the locals...,” said the police officer.The officer added the locals arrived at the restaurant and accused the four of “love jihad”, the term some Hindu groups use to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. The groups use the term to describe what they believe is an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriage. The officer said the locals and some Hindu groups informed the girl’s father, who told them that the four allegedly lured his daughter to abduct her. He added the four were taken to a local police station, where the father lodged a complaint.Ajay Lal Shah, a local police officer, said they booked the four for “abduction and molestation” and also under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The four were due to be produced before a local court on Saturday, said Shah.Earlier on Wednesday, communal tension erupted in Uttarakhand after some Muslim labourers were accused of offering namaz at the Badrinath temple premises in a social media post that went viral. Police booked the 15 and their contractor, who worked about a kilometre away from the temple for gathering at one place in violation of Covid-19 protocols. In their primary investigation, police said they did not find any evidence that they offered namaz on Badrinath temple premises. No arrest has been made so far in the case and police were carrying a probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-men-held-in-uttarakhand-s-almora-after-locals-accuse-them-of-love-jihad-101627117213865.html

According to the ATS, over 3,000 permits were illegally granted allegedly in the name of army personnel.Magistrates in Jammu and Kashmir are accused of issuing the licenses in bulk allegedly based on forged documents to non-residents between 2012 and 2016 "in lieu of monetary consideration", people aware of the matter said.The Jammu and Kashmir Police initially probed the case before it was handed over to the CBI.A CBI spokesman said the agency is conducting searches at around 40 locations in Jammu, Srinagar, Udhampur, Rajouri, Anantnag, Baramulla, Delhi including the official and residential premises of certain public servants including Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Kashmir Administrative Serice Officers. The raids were also being conducted on premises of gun dealers, the spokesman added.People aware of the matter said the CBI has collected documents pertaining to the issuance of armed licences across 22 districts of Jammu and Kashmir.“During investigation and scrutiny of documents, the role of certain gun dealers was found, who in connivance with the public servants...allegedly issued such illegal arms licenses to the ineligible persons. It was also alleged that the persons who got these licenses were not residents of the places from where the arms licenses were issued. The investigation is continuing,” the spokesman said.IAS officer Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said his official residence in Srinagar was also searched on Saturday. “With reference to media reports I’ve to confirm that CBI did search my residence & found nothing incriminating in ongoing arms license probe.

The minister addressed the meeting virtually."The Minister concluded with a vote of thanks and urged those G20 nations which have per capita GHG emissions above the world average to reduce their per capita GHG emissions and bring them down to the world average over the next few years which will vacate the carbon space to some extent and support the developmental aspirations of the developing nations," the government said in a release.Singh encouraged the G20 nations to take immediate steps in this direction so that the world community stays on the right track to leave a better planet for our future generations.Singh apprised the delegates from the G20 countries of the significant progress made by India in meeting its Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) targets while staying committed to meeting its climate goals under the Paris Agreement.The Union minister also said that India has already achieved 38.5 per cent installed capacity from renewables and when the renewable capacity under construction is also accounted for, the share of renewables in the installed capacity goes well over 48%, which is way above the commitments made under the Paris Agreement.Meanwhile, energy and environment ministers from G20 nations failed to agree on the wording of a key climate change commitment in their final communique, Italy's ecological transition minister Roberto Cingolani said on Friday.The failure to agree to common language ahead of that gathering will be seen as setback to hopes of securing a meaningful accord in Scotland.The G20 meeting was seen as a decisive step ahead of United Nations climate talks, known as COP26, which takes place in 100 days' time in Glasgow in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vacate-carbon-space-india-urges-g20-nations-with-high-greenhouse-gas-emission-101627112479782.html

Loose mud prevented National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) from resuming digging to look for around 50 residents, who remain missing. Locals said the rescue operation was progressing slowly due to bad weather and difficult terrain earlier even as 36 bodies were pulled from debris until Friday evening.Sandhya Malusare, who lost her mother, father, and six other relatives, said she survived since she lives in a neighbouring village. “This is the biggest tragedy of my life and I have lost many of my family members. ...the administration is very slow in carrying out the rescue and search operations.” Mahendra Pol, a resident, said the locals do not have the wherewithal to carry out the evacuation, search and rescue operations. “Fortunately, my family members were saved...but others were unlucky. Yesterday (Friday) and the day before (Thursday), there was a slow rescue process while today (Saturday) it has not even started properly.” Taliye is one of the hardest-hit areas in Maharashtra, where the toll from landslides and flooding went up to 138 on Saturday while 90,000 people have been evacuated from seven districts in the aftermath of heavy rain this week.The locals said they have been left to fend for themselves. “Even police are helpless, and many villagers are missing. The government is not sensitive. Police are also at a distance and not visiting the spot. The rescue operation has been delayed and the government officials are insensitive to our pain and anguish. Whatever bodies have been recovered was due to the efforts of locals,” said a resident.The NDRF said they were facing issues related to access and logistics. “...three teams of 25 persons are carrying out search operations. ...the area is waterlogged and very remote. Approach and access to the village are tough and difficult. It is a mud hillock and since we are working, there is a risk of the mudslide. So, we are working very carefully to avoid another tragedy,” said NDRF commandant Anupam Shrivastava.Collector Nidhi Choudhari said the additional collector, three tehsildars and NDRF is carrying out operations at the spot. “It involves a tough terrain as it (the village) is surrounded by Valleys from both sides. The road to the village was washed away. It is nature’s fury and unimaginable for us. There were access issues yesterday (Friday) and we had to clear the landslide debris to reach the village. The challenge is that we have to trace the bodies.”Choudhari said the district has nine extremely landslide-prone and 80 mild landslide villages. “This village (Taliye) is not among them. We have conducted the geological survey of the district and the village does figure on the landslide-prone village. We conduct studies to find out the vulnerable villages and plan accordingly to make life safe for the villagers as part of our disaster management preparedness.”The opposition parties have also criticised the government over the slow rescue operation.Bharatiya Janata Party leader Pravin Darekar said around 40-50 persons are still missing, and the administration has failed to respond to the situation. “Heavy rainfall, waterlogging, and disrupted connectivity are hampering the operations in the village. The tragedy must be viewed seriously by the state and the administration must ensure timely relief and evacuation of the victims .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hopes-of-finding-survivors-in-landslide-hit-maharashtra-villages-fade-101627111873712.html

24-07-2021||India||TMC MP not the 1st to get suspended for remainder of Parliament session||Trinamool Congress parliamentarian Shantanu Sen’s suspension from Rajya Sabha for the remaining duration of the monsoon session is being hotly debated politically. While according to the Rules of procedure and conduct of business in Lok Sabha, the speaker is empowered to suspend a member from the house if he considers his or her conduct “grossly disorderly” or if the member “disregards the authority of the Chair or abuses the rules of the House by persistently and wilfully obstructing the business,” however, in Sen’s case, chairman Venkaiah Naidu ruled in favour of the suspension motion moved by the ruling party MP and minister of state for parliamentary affairs V Muralidharan. This was then passed by voice vote.Sen’s suspension was sought under Rule 256, which says a lawmaker, who “disregards the authority of the Chair or abuses the rules of the Council” through “wilful” disruptions can be suspended for the remaining session if the Rajya Sabha chairman “deems it necessary”.Here’s a look at some other instances of MPs facing this censure:Delhi Riots: Following the Delhi riots of 2020, seven Congress MPs were suspended for “unruly behavior.” These included Raj Mohan Unnithan, TN Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, Benny Behanan, Manickam Tagore, Gaurav Gogoi and Gurjeet Singh Aujla. They had forcefully snatched papers from other lawmakers during the Budget Session of the Parliament.Farm laws: A ruckus over farm laws, which the Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu described as “unruly behavior” and an “insult to the deputy chairman,” eight opposition MPs including Congress’ Rajeev Satav, Syed Naseer Hussain and Ripun Bora, AAP’s Sanjay Singh, CPI(M)’s KK Rajesh and Elamaram Kareem, and TMC’s Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen were suspended in September last through a motion against “bringing disrepute” to the House, approved through a voice vote.Singh was suspended earlier as well in February for “sloganeering” against the same laws.Sabarimala, Cauvery River, and special status to Andhra Pradesh: In January 2019, nearly 45 members from parties including AIADMK, TDP, and Congress were suspended following in-house protests over a proposed dam on river Cauvery, special state status to Andhra Pradesh and the Sabarimala issue respectively. They were suspended by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on the pretext of “wilfully obstructing the proceedings of the House.”Protests over Telangana: 18 MPs were suspended following a ruckus over the creation of the separate state of Telangana in February 2014. Congress leader L Rajagopal then resorted to using a pepper spray in the house while another member M Venugopala Reddy smashed a mike.Price Rise: 7 MPs were suspended in March 2010 when the government took up the Women’s Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha. Lalu Prasad Yadav along with members from Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Janata Dal (U) sloganeering in the house calling the introduction of the then women reservation bill as a “tactic to divert attention from the issue of price rise.” Except for Yadav, rest of the MPs were suspended for showing total “disregard for the dignity of Council”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-not-the-1st-to-get-suspended-for-remainder-of-parliament-session-101627111153678.html
24-07-2021||India||5 Tamil Nadu districts bordering Western Ghats may get rain today||Five districts in Tamil Nadu bordering the Western Ghats will receive rain on Saturday, the Regional Meteorological Centre in Chennai predicted. Tamil newspaper Dinamalar cited RMC’s director Puviarasan as saying that these districts will get rain due to southwest monsoon turning intense in the Western Ghats.The heavy rain in the Nilgiris and Coimbatore will continue on Saturday. These two districts received heavy to very heavy rain last week. Avilanji, Naduvattam, and Upper Bhavani in the region received 16, 14, and 13 centimetres of rain respectively. Theni, Kanyakumari, Perambalur, Salem, and Tirunelveli districts as well as Chennai city recorded rainfall by Friday.Theni, Dindigul and Tenkasi bordering the Western Ghats will also witness showers on Saturday, the weather forecast said. The coastal districts of northern Tamil Nadu will receive sporadic rainfall while the rest of the state will see dry weather on Saturday, it added.Chennai and its suburbs will see cloudy weather and scattered rainfall is likely in some places in the city. Heavy winds are likely in coastal Tamil Nadu, Gulf of Mannar, coastal Andhra Pradesh and south and central Bay of Bengal areas where the wind speed is likely to cross 50 kilometres per hour. The fishermen have been warned not to venture into these areas for fishing.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government sanctioned ₹12 crore to take out preparatory works for the northeast monsoon, which may set in after October. Every year, districts like Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, and Cuddalore are the worst affected during the northeast monsoon. The channels and waterways in these districts are repaired every year so that the rainwater is drained into the sea. Last year, the government carried out monsoon-related works for the cost of ₹9.5 crore.Officials of the irrigation department said that they are preparing a Detailed Project Report for these works and the government order sanctioning fund allocation will follow shortly. The works will commence after the fund allocation, officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-tamil-nadu-districts-bordering-western-ghats-may-get-rain-today-101627109645127.html

Asaduddin Owaisi's All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has now put forward a condition for alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP). The AIMIM is currently a part of Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha which has smaller parties like Bharatiya Vanchit Samaj Party, Bhartiya Manav Samaj Party, Janata Kranti Party (R) and Rashtra Uday Party as constituents.The chief of Uttar Pradesh unit of AIMIM told Hindustan Times' Hindi-language sister publication Hindustan that if SP agrees to make a Muslim MLA from the Morcha deputy chief minister, it is ready for an alliance with Akhilesh Yadav's party. Shaukat Ali also said that Owaisi will visit Uttar Pradesh in August, Hindustan reported.Owaisi visited Bahraich and other areas of Uttar Pradesh earlier this month, and inaugurated a new party office for the state.Hindustan reported that Owaisi is expected to visit Prayagraj, Fatehpur and Kaushambi during his August visit. He is likely to hold meetings with Muslims, Dalits, backward class people and professionals like doctors and engineers.Shaukat Ali further said that the AIMIM has created an organisational structure in Uttar Pradesh, according to Hindustan. All 75 districts have party units and respective chiefs, added Ali. He said that if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has to be stopped, the Bhagidari Morcha will have to fight assembly elections along with SP ad Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). This will help consolidate the 20% Muslim votes in the state, Ali was quoted as saying by Hindustan.The AIMIM leader ruled out an alliance with the Congress, which he called a "sinking ship". And the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has no base in Uttar Pradesh, he added.Owaisi had earlier announced that AIMIM will contest 100 seats in Uttar Pradesh polls. The AIMIM chief made a challenge last month that he won't let the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) return to power in Uttar Pradesh. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath accepted the challenge and said his party will form government in the state after winning "more than 300 seats".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alliance-with-samajwadi-party-possible-if-owaisi-s-aimim-drops-a-hint-101627109656736.html

The state's health minister Ma Subramanian, after presiding over the coordination meeting on vaccination, told media persons that Tamil Nadu has been allotted 72 lakh vaccine doses for the month of July.The state government is planning to provide free vaccination in private hospitals too. To enable such an initiative, the vaccination at the private hospitals will be brought under CSR funding. The vaccines allotted to the private hospitals will be administered free to the people and the CSR funding will be used to bear the cost of the vaccines, the minister said.The private hospitals in Tamil Nadu have received 18,70,520 vaccine doses so far. Out of this, the private hospitals administered 13,31,613 vaccine doses and 5,38,907 doses are still in stock at the hospitals. The state government will publish the CSR funding details of the vaccines online, Subramanian mentioned.Elaborating further on the vaccination in the state, Subramanian said that they are now planning to vaccinate all the tribal communities in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts like the state government vaccinated the tribal people in the Nilgiris district earlier. All the hill villages of Tamil Nadu will be covered under the free vaccination. The government never forces anyone on compulsory vaccination but the people are sensitized on the importance of vaccination to fight Covid-19, he said.Subramanian also ruled out any deaths in the state due to oxygen shortage after the DMK government took charge. During the AIADMK rule, the state witnessed 13 people dying in the Chengalpattu district due to oxygen shortage, and the chief Minister then communicated the same to the Prime Minister. The four deaths in Vellore hospital and two deaths at Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital at Chennai were due to technical snags in oxygen supply and not due to oxygen shortage, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-aims-to-use-csr-funding-to-administer-free-covid-19-vaccines-at-private-hospitals-101627107628597.html

The dams in the Western Tamil Nadu are filling to the brim, reported Tamil daily Dinakaran on Saturday. The Nilgiris district has been receiving heavy to very heavy rains with thunderstorms for the last two days. The catchment areas like Avilanji, Upper Bhavani, and Ooty suburban areas are receiving incessant rains.

Landslides were reported in Rosemount, Nondimedu and local people are scared of more landslides if the heavy rains continue to lash the Nilgiris district.Meanwhile, the torrential rainfall around the Mettupalayam area of Coimbatore district resulted in the Pillur dam filling to the brim. The excess water from the dam is released into the Bhavani river causing the flooding of low-lying areas along the river. Noyyal, a tributary of River Cauvery, flowing in the Western Tamil Nadu is also flooded due to the rains in catchment areas.As these rivers are in spate, the Coimbatore district administration has issued a flood warning to people living near the river beds. Bhavanisagar dam in Erode district, another important water source of Western Tamil Nadu, has reached 98 feet out of its capacity of 120 feet. Anticipating further rains and a sudden surge of inflow, the Public Works Department has warned people residing along the channels to migrate to safer places. The National Disaster Response Force from Ranipet was rushed to Coimbatore and the Nilgiris district to carry out disaster mitigation works.The discharge from Kabini dam in Karnataka has increased to 30,000 cubic feet per second due to heavy rains in Karnataka’s Kodagu district. Another 6000 cubic feet per second of water is released from Karnataka’s Krishnaraja Sagar dam.

Last month, the AIIMS director told a Delhi-based news organisation that Covaxin shots might be available for children by September."The vaccines for children should come out now because trials in India are already there in the vaccines which are available in India, Bharat Biotech trial is in the final phase by September, we will have the data," news agency ANI quoted Dr Guleria as saying on Friday.Reports said on Monday that the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company will administer its indigenous anti-Covid shot to children in the age group of 2-6 as part of its vaccination trials for kids.In view of a probable third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccination trials on children have been underway in the country. Besides Covaxin, Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila is also testing its anti-Covid shot for children.Vaccine trials for kids are conducted by dividing them into different categories on the basis of their age, with 175 participants from each age group included. Once every participant has been injected with a second dose, an interim report is expected by the end of August. On the basis of this interim trial report, a decision will be taken if the vaccine is safe to be used on children.Covaxin, along with Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila's three-dose shot, ZyCov-D, are the two vaccines that experts believe will be cleared for children in the near future. While Covaxin is already being used in the nationwide vaccination drive, Zydus Cadila on July 1 applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) of its vaccine candidate for those aged 12 and above."Zydus Cadila vaccine has also included children and their data is already there. They have already applied for the emergency use authorisation," Guleria said.Government officials, however, have repeatedly said that "more data" is required before an anti-Covid vaccine can be made available for children.India has administered as many as 42.78 crore vaccines so far, as of 9am on Saturday. Of these shots, more than 40% have been provided to people in the age group of 18-44 years, 34.1% have been administered to 45-60 year-olds, and 25.4% to those above 60 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-for-kids-covid-19-vaccine-trial-results-may-be-out-by-september-says-aiims-chief-101627101261851.html

AIIMS chief answers||All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria has said India might have to adopt a booster dose with second-generation Covid-19 vaccines as the Delta variant of the coronavirus has swept across the world and driven up infections in several countries."It seems that we probably need the booster dose of vaccines as with the passage of time the immunity tends to fall," Dr Guleria said in an interview with ANI. "There is waning immunity. We would like to have a booster dose that will cover for various emerging variants," Guleria said adding that the booster dose will be a second-generation vaccine."We will have second-generation vaccines which would be better in terms of the immunity they give, covering of the new variants and a having a better overall efficacy," Guleria said.Also read | Covaxin booster dose: What is it? What does govt say about this?The Delta variant, which first emerged in India and is spreading around the globe, has infected those already fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The spread of the Delta variant has forced some countries to step up their vaccination campaigns and bring back curbs on businesses, activity and travel.Guleria said that trials of booster shots are already on. "You will probably need a booster dose till the end of this year.

24-07-2021||India||Need to curb bogus voting, booth capturing with iron hand: SC||Booth capturing and bogus voting should be dealt with an iron hand, said the Supreme Court on Friday while upholding the conviction of eight persons involved in rioting and causing injuries with firearms outside a polling station in what is now Jharkhand ahead of the 1989 Lok Sabha elections.Directing the eight to surrender forthwith and undergo the remaining sentence of six months, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said, “The essence of the electoral system should be to ensure freedom of voters to exercise their free choice. Therefore, any attempt at booth capturing, or bogus voting should be dealt with iron hands because it ultimately affects the rule of law and democracy.”The eight have been found guilty of beating a Bharatiya Janata Party worker after he refused to hand over voter slips to them. They also fired and caused injuries to bystanders.The bench said nobody can be permitted to dilute the right to a free and fair election. It added that in past judgments of the Supreme Court, it is well laid out that election is a mechanism that represents the will of the people, and it is for this reason, democracy, and the free election has been said to be part of the basic structure of the Constitution.“An important part of strengthening democracy and free election is by ensuring secrecy of casting vote,” the bench said, citing the 2013 judgment in Peoples Union of Civil Liberties case which held that freedom of voting is a part of the fundamental right of freedom of expression.“It is observed that in direct elections of Lok Sabha or State Legislature, maintenance of secrecy is a must and is insisted upon all over the world in democracies where direct elections are involved to ensure that a voter casts his vote without any fear or being victimized if his vote is disclosed,” the bench said.The eight accused, Lakshman Singh, Shiv Kumar Singh, Upendra Singh, Vijay Singh, Sanjay Prasad Singh, Rajmani Singh, Ayodhya Prasad Singh, and Ramadhar Singh, approached the top court against an order passed by the Jharkhand high court on October 31, 2018, rejecting their appeals against their conviction. Previously, a trial court in July 1999 held them guilty of rioting and voluntarily causing hurt.The bench noted that the punishment of six months was less. But it did not pass any orders to this effect as the state had not sought enhancement of the prison term. The bench found that the charges against the eight persons were proved by the testimony of witnesses. The witnesses told police and the trial court that the accused came to the booth with an intention “to snatch the voters’ list and bogus voting”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-curb-bogus-voting-booth-capturing-with-iron-handsc-101627104613425.html

Of the 40 children, 16 are girls and 24 are boys and two adults are women. Police said efforts were on to recover more trafficked children and apprehend the human trafficking racket. 80 children were trafficked from four villages in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) along the Indo-Bhutan border in Assam.

24-07-2021||India||Blinken to discuss ways to ‘deepen’ ties with India during visit, says US||The United States said Friday it expects to discuss ways to “further deepen” bilateral ties, the Quad, Afghanistan and the Covid-19 pandemic during Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s upcoming visit to India starting July 27, which will be his first as the top American diplomat.On July 28, Blinken will have meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval. He leaves for Kuwait later in the day. Blinken previously visited India as deputy secretary of state in the Barack Obama administration in 2015.“We expect the discussions to focus on ways to further deepen our bilateral partnership, which is very broad in scope, as well as increased convergence on regional and global issues,” acting assistant secretary of state for south and central Asia Dean Thompson told reporters, previewing Blinken’s visit.On bilateral issues, the US expects the discussions to be focussed on “expanding our security, defense, cyber, and counterterrorism cooperation,” he said. More of that will be part of the upcoming 2+2 ministerial dialogue between foreign and defence ministers of the two countries later in the year.Afghanistan will figure prominently among regional issues. India is “a critical partner in the region”, Thomson said, adding, “We welcome India’s shared commitment to peace and supporting economic development in Afghanistan”.India has been concerned over the rapid gains made by the Taliban in Afghanistan as United States-led international forces wind up their 20-year-old operations and leave, way ahead of a self-imposed deadline of September 11. The US military has said the pullout is nearly over, at around 92%.Thompson added that discussions with India will be on “how we can work together to realize” the goal of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan and to “find ways to bring the parties together, and continue to pursue a negotiated settlement to end the longstanding war”.Developments in the Indo-Pacific will figure in the secretary’s discussions, the state department official said, underscoring the importance accorded by President Joe Biden to the region by calling a virtual summit of the Quad, comprising Australia, Japan, India and the US, so early in his tenure, in March, just two months after assuming office.“We’re working with India and other friends and partners in the region to advance this shared vision of the Indo-Pacific,” Thompson said, adding, “Importantly, we’ll also discuss our health collaboration to combat Covid-19, including the Quad vaccine partnership that was first announced during President Biden’s Quad summit.”The Quad members had launched a joint initiative at the summit to distribute 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region by the end of 2022, funded by Japan and the US, manufactured by India and distributed by Australia. The rollout has been delayed by India’s own struggles with the second wave of Covid-19 cases.Amongst the most pressing of global challenges the two countries cooperate on, climate change will figure most prominently in secretary Blinken’s conversations on the visit.“The partnership will reinforce our collective efforts to achieve both the goals of the Paris Agreement and our own ambitious 2030 targets for climate action and clean energy,” Thompson said, referring to the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 partnership launched in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blinken-to-discuss-ways-to-deepen-ties-with-india-during-visit-says-us-101627092792221.html

The reservoir’s lowest point is at 664.50 feet above sea level and its crest is at 674.50 feet above sea level. Claiming that the reservoir was only at 31%, DJB moved a contempt plea alleging that the shortfall at Wazirabad reservoir was because Haryana was not releasing enough water.The order of February 1996 on which DJB relied said, “We direct that Delhi shall continue to get as much water for domestic use from Haryana through River Yamuna which can be consumed and filled in the two water reservoirs and treatment plants at Wazirabad and Hyderpur...”Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for DJB, produced a letter written by Haryana chief secretary Vijai Vardhan to DJB on May 20 this year, where it admitted that it supplied only 370 cusecs of water to the Capital when it was required to provide 450 cusecs.Haryana, however, disputed any shortfall in supply of water to Delhi. Senior advocate Shyam Divan relied on a report by a Supreme Court-appointed panel on April 22 this year that found out that Delhi was diverting water received from Haryana to its plants at places other than Wazirabad and Hyderpur.“The committee found how water from the Yamuna coming to Delhi is being diverted to water treatment plants at Bawana, Dwarka and Okhla. It depends on DJB how much water it wants to send to Wazirabad, as it is fully under their control,” Divan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-junks-djb-s-plea-against-haryana-over-water-shortage-101627071312511.html
24-07-2021||India||As 2nd Covishield doses begin, supplies fall short||The pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in Delhi slowed down further on Friday, as the city administered 35,700 jabs, a day after it halted the use of Covishield for first doses in government centres due to a shortage of supplies.The Delhi government’s orders on Thursday, in effect till July 31, came as people in the 18-45 age bracket who took the jab on May 1, when the vaccine drive opened up for all adults, became eligible for the second dose of Covishield, as the 84-day gap between jabs ended.On Thursday, around 48,600 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered in Delhi.The halt on using Covishield for first doses is likely to end in the first week of August, said officials.“We expect that Delhi will start receiving more doses from the Centre. This month the supply was quite restricted, because of which we weren’t able to run all centres,” said an official from the West District.Officials at state-run vaccination centres said they were forced to send people away.“Of course we faced problems. There were people coming in, but we did not have any vaccine doses. We had to ask them to leave. Delhi received very few doses today [Friday],” said the official aware of the city’s vaccine stocks.Till Friday morning, Delhi had 39,420 doses of Covishield and 234,730 doses of Covaxin, according to the government’s vaccination bulletin.Another official from South east district said, “This is not the first time we have had to turn people away. There are times when doses are in short supply and we have to keep centres closed or shut them in the middle of the day. This is a supply chain problem.”Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said, “The Delhi government is prepared to vaccinate people. We can vaccinate the entire population within three months. But whenever we get the vaccines, they get over in a day or two. We are just waiting for the vaccines.”“Scientifically, people who have had an infection have very little chance of getting a second infection. By now, at least 80% of Delhi’s population would have been exposed to the infection, so we need to vaccinate a very small proportion of people... Usually we see a lot of hesitancy when it comes to vaccines but right now people are eager to get it but there are no vaccines available. This hampers the trust in the programme,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-2nd-covishield-doses-begin-supplies-fall-short-101627070964497.html

This study said vehicular pollution, road dust, and industries are the major pollutants of Delhi air, besides stubble burning.“Those who stay in Delhi during the festival of Deepawali know about its impact. We have come a long way since 2017 (when the SC ordered a cracker-free Diwali in Delhi) and we are now in 2021 when the pandemic is still on,” the bench added. The NGT banned the sale and use of firecrackers on December 1, 2020, in view of the “harmful effect of firecrackers on public health” and the pandemic.Firecracker manufacturers and sellers moved the SC against the ban. The SC said the NGT order was fair, but clarified: “If the air quality improves, the authority may permit sale or use of firecrackers depending on the quality of air in that area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-ngt-s-cracker-ban-in-regions-with-low-air-quality-101627068365767.html

Shahid is currently on a three-day visit to India.The Maldives has benefited from large India-backed infrastructure projects worth $2 billion. The smaller high impact community development projects are a key part of India’s cooperation with the Maldives and the agreement signed by the ministers will lead to an additional outlay of MVR 70 million for projects to be implemented by local councils.“To support decentralisation efforts of Govt of President @ibusolih, an addl. grant of MVR 70 mn ($4.5 mn) has been extended to carry out high-impact projects in #Maldives through Local Councils. An MoU was signed during FM @abdulla_shahid’s ongoing visit to formalise this,” the Indian high commission in the Maldives said in a tweet.Shahid tweeted that the high impact community development projects, funded with grant assistance from India, are “immensely impactful”. He added, “I am delighted that today, we paved the way for more projects to be funded under this scheme with the envelope being increased to MVR 155 million.”In a tweet, Jaishankar described the community projects in the Maldives as “Neighbourhood first in action”. He added that he had a “warm meeting” with Shahid and discussed the priorities of his presidency at the UN General Assembly.Shahid, on his first foreign visit since his election to the UN post on July 7, also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The prime minister felicitated Shahid on his vision statement for a “Presidency of Hope”, and assured him of India’s full support and cooperation during his presidency.Modi said Shahid’s victory in the election reflects the growing stature of the Maldives on the world stage, and emphasised the importance of reforming the multilateral system, including UN organs, to reflect contemporary realities and the aspirations of a majority of the world’s population.Modi also expressed satisfaction that bilateral projects are progressing well despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and pointed to the importance of the Maldives as a “key pillar of India’s Neighbourhood First policy and vision of SAGAR”.The Maldives was the first country to receive made-in-India vaccines in January, and this was preceded by health and humanitarian aid in 2020, including 12 tonnes of medicines, and a soft loan of $250 million for budgetary support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-maldives-sign-4-5-mn-agreement-for-community-development-projects-101627067111382.html
24-07-2021||India||Union health minister confirms success of existing population policy||Amid states like Uttar Pradesh proposing a law on population control, the Union government reported a decreasing fertility rate and a halving in the rates of teenage births and marriages, just by successfully implementing the national population policy of 2000.Responding to a question by Bhartiya Janata Party MPs Ravindra Kushwaha and Manoj Tiwari, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Friday said, “The total fertility rate has declined from 2.7 to 2.2 from 2005-06 (NFHS III) to 2015-16 (NFHS IV). The decadal growth rate has declined from 21.54% in 1990-2000 to 17.64% during 2001-11.”MPs Kushwaha and Tiwari sought the government’s response to a report which stated India to become the most populous country by 2027. They also asked if the government had taken recommendations from MS Swaminathan Committee, which had offered suggestions like having a target-free approach on contraceptive use.Minister Mandaviya confirmed involving the Committee’s recommendations. Presenting proof of success for the government’s population control initiatives, he revealed statistics (that measure changing factors in population) showed a downward trend. The total fertility rate declined from 2.7% to 2.2% (2005-06 to 2015-16), the decadal growth rate declined from 21.54% to 17.64% (1990-2000 to 2001-11), crude birth rate declined from 23.8% to 20.0% (2005 to 2018), and the teenage birth rate was also halved from 16% to 8%.Recently, some BJP-led states showed support for legislation that would control India’s population level. UP government released a population control draft that de-incentives people from having more than two children. Not meeting this criterion would bar government employees from promotions, restrict people from contesting local polls or receiving subsidies.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also indicated that large families were likely to lose certain state benefits. He added, “There is no point in talking about what our parents did or others did in the 1970s.”Congress leader Salman Khurshid had earlier taken a jab at UP’s draft bill by saying that politicians should first declare how many children they have. Bihar’s CM Nitish Kumar on 12 July said that he was not in favour of any such law and that data shows educating women would reduce population growth.Vasectomy Fortnight, which encouraged male participation in family planning and post-abortion family planning services, were among some of the initiatives listed by the government for curbing India’s population growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-health-minister-confirms-success-of-existing-population-policy-101627065370885.html
24-07-2021||India||TN woos startups with exemptions, grants||Chennai: Tamil Nadu is wooing MSMEs and start-ups after committing to 49 investment projects worth around Rs. 28,508 crore earlier this week. The state on Friday announced the second edition of TANSEED (Tamil Nadu Startup Seed Grant Fund) 2021 during July-September 2021 to support up to 20 start-ups with seed grants of ₹10 lakh each. Start-ups registered under Startup India and with StartupTN and those willing to register here have been invited to pitch their innovation and win a seed grant.The Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Mission, also known as “StartupTN” was formed as a Section 8 Company under the MSME department by the Tamil Nadu government in March 2021. Startup TN had launched the first edition of TANSEED 2021 during January-February this year and had supported 10 promising startups with a seed grant of ₹10 lakh each.Additionally, to improve the start-up ecosystem in the state, the government has decided to provide exemptions from four entry barriers- Earnest Money Deposit (EMD), condition of prior turnover and prior experience for government purchases up to ₹20 lakh and waiver of tender cost. With this, Tamil Nadu joins the list of states such as Karnataka, Telangana, and Kerala who have already provided such exemptions. A government order dated July 22 signed by Arun Roy, Secretary, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) department, stated that many start-ups struggle in the early stages because of a lack of market for their products and that government patronage can solve their marketing problem to a great extent.Roy said after careful examination, the government has decided to provide concessions to registered start-ups for public procurements by a procuring entity which includes government departments such as public sector undertakings (PSUs), local bodies, cooperative institutions, universities, statutory boards, and societies. Experts say that the highlight of the new orders is that a start-up registers with the Udyam portal in another state like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra etc can also benefit, if they can register as a start-up in either Tamil Nadu’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) or Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Policy (TANSIM). This they believe can attract start-ups from other states.“A few days back investors were invited and now entrepreneurs are invited. These efforts will show its benefits in three to four years’ time frame on the creation of unicorns from Tamil Nadu and employment opportunities,” said K E Raghunathan, Consortium of Indian Associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-woos-startups-with-exemptions-grants-101627065129008.html
24-07-2021||India||Communities catering to the differently abled on the rise as pandemic takes toll on families||Chennai: Communities for inclusive living of abled people along with people with disabilities is making progress in Chennai and in several regions in Tamil Nadu, the ongoing pandemic has stiffened ageing parents’ agony on caregiving for their adult children with mental and physical disabilities.The biggest fear for parents is who would look after their child once they are gone. Akila Vaidhyanathan began pondering upon this question when her son, Nishant Sriram was just 10 years old. He was diagnosed with autism and aphasia. “We realised he cannot live independently and he requires support. So we thought of various options and a key question was what would he do the entire day?” says Vaidhyanathan. “Institutional setups do not engage them productively. Nishant is active, he loves to eat out and he enjoys all good things in life.” So Vaidhyanathan and her husband launched an inclusive living project by collaborating with Covai Care in Coimbatore which provides assisted living communities for senior citizens. 10% of the spaces were earmarked for families who have children with disabilities. “It’s a great age because as we grow older, we need help and some become single so during our time or after our time, our children can continue living in these homes with assistance.” A 50 year old woman with intellectual disabilities was recently orphaned but her transition to living was smooth as she was already living with her aged mother in this community. Vaidhyanathan,55 and her family along with Nishant who is now 25 will in the future move into a set up they helped create. Key figures driving this independent and inclusive living movement are mostly parents like them who have formed organisations such as SCAN (Special Child Assistance Network) in Chennai, CLAPS (Community Living Association of Parents) in Thiruvallur. The practice of ‘group homes’ is already ongoing in Tamil Nadu where an apartment is rented or bought and adults with disabilities live together with their peers, families and caregivers.This is being scaled-up as on Thursday, SCAN launched its inclusive housing initiative with a private real estate builder, Akshaya Homes who will construct the project to be disabled-friendly. The adults with special needs can live with their peers and caregivers in a shared accommodation with the apartment having accessible amenities. The caregivers would be certified by a prominent NGO working across various sectors for people with disabilities, Vidya Sagar (formerly The Spastics Society Of India). “The idea was that parents can watch how their adult children with special needs are being taken care of and they need not live in constant worry,” says Gopinath Ramakrishnan, co-founder and managing trustee of SCAN. “So far we have only concepts of institutions and hostels where adults with disabilities are forced to live together. Imagine being put in these places when you are in your 30s and 40s because the parents are in their 70s, they are incapacitated and they have no other choice. That’s not good enough. We want the parents to know that they are happy. We want to give the adults choices, flexibility and decision making power.”While the movement for interdependent and inclusive living is growing, there are concerns on transitions over finances and savings. Vidya Sagar which runs a program called ‘Begin to Live Interdependently with Support Systems’ (BLISS) is finalising a Trust deed for an early-thirties woman with multiple disabilities. Her mother, a retired professor with visual impairment, is her sole caregiver and the daughter needs full support the whole day. A Delhi-based lawyer Roma Bhagat is helping the organisation and family to finalise the deed. “We want to create a support system in advance when the parents or primary caregivers are alive and are active,” said Smitha Sadasivan, member of the project and a member of the Disability Rights Alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/communities-catering-to-the-differently-abled-on-the-rise-as-pandemic-takes-toll-on-families-101627065069027.html
24-07-2021||India||IGNCA opens for visitors with first major exhibition at new location||The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) on Friday opened its doors to visitors as it kicked off its first big event -- an exhibition on freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad on his birth anniversary -- at its new, though temporary, premises at Hotel Janpath.The five-storey building, where IGNCA will function from for the next 2-3 years, was inaugurated on July 1.Achal Pandya, head of the IGNCA’s conservation and cultural archives unit, said that the idea of holding an exhibition on Azad was first floated in November. “While the idea was proposed in November, work started around 3-4 months ago. This is the first big event at our new premises and is open for the public. Besides the current exhibition, we plan to conduct many other activities as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’,” said Pandya.The exhibition on Azad will be on display till August 10, following which another exhibition on relatively lesser-known freedom fighters, including a storytelling program - Kathakar, will come up next month, said IGNCA officials.Set up in 1985, IGNCA is actively involved in organising exhibitions, performances, conferences and lectures to promote various art forms, and also offers short-term and certificate courses in arts and culture. It was temporarily moved to Hotel Janpath in March as its original location, on Man Singh Road, was identified as one of the areas to be demolished as part of the Central Vista redevelopment. According to officials, IGNCA will be moved to Jamnagar House once the Central Vista work is completed.Patrons of the IGNCA are likely to miss the sprawling lawns of the original campus at Man Singh Road, spread over 27 acres, that played host to major exhibitions and festivals.IGNCA member-secretary Sachidanand Joshi earlier told HT that the terrace space in the new building will be used for hosting activities and events once visitors start trickling in. “We have created a welcoming ambience for the public. Our gallery space fell short, so we have used the lobbies for displaying our paintings. We plan to use the terrace space for performances in the coming future. While the location is temporary, our work continues as before and visitors will have a lot to admire and learn from,” he said.At IGNCA, its souvenir shop, Prastuti, and the Svasti Cafe are open in the main building though minor maintenance work continues in both the outlets. The library is expected to start in August.“Ventilation is much better in our new space. Due to the location, we get significant natural light which is beneficial since our work entails dealing with intricate material like paintings and documents,” said Anil Dwivedi, project associate, conservation.Dwivedi said that though he had many memories associated with the original location, the working space for the unit was more spacious now.Simran Sangal, 25, a conservation assistant, said that the varied rooms and alcoves of the hotel ensure enough and distinct storage for different projects. She said her team is currently working on Kalamkari paintings from Andhra Pradesh, and will soon start work on a set of paintings from Rashtrapati Bhavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ignca-opens-for-visitors-with-first-major-exhibition-at-new-location-101627064770595.html
24-07-2021||India||Khori demolition to continue, SC says||The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the ongoing demolition of encroachments in Faridabad’s Khori Gaon village on Aravalli land to be completed in four weeks, as it directed the city’s municipal authority to ensure that no illegal structure occupying forest land is spared.The Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) on Friday asked the top court for more time to comply with its June 7 order, which gave authorities six weeks to demolish illegal structures in the village, and directed Haryana to finalise its rehabilitation policy before July 31.The apex court on February 19 last year directed all encroachments to be cleared from Aravalli forest land, after which MCF carried out demolitions in the village in April this year.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari allowed the civic body four weeks to complete the demolitions, and said, “Our direction to remove all structures on forest land applies to all structures without any exception.”The observation was made after some residents of the village claimed that state and municipal authorities were acting swiftly against the poor while sparing the rich who have constructed farmhouses and commercial structures on forest land.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the residents, moved an application in this regard producing a list of 50 such properties in Faridabad and another 10 in Gurugram district. Gonsalves said, “In the very area said to be a forest area in which as this court has said no one can stay, there are a large number of farmhouses of rich people, hotels, ashrams and other commercial establishments that continue in the forest area with the protection of the state government. The decision of the government to evict only the poor and allow the rich to stay is blatant discrimination on the grounds of class.”Senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj, appearing for MCF, said Khori Gaon is spread over 150 acres in a Faridabad village. Of this, the corporation has cleared 74 acres of forest land and the demolition has so far been peaceful. He said the properties alleged to be on forest land, as mentioned in the application, could be beyond 150 acres.Several group of residents of Khori village filed separate applications requesting the court to first provide them temporary shelter and food before rendering them homeless. Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, representing a group of residents, said that with the approaching monsoons and the prevailing Covid-19 outbreak, their lives were at serious risk, and cited a call by experts of the United Nations Human Rights Council to stop forced evictions during the pandemic.Six UN special rapporteurs who were part of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council appealed to the Indian government to stop the eviction of Khori residents.Referring to the above statement, the bench remarked, “Before going public, they should have read the case paper books and our orders.”The Haryana government, represented in court by additional advocate general Ruchi Kohli, presented an affidavit which said that the state is considering plans to shift residents’ goods and provide them transportation and temporary shelter.Most residents of Khori Gaon have lived there since 2010, but were not entitled for rehabilitation under the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran Rehabilitation Policy as this scheme requires an inhabitant to occupy government or government agency land as on April 1, 2003.The court allowed the affected residents to present their suggestions to the authorities within a day or two. It directed the state to finalise its rehabilitation policy before July 31 and allowed the residents who are still aggrieved with the policy to challenge it by the next date of hearing on August 3.Till then, the Court directed that any resident who has a grievance about temporary shelter, transportation, etc can bring the matter to the notice of the Commissioner, MCF who will then take corrective measures. “In case no relief can be given, the reason for not giving relief should be recorded so that it can be examined appropriately by the Court on the next date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khori-demolition-to-continue-sc-says-101627064769449.html
24-07-2021||India||Afghanistan, Quad meet to be focus of Blinken’s India visit||The rapidly deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and preparations for the first in-person Quad Summit are expected to figure in the agenda for US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s maiden visit to India next week.Blinken, the third senior member of the Biden administration to travel to India after defense secretary Lloyd Austin in March and special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry in April, will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on July 28.His discussions with his Indian interlocutors will cover issues such as the continued cooperation on Covid-19 response efforts, Indo-Pacific engagement, shared regional security interests, shared democratic values and addressing the climate crisis, the US state department said in a statement.The situation in Afghanistan and cooperation at the UN will be part of the discussions on regional and global issues of mutual interest, the external affairs ministry said.India has watched with growing concern as the rapid drawdown of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan has coincided with a violent offensive by the Taliban in recent weeks to capture territory and crucial border crossings with Iran, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. Indian diplomats and security personnel were recently evacuated from the consulate in southern Kandahar city following a surge in clashes.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Blinken’s visit will allow the two sides to hold consultations on the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan, especially India’s concerns about the Taliban’s unfettered campaign to expand its influence before any possible peace negotiations aimed at finding a political settlement.India is also expected to convey its concerns about Pakistan’s efforts to limit the country’s role in Afghanistan and the presence of thousands of Pakistani terrorists on Afghan soil and the implications for regional peace.Blinken’s visit to New Delhi will coincide with a previously scheduled trip to the Indian capital by Afghan Army chief Gen Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai during July 27-30.Under the rubric of Indo-Pacific engagement, India and the US are expected to discuss preparations for the first in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad later this year following the virtual meeting of the leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the US in March. The two sides are also expected to discuss China’s aggressive activities across the region.The two sides will also discuss ways to give fresh impetus to the Quad’s Covid-19 vaccine partnership, which is largely dependent on India’s role as a supplier of vaccines and has been stalled since New Delhi curtailed the export of jabs after a devastating second wave of infections earlier this year.Modi’s proposed visit to the US and bilateral trade issues, including talks on a trade deal and the US withdrawal of benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences programme for Indian exports, too could come up in the discussions.With the Biden administration more focused on human rights issues and democracy than the previous Trump administration, the US has nudged India on these matters in recent months. This has included the US state department expressing concern over restrictions on freedom of expression and detention of human rights activists and journalists.The US state department’s statement said Blinken’s visit to India and subsequently to Kuwait will “reaffirm the United States’ commitment to strengthening our partnerships and underscore cooperation on our shared priorities”. The external affairs ministry described the visit as an opportunity to continue high-level bilateral dialogue and bolster the India-US global strategic partnership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-quad-meet-to-be-focus-of-blinken-s-india-visit-101627063930159.html
24-07-2021||India||Road ahead even more daunting than during 1991 crisis: Manmohan||Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Friday said the economic liberalisation process started 30 years ago catapulted India to a $3 trillion economy, but added that the road ahead is even more daunting than during the 1991 crisis and priorities of the nation need to be recalibrated to ensure a “healthy and dignified” life for every single Indian.The senior Congress leader said he was “deeply saddened” at the devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and stressed on the need to improve key social indicators. “The social sectors of health and education have lagged behind and not kept pace with our economic progress. Too many lives and livelihoods have been lost that should not have been,” he said in a statement on the 30th anniversary of the presentation of the 1991 Union Budget (on 24 July).In order to bring the economy back on track, the PV Narasimha Rao government (June 21, 1991- May 16, 1996) launched economic reforms by ending the era of licence-quota raj and by encouraging privatisation. The process was initiated by Singh as the finance minister, in his budget speech on July 24, 1991.Singh recalled his budget speech three decades ago where he quoted Victor Hugo, ‘No power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come’, and said: “Thirty years later, as a nation, we must remember Robert Frost’s poem, ‘But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep’.”Singh said that successive governments in the last three decades followed the path of reform that was laid in 1991, which brought India into the league of the world’s largest economies.“More importantly, nearly 300 million fellow Indians have been lifted out of poverty in this period and hundreds of millions of new jobs have been provided for our youth.”He, however, added that it was not a time “to rejoice and exult but to introspect and ponder”. “The road ahead is even more daunting than during the 1991 crisis,” he said.The reform process unleashed the spirit of free enterprise, which has helped produce world-class companies and helped India emerge as a global power in many sectors, the former PM said.“The economic liberalisation process in 1991 was triggered by an economic crisis that confronted our nation then, but it was not limited to crisis management. The edifice of India’s economic reforms was built on the desire to prosper, the belief in our capabilities and the confidence to relinquish control of the economy by the government,” he added.Singh said he was fortunate to play a role in this reform process along with several of his colleagues in the Congress party. “It gives us immense joy to look back with pride at the tremendous economic progress made by our nation in the last three decades,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-ahead-even-more-daunting-than-during-1991-crisis-manmohan-101627063871046.html
24-07-2021||India||House impasse may continue, govt eyes bill on Delhi air panel||The government is set to introduce in Parliament next week a bill to reconvene a now-defunct commission to monitor air quality in the national capital region but the ongoing impasse in both Houses over the alleged use of Israeli spyware might continue for some time as the Congress wants the Narendra Modi government to commit to a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the issue.The Opposition is not satisfied with the suo motu statement of information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who spoke in the Lok Sabha on Monday and Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, and insists that the government didn’t categorically rule out the purchase or use of Pegasus spyware by its agencies.A senior Congress leader told HT, “We want an SC-monitored investigation.”On its part, the government circulated the list of official business for the next week. It contains as many as 10 bills, including the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital and Adjoining Areas Bill. An ordinance on this matter, which set up a commission to monitor pollution in the national capital region last year, lapsed in March. The commission shut down soon after.The monsoon session of Parliament began on Monday but was roiled by protests and disruptions by Opposition parties over the alleged snooping row, controversial farm bills, rising petrol prices and other issues.A global investigative consortium reported this week that politicians, activists, journalists and even constitutional authorities were potential targets of surveillance using Israel-manufactured Pegasus spyware, triggering uproar.The Opposition insists that a debate on the Pegasus controversy can take place in Parliament only if the Union home minister is present in the House. While the government managers insist that the ruling dispensation is ready for a debate on any issue, senior Congress strategist told HT that “Pegasus can be discussed if the home minister remains present.”Trinamool Congress, the second largest Opposition party in Parliament, also see no end to the protests if the PM and the home minister don’t participate in the debate. “There is no question of giving up on our demands. This is not an information technology issue at all. Using espionage and military-grade against your own citizens? You are setting up a surveillance state. This is a serious issue and Parliament needs to know the truth,” said Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien.Both Houses of Parliament faced continuous disruption for the last four days. The government and the Chair have repeatedly appealed for peace for discussion to take place.On Friday, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu said he agrees that members have a right to seek clarifications from the IT minister on the latter’s statement on the Pegasus issue. “Allow the House to function and then the minister has to be told that there are going to be clarifications.”The Pegasus row erupted on Sunday night after an international investigative consortium reported that India was among countries that used Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software to potentially target politicians, journalists and activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-impasse-may-continue-govt-eyes-bill-on-delhi-air-panel-101627063812289.html
24-07-2021||India||Rain fury sweeps through India||At least 60 people were reported dead and thousands displaced due to heavy rains in coastal Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa in the past two days, even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for the entire western coast over the weekend.In Maharashtra, which is the worst-hit state along the western coast, 57 people died in various rain-related incidents, including a landslide in Raigad district that claimed 36 lives with the district administration saying almost equal number of people were still feared strapped under the debris. In another landslide incident at Kevanale in Raigad’s Poladpur tehsil, 11 bodies were recovered during multi-agency rescue efforts, said state officials. According to police, 11 people on board a bus had a narrow escape in Kolhapur district as they were rescued just before the vehicle got washed away in a river.The IMD on Thursday night had warned of “very intense spells of short duration” over parts of western coast. On Friday, the entire western coast from Maharashtra to Kerala received very heavy rainfall with some receiving up to 600mm rain in four to five hours. Mahabaleshwar, a hill station in Maharashtra’s Satara district, recorded the highest ever rainfall in its history with 600mm in 24 hours. Many regions in Goa and north Karnataka received up to 300 mm, including Valpoi in North Goa district (296.2 mm) and Belagavi in Karnataka (278 mm).IMD has predicted heavy rainfall over the next five days.In Karnataka, Dr Manoj Rajan, commissioner, Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), said parts of Belagavi, Chikkamagaluru, Dharward, Haveri, Shivamogga and Uttara Kannada were the worst-hit regions in the state due to incessant rains over the past few days. The rivers Krishna, Cauvery, Tungabhadra, Bhima, Kapila (Kabini) and others in Malnad and coastal Karnataka were in spate due to heavy rains, said the KSDMA officer.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who reviewed the flood situation with top officials on Friday, directed all district in-charge ministers and MLAs to oversee relief work in their areas. He said the government would extend all necessary support to relief and rescue efforts and assist farmers who suffered losses due to the untimely rain and hailstorms.According to details shared by Rajan, 131 villages in 18 taluks were severely affected by floods, affecting 16,213 people. While three people lost their lives, two were missing, he said, adding that 65 bridges, 10 schools and a primary health centre were damaged, while 291.03 km of roads was washed away. So far, 8,733 people have been evacuated to safety while 4,964 people have been shifted to 80 relief camps. Landslides were reported in eight places, including Virajpet in Kodagu district and Arabail Ghat in Uttara Kannada district, the officer said.In Goa, the overnight heavy rainfall inundated houses, leaving hundreds stranded, snapped communication lines and disrupted rail and road traffic. Chief minister Dr Pramod Sawant inspected the flooded areas, including Bicholim taluka, and directed the officials to provide immediate assistance to people in distress. According to state officials, 23 people at Harvalem in Bicholim were rescued and brought to safety.A bridge in Paikul Sattari washed away, cutting the village off from the mainstream while at least three incidents of house collapse after being inundated by flood waters were reported from different parts of Goa.“Due to continuous and heavy rainfall, Mhadei has been overflowing. Water has entered different parts of Valpoi. People have faced immense hardship in Sattari,” health minister Vishwajit Rane, who represents the Valpoi constituency, said.A major accident was averted when the engine and a passenger coach of the Mangaluru Jn- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus Express Special (which was running on the diverted route via Madgaon-Londa-Miraj due to overflow of Vashishti river between Chiplun and Kamathe), were derailed between Dudhsagar-Sonaulim section in Goa along the steep slope of the Western Ghats.“No passenger casualty has been reported. The passengers of the affected coach were shifted to other coaches. The train is being pulled back to Kulem, and has crossed Sonaulim at this time,” the South Western Railway, said in a statement.Roads connectivity in Goa, north Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra were also been cut off due to landslides. Traffic on the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway remained suspended on Friday after part of the stretch inundated near Shiroli under Kolhapur district and Yamgarni village in Belgaum district. This prompted local police to block the vehicular traffic from crossing the stretch.According to Kolhapur superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade, water has started coming on the highway near Shiroli village. “As precaution, the road has been closed for vehicular traffic,” said Balkawade.Meanwhile, release of excess water in dams in Maharashtra and Karnataka has brought some relief in flooding areas even though it caused momentarily panic among people living downstream. Both Maharashtra and Karnataka governments issued warnings to people living downstream of rivers to be cautious of sudden flow of water from the dams. About 2.5 lakh cusec water was released from Almatti dam in Karnataka on Friday afternoon.In northern India, rains continued in parts of Uttarakand and Himachal Pradesh. Three children drowned in swollen rivers in Haldwani and Rudrapur areas of Kumaon in two separate incidents, police said. Although no casualty was reported from Himachal, rains caused landslides leading to blockade of traffic on several roads, officials said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-fury-sweeps-through-india-101627063749504.html
24-07-2021||India||Before polls, BSP woos Brahmins, says it will expedite temple work||The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Friday reached out to the Brahmin community in Uttar Pradesh as part of its effort to grow its traditional voter base (composed mostly of Dalits) ahead of next year’s elections in Uttar Pradesh.The party assured Brahmins that it would expedite the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya if it was voted to power in the assembly elections next year.To be sure, work on the temple has gone on apace since the Supreme Court’s late 2019 order allowing the construction of the temple at what many believe to be the birthplace of Hindu God Ram. Brahmins account for 13% of the state’s population but wield considerable influence. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which governs the state, recently inducted former Congress leader Jitin Prasada , a Brahmin leader, into its ranks.On Friday, launching a virtual statewide Brahmin conference in Ayodhya, BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra raised questions over the funding of the temple and what he saw as a delay in its construction.After the BSP was voted to power in 2007, the party constructed grand Dalit memorials at various spots in the state within one-and-half-years of forming the government, Mishra said.After the party forms the government in 2022, Mishra added, “the BSP government will ensure the completion of the construction of the Ram Temple at the earliest”.Accusing the BJP of politicising temple construction, Mishra said that Ram continued to remain in a makeshift temple even though the saffron party came to power at the Centre and state in 2014 and 2017 respectively.On March 25 last year, the deity was relocated from the makeshift temple to a pre-fabricated structure within the Ram Janmabhoomi premises. The ceremony which was held on the first day of the nine-day Navratri festival was attended by chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Mishra also accused the BJP of keeping “local mahants, sadhus and priests (in Ayodhya) who have been associated with the Ram Temple movement” out of the loop.Seeking more transparency in the construction work, Mishra alleged that the ruling party had deliberately slowed down the construction of the temple to serve its political interests.Reacting to Mishra’s allegations against the ruling party, BJP state unit spokesperson Sameer Singh said: “The BSP has been promoting the politics of caste in Uttar Pradesh. The party has nothing to do with the dignity of the Hindu community or development of Hindu holy places. The Ram Temple is a symbol of faith and pride of the Hindu community. The BJP government is committed to the construction of the grand temple and work is underway in full swing. The chief minister has launched several projects for the development of Ayodhya and other Hindu religious spots in the state.”The BSP national general secretary said the party will continue to hold Brahmin conferences at “holy places” including Mathura, Vrindavan, Varanasi, Chitrakoot and Shravasti, till October 15, adding that a massive one will be held in Lucknow.The BSP formed a majority government in 2007 with the support of Brahmins and had allocated important positions to members of the community in the government and party organisation, he said.Brahmins who constitute 13% of the state’s population, and Dalits who make up 23% of the population will ensure the formation of a majority BSP government again, he added.Mishra also alleged that the Brahmins had been sidelined and that there was an increase in “atrocities” against the community under the BJP government.“The time has come for t Brahmins to mull over their dignity, security and progress. They should support the BSP for a share in power,” he said.Political analyst and former head of Political Science Department, Lucknow University, Professor SK Dewedi, said: “BSP’s efforts to woo the Brahmin voters with Ram temple card before the upcoming assembly elections is not going to pay much dividend in the polls. The Dalit memorials constructed during the BSP government is already under probe due to irregularities. The social engineering formula which brought BSP to power in 2007, it is not likely to evoke the same response from voters in the 2022 assembly elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-polls-bsp-woos-brahmins-says-it-will-expedite-temple-work-101627063268806.html
24-07-2021||India||Chinese man gets bail in ₹1k-cr hawala case||A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to a Chinese national, who was allegedly living in India under a pseudonym and arrested for suspected cross-border money laundering worth at least ₹1,000 crore, because the central agency couldn’t establish the source of his “proceeds of crime” after six months.Charlie Peng, a 43-year-old man who birth name is allegedly Luo Sang, allegedly came to India in 2009 via Nepal and procured documents here fraudulently. In January, the ED arrested him along with his partner – Li Zhenghua alias Carter Lee -- under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Appearing for Peng, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa told additional sessions judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana that the Chinese national was languishing in jail for about 175 days though the central agency failed to ascertain the source of his funds through shell companies.“Peng has been running companies - OTA New Delhi Pvt Ltd (purchased in 2019) and Fin Black Rock (India) Pvt Ltd (purchased in 2018) and have been legally incorporated on the basis of genuine documents; these companies were doing legitimate business of custom clearance and consultancy business and are not indulged in any kind of illegal business,” said Pahwa.Peng was earlier arrested by Delhi Police in 2018 for allegedly living in India under a false identity. He was given bail within a month.Arguing that Peng was not a flight risk, Pahwa told the court that “he remained on bail for two years in the 2018 case and never misused the liberty granted to him”.Opposing the bail, ED prosecutor Mohammad Faraz said that “Peng came illegally to India and started residing in Delhi from where he applied for a passport on the basis of forged and fabricated PAN card and Aadhar Card, but his application was rejected.”Peng eventually got an Indian passport after he married a girl from Manipur.Raising concerns that Peng may flee the country, Faraz said the ED was investigating the end use and last mile connectivity of the money trail as the probe is solely not based on documentary evidence. He added that the ED has identified at least 151 entities, so far, that have been used for money laundering.The judge, however, rejected ED’s contention and allowed Peng to be released on bail on two sureties of ₹1 lakh each and asked him to surrender his passport before the court.Rana agreed with Pahwa’s argument that the investigation conducted so far by the ED does not reveal the source of the “proceeds of crime”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-man-gets-bail-in-1k-cr-hawala-case-101627063028769.html
24-07-2021||India||7 booked for shaving off Dalit man’s moustache in UP||Saharanpur Police have registered a case against seven persons for allegedly assaulting a Dalit man and shaving off his moustache in a barber shop in Deoband area of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh.Confirming the same, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Saharanpur, S Channappa, said a search is underway to arrest the accused. “Hopefully, a few of the named accused will be arrested by tonight,” he added.In his complaint, the victim, Rajat, alleged that the incident took place on Monday in Shimlana village. Rajat said he was cornered by the accused persons, Neeraj Rana, Mokam Rana, Monty Rana, Satyam Rana, Rupanty Rana and Sandeep Rana, all of whom belong to the Thakur community, and was forcibly taken to a barber shop.The accused then directed the barber, Rajendra, to shave off the Dalit man’s moustache, saying that it is a symbol of pride and can only be worn by those belonging to the upper caste, the complainant said. The accused also passed casteist remarks at him, he added.A purported video of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed Rajat surrounded by some men as the barber shaved off his moustache. The Dalit man was seen murmering something with folded hands.Following this, a case under sections 147, 323 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code and SC/ST Act was registered against the accused, including the barber, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-booked-for-shaving-off-dalit-man-s-moustache-in-up-101627062848789.html
24-07-2021||India||Ghaziabad assault video case: K’taka HC quashes UP police notice to Twitter exec||The Karnataka high court on Friday canceled a notice by the Uttar Pradesh police that ordered Bengaluru-based Twitter India managing director Manish Maheshwari to appear in person for questioning in connection with the video of an assault of an elderly man in Ghaziabad’s Loni in June, and told the police to either record his statement as a witness via video conference or send a team to Bengaluru.The high court said the notice issued to Maheshwari under Section 41A of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) must be read as a notice under Section 160. A notice under Section 160 is sent to question a witness, who they believe may be aware of facts related to a complaint. A notice under section 41A, however, is sent to summon a party named in a complaint. Maheshwari interpreted the change in the section under which he was being summoned to imply that he could also be arrested and approached the high court against it.“The provisions of the statute cannot be permitted to become tools of harassment. The respondent has not placed even an iota of material which would prima facie show involvement of the petitioner. In that view of the matter, the petitioner has made out a case. Section 41A notice is issued by malafide and the petition is maintainable. The Annexure A1 notice is quashed”, justice G Narender said in his order.“The invocation of Section 41A was resorted to as an arm-twisting method after Maheshwari did not respond to initial notice under Section 160 CrPC,” the bench observed.The judge noted that Maheshwari was not arraigned as an accused in the case registered by the Ghaziabad police on June 15 over a video that alleged an elderly Muslim man in Ghaziabad was a victim of hate crime. Police said their investigation later revealed that the incident was over a personal dispute and booked nine people, including Twitter India, for allegedly circulating false information to fan communal tension.The UP Police initially summoned Maheshwari as a witness on June 17 after a first information report (FIR) was registered over the video but later served another notice under Section 41A after he told the police to record his statement over video conference. The Karnataka high court, which, on June 24, granted him interim protection from arrest, was earlier scheduled to pronounce its judgment on July 13, which was further deferred to July 20, and then to July 22. The judgment is now expected to be pronounced on Friday.Friday’s Karnataka high court also found merit in Maheshwari’s contention that the firm and its employees do not have control over the data of Twitter users.“Material placed on record demonstrates that the entity, Twitter India, is an independent entity and the control of the affairs of the company is in the hands of Twitter Ireland. The information available cannot be said to be indicating that petitioner controlling the contents of the social media platforms run by Twitter Inc”, the high court noted.During the hearings, Manish Maheshwari described Twitter India as an independent entity, claiming that its parent company, Twitter Inc, does not have a single share in it.“Twitter Inc is a parent company. We have absolutely nothing to do with it. Twitter India is an independent organisation and independent institution,” CV Nagesh, Maheshwari’s counsel, told the court when asked whether the social media giant could be called a “parent company.”The FIR against Twitter came against the backdrop of the central government’s escalating conflict with Twitter over compliance with a new set of rules notified in February that demanded extra due diligence from social media intermediaries.On June 16, the central government said Twitter will not be protected from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third party content unless it follows the new Information Technology (IT) rules. The social media firm finally appointed a resident grievance officer and chief compliance officer earlier this month apart from releasing the first transparency report mandated by the rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghaziabad-assault-video-case-k-taka-hc-quashes-up-police-notice-to-twitter-exec-101627060628555.html
24-07-2021||India||Mufti’s kin, separatists, J&K leaders on latest Pegasus list||Phone numbers of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s family, Kashmiri politicians, separatist leaders and journalists were selected as possible targets for phone surveillance between 2017 and 2019, online news portal The Wire said on Friday.The Wire, part of a 17-member global investigative media consortium, reported that two family members of Mufti were found on a list of people who could potentially be targeted by Pegasus, an Israeli military grade spyware to infiltrate phones for snooping and surveillance.Their names were chosen months before Mufti’s coalition government collapsed after the Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support.Sharing the link of The Wire’s story, Mufti said in a tweet: “A spyware used against terrorists has been weaponised to deal with political opponents & dissenters. BJP has taken a leaf out of how Britishers would suspect & treat Indians during the colonial era. GOI has gone rogue & is brazenly subverting basic human rights.”Mufti, who is now a trenchant critic of the BJP and part of an alliance pushing for the restoration of the region’s statehood and special status, told The Wire that surveillance, as a concept, was not new for Kashmiris.To be sure, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. In the absence of digital forensics of specific devices, it is not possible to conclusively establish that the phones linked to these numbers were hacked.In all, about 25 people from the region were found on the list of potential targets, the website said.Also on the list was separatist leader and Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, separatist leader Bilal Lone and former Delhi University professor SAR Geelani. Forensic analysis found traces of Pegasus software on Lone and Geelani’s phones, The Wire reported.“Hacking into people’s phone for surveillance, is a willful and direct violation of the universally acknowledged fundamental right to privacy a basic human right and those involved in it should be tried,” a Hurriyat spokesman said.J&K Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari’s brother Tariq Bukhari was also found on the list of potential suspects between 2017 and 2019. Bukhari was one of the 14 Kashmiri leaders who attended a landmark meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.At least five Kashmiri journalists were named as well.The Pegasus row erupted on Sunday night after the consortium reported that India was among countries that used Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software to potentially target politicians, journalists and activists.The first report alleged that 38 Indian journalists, including three current Hindustan Times staffers and one from sister publication Mint, were among 180 journalists potentially targeted worldwide. Subsequent reports said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and two sitting Union ministers – including Vaishnaw -- were on the list of potential targets.The allegations roiled Parliament. The government as well as the BJP refused any wrongdoing and insisted that India had a well-established protocol for tapping telephones and it was used only for national security. But the Opposition called for a separate probe into the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muftis-kin-separatists-j-k-leaders-on-latest-pegasus-list-101627060568595.html
24-07-2021||India||It’s treason: Rahul on snooping row; targets PM, Shah||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah of using Pegasus spyware against “India, its institutions and its democracy”, and said that the only word for this is “treason”.He added every phone that he uses is tapped and demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe and Shah’s resignation.“Pegasus is classified by the Israeli state as a weapon and that weapon is supposed to be used against terrorists. The prime minister and the home minister have used this weapon against the Indian state and our institutions. They have used it politically...”Also Read | Ensure justice, in the courts and beyond“The home minister should resign and a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court should be conducted against Narendra Modi as no one else can authorise the use of Pegasus… only the prime minister and home minister can authorise its use.” He described himself as an “open book” and said he is not intimidated. Gandhi added he and his friends have been informed by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) that tapping is being done.“I get phone calls from IB people who tap my phone. They call me up and say please be aware we are tapping your phone.” He added his security people have to report to their seniors everything he says. “So I am under no pretension that my phone is not tapped,” Gandhi said his phone has been tapped three-four times.He called the alleged use of the spyware an “attack on the voice of the people”. Gandhi added it is not just a matter of his privacy. “It (his phone) is not a potential target; my phone is tapped. It is clearly tapped. So, it is not a potential target.” He only the corrupt people fear Modi. “But if you are not corrupt, you will not fear Modi… you tend to laugh.”Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore dared Gandhi to submit his phone for investigation if he believes it was tapped and insisted that no one’s phone has been tapped illegally.Rathore said the Congress is determined to stall Parliament for one reason or another after being rejected twice by people in Lok Sabha polls of 2014 and 2019.The government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the spyware. NSO Group has on multiple occasions said that it offers services only to vetted government clients. The company has disputed the leaked list of numbers as those potentially targeted by its clients.Congress’s Pawan Khera said, “The defence being put up by the Government and the BJP is worse than the silence of the PM.’’ Reiterating their demand for a judicial inquiry, Khera pointed out that other countries had ordered one as revelations from the consortium of journalists surfaced. “The French cabinet has met to discuss the investigation on the Pegasus-Gate; As we speak the Mexican Government has already launched an investigation; As we speak the Israeli Government has already ordered an enquiry and is looking at reviewing the export rules for NSO’s Pegasus. If not anything, this adds to the credibility of the expose,’’ he said.The leaked database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices associated with 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of the 37, 10 were in India.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-treason-no-other-word-for-this-rahul-gandhi-on-pegasus-project-101627036027107.html

24-07-2021||Today's||Needed: Gender inclusivity in the Indian armed forces||While many institutions in the country have become far more gender-inclusive, one which has been slow off the mark is the armed forces, especially the Army. This is why the government’s recent statement, in response to a public interest litigation petition in the Supreme Court, that it is not averse to women joining military colleges such as the National Defence Academy is a welcome step forward. If this happens, it could be a game-changer.In the 1.4-million-strong Indian Army, women constitute a minuscule 0.56%, while the corresponding figure is 1.08% in the Air Force and 6.5% in the Navy.While many senior male Army officers say that, in principle, they are not against more women coming into the forces and even moving into combat roles, they cite several reasons why this is still impractical. Among the reasons are the low acceptance of women in leadership roles among male soldiers, the vulnerability of women soldiers to sexual harassment, physical fitness limitations, and the lack of infrastructure such as separate sleeping arrangements and toilets. One Major General spoke of the vast resources which would have to be commandeered to make the forces gender-friendly. He also felt women officers would seek privileges such as easier postings which could lead to resentment. None of this, strikingly, is the fault of women; yet they are excluded. The objections stem from the inability or the unwillingness of the male-dominated establishment to accept more women breaching the bastion.I spoke to various women officers, among them Captain (retd) Yashica Hatwal Tyagi, who was posted at the ordnance base during the Kargil War while she was five months pregnant. She feels that the objections to women joining in combat positions are ridiculous. “Women don’t need to be mollycoddled, and I don’t believe this theory that men will not accept a woman’s leadership. I know from experience that if you deliver on your job, you will be as respected as I was. Yes, we need infrastructure improvements, but more than that, we need a mindset change. We cannot be caught in a zero-error syndrome in the case of women in the forces.” A serving woman Lieutenant Colonel (who did not want to be named) agrees with this. “All the objections raised are not insurmountable. I have gone on night patrols, managed issues like uncomfortable sleeping quarters and sanitation facilities. I find the objections to expanding the role of women in the forces immature. As for physical fitness, it depends on your training. I don’t believe for a moment that women cannot fare well in combat roles, these are old shibboleths which refuse to go away.”Former Army chief VP Malik is all for change, but gradually. He feels that conditions have to be “conducive” before women can move to combat roles. He feels that when the time comes, women should compete on merit and not expect any concessions. Another woman Army officer dismissed the idea that women wading into a largely male bastion leave them open to sexual harassment. “It is not as though other professions are immune to sexual harassment. This is just an excuse.”At present, women cannot join the armoured corps, infantry, mechanised infantry and artillery. Says Captain Tyagi, “More women than ever are ready for the armed forces, but are the armed forces ready for them?”lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/needed-gender-inclusivity-in-the-indian-armed-forces-101627137975587.html
24-07-2021||Today's||Olympics and the art of competitive swimming||A hundred and twenty-five years ago, in 1896, a Hungarian named Alfréd Hajós dived into the icy waters of the Bay of Zea, off the coast of Greece, to become the first modern Olympic champion that the world had ever seen. It was the very first modern Olympics; there was no swimming pool; there were no hi-tech walls to track time in milliseconds; and there were no hydrodynamic swimsuits. There was, simply, the swimmer and the open waters of the Athenian sea.Carrying the misfortune of his father who died from drowning, Hajós conquered the water in a way that no competitive swimmer had done thus far, at the mercy of freezing temperatures and the sea.Over a century later, the sport has advanced in more ways than one. Mark Spitz, Michael Phelps, Ian Thorpe, Joseph Schooling, Stephanie Rice, and more recently, Caeleb Dressel and Katie Ledecky are household names to many aspiring swimmers who aim to fill their shoes.As the Tokyo Olympics get underway, swimmers from across the world will dive into the Olympic pool at Tokyo’s Aquatics Centre. The stadium, which can host 15,000 people, will, however, not be open to spectators. Despite fans being a major support system for all sports, once swimmers bend over the block with a firm grip and indomitable spirit, and hear the words “take your mark” followed by a swift whistle, they hit the water, and from that moment right till the end, it’s just the player and the blue. The competitors can’t hear a thing.As creatures of land, to most human beings, the water is alien — even intimidating. Everything we do, we do on land. So, when the world watched Spitz in the 1970s test the very limits of an athlete in water and then, at the turn of the millennium, Phelps stretch the boundaries of human potential even further, it was extraordinary.Like most sport, swimming is based on precision movement. Professional swimmers know the exact number of strokes they need to make to give their best time for all the events and every type of stroke — be it freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke or butterfly. However, what sets the sport apart is the fact that it isn’t just a race against other swimmers, it is a battle with the water that they swim in as well.In that sense, swimming is a curious sport. For every stroke, swimmers make adjustments in technique based on their centre of gravity to ensure buoyancy. Then, they must conjure up the power in their arms and legs to propel them forward and create a rhythm in their movement. However, with every move, they create waves around themselves. These waves help them move forward, but also slow them down. The “drag” (as it is called) impacts the speed of swimmers in water that is said to be nearly 800 times denser than the air. While sport has no enemies, swimming does — and it most certainly is the drag.Every breath swimmers take has the power to increase their time. Ergo, the fewer breaths they take, the faster they are likely to be. Swimming not only challenges athletes by putting them in unfavourable conditions that are attempting to slow them down, but it also goes against the very function that keeps us alive — breathing.As a former professional swimmer who represented the then united Andhra Pradesh, I believe that India has a lot to be proud of this year. The country will cheer on Sajan Prakash, Srihari Nataraj, and Maana Patel at the Olympics. It is the first time Indian swimmers (Prakash and Nataraj) have directly qualified for the Games, by achieving the Olympic qualification time (OQT) or the “A” cut. Patel qualified through the universality quota, which allows one male and one female athlete of a country to compete in the Olympics, if no other player of the same gender qualifies.Tokyo is expected to witness some of the finest swimming ever, as favourites from the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are set to dominate the Games, but this won’t change the fact that India, now, more than ever before, can make a dent in the sport.In India, however, swimming isn’t a mainstream sport. An “A” list qualification seemed impossible, until now. Prakash and Nataraj have proved that, in sport, nothing quite is. Breaching goals and eclipsing the past has been taking place consistently since competitive sport began. And India has the potential, and most certainly, the numbers. Nataraj, Patel and Prakash have proved that the underdogs deserve a shot. And as Michael Phelps, the GOAT (greatest of all time), said, “The making of a champion is mostly mental.” India should dive head-first into the sport and invest in it. Great things await us.marika.gabriel@htdigital.inThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/olympics-and-the-art-of-competitive-swimming-101627135095384.html
24-07-2021||Today's||Project Pegasus: India is at the crossroads||A network of global media organisations, assisted by a network of global civil society organisations, came together to reveal a list of potential targets for surveillance last week. To be sure, the list is only of potential targets; only a fraction of devices have been subjected to forensic analysis and only some of them were infected or hacked; and there is no information available about the source of the leaked list. But it was not just the possible surveillance (which, in itself, is deeply problematic) but the technology that was potentially deployed that has shaken India’s public sphere.Pegasus, developed by NSO and sold to “vetted governments”, takes over phones, and can track every element — messages, contacts, call logs, social media activity, app passwords, browsing history, and calls and offline conversations with access to camera and microphone. It can even be used to introduce material, which can then be used as evidence against the subject, as has been alleged in the Bhima Koregaon case.While surveillance is legal in India under defined procedures, hacking is not — and this makes the use of Pegasus illegal. The government has so far relied on a defence that hinges on due process of surveillance, without telling citizens if Pegasus has indeed been procured by the Indian State and deployed against Indian citizens. Only a fair probe can get to the bottom of the source of the hack, and the government should launch one if it wants to clear its name — for the circumstantial evidence at the moment is weighed against it. After all, the political executive had the most to gain from information about Opposition figures; those at the centre of the rift within the Central Bureau of Investigation; journalists who were either working on a particular story, or were in a position of influence, or were at the intersection of multiple information networks; ministers; business executives; activists; a Supreme Court (SC) judge who has not been named so far; and the woman who accused the then Chief Justice of India (CJI), Ranjan Gogoi, of sexual harassment.Still, all theories of the source of the hack are speculative and motive alone isn’t a sufficient basis to arrive at a conclusion. It is entirely possible that the government hasn’t attempted this intrusion into citizen’s lives and rights. In that case, it represents a cyber attack against India and its citizens by either a foreign government or a private agency (if it got access to the tech). All three scenarios (Indian government, foreign government, a State-enabled or non-State private agency) are deeply disturbing.While there is a dominant view that citizens don’t care about privacy as an electoral issue and, therefore, the issue will fade, this is too simplistic a reading. The revelations will shake Indian politics, particularly at the elite level, in six different ways.One, there will be a subtle shift in the relationships within the Bharatiya Janata Party, between the top leadership and ministers, and between the party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah’s dominance comes from their electoral success — and, therefore, the rest of the party and ideological fraternity, even when uncomfortable with the centralisation of power, stays quiet to reap the dividends of power. But this discomfort will now turn to suspicion, for both ministers and Sangh leaders are acutely aware that their moves may be watched. This may play out, behind the scenes, in assessing the implications of unbridled power of a few. It may also, alternatively, lead to a further consolidation of power given the fear that has seeped through the rest of the party machine.Two, the relationship between the political executive and the bureaucracy will shift. While officials were already circumspect about articulating any discomfort with government policy, the culture of fear will get even more entrenched. This fear will reduce the space for open discussions, including critical viewpoints, within the government; it will also make bureaucrats more sceptical of sharing these viewpoints outside the system, especially with the media, for who knows who is listening and watching.Three, it will change the relationship within and among Opposition parties. They can no longer rely on the ubiquitous mobile phone to discuss strategies, ticket distribution, finances, alliance possibilities and parliamentary tactics. At the elite level, expect a shift to secure platforms (till those secure platforms, as is the nature of technology, become vulnerable themselves). At another level, independent political mobilisation, particularly against the government, may become more difficult to organise.Four, the revelations will have an impact on the relationship between the executive and the judiciary. It is not clear how CJI NV Ramana plans to take up the matter — there are demands for a SC-monitored probe; there is also a public interest litigation; and some whose names have been listed are contemplating going to court. Given that the government itself is a possible accused in the matter, the judiciary will have to eventually step in. How it responds will determine the balance of power in the system.Five, there is the possibility of a legislature-executive reset. Manish Tewari, writing in these pages, highlighted the need for bringing intelligence agencies under legislative oversight. This is long due. It will still not lead to complete transparency, for the operational requirements of national security agencies will be prioritised. But it will open the door for classified briefings to people’s representatives and offer an opportunity to ask questions of those who operate largely beyond scrutiny at the moment.And finally, most importantly, the revelations have disturbed the social contract between the State and citizens. At the root, the terms of the contract are simple. It is a nasty and brutish world out there. To ensure security and keep order — and to guarantee rights and ensure justice — citizens surrender a share of their natural rights to the State. The State exercises it for these mutually agreed upon ends, and in a democracy, the aim is to expand rather than circumvent liberty, except when necessary as defined by law.Indian citizens, through the Constitution, gave the State power and subjected their own rights to restrictions. But they have not handed over the keys of their private and professional lives, even their political lives, to the State. If there is indeed any government involvement in the dark practices that Pegasus represents, it is undoubtedly a breach of contract and a violation of the Constitution.India is at the crossroads. It can either use this moment to recommit itself to individual liberty or live in denial, and turn into a more fearful and closed society where independent thought itself is jeopardised. It has to choose well. letters@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/project-pegasus-india-is-at-the-crossroads-101627135036322.html
24-07-2021||Today's||The PM’s silence on Danish Siddiqui is distressing||Did the prime minister (PM) make a mistake in not publicly expressing his sorrow at the horrible death of photojournalist, Danish Siddiqui? From the government, there has only been one tweet by the information and broadcasting minister and a statement of condemnation by the foreign secretary. But Narendra Modi’s silence is different. He’s often the first to tweet. And he does so frequently. So, when he chooses not to, his reticence attracts attention. Questions are bound to be asked.Now I accept that it’s Modi’s prerogative to decide when to comment and when to desist. No one can force him. But ought that apply to the PM of India? And, particularly, when one of his countrymen has been tragically killed? I accept that the PM can’t comment on everything that happens, although it often seems that he does, but was Siddiqui’s killing just one more death or one of particular significance? Let’s start with that question.Within hours, the president of Afghanistan, the president of the United States and the secretary-general of the United Nations publicly expressed their deep sorrow. Even the Taliban, which stands accused of the killing, said that it was sorry. Both in India and internationally, major media institutions carried obituaries, accompanied by glowing praise and even a collection of Siddiqui’s prize-winning photographs. The BBC devoted five minutes of its news bulletin. The Washington Post, almost a full page. And every single Indian paper and television channel that I regularly read or see did the same.Remember, Siddiqui was no ordinary photojournalist. He won the prestigious Pulitzer in 2018. His searing images of Rohingya suffering in refugee camps in Bangladesh or of the horrific catastrophe of the second Covid-19 wave in India translated dry stories into vivid and unforgettable pictures. His work made the written word real.But that’s not all. More importantly, he was one of us. The blood that flowed in his veins was the same as yours and mine. He may have worked for Reuters but he was, arguably, India’s greatest news photographer. Certainly the best known and most highly regarded. So if the world felt the need to mourn his death, how come his own PM did not?This brings me to my second question: Could it be Siddiqui’s memorable photographs that sealed the PM’s lips? Did he decide not to comment on the death of a journalist whose work conveyed to the world the full and unexpurgated horror of the second wave? Or a photographer whose images revealed — far more starkly and shockingly than any written commentary — how false and hollow were India’s boasts — including the PM’s own at the World Economic Conference — that India had defeated the coronavirus? If Siddiqui had made his name photographing Holi milans, the evening aarti in Varanasi and sunsets at Kanyakumari, might the PM’s Twitter handle have spoken?To his partymen, supporters and admirers, these are, no doubt, hurtful questions, but millions of his countrymen are asking them. It doesn’t burnish his image that they are. Should that not be of concern?Let me then come to a third question. It is the most depressing of all, but the fact it’s being asked could also make it the most pertinent. Was the PM silent because Siddiqui was Muslim? No one other than Modi can answer, though many will have their suspicions. Indeed, some probably have no doubt at all.Let me respond differently. If the Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer had been called Devinder Sharma, would anyone in the Bharatiya Janata Party have ignored his death at the hands of the Taliban? Suppose his name was Dharam Singh? Or, even, Desmond Sequeira? Would his death have been received in silence?Each of you will answer these questions as you wish to, but from the way that I have asked them, you know mine. And this is why I’m sad and upset. It’s not Modi’s silence that’s distressing. But it is disturbing that our PM had nothing to say.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-pm-s-silence-on-danish-siddiqui-is-distressing-101627135035206.html
