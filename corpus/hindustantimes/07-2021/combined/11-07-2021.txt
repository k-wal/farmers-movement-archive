11-07-2021||Mumbai||Rain spell to intensify, Mumbai placed under orange alert||Despite predictions of heavy rains starting Saturday, the city received just 45.6mm of rain in the 48 hours ending 8.30am Sunday, followed by 2.4mm rain in the next eight hours. India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials confirmed that there has been a delay in the onset of showers, which are now expected to arrive sometime on Monday. Heavy rains will continue intermittently for the rest of week, meteorologists said. IMD has placed the city under an orange category warning system, indicating heavy to very heavy showers are “very likely”.The delay in the onset of predicted showers has been attributed to the formation of an east-west shear zone, an area filled by opposing winds, over north Konkan coast. According to at least two independent meteorologists, this has inhibited rain bands lying off Mumbai coast from penetrating inland, leading to lesser-than-anticipated rainfall over the city. However, such a phenomenon typically strengthens monsoon conditions.Officials and experts clarified that rains have not skipped the city and are likely to arrive very soon under the influence of a low-pressure area forming in the Bay of Bengal and an upper air cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea. Over the next four to five days, Mumbai may receive as much as 400mm of rain. “Mumbai will start getting showers soon. It is going to be the wettest week of the season so far. From Today till Wednesday/Thursday, total rainfall is likely to exceed 400mm. We will have a 12-hour period with 200mm rainfall which will lead to waterlogging,” said an independent meteorologist on Sunday morning. “Mumbai-MMR [Mumbai Metropolitan Region] can expect moderate showers on July 11. Current forecast suggests moderate to heavy rain in the region on July 12, which can cause waterlogging and usual disruptions. Overall active next week for the monsoon,” tweeted Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist affiliated with the University of Reading, England.The city has so far seen 1,109mm rain since June 1, which is around 37% in excess of the seasonal normal of 801mm. However, since July 1, the city has recorded largely deficient rains at a departure of more than -80% of the normal rainfall for the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rain-spell-to-intensify-mumbai-placed-under-orange-alert-101626028178763.html

11-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra authorities focus on eight districts of concern||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 8,535 Covid-19 cases and 156 deaths due to the infection. While most parts of the state have reported a decline in the number of cases, eight districts — Kolhapur, Satara, Palghar, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Pune (rural) and Sangli — continued to record high number of cases and have also reported a high testing positivity rate. The district administrations have been directed to go for aggressive testing and screening to contain the infection and the test positivity rate. The large number of cases in eight districts has kept the daily caseload in the state hovering at 8,000-9,000 for the past month. On Sunday, Kolhapur recorded 1,468 new cases, while Sangli saw the addition of 1,097 new Covid-19 patients. Satara and Ratnagiri recorded 755 and 455 new cases, respectively. Pune with its rural areas and Pimpri-Chinchwad saw 1,072 new cases on Sunday.The eight most affected districts have the highest number of active cases. Kolhapur has 19,034 active cases, Sangli has 11,717, Satara 8,505, Kolhapur 13,157, while Ratnagiri has 3,569 active infections.All these districts have a high case fatality rate (CFR), above the state rate of 2.04% .Kolhapur is at top with 2.9%. Sangli (2.7%), Solapur (2.6%), Satara (2.4%), Sindhudurg (2.4%). According to state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, the administration has taken a twin approach. “We are identifying the hotspots in these districts, say some particular area and mass testing the population there. We are isolating the positive patients from the rest of the population to stop the transmission,” said Dr Awate.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state-appointed task force, said that local administrations in these districts have been directed to go for micro-containment, besides aggressive screening and testing. Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, blames the Covid-19 inappropriate behaviour of locals for the rise in cases. “The people in these areas have thrown caution to the wind and are not using masks, neither are they observing social distancing. There should be strict enforcement of rules,” said Shaikh.On Sunday, Mumbai saw 558 new cases and 15 deaths, as its toll reached 15,627. The total deaths in Maharashtra since the outbreak last year has reached 125,878. State’s case tally touched 6,157,799. There were 210,411 tests done on Tuesday, while the number of recoveries clocked 6,013.The number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 116,165. Pune tops in active cases with 19,034 patients, followed by Thane with 16,626 active patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-authorities-focus-on-eight-districts-of-concern-101626028058799.html

The move will benefit the residents of sectors 43 and 44, and Chhalera village, officials said on Sunday.The residents have been complaining about the frequent choking of sewer line in the area.The authority officials said that the plot where the old sewer line was laid in 1990 will now house a residential project. “Now, we are laying a new pipeline so that residents do not face any issues. The project cost has been estimated at ₹2.10 crore,” said AK Varun, project engineer of the Noida authority.The authority started work on this project in the last week of June with a deadline of March, 2022. “But we will try to finish the work before the deadline,” said Varun.Meanwhile, the residents of Chhalera have demanded that the authority should also replace the village’s internal sewer without further delay.“Choking of sewer is a regular feature in our village because the population has increased manifold since 1990. We have complained to the authority several times. Now, we hope that our area’s internal sewer line will also be replaced,” said Ishwar Singh, former village head of Chhalera.The authority is diverting the 1-km sewer line from Sector 43 land to the roadside. “Now, we are laying the sewer line along the road that will make the cleaning work easier,” said Varun.The residents of sectors 43 and 44 also hope that the project will benefit them. “We hope that the frequent choking of sewer will be a thing of past once the new sewer line is laid,” said Deepak Mittal, a resident of Sector 43.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-upgrades-master-sewer-line-in-sector-43-to-address-choking-issues-101626027758068.html
11-07-2021||Other||Martin Bell, relic of a bygone era at La Martiniere College, to undergo restoration||Lucknow After more than 100 years of silence, the great bell known as the Martin Bell at the La Martiniere College, was raised from its pedestal for examination on Sunday, according to a post by principal Carlyle McFarland on Facebook. He also shared video clips to give everyone a glimpse of how it was raised. “There was no gong attached to the bell. Despite a giant crack, a handheld hammer produced a clear peal. Now to get the gong replaced and a system of elevation installed for the bell to ring on special occasions,” McFarland’s post said. “The bell is known to have been installed in the North Tower of the Constantia palace in which La Martiniere College is now run. This was known as bell tower and could only be accessed from within the building,” the principal said. The bell was rung in an emergency. It is recorded that instructions were given for the bell to be rung in case of any attack during the turbulent times of 1857, when Constantia palace was roughly fortified, he said. Principal McFarland said the bell was cast in the arsenal of the Nawab of Oudh in 1796 under the erstwhile Lt Col Claude Martin (later Maj Gen) when he was appointed by the East India Company as its superintendent. For political reasons, he supervised the production of weapons for both the Nawab’s army and the forces of the East India Company. The arsenal was situated at Kothi Hayat Baksh, the current Raj Bhawan. The basement of this structure still exhibits signs of its original use. Carlyle McFarland said, “For decades the bell was placed on a wooden stand in the crypt of Constantia. The gong was removed at some time. At the turn of the 20th century, it was relocated as a garden embellishment on the East Terrace. This coincided with the positioning of the cannons on the East Terrace, the central canon also being cast under Maj Gen Claude Martin and used in the Third Mysore War.” “The bell is being examined and its specifications noted. A large crack indicates damage over the centuries, yet when rung by a makeshift hand held hammer, the sound produced was true,” he said. The principal has assured that the position of the bell would not be changed. A chain pulley mechanism would be used on special solemn occasions when the bell would be formally used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/martin-bell-relic-of-a-bygone-era-at-la-martiniere-college-to-undergo-restoration-101626027698757.html
11-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Activists oppose plan for underground multi-level parking at Ambedkar Park||Ghaziabad: The activists have opposed the move for development of a multi-level parking at city’s Ambedkar Park which is located in the heart of major commercial centre of Navyug Market. The officials of the Ghaziabad municipal-corporation said that the parking is proposed at a cost of ₹44 crore and meant for providing parking facility for about 235 cars. The Ambedkar Park is one of the biggest parks in the old Ghaziabad city and developed in times when the erstwhile Ghaziabad Improvement Trust (now Ghaziabad development authority (GDA)) developed the Navyug Market scheme and later handed it over to the corporation for maintenance. The park is located close to the headquarters of the GDA and also of the municipal corporation. The activists said that the proposed parking will mean change in nature of the park, and they will oppose the move and resort to legal recourse if the project goes through. Councilor Rajendra Tyagi from ward 84 has also submitted a representation to the GDA while opposing the move and demanded that the facility should be developed elsewhere and not at the park. “The construction on an area reserved for park alters and destroys the very character of the plan of the scheme. Parking will be a commercial activity at a green area. The municipal corporation is only a maintenance agency and is tasked under law to only maintain an area handed over to it by the authority. It cannot tamper with the plan or the character of the plan,” Tyagi, said. “The power of amendment of a plan vests with the development authority and not with the municipal-corporation. So, it is demanded that the parking project should be shifted elsewhere, otherwise we will move court,” he added further. Municipal-commissioner MS Tanwar said that they have sent a detailed project report of the project under the state smart city scheme to the state administration. “We searched for many places and could not find desired land for the multi-level parking. Finally, we came across the big Ambedkar Park and proposed that part of its area will be used for our underground multi-level parking for about 235 cars. The project is pegged at ₹44 crore, and the surface area of the park will be restored in original form. We also plan to develop facilities like cafe etc,” Tanwar said. “The DPR has been sent and we are waiting for its approval. The construction is proposed to be taken up by C&DS (construction and design services, a unit of UP Jal Nigam),” he added. He added that keeping the sentiments of people in mind, the parking will be named as ‘Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Multilevel Parking.’ Environmentalists said that even if the corporation has proposed underground parking, it will affect the very purpose of the park. “A park helps recharge of vast quantities of groundwater and change in its nature will affect the recharge system and also the ecology. Further, the nature of parking will be commercial which will require change in the land use of the park. There is also an order of the UP government (in 2018) which says that construction of only 5% of the area of the park shall be allowed but only for purposes like public convenience, footpath etc,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. The officials of the GDA said that they received representation from councillor Tyagi and waiting for a proposal for the parking from the corporation. “If they are developing a basement parking, it does not alter land use and does not amount to change in land use. Further, the surface park should be maintained, and the map approval is also required to be cleared from the GDA. The ownership of the park is with GDA, and it handed it over to the corporation only for maintenance purpose. So, all modalities will be checked up once we receive a proposal for the parking at Ambedkar Park,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner of the Ghaziabad development authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-activists-oppose-plan-for-underground-multi-level-parking-at-ambedkar-park-101626027698122.html
11-07-2021||Noida||Yamuna water quality worsening, shows UPPCB data||Noida: The condition of the Yamuna has worsened this year as the river enters Noida with no dissolved oxygen in it and exits the city even more polluted, shows data from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). As per the latest UPPCB report, Noida is the only city in Uttar Pradesh where the Yamuna falls under “E” category, that makes the river unfit for drinking even after conventional treatment and disinfection, bathing or survival of fish and other aquatic organisms.While the UPPCB report does not mention the data for industrial effluents like amount of hard metals -- mercury, arsenic, lead, etc. -- the state pollution body has tested water on basic parameters -- dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) -- and found the pollution levels very high.According to the data, in May 2021, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level of Yamuna was nil at Okhla barrage (from where the river enters Noida) and at Tilwada village (where it leaves the city), while the same in May 2020 was 7.4 milligrams per litre (mg/l) at the entry point and 2.8 mg/l at the exit. The minimum requirement of DO is 4 mg/l for category D (propagation of aquatic life) water and 6 mg/l for category A (drinking). Similarly, the UPPCB report found the BOD levels for May 2021 to be 24 mg/l (entry) and 31.5 mg/l (exit), while the corresponding figures in May 2020 were 12 mg/l and 27mg/l. At the exit point, the BOD levels are over 10 times the permissible limits of up to 3 mg/l.According to official figures, the length of the Yamuna in Delhi is 22 km while it is about 10 km in Noida.Till May this year, January has been the only month when the river entered the city at Okhla barrage with some life in it with the DO value of 1.4 mg/l, which died at Tilwada where it meets even the more polluted Hindon. The two rivers support no aquatic life. The officials blame “untapped sewage” from Shahdara drain that enters from Delhi for the poor condition of Yamuna, besides additional pollutants from Kondli drain and Hindon river. “Shahdara drain from Delhi meets the Yamuna after Okhla barrage near Sector 15A. The drain is untapped and brings effluents that fall directly into the river. It is the major source of pollution. Besides, there is Kondli drain that also originates in Delhi, but work on its remediation is under process in Noida through engineered wetlands. Then Hindon water that is very polluted falls in the Yamuna. The pollutants in the source drains vary from time to time,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. According to environmentalists, honest efforts are missing to revive the Yamuna in the NCR. “Shahdara drain is one of the major sources of pollution. There are no honest efforts to clean the Yamuna in Delhi where a number of untapped sewage is being discharged into it. At the same time, there are sources of pollution in Noida also. Hindon river is one of the major sources and nothing is being done by the authorities,” said Vikrant Tongad, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yamuna-water-quality-worsening-shows-uppcb-data-101626027638742.html

Children, too, have been facing a lot of problems while attending online classes during the daytime, parents complain.Suresh Chauhan, a resident of Sector 49, says there have been frequent power cuts in the area for the past three months. “Just like old times, when the Uttar Pradesh electricity board (UPSEB) was in charge, we are not keeping anything inside our refrigerators as it is of no use. We don’t have electricity for hours every day. There are no power backups at the builders’ flats in our residential complex, so we go through a lot of trouble... We also suffer from skin diseases due to heavy sweating.”According to Santosh Kumar, a resident of Sector 77, he had to install an inverter at his flat as his son’s online classes got interrupted several times due to power outages. “We are planning to move to some other area, with better electricity connection,” says Kumar.The Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA), too, has raised a complaint. Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA) — an association of 71 high-rises in Noida — has sent a letter to the state minister of energy, Srikant Sharma, saying, “Despite tall claims made by the electricity distribution company, Discom, over Noida being a ‘no power cut zone’, the residential complexes have been suffering from unstable electricity supplies regularly. There are frequent power cuts and voltage fluctuation in Gautam Budh Nagar during the daytime, and sometimes, even at night... Such power failures are extremely worrisome, especially when many children attend online classes or appear for online examinations. People working from home also suffer a lot. Due to this poor situation, diesel generators are being used more, which adds up to the existing pollution.”When contacted, Virendra Nath Singh, Noida divisional chief engineer of Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said that “this has been happening due to faulty overhead supply lines”. “We have started replacing faulty lines, poles and transformers in Noida. We hope there won’t be power cuts after a day or two, besides the power failures during scheduled maintenance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/frequent-power-cuts-add-to-summer-woes-in-noida-101626027398153.html
11-07-2021||Delhi||4 held after shooting two passersby dead in North Delhi||Three days after two passersby were killed during an armed attack by at least four unidentified assailants on a local builder and his nephew at Filmistan near Bara Hindu Rao in north Delhi, police said they arrested four men from Delhi and Chandigarh between Saturday and Sunday and said that the attack was a contract killing gone wrong.Police said the attack on local builder Haji Naeem and his nephew Muneeb was planned by Feroz, a rival builder and his partner Danish, over a disputed property. Among the four who were arrested are Feroz, Rahul alias Charlie (23) and Himanshu (21), and Mehtab, who is Danish’s relative.“We are now looking for another key conspirator, and one more man who was also involved in the attack,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.Joint commissioner of police (central range) N S Bundela said during investigation, it was learnt that Naeem and Muneeb were rivals of other builders in Sadar Bazar and Bara Hindu Rao areas. The teams also learnt that Muneeb had managed to get a stay on the construction of a building at Ahata Kidara and was responsible for the demolition of the property. “Inputs collected from locals revealed that Feroz and Danish conspired with Mehtab to settle scores with Muneeb and his uncle. They hired contract killers to kill them,” said a senior investigator.“Interrogation of Rahul and Himanshu revealed that they were roped in for the contract killing by their friend, who is also absconding. On Thursday evening, the three of them reached near Kishanganj railway station and met the key conspirators. The deal was finalised there itself. The attackers left and reached Filmistan to execute the plan,” added the officer.On being asked if the attackers were promised any amount for the contract killing, DCP Alphonse said, “We are looking for Feroz’s business partner, who managed everything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-held-for-shooting-dead-two-passerby-near-bara-hindu-rao-101626027338572.html
11-07-2021||Noida||Paucity of vaccines puts a brake on inoculation drive in GB Nagar||NOIDA: The near-to-home mega vaccination drive, which was supposed to kick off from July 1, is yet to be started in Gautam Budh Nagar, thanks to the shortage of Covid-19 vaccine in the district. Health officials on Sunday said that the situation is unlikely to improve in the next 10 days.The GB Nagar health department had claimed to vaccinate at least 30,000 persons every day in July. But, the limited supply of vaccines has kept the daily vaccination figures to less than 10,000 in the district this month, the officials said. The GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, admitted that the near-to-home vaccination has been affected by the vaccine scarcity. “The district is not getting enough doses of vaccine. As a result, we are unable to kick off the near-to-home vaccination. The state headquarters have been informed about the vaccine shortage and we hope to get adequate vials very soon,” he said. Senior health officials said that several vaccination centres in the district have been closed for the past few days due to inadequate supply of vaccines. “We had to shut down several vaccination session sites on Saturday. We had fixed a target to inoculate at least 30,000 people in a day in July. But due to paucity of vaccines, we are not setting any daily target now. As per our information, the similar situation will continue at least for another 10 days,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, district chief medical officer. District immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that the district has nearly 10,000 doses of vaccine in the inventory at present to continue the vaccination on Monday. “We have administered 80,449 doses at different government health centres in the first 11 days of July, which includes two Sundays, when no vaccination takes place. It indicates that we’ve administered, on average, less than 10,000 vaccine daily,” he said. It may be noted that in the last two consecutive days of June, the Covid-19 vaccination drive remained suspended at the government health centres due to a shortage of vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/paucity-of-vaccines-puts-a-brake-on-inoculation-drive-in-gb-nagar-101626027337982.html

A team from KIMS reached RMLIMS a day before (July 10) and prepared for her shifting, said Dr Srikesh.Asked about the process for lung transplant and the time taken for complete recovery, Dr Srikesh Singh said, “It is a long and complicated process. The doctors are doing their best and we hope she recovers soon.”The woman doctor first fell ill on April 12 as she got fever. She tested positive after Covid duty. After remaining in home isolation for a couple of days, she had to be admitted to the Lohia institute, where she is doing postgraduate studies in gynaecology. While she was admitted at Lohia Institute, the doctors performed a caesarean operation, and she delivered a girl child on May 6. The newborn girl is Covid negative and fine, according to the doctors of the institute.This is first such case in Uttar Pradesh where a doctor who developed severe complications after Covid duty has been supported by the state government for lung transplant. She joined Lohia institute in 2018 and got married on May 29, 2019.Husband hopes things will go wellEven as Dr Sharda Suman was airlifted to Hyderabad for a lung transplant, her husband Dr Ajay said, “It’s a tough time and we hope things go well.” The husband, who works in Bihar, also said, “People have extended support to us, and we are happy about it. Also, the state government and the institute supported us.” He added that he was hopeful of his wife returning with a successful lung transplant.

Jayshree Deshpande, president of the Parents Association of Pune, said that the question of fee hikes should be resolved as early as possible.“Parents are financially struggling over the last one year due to the pandemic. However, schools are hiking fees even during the pandemic when offline classes are not going on,” said Deshpande.The Parents Association has been in talks with the education department. “We will be meeting education commissioner, Vishal Solanki to discuss various issues at hand,”Deshpande added.Amar Ekad, president of a student organisation, said that the basic demand of 50 per cent fee reduction should be implemented soon.“We have submitted our list of demands to the education department. And until the department gives us a written intimation regarding the same, we will not stop the protest,” said Ekad.He also added that one of their demands is to make the audit of each school mandatory.“There are 90 per cent schools in the state who have not submitted, or even carried out their audits. Such schools should be held accountable for doing the audit. Education department does not carry out any investigation on such schools. Schools and colleges must undergo an audit to understand how they are hiking fees each year,” said Ekad.He added that students now are at home and schools are online due to the pandemic.“In such a situation, there should be a separate school fee structure that the schools should charge for,” said Ekad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/parents-association-of-pune-to-press-ahead-with-protest-against-school-fee-hikes-101626025718082.html

Responding to a question on Patole’s allegations, the NCP chief said he need not react to comments by “small people”. “These are small people. Why should I react? If Sonia Gandhi says something, I will give my reaction,” said Pawar, during an interaction on Sunday in Baramati, his hometown. Patole, while accusing the allies in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, had asked Congress workers to transform hardships into strength while reiterating his stance of going solo in the upcoming elections Commenting on complaints from workers that Pune district guardian minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar was not helping them with their work, Patole during his interaction with party workers in Lonavla, had asked them to keep calm and instead convert the anger into strength. “The guardian minister is from Baramati. Whose work is he doing? Is he getting work done for our members? You need to convert this hardship into strength. Do not treat this hardship as mental weakness,” said Patole. The MPCC chief had also accused both the MVA allies of not fulfilling promises. “It’s fine that they are not giving us our share, it will come to us. But, you need to take a vow that one day, the guardian minister here will be from our party. If they do not want to compromise and backstab while being together, then we won’t say anything, but transform our hardships into strengths.” Reacting to the post of speaker being with the Congress as part of an arrangement among the MVA allies, Pawar said, “Our decision is clear and the post of speaker is with Congress. Whoever they will decide will be the speaker.” On going solo in the elections, Pawar said every party has a right to expand the party base and there’s nothing wrong. “There shouldn’t be misunderstanding, even leaders of all three parties say that their parties will fight polls alone. We are together in the government, but not running parties together.” His remarks came after Patole reiterated that the Congress would go alone in the polls. “I am not going to backtrack on what I said about fighting elections solo. The other day, the CM also appealed [to Shiv Sena workers] to start preparing for polls. If I say something, it becomes a problem, but now that he is saying it then it is okay,” Patole had said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/small-person-won-t-comment-says-pawar-reacting-to-patole-s-remarks-101626025658763.html

Since May 2020, the state government has put in price cap for what Covid-19 patients can be charged at private hospitals. The government also ordered the local administration to audit the bills, in case of complaints, and to then ensure the excess amount charged above the limit is returned. In the past one week, as per the civic body’s health department, between July 1 and July 7, PMC has been able to audit bills and reduce amounts charged by a total of ₹17,21,042.Between March 1 and July 8, 2021, the civic body has been reduced a total of ₹5.20 crore from 1,724 bills. The PMC has also stated that following the audits, bills charged by Sahyadri Hospital, Deccan hospital, Jehangir hospital, Poona Hospital, Rao Nursing home and Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital, were reduced.Dr Sanjay Patil, Indian Medical Association (IMA),Hospital Board, Pune chapter chairperson said, “The government had capped prices back in May 2020, which are still relevant now. It did not consider the rise in oxygen prices and other inflation costs for hospitals. During the second wave, we only have patients with moderate and severe symptoms and almost all of them require oxygen. Each patient needs at oxygen worth ₹12,000 at least, every day. Also, while the government audits bills and reduces the bills that they think are being overcharged, they must also consider that sometimes, the hospitals are forced to give heavier discounts to patients or even in some cases, patients leave the hospital without paying a single rupee. Hospitals must be compensated for such situations as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pvt-hospital-bills-audited-rs-17-21-lakh-over-charged-in-seven-days-101626025599169.html

Officials said that it was a minor incident and there were no injuries.“Fire at the landfill is a common occurrence. Due to the build-up of toxic gases, the landfill always remains susceptible to fire and it is a frequent occurrence at the Bandhwari plant,” said Narender Yadav, fire safety officer.Yadav said that the intensity of the blaze was minor, but it led to heavy smoke in the area. “The problem with landfill fires is that the blaze is not limited to one area.

A total of 20 robberies by cab drivers have been reported this year. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, “People fall prey to their tactics due to a lack of public transport.

However, cases are still on the rise.” In the latest incident last Friday, a 35-year-old sales and marketing executive of a private company was assaulted and robbed of his belongings at gunpoint around 11.30am when he tried to hitchhike from Rajeev Chowk to Naraina in Delhi. The victim, identified as Shashank Pandey, of Deoria in Uttar Pradesh, who lives in a rented accommodation in Sector 47, was robbed of his belongings.Pandey flagged down a Brezza, which had a private registration number and four people in it, at Rajeev Chowk. “I told them that I was going to Naraina, following which they asked me to board the car. After five minutes, two of the commuters suddenly attacked me and asked me to hand over my belongings. They snatched my diamond ring and gold chain worth ₹2 lakh. It all happened within a few minutes and I could not even retaliate,” he said. They took the U-turn before Iffco Chowk and drove towards Hero Honda Chowk. They pushed him out of the moving car near the Sukhrali flyover and drove towards Delhi, the police said.A case under sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was filed at the Civil Lines police station.

Officials at the hubs register residents and direct them towards the appropriate bins.The two facilities were opened to reduce the amount of daily waste being ferried to the Bandhwari landfill and to provide residents with easier access to such facilities. Around 1800 tonnes of daily waste is dumped at the site from Gurugram and Faridabad. With the Bandhwari waste plant lying defunct since 2013, around 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste has accumulated at the landfill over time.Until last month, there was only one recycling facility, at the Samadhaan Hub in Sector 43, which opened in February 2019.The NGO looks after the day-to-day operations of the three waste recycling hubs with the MCG’s support.“We have opened the two waste recycling hubs, with the hope of reducing the quantity of waste that is carried to the landfill and also for recycling it for multiple uses. Reduction of waste will also bring down our garbage transportation costs and the saved money can, instead, be allocated for increasing the processing at the landfill,” a senior MCG official privy to the matter said.Khatri said that the entire awareness process involves bringing about a behavioural change in people, a process that needs continuous effort.“We plan to visit nearby condominiums or ensure our messages are circulated in the society’s social media platforms so that residents firstly know that such a facility exists and that it can be availed of free of cost. The second part would be to explain to them about the different categories of waste that can be segregated and the advantages of it,” said Khatri.Khatri said that the NGO, along with the support of the MCG, is also planning to involve Gurugram schools in the project, so that school students can spread awareness locally and ensure dry waste is dumped at the three facilities, as part of their extracurricular activity.Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist, said, “While the recycling hubs are a move in the positive direction, it needs to be backed by stringent policies that make it mandatory for recycling of waste for various types of waste. Only then will there be a major impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/waste-processing-awareness-drive-to-promote-dumping-at-recently-opened-hubs-101626023738705.html

11-07-2021||Patna||Union minister Giriraj Singh bats for UP’s population policy in Bihar, other parties react||Union rural development minister Giriraj Singh backed the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government’s population control policy launched on Sunday and batted for a similar legislation for Bihar to check exponential growth of population.The new population policy aims to incentivise people to help in population control. It aims to reduce population growth rate to 2.1%, UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh said.The UP government’s law commission has also prepared a population control bill, which promises perks and incentives to government employees and general public who follow population control measures. People who choose to have more than two children in UP will be made ineligible for government jobs and promotions, and excluded from receiving benefits of various schemes among other measures, according to the draft bill.Leaders of Janata Dal (United), an ally of the BJP in Bihar, however, dismissed it as an electoral strategy to polarise votes in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the state polls and said it should be rejected. The JDU’s contention also drew the support of Congress, which said that a political consensus is required before enforcing any such policy.Singh, while talking to media persons on his arrival in Begusarai on Sunday, said overpopulation is a major obstacle in development and social harmony. “Every state shall attach the issue of population with elections like the one Uttar Pradesh is doing,” said the Union minister, who earlier in 2019 favoured disenfranchising those having more than two kids.BJP MLA from Bisfi Haribhushan Thakur also strongly demanded enactment of a strong population policy. He said, “A conspiracy is underway to turn India into an Islamic nation. The Bihar government needs to enact a stronger population policy to foil the design by certain elements.”On the other hand, senior JD(U) leaders, including Ghulam Gaus, said the BJP was resorting to “vote politics” to divide votes on communal lines. “They (BJP leaders) have done it to polarize votes,” said Gaus. Former minister Jai Kumar Singh said such a move had the potential to jeopardize social balance in the country. “Bihar government is trying to check population by educating the people,” said the JD(U) leader.Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, while dismissing the population policy as an election ploy, said that an all-party meeting should be held to bring about consensus on the issue. “The Congress also tried to check population by resorting to “hum do, hamare do” policy, which backfired. Our party is also in favour of containing population growth, but not by force,” said Mishra.The RJD too reacted sharply to the BJP’s design to deprive benefits to those having more than two children. RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said, “A particular religion was being targeted through the policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/union-minister-giriraj-singh-bats-for-up-s-population-policy-in-bihar-other-parties-react-101626018877866.html
11-07-2021||Patna||Rains, swollen rivers wreak havoc in north Bihar||Incessant rains in bordering areas and swollen rivers originating from Nepal have compounded miseries of those residing in far-off villages and outskirts of towns in north Bihar on Sunday.While all major rivers, including Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kosi, are in full spate and jumping danger levels (DL) by over one to three metres at different stretches, road connectivity to dozens of villages in West and East Champaran has been snapped following rising floodwater level.Floodwaters entered over a dozen villages of Narkatiaganj block of West Champaran after Sikharna river, a tributary of Burhi Gandak, breached a zamindari bund near Sikta. Flow of traffic on Narkatiaganj and Bettiah has been disrupted after floodwaters overtopped it near Chanpatia. Kartaha river is wreaking havoc in the same block, inundating standing crops on thousands of hectares of land. Dozens of villages in Mainatand block have been disconnected from Narkatiaganj subdivisional headquarter after a bridge on Kartaha river caved in due to gushing water in the river.Heavy rains coupled with floodwaters of other rivulets originating from Nepal have already left tens of thousands of villagers of Bettiah’s Sonbarsa block, forcing residents to relocated to safer places.Meanwhile, flood situation in Samastipur remained grim as Burhi Gandak was reportedly flowing nearly three metres above the DL at Rosera. Gandak, Bagmati and Kosi were flowing around one metre above the DL at Dumarighat in Gopalganj, Benibad in Muzaffarpur and Baltara in Khagaria, respectively. Adhwara and Burhi Gandak are also flowing over one metre above the DL at Ekmighat in Darbhanga and Sikandarpur in Muzaffarpur, respectively.Officials of water resources department (WRD) said all embankments were safe and flood protection drive was on at all vulnerable portions of the bund on all major rivers. They said a minor breach in a zamindari embankment on Bagmati near Kothia village of Kewati block of Darbhanga had been repaired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rains-swollen-rivers-wreak-havoc-in-north-bihar-101626018578843.html

The deceased woman was identified as Anjali Nitin Nikam (22) a resident of Chakrapani vasahat of Bhosari where she lived with the assailant husband. The arrested man was identified as Nitin Bapu Nikam (32), according to the police.

11-07-2021||Pune||Pune city’s 24*7 helpline launched||The Pune city police cybercrime cell has launched two 24-hour helpline numbers which will also be available on WhatsApp - 7058719371 and 7058719375. The number of cybercrime complaints have risen exponentially in the past five years. “Sharing cyber fraud screenshots on these new cyber helplines will highly increase chances of amount recovery,” tweeted commissioner Amitabh Gupta of Pune police. What is the definition of the “golden hour”, one might ask; it is the time after the crime is committed during which the money can be retrieved by freezing the transaction. Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, cybercrime and Economic offence wing (EOW) said, “First few hours are the best time to report the crime. There is no set definition for the “golden hour” but the transaction needs to be reversed before the person on the receiving end is able to withdraw it. Just like in accidents where they say that the patient can survive if provided help in the golden hour; it will help us save people’s hard-earned money which we do on a regular basis. This process will only hasten the process.” The complaints will be sent to five separate units of cybercrime created by the Pune police: hacking/data theft, online business, cheating, social network, and ATM card related fraud. Here are the steps to follow: call the helpline to explain what has happened, then send required screenshots on the same number, then get an FIR registered. Once your FIR is registered, you will be provided with a QR code through a link which will help you keep a track of your case or you can call the landline number to check the status of your complaint. Senior police inspector Dagdu Hake, in-charge of the cyber police station of Pune city police said that the number of complaints is on a steady rise over the years. “This year the number of complaints is nearing 9,000 by now. Last year the total complaints were 14,900 and the year before that it was 7,800. Year-on-year, it is rising,” said PI Hake. Along with the number of complaints, the methods of fraud have also increased in number in the past few years. From hacking to data and identity theft, to UPI fraud, the number of methods have increased manifold in the past decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-city-s-24-7-helpline-launched-101626018217866.html

He added that this was not ‘full justice’ with Punjab.His statement assumes significance as its comes just a day after former Punjab minister and senior saffron party leader Anil Joshi was expelled from the party for six years for what the party claimed was dissent. Lal had backed Joshi. Interacting with the media, he said, “It is unfortunate that Punjab doesn’t have representation in the council of ministers, as it should have. Punjab has played the best role in boosting the economy of the country, yet it is not given even 1% preference. We make the largest contribution to the Central grain poll, and the state bore the brunt of the consequences of our wars with Pakistan.”“The 2022 assembly elections are approaching, but I have seen that the PM Narendra Modi has not done full justice to Punjab. Hardeep Singh Puri has got cabinet rank and Som Parkash is there as a minister of state, but Punjab should have been given more representation,” he said.He added, “I hope the PM will take care of Punjab and include more cabinet ministers from the state to give it full representation.

If they had been informed, then they should tell Punjabis why they did not raise any objection. Why are they silent till now,” he added.

There is proof of their links with JMB militants,” said Aparajita Rai, deputy commissioner of police (STF).“These men had links with Al Amin, the JMB leader based in Bangladesh,” she added.The arrested men were being interrogated.Reacting to the arrests, the Bharatiya Janata Party's Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh said, "Terror groups treat Bengal as a safe haven. We have seen several arrests in recent years."Trinamool Congress leaders said the arrests prove that the police are active and vigilant.The arrests come months after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested several men from Bengal’s Murshidabad district for alleged links with the Al Qaeda.In September last year, the NIA arrested 10 people from West Bengal and Kerala. These arrests were followed by several more in the subsequent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/3-bangladeshis-with-suspected-jmb-link-nabbed-in-kolkata-101626014258183.html
11-07-2021||Pune||PMC to construct 200-metric ton garbage processing plant||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is all set to construct a mammoth 200 metric tons garbage processing plant at one of the strategic spots of the newly included 23 villages in the PMC urban agglomeration. The PMC has sought grants worth ₹200 crore from the state government for setting up the plant and has got assent for the same. The grant is likely to be credited to the PMC exchequer soon while a draft plan is being readied to be immediately implemented. The decision has been taken as tons of garbage and waste was being dumped along the roadsides in major villages leading to a fresh set of challenges before the administration. With the PMC taking over the villages, the zilla parishad has withdrawn from collecting and disposing the garbage leading to widespread accumulation and possibility of a major outbreak of garbage induced diseases amidst the spread of Covid-19 in the city and the district. PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “Lots of garbage is getting accumulated in the villages and disposal is a major issue in the gram panchayat. We had not expected this problem to crop up as 200 tonnes garbage is being generated every day and it requires processing. The big gram panchayat did not have their independent processing units. Currently it is also being dumped in the ‘gairan’ area of the villages. Till what time will the garbage be dumped at the roadside.” In the meantime, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has also started to identify new lands for the garbage disposal for the merged 23 villages. As per the PMC’s estimate around 200 metric tonnes of garbage is generated per day in big villages like Manjari, Wagholi, Shivane and Ambegaon area which according to the administration are the maximum garbage generating urban sprawls. PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar has also instructed the solid waste management department to utilize the gram panchayat’s facility for a few days. Two weeks ago, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to pay ₹2 crore for not completely complying with the tribunal order from 2018, related to a garbage dumping ground in Uruli Devachi and Phursungi. The fine amount will be utilized to enforce an action plan to restore the environment in the area which will have to be prepared by PMC, as originally directed, and submitted to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). The Maharashtra Environment Secretary will monitor the compliance by PMC. MPCB and state environment department will assess continued violation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and levy a compensatory amount that PMC will have to pay along with the ₹2 crore, according to the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-construct-200-metric-ton-garbage-processing-plant-101626011797506.html

11-07-2021||Jaipur||7 months and farmers protest against 3 agri-laws continues in Rajasthan||Its’ been over 200 days of their agitation at Shahjhanpur border against the farm laws passed by the Government of India, farmers have decided to Gherao the parliament daily, and pressure opposition to raising questions related to farmers inside the house. To maintain the momentum of the agitation, as it has stretched long, the farmers have now adopted a new strategy - a dozen or more from every village will be sent to the agitation place (Shahjahanpur border on Jaipur-Delhi highway) in rotation, which helps them to manage their personal and household works. The seven-month-long farmers protest led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha is probably one of the longest continuous protests in the country, where thousands have joined in from different parts of the country. Convener, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, Sanjay Madhav said sowing has been done and the farmers in large numbers have started returning. It has been more than seven months since the protest started but the government is still adamant with its stand that the three farm laws will not be rolled back. He continued, “If the law is not withdrawn, then the government will be removed. The way they were defeated in West Bengal, will be repeated in other states. The trade, labour and farmers’ organization will go among the masses on-farm laws, increasing inflation and changes in labour laws. ‘Ab janta hee ilaj karegi (now people will deal with them),” said Madhav. The monsoon session will start on July 19, the Morcha will send a letter to all opposition parties of the country on July 17 to ensure that the session is used to support the struggle of the farmers; and that the government is bound to fulfil the demands of the farmers, he said. Along with this, from July 22, at least 200 protesters will protest outside Parliament every day till the end of the monsoon session, he added. The farmers are firm on their demand for the repeal of agricultural laws. He said, “The government has not yet given a single reason why these laws cannot be repealed. We can only conclude that in the world’s largest democracy, an elected government is the most important of its citizens. Playing a game of arrogance with a large section - the peasantry - and giving priority to the interests of crony capitalists over the grain of the country will not work,” said Madhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/7-months-and-farmers-protest-against-3-agri-laws-continues-in-rajasthan-101626005857934.html
11-07-2021||Pune||Your Space: Infra development top priority in 23 villages merged in Pune municipal limits||The merger of 23 new villages into Pune Municipal Corporation, though a populist decision, will leave the civic administration handle basic amenities of an extended area of 518 sq km from its present 334 sq km. What are the steps that PMC should take to turn this merger into advantage and boost exchequer? Planned development must in merged areas We can have planned development in the new areas that have been merged into Pune civic limits. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should provide facilities and the government should give subsidies to improve civic amenities in these villages. The new areas can be utilised for creating infrastructure related to housing, transport, medical, new colleges and garbage management. Projects like low-cost housing can be promoted in the areas for slum rehabilitation. Dinesh Sood Merger will help rationalise property tax The merger of 23 villages under PMC has its advantages and disadvantages. Since the area after merger has increased, it becomes a challenge to manage the same unless the professional manpower is employed for the task. There are many advantages of the merger. Property tax collection of PMC will increase multifold due to the merger. The increase in revenue can be rationally utilised to develop the existing facilities and provide basic amenities to the villages newly merged. The merger can also help in bringing the development faster since the hierarchy has changed and communication becoming easier. The merger can also help in judicious estimation of property tax as the payer base will increase. Any decision or change has its own advantages and disadvantages. It’s up to us how we want to utilise the same. Ankit Rungta Focus on development should be priority Although the merger makes Pune the biggest city in Maharashtra in terms of geographical area, I wonder how much beneficial the decision would turn out for the added villages. For the current size of Pune, there are already numerous issues which are unanswered for years. With the addition of these 23 villages, it would be challenging for the administration. The new villages would be seeking benefits of being included in city limits and they don’t even know how long will it be till they actually see the benefits. I feel PMC is going to have a tough job at their hands for the next 5-10 years. The appointment of right people and focus on development would probably change the game. Aditya Gund New areas should have a separate civic body The advantages of being in municipal area include planned development, stricter watch on unauthorised construction, being part of larger authority, better chances of good implementation of common facilities such as footpaths, roads and water. Part of a large municipal corporation also has its disadvantage. It should have been divided into two civic bodies, as there may be delay in work implementation/decisions due to workload on the authorities to cover a bigger geographical area. Nihar Adkar Good to be part of the city Living in one of these 23 villages never felt like a part of Pune. Apart from living amidst greenery, one had to travel long distance for other amenities. It feels good to be officially recognised as a Punekar and not being condescended as a countryman. We have been waiting for this merger for years now and finally the civic body has made it official. Over the years, living in a village but staying close to urban life has been influencing our lifestyle. Although, centralised infrastructure and roads which would be maintained by the authorities would not only make our life easier, but make us feel a part of the city. Tax collection would be better and streamlined as population has increased by 0.2 million. Ronit Augustin. Strategies must for new areas With the merger of 23 villages into PMC limits, the civic body becomes largest municipal corporation in the state. However, they will have to plan new strategies for generating revenue for the administration and development of extended area. PMC needs funds from the state and they can generate funds by altering taxes. PMC can get more revenue through these villages. They will have to put more effort to administer and give basic facilities to the people. Guru Sontakke Infra development of villages must It will support Pune Municipal Corporation for development and work towards achieving progress. The city administration has to take initiatives such as construction of sewage treatment plants (STP), remodeling of stormwater drains, water supply, development of waste management facilities, rehabilitation of slums under environmentally sensitive locations, residential area, commercial, industrial, public utilities, transport, public transport, metro, ring roads, road widening and subways, recreational reserved, forest and agriculture, river improvement forest land, water bodies, hills and housing policy.

11-07-2021||Dehradun||Arvind Kejriwal offers 300 units free electricity to Uttarakhand if AAP wins||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised 300 units of free electricity to people in Uttarakhand if his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was elected to power in the assembly elections next year. Kejriwal’s offer comes four days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state promised to provide the first 100 units of electricity for free and the next 100 at 50% discount.Kejriwal gave four guarantees related to electricity: “First we will provide 300 units of free electricity, which will have a financial implication of around ₹1200 crore. Second, people won’t have to pay old pending and inflated bills. Third, there will be no power cuts in the state; electricity will be provided 24X7 and fourth, farmers in the state will get free electricity for farming purposes”, he said.Kejriwal asked why people in Uttarakhand had to pay a heavy amount for power despite the state producing electricity in good quantity and why no party in the state had thought of providing free power to residents till now.Kejriwal said the Uttarakhand’s minister for energy and renewable energy’s announcement to provide 100 units of electricity free and the next hundred at 50% discount had no value in the face of a denial by the chief minister. “Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the state has no such proposal, which made it clear that they will not provide free electricity,” he said.Kejriwal also alleged that the Congress and the BJP had some “arrangement” between them. “Since 2000, first one [party] comes to power and then the other. BJP is busy changing CMs, [it is] something that has happened for the first time in 70 years that the party is itself saying that this or that CM is not good and needs to be changed. ...Congress can’t make up its mind about who will lead the state, who will be the leader of Opposition. Both the parties have destroyed Uttarakhand,” he claimedTalking about replicating AAP’s Delhi model of governance in Uttarakhand, he said if the party comes to power it will transform the schools and health infrastructure. “Our leaders here are talking to youth, and within a month or so, we will make a big announcement about employment for the state’s youth”, he said.“I also want to appeal to all those who love this nation, who are honest and feel stifled in their parties, to leave their parties and join AAP”, he saidKejriwal said he will soon return to the state to announce AAP’s CM candidate.With less than a year left for the next state assembly elections, AAP is increasingly becoming aggressive. Over the last eight months or so, it has attacked the ruling BJP on various issues including corruption, unemployment and health through various political events and on social media.In the Himalayan state, Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), a government of Uttarakhand undertaking, is the sole distributor of electricity to over 2.5 million consumers across the state with a peak demand of 2233 MW.Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson said AAP was trying to mislead the people of Uttarakhand. “They are just trying to mislead people of the state with such promises. Everyone knows the condition of Mohalla clinics in Delhi and the overall Delhi model. Here they don’t have much cadre or a face. They can’t even win the local civic elections [in Uttarakhand] if they try”.Bhasin refuted Kejriwal’s claim that the BJP government had no intention to provide free power and said that the CM hadn’t rejected the proposal but he only meant to say that it hadn’t been brought before the cabinet yet. “He just spoke about the technicality that it hasn’t yet been brought before the state cabinet,” Bhasin said.Pritam Singh, state president of the Congress said AAP doesn’t have any roots in the state and it was a B-team of the BJP. “They know very well that they can’t win here. They have no base here and people of the state will themselves give them a befitting reply”. He added that so far the party didn’t have any plans to provide free electricity if elected to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/arvind-kejriwal-offers-300-units-free-electricity-to-uttarakhand-if-aap-wins-101626001957758.html

Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal, who is also the AAP's national convener, said, “Today, I’m giving you four guarantees with regard to electricity. This is not an election jumla. The first guarantee is that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will provide 300 units of electricity free of cost to every family of Uttarakhand if the party comes into power.”He said the second guarantee is that all old electricity bills will be forgiven.Also Read| Eye on polls, Arvind Kejriwal promises free electricity in Punjab“For the past few months, our party workers have been going from home to home. There have been several instances where people have received wrong electricity bills, which at times is done intentionally. For example, a person receives a wrong bill of ₹60,000. Now when the person goes to correct it, he/she is told to pay ₹10,000 and the bill will be forgiven. And then the person is running from pillar to post.” Kejriwal said, adding the number of wrong bills is so high that the entire machinery will be unable to correct it.The third guarantee which the Delhi chief minister gave is that there will be no power cuts in Uttarakhand and electricity will be available 24x7. He pointed out that free electricity does not mean that less of it will be provided.Uttarakhand के लिए Kejriwal जी की 4 बड़ी गारंटी‼️AAP की सरकार बनने के बाद देवभूमि के लोगों को -⚡हर महीने 300 Unit Bijli Free ⚡पुराने बिजली Bill माफ होंगे⚡24 घंटे Electricity देंगे⚡किसानों को मुफ़्त बिजली मिलेगी- CM @ArvindKejriwal#KejriwalKiBijliGuarantee⚡ pic.twitter.com/IzeG1R8EhTThe fourth and the final guarantee which Kejriwal gave is that all farmers in Uttarakhand will get electricity for free.Kejriwal also said that except for ensuring 24x7 availability of electricity, the remaining three guarantees will be fulfilled right when the AAP comes into power in Uttarakhand. “It will take 3-4 years to ensure 24x7 availability of electricity as the network will have to be rectified,” he added.Also Read| Uttarakhand announces free electricity scheme ahead of assembly electionsBefore Uttarakhand, Kejriwal had in June visited another poll-bound state, Punjab, where he promised 300 units of free electricity for each household along with a waiver of their pending bills.During Sunday’s briefing in Dehradun, the Delhi CM also hit out at the ruling and opposition parties in Uttarakhand by alleging that such leaders have left no stone unturned to destroy the state. The ruling party does not have a chief minister while the opposition party does not have a leader, Kejriwal said.“Opposition doesn’t have a leader. They have been coming to Delhi for the past month to select a leader. Who will think about the development of Uttarakhand residents? Are these parties concerned about the state’s people? They do not care. They are only fighting for power.” Kejriwal further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/not-a-poll-jumla-arvind-kejriwal-gives-4-guarantees-in-poll-bound-uttarakhand-101625990284610.html
11-07-2021||Patna||Controversial Bihar SHO suspended for nexus with liquor mafia||A Bihar Police inspector posted in capital Patna has been suspended for alleged nexus with illicit liquor mafia. Inspector Mohammad Qaisar Alam, currently the station house officer (SHO) of Buddha Colony police station, was punished after a report by inspector general (prohibition) Amrit Raj said he was involved with the liquor mafia. “The SHO has been placed under suspension based on a report on his illegal activities,” confirmed Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Upendra Sharma. A senior official in state police headquarters said Alam was under the radar after his name surfaced during June 12 raid in Digha police station area, where five individuals involved in the liquor mafia were arrested with two SUVs and 326 litres of liquor. Sale and purchase and consumption of liquor is prohibited in Bihar. The Prohibition department soon found out that one of the absconding accused was constantly in touch with the suspended inspector. The officer allegedly protected him and his illegal business. The SHO was then put under surveillance. The suspended SHO was also accused in the fake encounter of 21-year-old Mohammed Gurfan in Samastipur district on February 5, 2002.On December 28, 2018, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav wrote to chief minister Nitish Kumar demanding the suspension of Alam, posted as SHO of Phulwarisharif police station. Tej Pratap alleged he saw a liquor bottle inside the SHO’s chamber, which he said was an offence since liquor was banned in the state.Later on, May 23, 2019, the central range deputy inspector general (DIG) Rajesh Kumar ordered an inquiry against the SHO for alleged illegal detention of a person after his vehicle was seized for not possessing valid papers. He directed the SSP to attach the SHO to the Police Lines if found guilty in the inquiry report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/controversial-bihar-sho-suspended-for-nexus-with-liquor-mafia-101625985037179.html

11-07-2021||Delhi||No driving test to get license now! Delhiites wonder why?||Remember the days of queuing up in trepidation at the regional transport office (RTO) when trying to pass the driving test for a license? No longer are Delhiites required to go through this struggle since the new amendment in the rule by Union Transport Ministry states that passing a driving test is ‘not mandatory’ to get a license! Surprised? Well, while many in the Capital are sure taking this as a good riddance, but the change that might have been introduced to make life easier is being speculated to have other repercussions as well. What is the common (wo)man’s view?It might be easier to get your license now, however, the number of people who have vehicles to drive on the roads “is scary”, says a Patparganj-based entrepreneur Geeta Verma, adding, “It’s going to be a chaotic situation on the road! I am dreading it already as I need to go to work every day and ab sab hi road pe honge unlock mein! It’s so risky as it has become much easier to get a license... And by the time the violators are challaned, for all you know they might have already skipped a test at the cost of a life!” Arnav Rajpal, a student of Delhi Technological University, is hopeful that the new rule and the system being set-up will help regulate traffic by making the drivers more responsible. He adds, “There should be some uniformity so that the applicant’s driving skill level is above a certain threshold, to as to ensure road safety. Previously, there were many RTOs and each would have a different driving test according to the space and resources available. Even then some could get away with a driving licence without appearing for a proper test, so not driving rules but the drivers need to get updated.”A few driving schools to go out of business?The training centres, which will now be allowed, shall be required to have simulators and a dedicated driving test track. Opining on this, Anil Kumar, owner of driving school in Pitampura, says that this decision has put them in a tough spot. “The authorities have asked for a two acre track for the test, and we cannot arrange that. And if that’s the case, no one will come to us and other smaller driving schools. It’s going to be tough to sustain in the business. Let’s see if we are able to continue or need to change business,” he says. Vijay Kumar, owner of a driving school in Dwarka, feels that just the training in a driving school isn’t enough to get a license and start driving independently. “Driving needs practice. A lot of times people learn driving from the driving schools, but they are still not ready to drive on the road. Sirf basics clear hote hain driving school mein, on-road experience toh chahiye. So there must be an on-road test after any training,” he adds. Expert’s opinionA city-based road safety officer for over six years, Raj Kumar Yadav says that this sort of judgement comes with it’s own pros and cons, and explains: “It’s good in the sense that there will be private driving schools that will be reputed, where people can take their training. And this will certainly help them drive better. But yes, there is also a chance that these schools would just train as a formality as compared to the details that were earlier taken into account at RTOs. So, the new rule could swing either way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-driving-test-to-get-license-now-delhiites-wonder-why-101625984098904.html

The firms searched today were mostly under Saran, Patna West, Tirhut, Patna East and Darbhanga divisions of the department.Sources said the firms were selected for searches by using data analytics and 360 degree profiling on the instructions of commissioner cum secretary, commercial taxes department Dr Pratima.Officials said the department had started tracking the owners of these firms involved in tax evasion and would impose penalties as per legal provisions. “We will also lodge FIRs against the persons involved in the racket and take other punitive measures,” said another officer, engaged in raids.The commercial taxes department has witnessed a decline in revenue in the past few months owing to Covid induced lockdown following the second wave of the pandemic and is presently focused on cracking down against tax evaders to minimise losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/50-bihar-firms-caused-rs-171-crore-loss-in-gst-tax-raided-101625983417151.html
11-07-2021||Mumbai||Delayed by a day, heavy rains to begin on Sunday in Mumbai; orange alert issued||Despite the weather department predicting heavy rains in Mumbai starting Saturday, the city received just 45.6mm of rain in the 48 hours ending 8:30am on Sunday and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) revised its forecast to say that heavy rains were now expected to arrive sometime on Sunday, peak by Tuesday and continue intermittently for the rest of the week.The delay is said to be due to the formation of an east-west shear zone (an area filled by opposing winds) over the north Konkan coast. Two independent meteorologists said it had inhibited rain bands lying just off the coast of Mumbai from penetrating inland, leading to lesser than anticipated rainfall over the city. However, such a phenomenon typically strengthens monsoon conditions, they added.Officials and experts said rains were likely to arrive soon under the influence of a low pressure area forming in the Bay of Bengal and an upper air cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea. Over the next four to five days, Mumbai may receive as much as 400mm of rain and has therefore been placed under orange category by the IMD, warning of heavy to very heavy showers.“Mumbai will start getting showers soon. Going to be [the] wettest week of the season so far. From today till Wednesday/Thursday, total rainfall [is] likely to exceed 400mm. Will have a 12 hours period with 200mm rainfall which will lead to waterlogging,” an independent meteorologist said.“Mumbai-MMR can expect moderate showers on July 11. Current forecast suggests moderate to heavy rain in the region on July 12, which can cause water logging and usual disruptions. Overall, active next week for the monsoon,” Akshay Deoras, another independent meteorologist, tweeted.The city has so far seen 1106mm of rain since June 1, which is about 37% in excess of the seasonal normal of 801mm. However, since July 1, the city has recorded largely deficient rains at a departure of more than -80%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delayed-by-a-day-heavy-rains-to-begin-on-sunday-in-mumbai-orange-alert-issued-101625978856984.html

11-07-2021||Dehradun||Arvind Kejriwal in Dehradun today with promise of free electricity to poll-bound Uttarakhand||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will visit Uttarakhand's capital Dehradun on Sunday, in a bid to expand his Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) base. The visit is crucial in view of the assembly elections in Uttarakhand next year.Kejriwal is going to the state with a pitch to provide free electricity to the people of Uttarakhand.“Uttarakhand itself generates electricity and also sells it to other states. Then why is electricity so expensive for the people of Uttarakhand? Delhi does not generate its own electricity and buys it from other states. Still, electricity in Delhi is free. Shouldn’t the people of Uttarakhand get free electricity? See you tomorrow in Dehradun,” Kejriwal said in a tweet ahead of the visit.This promise of Kejriwal comes just days after the Uttarakhand government announced on July 8 that 100 units of electricity will be provided free of cost every month to domestic consumers. State power minister Harak Singh Rawat said there are around 13 lakh consumers who come under the purview of 100 to 200 units of electricity. “Those who use 100 units per month will be given electricity free of cost. Those using 101 to 200 units per month will get a 50 per cent discount,” he said, according to news agency ANI.Rawat added this scheme will also benefit electricity consumers in Uttarakhand’s remote areas. Highlighting that electricity bill in the state comes for two months, he said the benefit of this scheme will be given on the basis of units each month. “That is, if someone gets a bill of 200 units in 2 months, then he will not have to pay any money,” the state power minister further said, adding those related to dairy, horticulture, and agriculture sectors, which were earlier under the commercial category of electricity consumers, will now be brought under the domestic category.Before Uttarakhand, Kejriwal had in June visited another poll-bound state, Punjab, where he promised 300 units of free electricity for each household along with a waiver of their pending bills. “With 300 units of free power to each household, 77-80% families in Punjab will get zero bill. They will get 24-hour power but no bill,” the Delhi CM had said.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/kejriwal-in-dehradun-today-to-promise-free-electricity-to-poll-bound-ukhand-101625972039188.html

11-07-2021||Chandigarh||27 Panchkula villages accomplish 100% vaccination||After facing much reluctance and difficulties, the health department of Panchkula claims to have successfully vaccinated all residents of 27 of the district’s nearly 500 villages.One of the hardest to reach was Morni block, where residents of 12 villages have been 100% vaccinated. Supervisor Swaroop Singh from Primary Health Centre (PHC), Morni, said the 312 villages in the block had a population of around 19,000.“At times, I had to walk 40km a day from one village to another. On regular days, one travels 4-5 km easily, as vehicles don’t reach there,” said Singh.District immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sasan said: “We have strategies to vaccinate entire villages one by one. So far, we have achieved 100% vaccination in 27 out of nearly 500 villages.”She said Morni was a difficult area as teams had to walk several kilometres to reach the villages with limited population. “But they reached where roads won’t take you,” she said.Some of these villages are Bitna and Rampur village of Kalka; Rampur, Amb Ki Bhud, Tandawala and Neemwala that fall under community health centre, Raipur Rani; 14 villages under PHC Morni; Alipur village in Kot; two villages in Surajpur; and Malabog, Jabrot, Nala Dhamir, Nala Dakhrog villages.Only 18% population fully vaccinated More than six months have passed since the first woman was vaccinated for Covid-19 in the district, but the health department has been able to fully vaccinate only 18% of the population. Vaccine shortage, reluctance among people are some factors due to which only 64% of the target population have been jabbed just once.Panchkula has a total target of 4,10,940 beneficiaries, of which 3,38,442 have been vaccinated. While 2,63,054 people have received the first dose, 75,388 have been fully vaccinated. Over 1.8 lakh men have been inoculated, which is slightly more than the 1.5 lakh women vaccinated.Shortage of CovishieldThe vaccination drive’s pace has also been affected by slow supply of Covishield doses. Even now, the health department has stopped administering the first dose , as they are left with just 2,900 doses. Even vaccination sites have been reduced to four amid the shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/27-panchkula-villages-accomplish-100-vaccination-101625949455688.html
11-07-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh plans job curbs based on family size||A draft bill on population control prepared by the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission proposes to make people with more than two children ineligible for government jobs, disentitle those already in service to promotions and exclude them from benefits of 77 schemes.The draft bill, for which suggestions have been invited from the public by July 19, also proposes to prohibit people who have more than two children from contesting local bodies elections or receiving any kind of subsidy. It also suggests incentives such as tax rebates for those with up to two children.The draft has been uploaded on the commission’s website. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is expected to announce on Sunday a new population policy 2021-30 for the state, which is set to go to the polls early next year. Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state with a population of around 220 million.Justice AN Mittal (retd), the panel’s chairman, said all aspects were looked into and an exhaustive study of such laws was carried out before the proposed legislation was drafted. He underlined the need for a law to check the increasing population of the state.“Resources are already overstretched due to increasing population. Be it medical facilities, food grains and jobs, everything is under stress due to the rising population,” said Mittal, a former Allahabad high court judge.“Imagine if the population of the state remains 22 crore (220 million) to 23 crore (230 million) even after 20 years, then what will be the state’s condition. There will be the availability of everything in abundance for the future generation. There will be no scarcity of resources,” he said.The proposed incentives for government employees with one child include increments, promotions and concessions in housing schemes. For those who are not government employees, the incentives listed are rebates in taxes on water, housing and home loans. If a single child’s parent opts for vasectomy, then the child will be entitled to free medical facilities until the age of 20. Such children are also proposed to get free education, insurance and preference in government jobs.The draft bill said: “Public servants who adopt the two-child norm will get two additional increments during the entire service, maternity or as the case may be, paternity leave of 12 months, with full salary and allowances and three per cent increase in the employer’s contribution fund under the National Pension Scheme.” A state population fund will be constituted for its implementation. Listing the government duties, the draft bill said that maternity centres will be set up at all primary health centres.The draft bill also said that it shall be the duty of the government to introduce a compulsory subject relating to population control in all secondary schools.The Congress questioned the timing of the draft bill ahead of the assembly polls in the state. “The polls are due in seven to eight months. What is the urgency to bring the (draft) bill now when parties are preparing for the assembly polls?” said VN Madan, state Congress spokesperson. Madan said they were studying the draft bill and added that the Congress will support its positive aspects and oppose the ones the government has incorporated for its own benefits.Chief ministers of Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam have of late sought population control. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said large families were likely to lose certain state benefits.According to United Nations data, the rate of population growth is falling behind replacement rates in over half of the countries globally. The growth rate in the global population is projected to be zero by the end of the century perhaps for the first time. China has allowed two to three children per household to reverse a fall in its population after decades of the one-child policy.India is projected to overtake China as the most populous country by 2025.Adityanath will release the Uttar Pradesh Jansankhya Neeti-2021-30 (UP population policy-2021-30) on the occasion of the World Population Day on Sunday. He will also distribute kits to promote family planning among some newly married couples, a state government statement said on Saturday.On Thursday, the chief minister held a meeting on the policy and said: “For providing a better standard of living to all, it is necessary to control the population growth. And for the development of Uttar Pradesh, it is necessary to check the population growth rate. By controlling the population, we can realise the dream of a better tomorrow.”“People should be told that a small family is the basis of prosperity and with a reduced population density, people will have a better environment. For a healthy society, it is necessary to stabilise the population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-plans-job-curbs-based-on-family-size-101625948654498.html

During the hearing held through video conferencing, the applicant’s advocate Sanjay Abott told the court that Sirsa has already sold his properties and he is in the process of fleeing as soon as flights resume. The counsel further submitted that the investigation agency has not taken appropriate steps to prevent him from fleeing. Meanwhile, the court also noted the submission of the Delhi Police that lookout circulars (LOCs) against the accused persons have not been opened as they are joining investigation as and when asked. A Delhi court had earlier directed the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police to register an FIR on the complaint filed by Bhupinder Singh. Singh had alleged that Sirsa, who at the time of the incident in 2013 was general secretary of DSGMC, had caused wrongful loss of public funds. Following the direction of the court, the EOW of Delhi Police had registered an FIR against Sirsa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-manjinder-sirsa-doesn-t-flee-from-justice-delhi-court-to-police-101625948795665.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Victim’s statement changed in POCSO case: Suspended SHO, SI booked in Ambala||Two days after the station in-charge of Naraingarh women police station, inspector Satwinder Kaur, was suspended for allegedly changing the statement of a rape survivor in a case lodged under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act in June, she along with the investigating officer, sub-inspector Rajwinder Kaur, were booked on Saturday.The FIR came after the victim’s family had written to various authorities calling out for an action against the officers for changing their original statement and weakening the case by adding flimsy charges in favour of the accused. Subsequently, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Hamid Akhtar marked an inquiry to deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Barara) Rajnish Kumar.While Akhtar didn’t respond to calls, Kumar said, “I found that the allegations levelled by the family were true and a case was lodged against the officers.” The officers, Satwinder, 40, and Rajwinder, 35, who have yet to be arrested, remained incommunicado for a comment.The FIR was lodged under Sections 166A (public servant disobeying direction under law), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of the offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture) of the Indian Penal Code.As per the case, an 18-year-old girl had complained on June 26 that a 25-year-old Navneet had repeatedly raped her, given her abortion pills and violently sexually assaulted her.“We had e-mailed the complaint to the SSP and DSP concerned, and on the Whatsapp number of the SHO. But we found that the mobile number on the official website was old, so my cousin handed over the complaint at her office later in the evening. After this, the police raided his house the same night, but he was not found there and the officers started pressuring us to change my statement in favour of Navneet,” said the Class 12 student.The girl further said that the officers had taken her and her mother’s signatures on plain papers. On June 27, the girl was referred to the civil hospital in the city for an ultrasound because of the abortion pills she was given. But after waiting for hours at the hospital, the next day, the girl alleged, Rajwinder told them that she didn’t need to get the test done.“We were yet to get an FIR copy, so we went to the police station to get one and were shocked to read my statement different from what we had sent. The case was lodged under the same act in three-four lines with mention only of rape and all other allegations were removed,” the survivor alleged||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/victims-statement-changed-in-pocso-case-suspended-sho-si-booked-in-ambala-101625948675641.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||CM not allowing police to act against Simarjit Bains: SAD||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday said that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is not allowing the police to proceed against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leader Simarjit Bains even as a Ludhiana court had ordered to book him for rape on the complaint of a woman. Addressing a press conference here, SAD spokesperson Virsa Singh Valtoha said, “It is eight months since the 44-year-old widow had accused Bains of raping and sexually exploiting her. The police failed to take any action in the matter despite clear cut apex court guidelines on such issues. The victim was forced to go to the courts to seek justice and finally after a protracted legal battle, the court of the additional CJM in Ludhiana ordered the police to register a case against Bains on the basis of the complaint of the victim. The police, however, have still not swung into action.” “Earlier, the Gurdaspur sessions court had ordered custodial interrogation of Bains for threatening the deputy commissioner but the police didn’t execute the court directive. We demand that the DGP be proceeded against in both cases,” Valtoha said. He said a detailed inquiry should also be held into the role of food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in patronising and shielding the LIP leader. “There are murmurs that Bains is scheduled to dissolve the LIP and join the Congress party soon and that is why no action is being taken against him,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cm-not-allowing-police-to-act-against-simarjit-bains-sad-101625948497966.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Power shortage persists, PSPCL relying on rains||Amid an all-time high demand for power, Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) managed to supply only around 12,500MW daily against a demand of 15,500MW. The PSPCL is now relying on monsoon as rains will decrease the demand by about 3,000MW and the generation from hydropower stations will also go up. The shortfall is mainly due to lesser generation by hydropower stations, including Bhakra Beas Management Board, and 1,980MW Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) going out of operations. In order to bridge the gap between demand and supply, the PSPCL was constrained to impose power regulatory measures on industrial as well other consumers. The corporation is enforcing outages from 2 to 6 hours across the state, especially in rural belts. Besides, the industry is on forced shutdown for three days a week till July 14. Industrial bodies held protests against the PSPCL across Punjab on Saturday, after which the corporation came out with some relaxations. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Prasad said keeping in view the persistent demand of the industrial consumers, power regulatory measures on general category LS consumers having sanctioned contract demand up to 100KVA have been relaxed with effect from July 11. Industrial consumers have now been allowed to operate up to 100KVA of load, while the earlier exemption limit was only up to 50KVA. However, industrialists termed the relaxation as insufficient. “There is need to order probe why such lopsided arrangements were made. You can’t run industry short of capacity as it leads to higher input costs and ends up in losses,” said Yogesh Kumar, an industrialist from Patiala. The PSPCL has arranged to purchase 752MW extra power at a rate of ₹3.08 per unit for July 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-shortage-persists-pspcl-relying-on-rains-101625948256058.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||RWAs seek Chandigarh MC’s attention towards stray dog menace||The resident welfare bodies in the city have called out the municipal corporation for not delivering the desired results with their animal birth control (ABC) programme, alleging that the stray dog problem in the city had gone out of hand.Speaking about this, secretary of the Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC) and president of the Sector-8 RWA, RS Gill, said, “Packs of stray dogs roaming in the city make us feel very unsafe. Children can’t go to play in parks because of them and the dogs are even more aggressive during the summer heat. This summer we have had around 25 dog bites in the sector. They have even been attacking our cars and leaving bite marks on the plastic.”Gill added that numerous eateries in Sector 8 were drawing stray dogs from neighbouring sectors, but the authorities hadn’t been considering their complaints.Chairman of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) Hitesh Puri, who lives in Sector 43, said, “This isn’t a problem restricted to the northern or the southern sectors, it’s spread throughout the city. The ABC programme being run by the authorities needs to be ramped up. Dog census of all sectors needs to be carried out regularly to keep a track of the situation. If the dog population is increasing over the years despite the ABC programme, then something is going wrong.”Puri added that they had received numerous complaints from Sectors 21, 28 and 33 and CRAWFED will take up this issue in their next general body meeting.District animal welfare officer Inder Sandhu said, “While it is incorrect to say that dogs get more aggressive in the summers, the authorities need to implement the ABC programme more effectively. Animal lovers must do their part and ensure that they get any animal they care for spayed. Those who are not comfortable with dogs need to avoid hitting them or teasing them. We must coexist and treat them humanely and focus on sterilisation.”Inspector with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dharminder Dogra, added that due to lockdown restrictions imposed earlier, not many cases of dog bites or other attacks have come forward this year.Chandigarh mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “The MC is working on the stray dog issue. We have vaccinated around 80% of the canine population of the city already. Many dogs enter UT from neighbouring cities, which increases the count, but overall the population of dogs is going down year-by-year. We have also asked animal lovers to come forward and adopt strays.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rwas-seek-chandigarh-mc-s-attention-towards-stray-dog-menace-101625948195542.html

Similarly, 28.4% of Junior Basic Training (JBT), 26% of lecturer and 29.4% of master cadre posts have also yet to be filled.Among lecturers, 24 posts of English teachers are vacant, followed by 15 of Hindi, 14 of physical education and 13 of Punjabi teachers. Similarly, 130 social studies teachers of master or Trained Graduate Teacher (TGT) cadre have not been recruited, apart from 114 teachers for non-medical and 87 for fine arts.“The number of vacancies increased in 2020 after the Punjab government decided to reduce the age of retirement from 60 to 58. Many teachers retired due to this and fresh recruitments could not be conducted due to the Covid pandemic,” said Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, Chandigarh.Brar said the education department was working to fill most of these vacancies. “An entrance exam for 100 TGT and 300 JBT teachers will be conducted soon by the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research. Another 300 teachers will be roped in on deputation from Haryana and Punjab.”The official said as classes were being conducted online due to the contagion, students’ education was not affected by the vacancies: “Many lectures were pre-recorded for students and teachers worked with students throughout the lockdown, taking their doubts and answering any queries they had.”However, president of UT Cadre of Educational Employees Union, Swarn Singh Kamboj said vacant positions had increased teachers’ workload. “The department needs to recruit more teachers soon, even if on contractual basis,” he said.NGO Yuvsatta’s coordinator Pramod Sharma added, “Students of government schools are already facing hardships in accessing the internet and using phones to study. The student-teacher ratio must be maintained. More teachers must be hired before schools reopen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/32-teaching-posts-vacant-in-chandigarh-s-govt-schools-101625947956257.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||BJP expels former Punjab minister Anil Joshi for 6 years over ‘anti-party’ activities||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday expelled senior leader and former Punjab minister Anil Joshi for six years terming his outburst against the state and the central leadership on mishandling the farm protests as an ‘anti-party activity.’ A two-time legislator from Amritsar North, Joshi, 57, had been openly blaming the party’s state leadership for not giving a correct feedback to the Centre on the farm laws. He had also demanded revocation of the three agri laws. Joshi was expelled on the directions of state unit chief Ashwani Sharma, said state general secretary Subhash Sharma.Joshi did not give up his stubborn attitude of going against the party whereupon the state BJP chief on the recommendations of a disciplinary committee expelled him from the primary membership of the party for six years, the statement added.Joshi was issued a show-cause notice earlier this week. In a two-page reply to the notice, the former minister said he never spoke against the Centre’s farm laws. “I neither spoke against the Centre’s farm laws nor against central leaders,” Joshi said. He added that workers were leaving the party and asked state party chief Sharma whether giving a suggestion to save the party was indiscipline. According to a senior party functionary, Joshi was expelled after taking the party high-command into confidence. After his explusion, Joshi said: “Is speaking for farmers a sin? Is it indiscipline to talk about ‘arhtiyas’, industrialists, small traders and labourers?” “I have worked very hard for the party in the past 35 years. Working as a soldier of the party, I received bullets, my car was burnt. When I was minister, my brother faced bullets. And now they have ended my tapasya (for the party) in such a manner,” Joshi told mediapersons in Batala. Some senior state BJP leaders also came out in support of Joshi. “Expulsion of a senior leader who gave 35 years of his life to the party is very unfortunate. Joshi spoke for farmers and communal harmony and in no way this was an anti-party activity,” former chief parliamentary secretary KD Bhandari said. He urged the senior leaders to reconsider the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-expels-former-punjab-minister-anil-joshi-for-6-years-over-anti-party-activities-101625947776655.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Covid cases down, Chandigarh admn readies plan to reopen colleges in August||With the second wave of the Covid pandemic ebbing way, the UT administration has started preparing the unlock plan for city colleges. The proposal is to open colleges in August with several riders in place. For both students and college staff, at least a single dose of Covid vaccine will be mandatory to attend the classes. For those yet to get jabbed or not willing to attend physical classes with concerns of Covid spread, online classes will continue. For more than a year, since March last year when the pandemic first broke out, city colleges have remained largely shut. Some colleges reopened in November, but didn’t evoke much response from students.When the first wave subsided, the administration had decided to reopen all colleges in February this year. However the second wave started soon after in March, thwarting the plan. On May 4, the administration had imposed strict lockdown in the city, but over the last couple of weeks most of the lockdown restrictions on public movement, gatherings, shops and restaurants, and weekend curfews have been withdrawn.“The Covid situation in Chandigarh has improved considerably. Consequently, we are in the position to consider reopening colleges. We are weighing different options, but the key to allowing colleges to reopen is the vaccination status of teachers and students. We are also keeping a watch on the situation in the neighbouring states,” said a senior UT official. Focus on increasing vaccination coverageThe administration has sought from education and health departments the current status of vaccination among the college staff (both teaching and non-teaching) and students. Its emphasis now is on increasing the vaccination coverage among students and teachers. “Over the next three weeks we will be pushing for more teachers and students to get vaccinated. If the administration is satisfied with the rate of vaccination among them, it will allow resumption of physical classes,” said the official. On the directions of the administration, the UT health department is also going to start a special vaccination drive for college students.Daily camp from 10am to 5pmThe special drive with the tagline “Students before join your college vaccinate yourself” will be launched on July 12 and will be organised everyday from 10am to 5pm. “The department will hold three vaccination camps at Punjab Engineering College, Sector 12; Chandigarh College of Engineering and Technology, Sector 26; and Post Graduate Government College, Sector 46. No prior appointment is required for getting jabbed. All students above 18 years of age can walk in for the vaccine. They can also get vaccinated at the nearest government vaccination centre,” the official said. Vaccination of outstation students a challengeChandigarh is a major education hub of the region, with students from neighbouring states like Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country pursuing their undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the city.As such, enforcing the one-jab rule for outstation students remains a challenge for the administration. “We are looking at all these issues before the final decision to open the colleges is taken. Initially, attending physical classes will not be mandatory. If and when Covid’s third wave unfolds will also greatly determine the complete reopening of colleges,” the official said.No call on reopening of schools yetEven as the UT education department has asked all eligible teaching and non-teaching staff to get vaccinated by July 31, no date has been planned for reopening schools. As per higher officials of the department, a meeting is likely to be held next week to review the situation and take a decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-cases-down-chandigarh-admn-readies-plan-to-reopen-colleges-in-august-101625947595949.html

The institution will be granted the status if it gets the approval from the Union ministry of education.The deemed to be university status under the ‘de novo’ category is given to institutes devoted to unique and emerging areas of knowledge, not being pursued by conventional or existing ones, particularly in specific areas of study and research.Caters to development of polytechnic education in northNITTTR Chandigarh was established in 1967 by the Government of India, along with three other similar institutions in Bhopal, Chennai and Kolkata. It was designed to meet the requirements for developing polytechnic education in the northern region covering Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Chandigarh.Since 1983, the institution has been guiding and assisting these states in the areas of educational planning and management. In 1992, NITTTR Chandigarh started offering regular masters of engineering programmes and from 2005, modular master of engineering programmes were started.All the programmes are offered for teachers of technical institutions and their administrators, professionals from industry and general candidates. These programmes are affiliated to PU. The institution has also been recognised as a research centre by PU in 2006 and Punjab Technical University (PTU) in 2005 for pursuing PhD.Institute’s 15-year strategic planThe 15-year strategic plan of NITTTR envisions the development of the institute as deemed to be university, to meet the needs of the technical education system in view of the changed scenario, with more focus on the use of ICT in the teaching-learning process. Its objectives include: to become a preferred university offering teacher-focused multi-disciplinary programmes; to establish centres of excellence in selected areas of engineering and technology with industry collaboration; to provide programmes with multipoint entry and multipoint exit option among others.Unique programmes proposedDirector of NITTTR Chandigarh, Shyam Sundar Pattnaik, said, “The country needs some areas that are strategic in nature and demand driven societal requirements. The conventional institutions are structured for a particular requirement and they cannot change very fast, but an institute like NITTTR can do that. That is the reason we have applied for deemed to be university status under de novo category.”“If we get the status, we would like to launch those strategic programmes that cannot be run by conventional institutions,” he added.The unique postgraduate programmes proposed by the institute include digital kinematics for organisational resilience, 3D/4D printing, innovative design and production, sensor, data and IoT system management, drone and unmanned airborne system technology, nanophotonics and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nitttr-chandigarh-eyes-deemed-to-be-university-status-101625947415594.html

But, the fortunate ones who chose to watch the match between India and England being played at Northampton on Friday night, witnessed Harleen Deol’s stunning catch on the boundary line which has already garnered over two million views worldwide. Netizens showered Harleen with praise, while bestowing upon her titles like “wonder woman”, ‘flying Sikh’ and “superwoman”. It was in the 19th over of England’s innings, when Amy Jones whacked the ball towards wide long-off, and Harleen produced the stunning effort to get the dismissal and save the six. She jumped in for the catch, but realised she was stepping out of the boundary line. Immediately, she tossed the ball into the air and then came back inside the line to complete the catch mid-air.Stalwarts of the game laud Mohali girlPlaying in her 10th T20 match for India, Harleen was lauded by stalwarts of Indian cricket like Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Harbhajan Singh and Suresh Raina. Indian businessman Anand Mahindra and political leaders like I&B and sports minister Anurag Thakur and Priyanka Gandhi also showered her with praises. Harleen was not in the Indian ODI team that lost the three-match series to the hosts. It would have been the icing on the cake had the match been completed and Harleen won the game for India while chasing 177. England won the first T20 and took a 1-0 lead in the series, after no more play was possible due to the rain. The hosts won by 18 runs (DLS method). Harleen remained 17 not out. Back home in Mohali, her mother Charanjit Deol has been flooded with texts, messages and calls from relatives and friends. “I spoke to her after the game. She was thrilled, but disappointed as India lost the game. She wanted to win the game for the country,” she said. Harleen’s mother attributes her daughter’s success as a fielder to her fitness and commitment. Harleen’s brother would drive her 30 kms everyday for practice from Mohali to Zirakpur. “Not many grounds have opened since the pandemic broke out. We found this ground and even though it was a bit far, it had good facilities. We bought gym equipment so she could work out at home. She was always in good shape and working on her fitness and athletic ability,” added Charanjit. Not many know that Harleen shifted base from Mohali to Dharamsala to join Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association’s residential academy for U-19 girls. The academy was ex-BCCI chief and sports minister Anurag Thakur’s brainchild, who was then HPCA president. She was 13 when she left Punjab Cricket Association for better facilities. As a teenager, she lived away from home at the academy, with a dream to win the world cup for India. “It feels great to see Anurag sir appreciating Harleen. My daughter was always welcomed at HPCA, where she honed her skills. She wants to be part of the India ODI team and play in the Australia series, followed by the ODI World Cup in New Zealand early next year,” added Charanjit. The Indian team’s fielding coach Abhay Sharma has also helped Harleen become a sharp fielder. She made her ODI and T20 debut against England in 2019 when she replaced an injured Harmanpreet Kaur. Known to be a sharp fielder, solid top-order batter and a useful leg-spinner, Harleen has not had many chances playing in ODIs. She scored a 50 against South Africa at Lucknow in the T20 series. “Harleen is a livewire on the ground. She will always take match-winning catches and save runs for the team. She should be in the Indian ODI team too. Her presence can make a difference,” echoed Pawan Sen, HPCA women’s team coach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-girl-harleen-deol-s-stunning-catch-garners-praise-from-far-and-wide-101625947355650.html

He announced that a physical meeting will be held at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan on Wednesday.Earlier, Sandhu had announced that the meeting would be held virtually, keeping in view the restriction on gatherings imposed by the government amid the pandemic. But the opposition slammed the move stating that the mayor and the civic body are avoiding answering the queries of elected representatives regarding improper solid waste management and hike in water-sewer tariff, among other issues.All the opposition parties in the house including, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) opposed the move on Friday and stated that a physical meeting should be held to discuss the issues in detail.Leader of opposition Harbhajan Singh Dang and leader of BJP councillors Sunita Rani stated that two physical MC house meetings were held when the Covid cases were on a rise— one at the Rose Garden on November 10 and the other at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan on March 24. Now when the situation is under control, the civic body wants to hold virtual meetings to avoid answering the queries, they added.Sandhu said that the decision to hold the virtual meeting was taken keeping in view the ongoing pandemic and the gathering restrictions. As the government has eased the restrictions, and the opposition has been demanding a physical meeting, we have decided to hold a physical meeting at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-house-to-meet-in-person-on-july-14-101625947177612.html

The clearance timings are also mentioned on the letterbox. They are: 8.05 am, 11.20 am, 3 pm, 4.45 pm, and 5.30 pm. Ludhiana city division superintendent of post offices Kulwant Singh said, “We have identified various locations where pillar embedded letterboxes are in deplorable condition. To give them a better look, we are in the process of getting them painted.”He said, “Letterboxes are the face of the post offices, and a majority of the customers visit our office to post letters. So, we decided to get them repainted. We have also kept earthen pots near the letterbox to beautify the surroundings.”Residents laud initiativeThe residents have appreciated the efforts made by the head post office authorities. Manpreet Kaur, a resident, said, “I have visited the head post office several times to post letters but, this time when I dropped the packet in the box, I found that it had been repainted and looked appealing. My grandfather, who accompanied me to the post office, also praised the authorities for taking the initiative. I also took a picture of the letterbox and then circulated it among my friends, who also applauded the new look.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-letterboxes-get-a-facelift-101625947176570.html

His reaction comes days after a high-level committee of experts constituted by vice-president of India and PU chancellor M Venkaiah Naidu submitted its report on governance reforms at the varsity. Besides downsizing of senate and syndicate, the panel has also recommended that colleges situated in close proximity of PU in Mohali and Ropar may be affiliated to it, while colleges far away can be affiliated to other varsities. Sukhbir has cautioned PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar not to rush into this ill-advised venture, which concerns the sentiments of the people of Punjab. “It seems that the varsity’s authorities are insensitive towards the emotional fallout of their actions. Their motives strike at the very roots of the ideals which inspire SAD and form the cornerstone of the Constitution of India,” he said. He also said that this move will deprive PU of its character as an “institution of global repute, symbolising Punjab and its rich and varied culture”. Sukhbir added that the university’s authorities are using Covid as an excuse to not hold the senate elections. The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31, 2020. Elections were scheduled to take place in August 2020, but varsity deferred it amid the pandemic. The elections were later scheduled in April this year, but was postponed again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-opposes-changing-of-panjab-university-s-territorial-jurisdiction-101625947175473.html

The 44-year-old complainant refused to leave the police station until the LIP chief was booked as per the July 7 directions of a local court. The police, however, said they could not register an FIR as the power supply of the area had been disrupted. However, SAD leaders were not placated. Former SAD MLA Harish Rai Dhanda, an advocate, who was accompanying the complainant, offered to arrange a generator for the police station to facilitate the process. Later, the cops claimed that the computer system had developed a snag, due to which they could not lodge an FIR. In response, Dhanda along with SAD workers raised slogans against the police. They alleged that the police were not lodging an FIR on behest of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Dhanda said, “Despite the court’s directions, the police are dilly dallying so as to favour Bains. This amounts to contempt of court.” He alleged that the police officers concerned had gone on leave till Monday to escape questions. “Bains knows that the police will not lodge an FIR against him. Thus, he has moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking stay on the local court’s orders.” The woman said she had filed a complaint against Bains six months ago and had been protesting outside commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal’s office for five months, to no avail. “Even after the court directed the cops to lodge an FIR, they are still reluctant to do the needful,” she said. Inspector Sukhwinder Singh, who was holding charge of the police station in absence of station house officer Amandeep Singh Brar, said they had received the court orders two days ago. The court has ordered the police to file a status report in the case till July 15. “We will lodge an FIR as soon as the system resumes,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rape-allegations-against-mla-bains-police-claim-fir-delayed-due-to-power-cut-sad-leaders-offer-generator-101625947116742.html

The accused, Arvinder Singh alias Aman Tatto, had opened fire on a shopkeeper during an extortion bid on July 1. The shopkeeper had retaliated and shot Tatto in the stomach. “After the incident, Tatto left Ludhiana. He went to Barnala, Patiala, and Jalandhar and returned on Friday night. He did not go to a hospital to evade arrest so the bullet remained lodged in his stomach,” CIA Staff 3 in-charge sub-inspector Yashpal Sharma said, adding that Tatto had been admitted to the civil hospital. Tatto was arrested with his aides Abhishek Sharma of Baba Fateh Singh Nagar and Deepak of Gill village while hatching a plan to execute another robbery. A country-made 0.32 bore pistol, 11 cartridges, a knife, a 0.12 bore barrel and one cartridge were seized from the accused. The trio had gathered at a vacant plot along the Malerkotla Road in front of the main gate of Gurudwara Alamgir Sahib, the police said.

The steel and yarn production has been badly hit in the state and the 35-lakh labour/staff have been forced to sit at homes. The exports of more than 1,000 crore are at risk and the multinational companies are boycotting the industry in Punjab due to delays in supply of material.”Slamming the state government for its alleged mismanagement which led to the crisis, the industrialists rued that they were already reeling under losses due to the pandemic and the power crises had added to their woes. The industrialists stated that the CM should step down from the power ministry and the government will pay in the upcoming assembly elections.President of the Fastener Manufacturers Association of India, Narinder Bhamra, said, “The government should have made proper arrangements as it knows that power demand increases during the paddy season. It is only due to the failure on the part of the government that the industry is witnessing blackout for the last 10 days, which has never happened in the history of the state. We cannot bear any more losses and the industry will commence operations even if the government extends the forced weekly off.”President of the Furnace Alliance Association, Mahesh Gupta, said that the industry paid hefty power bills, but the state had still failed to provide uninterrupted power supply.If the crisis continues, we will be forced to raise the agitation to the next level and if needed we will also protest outside the CM’s residence, said the industrialists.On July 1, industries in the central and north zones of the state were asked to close their units for 48 hours for the first time. Subsequent orders extended the curbs for another day. The general industry was only able to work on July 5 and 6, before three weekly offs were imposed on July 7 and subsequently extended for another day (July 11). In the latest orders, the directions for power shutdown for industry which were already applicable since July 7 to 11, were further extended by three days till July 14. However, the threshold limit of 50 KVA to industry was increased to 100 KVA giving relief to small units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-industrialists-protest-against-forced-weekly-off-say-units-will-operate-despite-curbs-101625946995541.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana’s hospitality sector cheers night curfew roll back||Marriage palace owners, restaurateurs and hoteliers have reason to cheer as night curfew has been lifted at long last and the ceiling on guests has been extended.Stakeholders say this will be a shot in the arm for the Covid-hit hospitality sector, which had been reeling under losses for around three months after the government restricted gatherings in March and subsequently imposed a night curfew amid an escalating Covid crisis.Owners of marriage palaces, hotels and banquet halls say resumption of nighttime weddings has improved their chances of weathering the slump in business caused due to months of closure during the first and second waves of the pandemic. Citing the low positivity rate in the state, the state government has allowed gatherings of 100 people indoors and 200 persons outdoors from July 12. Though Sunday lockdown restrictions had been lifted on June 27, night curfew from 8pm and 5am continued across the district.Marriage Palace Welfare Association president and owner of Shehanshah Palace on Ferozepur Road Amarjit Singh Sant said, “Hundreds of events were cancelled and our business came to a standstill when the government scaled down the strength of public gatherings to 20 in March. Business failed to pick up when the ceiling was increased to 50 in mid-June. Those who had taken resorts on lease had to wind up their business as they could not afford to make payments.”“With gatherings up to 200 people allowed, we are hopeful that we will get some bookings in the coming days. Our staff is vaccinated, and we will adhere to the government’s guidelines,” said Sant.Punjab Marriages And Resorts Association general secretary and owner of Regency Garden in Mullanpur, Gurpreet Singh Malhi, said, “Though people will not start hosting events immediately, the announcement has come as a major relief. We are expecting a positive response in a week or so. We will at least be able to cover fixed expenses such as salaries, power bill, and bank instalments. The sector may not be able to survive another lockdown as we have suffered many setbacks since the outbreak of the pandemic.”More families will venture out: Restauranteurs, traders Restaurateurs have also hailed the move as customers prefer to dine out with their families after 8pm. Owner of Bruu Kiln on Malhar Road, Typsy Bal, said that even after the government allowed the restaurants to stay open till 7:30pm, many of restaurant owners kept the unit shut due to the low footfall. “Now, we will open the units as bars have also been allowed to open. Things will slowly come back on track.”The state government had shut down dine-in facility at restaurant from April 20. Home delivery and takeaways were allowed subsequently. Dine-in facility was resumed in mid-June and the bars were allowed to open at 50% capacity from July 1 during the curfew relaxation period.Hotel and Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh said, “The announcement will certainly give a push to the business as people will start holding social events. The footfall in the restaurants will also increase as the restriction of working at 50% capacity have also been removed from bars. We are taking all precautions and the staff has also been vaccinated. We expect that the government will further ease restrictions on gatherings so that the business can bounce back.”Traders say abolition of night curfew will improve footfall in markets as people will venture to popular haunts like the Sarabha Nagar Market, and Model Town Market in the evening. Sarabha Nagar Main Market Traders’ Association chairperson Wangjenn Chiu (Wong) said, “People visit the Sarabha Nagar Market to spend leisure time with their families and friends in the evening . The move to abolish the night curfew will certainly increase the footfall in the market, but we appeal residents to take all precautions to avoid a third wave of the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianashospitality-sector-cheers-night-curfew-roll-back-101625946935665.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Yeh dil maange more irises||The towering mountain of nearly 16,608 feet that takes its name after the dominant tiger stands quiet and solemn like a sentinel over Drass. There is no giveaway clue on the distant horizon that Tiger Hill was riven by a bloody battle 22 years ago. Standing on the outskirts of Drass below, one gazes at wild yellow roses blooming in abundance along the skipping, whirling snow streams. Another summer will go by too quickly in icy Drass just as young soldiers had gone too quickly to their Gods in the summer of 1999. In their melancholic silence, the elegant roses frame Tiger Hill’s grieving homage to the indomitable spirit of our soldiers.Westwards of Tiger Hill stands the equally quiet Batra Top (Point 4875) in the Mashkoh LoC sector. Here, Captain Vikram Batra’s heart’s desire for more fighting was fulfilled and he was later awarded the Param Vir Chakra. On Batra’s 22nd death anniversary that fell on July 7, northern army commander Lt Gen YK Joshi, UYSM, Vir Chakra, Sena Medal, flew over Batra Top in a Su-30 MK1 fighter to pay homage and express solidarity with his fallen comrade from the 13 JAK Rifles. Just 1,706 feet below Batra Top and situated in its towering shadow stands an abandoned Pakistani stone bunker at Point 4355. This bunker had stymied the Indian Army’s approach up the Safed nallah during the Kargil War. Here, amid unexploded mines, live grenades and rifle-propelled grenades abandoned by fleeing, rattled intruders, wild Hooker’s irises grow sparsely. They pay lonely homage to the fallen soldiers’, whose eternal memorial majestically looms above in the guise of Batra Top. Life survives under great adversity in Drass, somewhat controversially marketed as the second-coldest inhabited place after Siberia. To catch a glimpse of these blooms is to get a feel of how life raises its dainty head for just the brevity of a summer song. Flowers breathe easier now as there are no shells landing and blowing them to oblivion or cordite and artillery explosives contaminating snow and the tumbling melts along which they erupt. These petalled embers of summer are no longer crushed under army boots fearlessly charging up ibex trails and bullet hails. From hell to heavenFrom doom and gloom to a very cool pool! As many as 29 elephants rescued from a life of cruelty, damaged health and serfdom at circuses, shrine rituals, tourist rides, begging on streets and wedding processions are enjoying the bliss of a proverbial second life. The NGO, Wildlife SOS, has transformed their hitherto hellish existence into one where their emotional and physical needs are minutely cared for and even the anniversary of their freedom from exploitation is celebrated with an extravagant cake of vegetables and cooked pulses!These 29 gentle giants are committed to the lifetime care of the NGO at the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre, Mathura, whose patrons include celebrities like Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, superstar Amitabh Bachchan and turbanator Harbhanjan Singh. The latest facility to heal the damaged giants suffering from a gamut of health issues is the introduction of India’s first jumbo hydrotherapy pool firing 21 high-pressure jets. “An effective complementary treatment for the elephants’ painful joints, it uses the therapeutic benefits of water to perform physical rehabilitation in animals. Exerting hydrostatic pressure compresses muscle and joints. helps in relieving chronic muscle aches, aids blood circulation and rebuilds muscle memory with its natural resistance,” according to a wildlife SOS media release.While the elephants’ horrific past cannot be changed, the NGO’s rehab work amounts to an atonement on behalf of a guilty society. Elephants enjoy their personal pools as well as dips in the Yamuna river to beat the heat. Buoyancy of water helps take the massive weight off the elephants’ damaged feet and relaxes them. “Older elephants spend hours relaxing in cool, refreshing water. Younger, more playful ones like Peanut, Coconut, Laxmi and Chanchal dive headlong into water and play with rubber tyres inside the pool!” the release added.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-yeh-dil-maange-more-irises-101625946577455.html

We’re talking here not of football fans, but non-fans whose lifestyles resemble Tauktae-alerted terrain by virtue of being under the same roof as sports lovers with a proven propensity to bring the roof down. At the drop of a goal. By any Tom, Schick and Harry.These are tribes of Tweeple whose timelines have been tossed topsy-turvy by in-house Euro watchers glued to small screens or smartphone screens — spouses, sons or spaniels. Spaniels, not for their love of the game, but for the chicken lollipop or chilli cheese snacking that feeds all the Euro exclaim. The “catch” in the timelines tossed topsy-turvy – the unearthly hours.Of Gold Booty and Golden Boot Sample this. An author friend would much rather be tucked into bed, dreaming of goals as sublime as shattering glass ceilings of global authorhood by bagging bylines in The New York Times or grappling with goalposts such as penning future masterpieces for The Washington Post.Instead, she finds herself sacrificing sweet slumber to stare at some other spectacular sort of goals.Thanks to her sports journo son, she who knows not the A, B, C of soccer, has of late mastered the ‘D’ of it. That is, the tongue-twisting nomenclatures of all players in the team from Denmark.She who is an uncrowned gold queen, courtesy the golden booty amassed from myriad magazine caption contests, and she who has hitherto been familiar with only one sterling – pound sterling – now finds her vocabulary expanding to include the other kind of boot and sterling: Golden Boot and Raheem Sterling.The Curious Case of Sleepless in See-It-All.Of rooting and relationship goalsThe other species is symbolised by a better half who has been losing sweet slumber, not because she is driven by noble relationship goals of lending company to a lonely soccer-consumed spouse. Nah, she is staying awake well past her early bedtime solely to make sure her spouse stays awake. And doesn’t fall a victim to that other passionate pastime of his apart from soccer – snoring. The fallout – since the this better half stays awake to be sure the spouse stays awake, she’s not awake, for next day’s customary good morning WhatsApp calls to Biradri, BFFs & Co. When we’re talking relationship goals in the time of soccer goals, how can our comic couple Lollita and Lamba ji be far behind! Lamba ji is gurgling and guffawing as he goggles at the nail-biting England Vs Denmark action on the Idiot Box, his calf tendons twitching ‘n’ tingling to a bhangra unleash.“Where is the leash?” Lollita interrupts into his impending revelry.“Kane!” Lamba ji roots raucously.“How in the world can a cane help to leash the new kitty?” Lollita sounds stupefied. Lamba ji’s rooting refuses to be reined in.

11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: To dress up or dress down, that is the question||Not so long ago, there was a great brouhaha over the ripped-jeans controversy. While it is certainly not immoral to wear ripped jeans, ‘Friday Dressing’ has sadly permeated official settings and universities as we forget basic dressing etiquette. Even the Central Bureau of Investigation recently put in place a formal dress code for both men and woman as the agency’s newly appointed chief Subodh Kumar Jaiswal felt it was non-negotiable to indicate a professional work environment.It is the norm to wear formals at universities in western countries. While I was studying at Cambridge University , in the United Kingdom, the faculty could not wear jeans to class, they had to wear trousers and a jacket (a blazer as Indians refer to it). Sadly, the same is not seen in our country.I am a strong supporter of women wearing trousers, especially as it encourages the wearer to stay trim. However, I loathe to see doctorate students and sometimes even younger faculty wearing ripped jeans. This hardly aesthetic or appropriate in an academic set up.I have seen students presenting seminars and even appearing for viva voce examinations wearing round-neck tee-shirts and open-toed footwear.So do clothes really matter? Not to Albert Einstein, who felt if most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies. However, for lesser mortals like us, I would say, dressing up well is a form of good manners.The legendary lyricist Gulzar would agree as he had famously given the Oscars a miss in 2009 because he did not have a black coat to conform to the mandatory dress code, though his song ‘Jai Ho’ won an Academy Award for the best original song. A decade down the line, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo deviated from the strict dress code and received their Nobel Prize in economics donning a dhoti and a sari, respectively.It is strange that people who would not be caught dead attending a social function wearing casuals are unaware of workplace dressing etiquette. After all, one gets noticed and defined by their dressing sense. Try recalling an old friend or acquaintance. You will also immediately recall his or her dress sense, whether simple, elegant, flamboyant or shoddy. Each generation has always had their favourite style icons. During my teenage years, I pored over outfits worn by princess Diana, while my mom was fan of Jackie Kennedy’s classic style.Bridal colours, funeral colours and clothes to be worn while visiting a religious place are all defined by society. In some mosques, it is mandatory for women to wear a burkha, while one must drape a saree to enter certain temples. In gurdwaras, one is immediately told to cover one’s head properly if the head covering slips by even an inch.Traditionally, the Brits have been particular about dress etiquette. Our dress code and local customs seem rather strange to the English. Once our visitor, an Englishman, felt it was rude to take off one’s shoes and socks in public, so he decided to wait outside, while the rest of us went in to pay our respects at the Golden Temple, Amritsar. In another incident, a British friend of mine was amused to see men in western suits sitting cross legged on the carpet during a Sikh wedding!While at Cambridge, a batchmate of ours was an alumnus of IIT. In the 1980s, the intellectual IITian would be seen in a kurta-pyjama paired with kohlapuri chappals and a ‘jhola’ bag. Now, this batchmate changed into the aforementioned attire for dinner at the college hall, oblivious to the fact that Brits take formal dining very seriously.He was denied entry by a university official and told to dress up and come. Baffled, he muttered, “Oh! So in your country people dress up for dinner, while in our country we dress down for dinner.”Indeed, during hot summer months, we wash up and change into loose sleepwear before sitting down for dinner at home.sbedipau@yahoo.comThe writer is a professor at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-to-dress-up-or-dress-down-that-is-the-question-101625945796389.html

Three people have been arrested in connection with the case, while police teams have been formed to find the six other culprits, they added.According to the victim, a painter and a resident of Sarwan Kheda, the incident took place in Patari village on July 6, when he went to meet the woman he was in a relationship with. The victim has alleged that the family members of the woman, who belonged to the Other Backward Classes, tied him to a tree and assaulted him till he lost consciousness. The accused have, however, alleged that the victim was punished for harassing a woman at his workplace.A video of the incident went viral on Saturday, following which the Akbarpur police registered a suo motu complaint and arrested Manish Sharma and Shiva — both residents of Akbarpur — and an unidentified person. The viral video purportedly showed the victim being tied to a tree in full public view by one of the accused Sanjay Pal, who is absconding. A mob gathered and some of the men were purportedly seen beating the victim with sticks and brutalising him.Akbarpur station house officer, Tulsiram Pandey, said the man is undergoing treatment at the LLR hospital in Kanpur and a case has been registered against the accused under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.Additional Director General of Police (Kanpur zone), Bhanu Bhaskar, said the district magistrate and Kanpur Dehat SP later visited the village and spoke to members of the two castes to ensure law and order situation remains under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dalit-man-assaulted-and-brutalised-by-kin-of-partner-in-up-say-police-101625945074605.html

Congratulations to the cadre for this win,” Modi tweeted.The BJP’s state unit chief, Swatantra Dev, said the results were a precursor to the upcoming state polls. “Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the BJP would sweep the 2022 UP assembly polls,” he said.The Opposition, however, accused the state government of using the administration to gain an unfair advantage and carrying out attacks on the members of rival parties.“The BJP doesn’t believe in democracy and the Constitution. With the cooperation of the government, the BJP got votes polled in its favour,” said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav in a statement issued late on Saturday.“Block pramukh candidates and kshetra panchayat members were kidnapped in various districts and those who protested against rigging are being harassed. Despite having all the valid documents, many were forcibly deprived of voting,” he added.“What kind of a farce this election was where the police and local administration were openly made to side with the ruling party. It was a blatant, shameful display by the ruling party whose cadres also attacked the police. We saw shocking images of women candidates from the Opposition being ill-treated by BJP goons. It would have been better had the BJP declared itself a winner without a contest,” Samajwadi Party MLC Udaiveer Singh said.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet in Hindi, said that in Uttar Pradesh, “violence has been renamed masterstroke”.The clashes that erupted on Thursday during the filing of papers for the polls continued on Saturday with incidents of stone-pelting and firing being reported from different districts, the police said.“When a mob was asked to stop from coming near a polling booth [in Etawah district], it started stone-pelting and firing. We have all the CCTV footage. We will investigate once the election is over. A case will be filed soon,” Etawah senior superintendent of police Brajesh Kumar Singh said.At places, police had to resort to baton-charge and fire tear gas shells to break the clashes between members of different parties and supporters of Independent candidates, officials said.The UP Police arrested two people and suspended six personnel after a woman candidate was assaulted while filing nomination on Thursday.“Cases have been registered under Section 147 (Punishment for rioting) and 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) [among others] in connection with the incident of misbehaviour with a woman candidate during filing nomination,” the police said in a statement.Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Bahujan Samajh Party (BSP) chief Mayawati alleged that the law and order situation had deteriorated under the BJP government.“In the current reign of the BJP in UP, there is no rule of law, but a jungle raj is prevailing under which there has been widespread violence in the panchayat polls and indecent behaviour with a woman in Lakhimpur Kheri. This is highly condemnable,” she said.The CM, however, praised the State Election Commission for the “peaceful and fair” polls, stating that “conducting such a massive election process peacefully was praiseworthy.”(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/violence-clashes-as-up-elects-local-body-chiefs-101625944442246.html

Gone are the days when the NC leadership would weave a story in Kashmir and super weave another in Jammu and then superbly weave another one in Delhi. We are living in the age of electronic media, where such hypocrisy gets exposed,” he said.Vakil also questioned whether the NC believes that people in Jammu have been wronged previously by the delimitation commissions.“Does the NC believe that Kashmiris have been given more seats in the assembly than they deserve? If they think this delimitation commission was unconstitutional in Kashmir, why do they think it was not unconstitutional in Jammu? Why in Jammu they think that Jammu people have been wronged, and in Kashmir they think Kashmiri people have been wronged?” he said.Slamming the NC, Vakil said that even after J&K has been deprived of statehood, the NC is no mood to be truthful to the people of Kashmir.“Even after we are left with nothing, are they still going to do the same? Where has the shame gone? And for the people of J&K, please see where they stand. They stand with power,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delimitation-vakil-slams-nc-for-different-stands-on-jammu-kashmir-101625944955420.html

Emergency, Covid, post-mortem and medico-legal services will continue as usual.The doctors have been protesting against the government silence on their demand of no reduction in Non-Practicing Allowance (NPA) being paid to them. The doctors added that if the government did not resolve the issue of the NPA by July 18, all health and veterinary doctors would go on indefinite strike from July 19 onwards.

For the convenience of the public, government OPDs will be shut from July 15-17, but parallel OPDs would be run by the JGDCC in lawns of hospitals so that the needy persons would not be deprived of availing health/veterinary service.”During the boycott, all doctors across the state will donate blood. Doctors are irked as health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had recently assured the joint committee that the issue of NPA would be resolved within a week, but nothing has been even as many days have passed.  JGDCC convener Dr Inderveer Gill said this NPA agitation is to the save the public health care system.

The place where I was staying has been allotted to director finance despite my protests. So I had no option but to leave the house,” he said.“I wanted to go to my house in Shopian and stay there but police fear that I might become target of militants. Even the locals are not ready to give me an accommodation on rent due to security men attached with me. I had requested my PSOs to leave me alone but they have strict instructions not to leave me,” he added.Mir, who got elected as a DDC member from Shopian on PDP ticket, said he doesn’t know why the government took away his accommodation despite being a protected person.“In the present circumstances, I am unable to understand what to do. As an elected DDC member, I don’t have any government accommodation,” he said.Another PDP leader and former minister Zahoor Ahmad Mir was also asked by the estate officials to vacate his government quarter at Tulsi Bagh.“A few days ago, some officials from the estates department came and asked me to vacate my official house. My father was an elected legislator and was killed in a militant attack at Pampore in 2003. I can’t stay at my house in South Kashmir as I haven’t been provided any police protection there. I am in quandary what to do,” he said.Another former legislator Mohamed Yusuf Bhat, who is currently the member of PDP’s political affairs committee said he too was asked unofficially to vacate the government accommodation at Jawahar Nagar.“Several times, the estates officials told me to vacate the house, despite knowing the fact I am a former legislator and a protected person. I am still in the house because I have no place to go,” said Bhat.He questioned as to why only PDP leaders are being asked to vacate their government accommodations.“There are many people who have no entitlement and have still been allotted government accommodations and nobody is asking them to vacate their places,” he said.Another former legislator and senior PDP leader Nizamudin Bhat too has been asked to vacate the government accommodation.BJP state spokesman Altaf Thakur said politicians are eligible for government accommodation only till they hold any constitutional posts.“In J&K, even after losing their posts, politicians and other people have the habit of holding the accommodation which is against the law. I agree that politicians have threat but law is for everybody,” Thakur said.Director estates Subash Chibber said he isn’t aware about these cases and said his deputy is dealing with the issue.Deputy director estates Mohammad Aslam said it is the order from the high court that all unauthorised people occupying government accommodation should be asked to vacate their accommodation. “It has nothing to do with any particular political party,” Aslam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/estates-dept-asks-4-pdp-leaders-to-vacate-official-accommodations-in-srinagar-101625944777311.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Health workers should get bouquets, not brickbats||The fight against the virus is not over yet as the pandemic continues to torment the world. The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic had devastated the country, especially in the months of April and May, this year.Amid all this, doctors, nurses, attendants and technicians have led the fight from the front. Few realise how stressful, physically tiring and mentally exhausting it can be to work in Covid wards. As cases surged and more hospitals were converted into Covid hospitals, the same workforce was stretched with longer duty hours and more workload.At times, staff in intensive care units had to work on endless shifts without weekly offs. More often than not only two doctors had to manage around 100 to 150 patients. The stakes for healthcare workers were high as not only were they at risk of contracting the deadly virus themselves but they could also transmit the pathogen to their families.As per the Indian Medical Association around 700 doctors have succumbed to Covid in the second wave, while 748 had succumbed last year. The figures will be all the more horrifying, if one were to include the fatalities reported among nurses and other healthcare workers, considering the size of the workforce. No wonder healthcare workers have been called frontline workers.Periodically, we come across pieces by doctors and nurses chronicling the emotional upheaval they undergo as they witness the last moments of Covid patients. How emotionally taxing and hard it is to choose between two patients when only one ventilator is available. This often scars psyche and many healthcare workers have developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and have had to seek counselling.Despite their punishing hours and personal sacrifices, healthcare workers are sadly not appreciated enough. Far from being appreciated, incidents of violence against them are on the rise. Relatives of patients have beaten up doctors at several hospitals across the country and some nursing homes have been vandalised. Just recently, a doctor in Assam was manhandled.Things were worse at the outset of the pandemic when many doctors and nurses were barred from entering residential areas as it was feared that they could transmit the virus.We must honour healthcare workers in any way we can. In several countries, fast-food chains would offer a free coffee or burger to healthcare workers who could furnish a valid identity card during the first and second waves. In India, IndiGo Airlines sent a pack of goodies to a healthcare worker, if any passenger wanted to send a note of appreciation to their favourite doctor or nurse. Earlier this year, ITC, a leading hotel chain had announced a hefty 50% discount on bookings in their hotels for all doctors as a gesture of appreciation for their contribution to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.Last year, PM Modi had extolled the citizens to express gratitude to healthcare workers for their contributions during the pandemic. Such gestures are morale boosters. It is time that the contribution of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers is acknowledged and appreciated in a more fitting manner.dr_kochhar@hotmail.comThe writer is professor of gastroenterology at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-health-workers-should-get-bouquets-not-brickbats-101625944358149.html
11-07-2021||Other||Anil Joshi’s next move being keenly watched||AMRITSAR With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) expelling former local bodies minister Anil Joshi from the party for six years, for what state president Ashwani Sharma has termed ‘indiscipline’ and ‘anti-party activities’, Joshi’s next move will be keenly watched in political circles. Sources said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will be the least of his priorities, with former Punjab Police inspector general (IG) Kunwar Vijay Partap recently joining it. As Amritsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) in 2009, Kunwar had locked horns with Joshi, a BJP MLA then, who sat on a dharna against his own government seeking his transfer. It is also a given that Joshi will contest the next elections from any of the assembly segments in Amritsar. Kunwar, however, is likely to get the AAP ticket from Amritsar north, a Hindu dominated seat and the home turf of Joshi. Advocate RP Singh, a close aide of Joshi, who had quit the BJP in support of protesting farmers a few months ago, and joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), congratulated him. In a Facebook post, RP said, “Congratulations for being Independent.” The post carried the election symbol of the SAD, with a victory sign for 2022 assembly elections. This is being interpreted to mean that Joshi is likely to join the SAD. The seat-sharing arrangement between the SAD and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), however, is seen as a hurdle to this possibility. The SAD has already given Amritsar north seat from where Joshi was elected as MLA in 2007 and 2012, to the BSP. When queried, a senior SAD leader said, “Resolving this issue is not difficult, if Joshi is ready to join the party.” The SAD holds sway in some villages falling in this constituency. Joshi, however, will remember that SAD workers in Tarn Taran had thrashed his brother and aides during local elections years ago. For the Congress, sitting MLA Sunil Dutti, had defeated Joshi in his home turf in 2017. Another influential Congress leader, Amritsar mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu, is also from this seat. Political observers, thus, conclude that the Congress may not be a viable option for Joshi. Some of his aides claim he could also contest as an Independent, as he holds considerable influence in the constituency.When asked about his future, Joshi said, “I have no agenda/plan to join any other party. I have been punished for supporting farmers, and I accept it. They have not hung me, at least. I am a product of the organisation and am attached to their ideology from which I cannot detach myself.”“I have always worked with honesty for my country and Punjab. I am proud of being a Punjabi and will always raise the voice of state’s residents, irrespective of the consequences,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/anil-joshi-s-next-move-being-keenly-watched-101625944355493.html
11-07-2021||Delhi||Police bust international drug racket, recover heroin worth ₹2,500 crore||Delhi Police on Saturday said they have busted an international drug cartel with the arrest of four men, including an Afghan national, over the past week and recovered 354 kg heroin, estimated to be worth over ₹2,500 crore, in raids in Delhi, Faridabad and Gurugram. Police traced the cartel’s operational footprint across Portugal, Afghanistan, Iran and India, with the drugs reaching Mumbai from Iran’s Chabahar port, and then moved to different parts of the country.Police said it is the force’s biggest drug haul in at least 10 years. In 2019, Delhi Police recovered 330 kg of heroin, which was said to be the force’s biggest seizure then.A five-member police team were set on the trail of the massive drug operation after one of the gang members, Rizwan Ahmed, alias Rizwan Kashmiri, who was involved in peddling drugs in parts of Delhi, in addition to Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, was arrested from south Delhi with a kilogram of heroin.“On July 5, a reliable source informed us that Rizwan was going to deliver contraband in Ghitorni area of south Delhi. We laid a trap and arrested him with a kilo of heroin. This initial recovery proved to be just the tip of the iceberg. When Rizwan was questioned at length, he revealed that he works under the command of an Afghan national named Isha Khan who recently left India and is now based in Afghanistan,” said deputy commissioner of police(special cell) Pramod Kushwah.“Khan had directed Rizwan to contact Gurpreet Singh and Gurjot Singh, both residents of Punjab who operate the drug racket from Faridabad. We conducted a raid at their hideout in NSG Vihar co-op housing society, Sector-65, Faridabad and arrested them. Heroin weighing around 166 kg and 115 kg were found in two cars -- a Hyundai Verna and a Honda Amaze -- parked in the society,” added Kushwah.A subsquent search in the house yielded 70 kg of heroin stashed in a secret cavity in one of the beds.Police said the two men confessed that they were working under a man named Navpreet Singh, alias Nav, currently suspected to be hiding in Portugal. Gurpreet told police he had met Navpreet in Kapurthala Jail, Punjab.Separately, another police team questioned Rizwan and learned that he was in touch with an Afghan national Hazrat Ali who was arrested from his house in Gurugram sector 39 with two kilograms of the drug.Investigation so far has revealed that Gurpreet, Gurjot and Hazrat have been arrested in drug cases in the past and were out on bail.How the drugs reach IndiaExplaining how the drug is smuggled into the country, DCP Kushwah said that opium from Afghanistan --concealed as legitimate export items like talc stone, gypsum powder, basil seeds and packed in gunny bags, cartons and others -- is sent from Iran’s Chabahar port to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Navi Mumbai.From there, the consignment is sent to makeshift factories in Shiv Puri, Madhya Pradesh, for processing to get the final product -- heroin.“The factories procure various chemicals required for processing through a network of chemical shops located in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. Experts from Afghanistan also assist in the factories. Once processes, the heroin is sent to Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and various other parts of India, using different supply chains,” added Kushwah.Police said they are in contact with their counterparts in these states to trace the other members of the gang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-bust-international-drug-racket-recover-heroin-worth-2-500-crore-101625943939289.html

Besides close family and a priest, no one was allowed to be present. Vikramaditya’s wife Sudershna was also present.The ceremony started in the wee hours of Saturday. No one was allowed to carry mobile phone camera inside the hall. The family did not call the ceremony ‘rajyabhishekh’ of the king.In accordance with the tradition of the family Vikramaditya was declared the titular head (nominal head of the family). Vikramaditya, who was earlier referred to as ‘tikka sahib’ (the prince) will now be called ‘raja’ while Virbhadra’s wife Pratibha Singh will now be called ‘rajmata’.Considered a descendent of Praduymna, son of Lord Krisha, Virbhadra was born on June 23, 1934, to Raja Padam Dev and Shanti Devi in the royal family of Rampur Bushahr.Rampur Bushahr was known as Shonitpur which was believed to be founded by demon king Banasur which later came to be known as Bushar with its capital shifted from Sangla in Kinnaur to Rampur.Virbahdra was crowned as the king of Bushahr in 1947 at the age of 13 upon the demise of his father.As per tradition, his coronation had taken place before the cremation of Raja Padam Dev, who was the last king of Bushar. After his death, Virbhadra was made the titular head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vikramaditya-appointed-as-titular-raja-101625944179771.html
11-07-2021||Delhi||Haryana to blame for water shortage in Delhi: Raghav Chadha||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Saturday blamed the Haryana government for triggering a “severe water crisis” in the national capital, and exhorted the neighbouring state to adhere to orders by the Supreme court on water sharing. Haryana government, however, said it is adhering to water sharing pacts, and blamed “internal mismanagement in Delhi” for the scarcity.“Haryana has reduced the water supply into the river Yamuna by 120 million gallons per day (MGD), which has led to a decrease in drinking water production in Delhi by 100 MGD,” said Chadha, during a press conference.The water released in the Yamuna is treated at the various water treatment plants (WTPs) after which it reaches households.“Water production at Chandrawal WTP has come down from 90 MGD to 55 MGD, at Wazirabad WTP from 135 MGD to 80 MGD, and at Okhla WTP from 20 MGD to 15 MGD. The water production in Delhi has come down from 245 MGD to 150-145 MGD. This is at a time when the Upper Yamuna River Board directed Haryana to provide an additional 150 cusecs of water, besides providing the legally prescribed amount of water to meet the requirement,” said Chadha.Water supply has been disrupted in areas falling under the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), central Delhi, and parts of west and south Delhi on account of the reduced supply by Haryana.“Delhi receives Yamuna water coming from Haryana at three places - CLC channel, DSB channel, and the Wazirabad pond. There has been a heavy reduction in water received at the CLC and the DSB channels while the Wazirabad pond has not received the supply,” added Chadha.AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj too attacked the Haryana government for “repeatedly stalling Delhi’s water”. “Nearly 10% of total water consumption is not being released, which means around 20 lakh people across the city are not getting enough potable water,” said Bharadwaj in a statement.The DJB has been raising the water issue with Haryana since May.“I fold my hands and request the Haryana government to not reduce water supply to Delhi as we need water to drink,” said Chadha.Denying the DJB’s allegations, a Haryana irrigation department spokesperson said Delhi it has not reduced the water released to Delhi. “...Haryana is supplying 1,049 cusecs at Munak or more than 950 cusecs of water (against 939 cusecs) at Bawana contact point, through its canal system, which is more than their legitimate share... Shortage of water in Delhi is the result of internal mismanagement; Haryana has no role in it. It is worth mentioning that due to a delayed monsoon, Haryana is facing serious water scarcity but we are still maintaining water supply to Delhi without any reduction,” the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the Delhi government has failed to ensure adequate water supply, adding that the Capital is receiving its full share from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. “Delhi is facing water shortage because the Arvind Kejriwal-led city government has failed to check water pilferage and has not been able to use its full water treatment capacity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/haryana-to-blame-for-water-shortage-in-delhi-raghav-chadha-101625943947150.html

Passengers have also arrived in the state on special trains operated by other zonal railways.In May, nearly 200,000 people had left Maharashtra.Railway authorities have also stated that the pattern of passengers arriving back in the state has been witnessed in July till date as well.“The number of passengers arriving back in the state has increased. There has been a surge witnessed from the start of June and now in July as well. Special trains are being planned and operated towards Maharashtra from different parts of India,” said a senior CR official who did not wish to be named.After restrictions were announced by the Maharashtra government in April, nearly 600,000 people had left the state on regular and over 250 special outstation trains that were operated by both Central and Western Railway.

Captain Naveen Singhal has filed the public interest litigation (PIL) contending that an independent inquiry is necessary in the matter, although the director general (DG), shipping, has initiated an internal probe into the matter. Singhal has apprehended that the real root causes and systemic failures may not come out in the inquiry undertaken by the DG. In this regard, the marine consultant has said that he “believes that the issues and allegations that need to be investigated will include the role (acts of omission and commission and lapses) of the DG itself, because it is the DG who grants licences to self-propelled and non-propelled domestic and other ships to engage in trade in the coast of India and oversees, the condition and maintenance of ships and issues certificates to operate and ply.” His PIL points out that as early as March 10, the India Meteorological Department had announced the beginning of formation of a cyclone on India’s west coast that acquired the name Tauktae. As it consolidated over the Arabian Sea and moved towards the north-western direction, the cyclone started gathering intensity and was constantly upgraded. The PIL stated that while all other vessels returned to the safety of the port and anchorages, barge P305 with 261 on board, GAL Constructor – a floating crane with 137 crew members, and an ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) vessel named Sagar Bhushan continued near an unmanned platform. Being “dumb” barges, they were unable to move by themselves, stated the PIL. “As events showed, despite the early warnings, ONGC and Afcons (a contractor of ONGC), continued work on the platform [in Mumbai High oilfields] and retained their full complement untilled it was too late,” the PIL read. It added that after the weather became severe, the captain of GAL Constructor insisted on returning to safety of the harbour and accordingly, tugboat Varaprada brought it out of Mumbai High, but had to remain in unsheltered water outside Mumbai port, known as Bombay Floating Light. Varaprada anchored somewhere else. P305, the PIL said, continued at the platform in Mumbai High and was moved off the rig platform (for safety of the platform) and made to anchor in unsheltered waters, without any protection. “It is believed that even life rafts on P305 failed. The vessel is registered on Saint Kitts and Nevis, one of the most lax and notorious flags of convenience,” Singhal alleged. The PIL also raised the issue of sea worthiness of the vessels involved. ONGC as a matter of policy does not allow use of vessels that are more than 21 years old. However GAL Constructor was 48 years old, while Varaprada was built in 1984. Referring to the statement of Varaprada’s chief engineer – who is one of the two survivors of the vessel – the PIL added that when the tug began to take in water, its pumps were not working and the crew had to manually bail out water, which ultimately is an impossible task. “It could not or did not send out a distress signal till 5pm of May 17, that is 12 hours after it broke anchor and began to drift, and seven hours after it began to take water in. It is not imaginable that any sailor would delay asking for assistance for that long and presumably, the vessel’s communication status needs to be checked,” stated the PIL. The litigation will come up for hearing before the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pil-in-bombay-hc-seeks-independent-probe-into-p305-tragedy-101625944054792.html

The six-time chief minister was cremated with full state honours. His son Vikramaditya lit the pyre at around 4.30pm. People who had gathered in large numbers fondly remembered ‘Raja Sahib’ as a leader who stood by them through thick and thin. Virbhadra, 87, had breathed his last at the Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla, following a cardiopulmonary arrest on Thursday. Leaders from across political parties, including the national BJP president Jagat Parkash Nadda and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, paid tributes to the departed leader in Shimla on Friday. A large number of people thronged the national highway when Virbhadra’s mortal remains were being taken from Shimla to Rampur. People from across the state had descended on Rampur to pay last respects to ‘Raja Sahib’ who left an indelible imprint on the state’s public life through his political achievements for nearly six decades. “Dekho dekho kaun aaya, sher aaya, sher aaya… (Look who has come, the lion…” reverberated the crowd when the body was brought out of the palace as people could not hold back their emotions. Local folk bands accompanied the body to the cremation ground. “He was a ‘living God’ for us, he worked for the downtrodden, he was full of magnanimity,” said Purno Devi, 65, who had come all the way from interior 15-Beesh area of Rampur. There was no room for vehicles on the highway as the massive surge of supporters from claimed every inch of the stretch up to the crematorium. No one talked of Covid-19 protocols as police personnel struggled as people jostled to get the last glimpse of their beloved leaders. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, along with some members of his cabinet, himself flew to Rampur to pay last tributes to the six-time chief minister.

11-07-2021||Lucknow||BJP’s win in block pramukh elections shows people’s preference, says Yogi Adityanath||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday claimed a decisive victory in the violence-hit block pramukh elections in Uttar Pradesh.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that on the basis of trends, leads and results, the BJP, along with its ally Apna Dal (Sonelal), won at least 635 of the 825 block pramukh or kshetra panchayat chief’s posts for which elections were held across the state.Saturday’s big win came just a week after the BJP dominated the zila (district) panchayat chairpersons’ polls, winning 67 [including one win by its ally Apna Dal (S)] of the 75 seats.The party had won 349 of block pramukh posts unopposed by the close of the nomination withdrawal time on Friday itself. Election in the Mujhena block in Gonda district was not held as the term of the block pramukh has not been completed there.Adityanath, along with UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, arrived at the party office in Lucknow on Saturday evening to greet cadres.Adityanath described the win as “janta ka rujhaan (people’s preference). The state BJP chief said the victory had now set up the 2022 UP assembly polls nicely for the party.The chief minister said villages were at the centre of all development in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda and the blueprint was now ready. “These rural polls were the biggest test of democracy and the win shows that the people have incredible and unshakeable belief in BJP and its policies,” he said.Adityanath also said that in 76 seats, BJP cadres were engaged in “friendly contests” in these block pramukh polls where both contestants were from the ruling party.“Besides, we left 14 seats for our ally Apna Dal (S),” he said, adding that the whole process was carried out in a transparent manner.“The official results are yet to come in but it’s very clear that BJP has found favour with the (rural) masses in a big way,” Adityanath said at a press conference at the party office. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said the results were an indication that the BJP cadres would accept the 2022 UP poll challenge too.“Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the BJP would sweep the 2022 UP assembly polls,” the state BJP chief said. On the other hand, the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) accused the ruling BJP of “hijacking democracy”. The SP has already announced statewide protests on July 15, according to a statement issued by the party on Friday.Both Adityanath and Swatantra Dev didn’t take any questions at the party office. The BJP claimed a clean sweep in Agra, Ghaziabad, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Shravasti, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Pilibhit, Kannauj, Banda, Mahoba, Lalitpur, Sonbhadra and Varanasi districts.The Apna Dal won nine of the 14 block pramukh seats that the BJP left for it, said Apna Dal spokesman Rajesh Patel.The last of the rural elections were marked by visuals of BJP and Opposition members, mostly those from the Samajwadi Party, clashing at many places.At places, the police fired tear gas shells as in Etawah, where a senior police officer was slapped and later named BJP cadres as responsible for the attack on him while in Hathras the Samajwadi Party workers were accused of pelting the police with stones.At many other places, police had to resort to lathi-charge to disperse agitated party workers accusing the ruling party of misusing official machinery. From Muzaffarnagar to Ayodhya and Lucknow, the scene was no different as at all these places as the BJP and the SP engaged in claims and counterclaims.Several senior politicians from the BJP, as well as Opposition, had fielded candidates or family members in these polls. For instance, former UP assembly speaker and Samajwadi Party leader Mata Prasad Pandey’s wife contested and won from Itwa block of Siddharthnagar from where state’s basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi hails.In Rae Bareli’s Unchahar, UP labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya’s daughter-in-law contested and won.While the Congress couldn’t do well in its lone bastion Rae Bareli, in Pratapgarh’s Rampur Khaas assembly segment represented by party MLA Aradhana Misra ‘Mona’, the Congress managed to win three block pramukh seats. Piyush Singh, son of former Congress MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh, who is now in BJP and contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls unsuccessfully against Sonia Gandhi, BJP’s Raebareli MLA Aditi Singh’s mother Vaishali also won these block pramukh polls. On paper, Aditi is still a Congress MLA. The Samajwadi Party had won the first round, winning more seats than the BJP for the zila panchayat ward members’ poll. The win for the ruling party was accompanied by accusations and objectionable visuals of some male cadres’ physically stopping a woman candidate of the Samajwadi Party in Pasgawa block of Lakhimpur Kheri district.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has since suspended six local police officials on the issue. Some BJP members shared visuals showing armed supporters of opposition SP flexing muscles in Basti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjps-win-in-block-pramukh-elections-shows-people-s-preference-says-yogi-adityanath-101625943695398.html
11-07-2021||Delhi||Another day, another rain delay in national capital||June 15. June 29. July 10.In what is the most delayed arrival of monsoon in the 17 years since records have been made available, the summer rains have now defied yet another prediction. The monsoon was meant to arrive on Saturday, with some pre-monsoon showers the day before – but neither days saw a drop of rain. Instead, in a bulletin later on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department said the rains will take “another 24 hours” to reach the Capital.The IMD has shared monsoon onset dates since 2004. Typically, the onset occurs on June 29. The most delayed onset prior to this year was in 2006, when rains arrived on July 9.The delays this year — which altogether may be one of the latest yet — have led to a summer of an unusual spell of high-heat, high-humidity conditions across much of north-west India.For the past 10 days, Delhi and its surroundings have reeled under near-heatwave conditions. IMD officials, however, added that the wait may finally be over as monsoon winds reached Delhi on Friday. The easterly winds, which originate in the Bay of Bengal, extended northwestwards, reaching up to Delhi, Haryana and East Rajasthan on July 10, the IMD said.“Relative humidity has also increased over the region. Hence, the conditions continue to remain favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over Delhi, remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during next 24 hours,” the bulletin stated.RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD, said a prediction was made for July 10 but added that its “realisation each time is different”. “The easterly winds that bring the monsoon showers have reached the northwestern region including Delhi. Rain is expected between late Friday evening and Sunday noon. This is why we have given another 24 hours to officially declare its onset. It has already rained in parts of Punjab and Rajasthan while Haryana, south Punjab, south Rajasthan and Delhi are yet to get rainfall,” he said.Showers will intensify in Delhi as well as over Haryana, Chandigarh and West Uttar Pradesh between July 11 and 13, the bulletin said.The monsoon is arguably India’s most watched weather event, influencing much of the country’s farm sector where a vast majority of fields are still rain-fed. But predicting how it behaves has often been rife with errors, particularly for the north-western region where weather scientists say conditions are typically volatile.This year, the rains were first predicted to make a record early march across the country, initially predicted to hit Delhi by June 13-15. But in the latter half of the month, the progress slowed down before it eventually stalled and entered a three-week long break phase.Independent weather forecasters now also say that monsoon showers are likely to arrive in Delhi on July 11 and will continue over the following days. Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet weather, a private forecaster, said monsoon currents have reached Delhi-NCR and there is also a rise in humidity. “These conditions help cloud formation that triggers rainfall. Clouds are likely to be seen over the Capital on Sunday resulting in showers around noon. Though heavy rainfall is not expected, short spells of ‘moderate’ rain are likely over the next few days. This will also bring the mercury down to around 34°C,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/another-day-another-rain-delay-in-national-capital-101625943520005.html

His body has been kept in the temple for last darshan. His last rites will be performed on Sunday morning.“Mahant got infected with the corona virus during Haridwar Kumbh. After getting treatment in New Delhi, he came to Lucknow and later came back to the temple in Kashi. Meanwhile, on June 11, his health deteriorated, and he was admitted to Medanta in Lucknow. His condition remained critical for the last 10 days. After doctors’ lost hope of improvement, we shifted him to a private hospital in Varanasi where he breathed his last,” said Shankar Puri, deputy mahant of the temple. “Rameshwar Puri was appointed Mahant of Shri Annapurna Math temple after the death of the then Mahant Tribhuvan Puri in 2004.

11-07-2021||Delhi||Parents’ association demands relief from last year’s school fee arrears||The Delhi Parents Association on Friday wrote to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal demanding relief from last year’s fee arrears private schools are charging following a High Court order, citing survey filled by over 3,000 parents wherein 98% of them opposed the arrears.On May 31, the Delhi high court set aside two orders issued by the Delhi government last year, prohibiting private schools from collecting annual charges and development fees during the Covid-induced lockdown.The court directed that schools may collect these charges for the last academic year retrospectively in six monthly instalments starting from June 10, but only after applying a 15% reduction on total school fees in lieu of facilities not used by students during the lockdown. The court also allowed schools to charge the whole fee, including tuition fee and other charges, for the 2021-22 academic year.The Delhi government’s education department challenged the order in the Supreme Court which refused to stay the order. On July 1, the Delhi government issued an order allowing 460 private schools, which had filed a petition in the high court, to charge last year’s arrears as per the court direction and barred other schools from charging development and annual fees from parents.The Delhi Parents Association started an online survey on Google forms to collect parents’ responses on the matter of fees and sent it to the CM and the L-G. “Over 3,000 parents responded with the majority of them being from schools that have been granted permission to charge the last year’s arrears. Around 98% of these parents said they are against the Delhi government’s July 1 order, and 87% of parents think that the Delhi government’s education department failed to properly represent parents’ point of view in the court. We have sent the responses of over 3,000 parents to the Delhi CM and L-G, requesting them to help the parents at a time when the majority of them are witnessing financial challenges due to the pandemic,” said Aprajita Gautam, president of the association.“We request the Delhi government to listen to the demands of parents and put their issues before the double bench during the hearing scheduled on Monday. So that parents and children can get relief from the court,” the association said in the letter.A senior Delhi government official said that they are taking every possible step to provide relief to parents. “The Delhi government’s education department had in fact challenged the Delhi high court’s order in the Supreme Court in the matter. The government will continue taking all possible steps to safeguard the rights of parents,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parents-association-demands-relief-from-last-year-s-school-fee-arrears-101625943257292.html
11-07-2021||Delhi||Collected ₹27+ cr in fines for Covid norm violations: Delhi cops||In a bid to enforce Covid protocols in the national capital, the city police has collected over ₹27 crore in fines between April 19 and June 20 this year, with over 900,000 challans issued for the violations, the Delhi high court was informed.In a status report filed before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh on Friday, the Delhi Police said it has issued 121,230 fines for not wearing face masks in public, and 20,493 fines for flouting distancing norms.The police have also said that 11,144 FIRs have been registered and 10,209 people been arrested in the two-month period. The police said it issued a total of 908,243 fines for various violations of Covid-appropriate protocol as put in place by state authorities.The Delhi government, in a separate report, also submitted on Friday, has told the court that it has issued over 580,000 fines till June 30, with the most being handed out in north Delhi district. The fewest fines were issued in south district with 22,208.Giving a district wise breakup of the challans, the state government told the court that it has taken several measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the city, including issuing notices and shutting down various markets after overcrowding.The reports were filed in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) initiated last month by the high court after it took note of photographs sent to one of the high court judges on WhatsApp by a doctor of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) that showed Covid-19 protocol violations by street vendors in the city.In response, the court sought status reports from the authorities on steps being taken to control the spread of pandemic while observing that such breaches would only hasten the arrival of a third wave of the infection.The Delhi government, in the report filed through additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan, informed the court that it issued a show cause notice to Vegas Mall in Dwarka on July 4 after it failed to adhere to the 50% seating capacity limit in restaurants at their food court. The government said the food court was ordered to stay shut from 7pm on July 4 to 11pm on July 5.Similarly, the Hauz Khas sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) on July 4 ordered the closure of the food court at Select City Mall in Saket, due to violation of seating capacity norms, as laid out by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). The food court was shut for that day (july 4), the government said.The matter was listed for Friday but could not be taken up due to a shortage of time, and will now be heard in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/collected-27-cr-in-fines-for-covid-norm-violations-delhi-cops-101625943335929.html
11-07-2021||Delhi||1,000 AC low-floor buses: AAP, BJP lock horns over LG panel’s report||A report prepared by a committee set up by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to investigate the Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) tendering and procurement of 1,000 air-conditioned (AC) low-floor buses became a political flashpoint between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the Capital’s ruling party said it would go ahead with the purchase of the buses, even as the opposition accused it of “misleading people”.HT on Saturday reported that the three-member panel, prima facie, did not find criminal misconduct by any public official, even as it recommended that the 12-year annual maintenance contract (AMC) worth ₹3,412-crore awarded by the DTC be scrapped over “procedural lapses”.State transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Saturday said the Delhi government will now go ahead with the work order for the procurement of the 1,000 buses, for which two companies were appointed, but added that they will revisit the AMC in light of the panel’s recommendations.“These new buses will give a much-needed boost to the city’s public transport as Delhi needs 11,000 buses and we currently have over 6,600. Buses were last added in the DTC in 2008 and the fleet hit an all-time low of around 4,500 buses. Gradually, when the AAP came to power, we started adding buses through the cluster scheme,” he said.Addressing a digital press conference on Saturday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “The investigation committee of the BJP-led central government, after going through at least 3,000 documents, has not been able to find any flaws or irregularities in the purchase of 1,000 DTC buses. The report of the inquiry committee has made it clear that the government in Delhi led by Arvind Kejriwal is honest. Delhi BJP leaders in the opposition are trying to malign the government’s image,” he said.However, senior leaders of the BJP’s Delhi unit in a press conference on Saturday said the entire deal was meant to favour two companies as a quid pro quo and siphon off ₹3,500 crore from taxpayers’ funds.Rohini BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, who registered a complaint with the city anti-corruption bureau (ACB) and the LG in March said the Delhi government is wilfully not focussing on the part of the report that recommends scrapping the AMC.“The ruling AAP is misguiding [people] by saying that the committee has inquired into the procurement process of the buses and given the DTC a clean chit. This is just another cheap way to mislead the people. After finding the AMC process and contract faulty, the committee suggested scrapping the deal entirely,” he said.The report, portions of which HT has reviewed, stated that the evaluation criteria adopted by DTC was flawed and not in consonance with the provision of relevant guidelines.“Since the technical bids for supply of buses was opened ahead of the bid for AMC, the number of bidders for AMC was known, leaving limited room for negotiation. Both bidders had an assured number of buses to maintain, since only two bidders participated in the purchase bid. Hence, there was no real price discovery in the absence of any cost benchmarking,” it stated.The report also said that the panel examined the material on record and observed that the allegations in the complaint essentially pertain to the AMC of buses.“The committee therefore focused its attention only on the procurement process of AMC of the buses... The tendering process of purchase of buses warrants no interference and suffers from no major infirmity... The committee, prima facie, did not come across any material to impute criminal misconduct attributable to any public official,” the report said. The committee, however, recommended floating fresh tenders for its annual maintenance contract (AMC) over what it described as “procedural lapses” arising out of a “bona fide decision-making process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/1000-ac-low-floor-buses-aap-bjp-lock-horns-over-lg-panel-s-report-101625943161043.html
11-07-2021||Other||Cooperation ministry: Key citadel of Congress, NCP in trouble?||If former chief minister (CM) Narayan Rane’s induction into the Union cabinet has come as a clear signal to Shiv Sena that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will get more aggressive against it in the coming days, the creation of a separate ministry for the cooperative sector has sent alarm bells ringing in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-Congress camp. Maharashtra has strong network of cooperative bodies, which also forms a significant support base for the NCP-Congress. There are apprehensions in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition that the cooperative sector in the state may turn into a new battleground between BJP and NCP-Congress, with the former trying to end the monopoly of the two parties in the sector. For decades, the cooperative sector has been the backbone of rural economy in Maharashtra. It changed the face of rural Maharashtra, with farmers getting benefit, as cooperative sugar factories, banks and dairy units were formed. It significantly reduced their exploitation by traders and middlemen as farmers became stakeholders in the local cooperative units. The cooperatives movement flourished in various parts of Maharashtra as successive Congress governments encouraged the same since the state’s formation in 1960. Maharashtra now has around 225,000 cooperative bodies comprising sugar mills, banks, dairies and cotton spinning mills. The rural economy of almost entire western Maharashtra and several parts of north and central Maharashtra got a boost with the emergence of the cooperative sector. It also became a strong support base for Congress and later its offshoot, the NCP. Local politics, especially in the sugar belt in western Maharashtra spread from Pune to Kolhapur-Solapur, is closely connected with the cooperatives sector. It has become the strength of the NCP-Congress which is why even during the BJP’s dominance in the 2014 and 2019 Assembly elections, the two parties had managed to retain many of their strongholds in rural Maharashtra. The control over the sector and its close link with power has also led to lot of malpractices and corruption. There have been a number of episodes of corruption and mismanagement in running cooperative banks and sugar factories. The mismanagement and irregularities in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank – the state’s apex cooperative bank – compelled then CM Prithviraj Chavan to dissolve the board of directors of the banks and appoint an administrator. The directors of the bank were mostly politicians from NCP and Congress. “Though the official version is that the Union cooperation ministry is formed to improve the cooperation sector, it is likely that the Centre will take charge of the mechanism that controls the cooperative movement. It assumes political significance as the cooperative sector has a strong presence in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat, and has substantial influence over politics in these states. In Maharashtra, it forms the backbone of a party like NCP, whose chief Sharad Pawar was the architect of the three-party coalition (comprising Sena, NCP and Congress) formed to keep BJP out of power in the state,” said political analyst Hemant Desai. “The Enforcement Directorate is already probing the allegations of corruption and misappropriation in MSC Bank as well as in the sale of Jarandeshwar Cooperative Sugar Factory in Satara which might get linked to [deputy CM] Ajit Pawar. It won’t be surprising if the NCP-Congress-controlled cooperative units come under scrutiny and if attempts are made by BJP to end their control over the sector,” he added. On Friday, Ajit Pawar expressed his suspicion over the Centre’s move over forming the cooperation ministry. “The intention of the Central government is yet to be clear but they may have something in their minds. It will be known only after the new legislations are introduced for the sector, just like the three contentious farm laws over which farmers are now protesting for the past eight months,”Ajit Pawar said in Pune. He added that the cooperative sector has existed from the past 100 years and states have their own rules to deal with it. He insisted that the Centre should not “encroach” on states’ rights. “There are some black sheep in the sector and I’m not denying it, but defaming the entire cooperation sector because of them is not fair,” the deputy CM said. Former CM and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said, “Those who have done good work for the sector must be happy but those involved in malpractices must be obviously worried because [Union home minister] Amitbhai Shah will be heading the cooperation portfolio. He is also an expert in the field as he was a part of the sector before coming into politics.” State BJP president Chandrakant Patil refuted the allegations that the new ministry is aimed at creating trouble for the cooperative sector in the state. “The new ministry is formed to improve the sector. In fact, the cooperative sugar factories in the state were benefitted as the [Narendra] Modi government [in the Centre] for the first time fixed the minimum sale price for sugar,”Patil said in Pune on Saturday. He added that there was no connection between his letter sent to Shah seeking probe into the sale of the 29 troubled cooperative sugar factories to private companies and the Centre’s decision. “The decision to form a ministry for cooperation had been taken earlier,” said Patil. The tussle between Centre and state over the sector began even before the formation of the cooperation ministry. Recently, MVA government had decided to form a task force comprising ministers from the three parties to explore alternatives against the Centre’s amendment in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, last year. The decision was taken following directives issued by Pawar. According to party insiders, the NCP leadership believes that the new amendments in the Act will end the cooperative banking system. The 13-member committee formed on June 7 is headed by state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and eight other ministers from all the three ruling parties. Experts are of the view that most of the provisions brought in the Banking Regulation Act are against the principles of the cooperative sector and creates a conflict. “Most of the provisions passed by the Central government are related to the Companies Act which are against the principles of the cooperative sector,” said Vidyadhar Anaskar, former chairman and administrator of MSC Bank. He said that the cooperative sector is a state subject. “If the objective of both the state and the Central government is to strengthen the cooperative sector then there won’t be any issue. But if not, then the chances of conflict in the federal structure cannot be denied. As of now the objective of the ministry is said to be providing a separate administrative, legal and policy framework,” Anaskar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cooperation-ministry-key-citadel-of-congress-ncp-in-trouble-101625943154857.html

11-07-2021||Delhi||Now, pay up to ₹1 lakh for violating noise pollution norms in Delhi||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has revised the penalties issued for noise pollution caused by loudspeakers and diesel generator (DG) sets in the national capital notifying hefty fines up to ₹1 lakh for violation of rules. The move has come following directions from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for better enforcement and compliance of noise pollution norms.For the first time, the DPCC has come out with an order that not only lists the different sources of noise pollution but also categorically defines the penalty to be levied if the noise pollution levels cross the prescribed limits.As per the DPCC order dated June 25, a fine of ₹10,000 will be imposed for noise pollution caused by loudspeakers or public address systems. “For DG sets over 1000 kilovolt-ampere (KVA) emitting sound above the prescribed rules, the penalty will be ₹1 lakh as well as sealing of the equipment,” stated the order.Besides, using construction equipment that make a lot of noise will invite a fine of ₹50,000 as well as seizure/sealing of equipment, it said.So far, loudspeakers making noise beyond the permissible limits led to confiscation of equipment, a fine of upto ₹ 5,000 as well as imprisonment up to five years, depending on the gravity of the violation under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. This rule was applied to the noise pollution generating from all other sources and was tweaked to determine the penalty for each category based on the seriousness of the violation.The order further states that people found bursting firecrackers in residential or commercial areas will be fined ₹1,000. Bursting firecrackers in the silent zone will attract a fine of ₹3,000. In case of firecrackers being used in public rallies, marriage ceremonies and other religious events, the fine levied can go up to ₹10,000 for residential and commercial zones and ₹30,000 in the silent zones.“Earlier, there was no upper limit fixed for penalties to be levied on violators. The step has been taken for better compliance to noise pollution rules as well as to bring realism in the quantum of the penalty levied,” said a senior DPCC official.Last year, the NGT asked the pollution-control agencies to take further steps to ensure noise pollution is under control at the ground level for protection of public health and environment. Following this, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in a report submitted to the NGT on June 12, proposed higher penalties for the violations, which were cleared by the latter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/now-pay-up-to-1-lakh-for-violating-noise-pollution-norms-in-delhi-101625942655593.html
11-07-2021||Kolkata||Actress alleges getting rape threats in Kolkata, police start probe||A Bengali actress alleged that she was receiving rape threats on social media following which sleuths of the Kolkata Police’s cybercrime department started a probe, HT has learnt. “We have initiated a case under various sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act 2000 and the Indian Penal Code on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman,” said a senior officer of the detective department. The actress told media persons on Saturday that her pictures were morphed and the sexually explicit pictures were posted on social media. “I was receiving threats that I would be raped. Initially, I was asked by the police to ignore it but the harassment went on. I feared for my life,” the woman told media persons. She also alleged that whenever she would block a profile, a second profile was created to send her messages and threats. “The morphed pictures were even sent to my mother and friends,” she added. Meanwhile, in another incident, the son of a local Trinamool Congress leader from Hooghly district allegedly uploaded the morphed pictures of the daughter of a police officer on social media. Her phone number was also uploaded. The woman and the accused knew each other, officials said. Even though the family lodged a complaint with the Bidhannagar Police in June, police started a case under the IT Act on Saturday. “If being a police officer I don’t get justice then what would happen to the common citizens,” said the woman’s father who is a police officer of deputy superintendent of police.“I was getting calls not only from other states but also from abroad after my morphed photo and number was uploaded on porn sites,” said the woman. The two incidents have triggered a political slugfest between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Police have become inactive. Some of the efficient officers have been sidelined by the TMC government. Maybe they didn’t do the task which the ruling party asked them to during the elections. They had to face the consequences. What would the police do? Ultimately it is the party leaders who are running the police,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP president in West Bengal. “Cybercrime is not just restricted to West Bengal. It happens across the world. West Bengal police act on such cases very promptly. There is no party interference. Such allegations are baseless,” said Sujit Bose, TMC minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/actress-alleges-getting-rape-threats-in-kolkata-police-start-probe-101625942795279.html
11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Rohtak land release: Independently look into case, SC tells CBI||The Supreme Court has said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will independently look into the legality and bona fides of the action of the persons responsible for illegally entertaining the applications of real estate developer Uddar Gagan Properties Limited. The agency will also probe release of the Rohtak land to Uddar Gagan in light of the fact that it had no title to the land on the date of the notification under Section 4 of the existing Land Acquisition Act, and proceed against erring officials in accordance with law. The apex court had on July 7 ordered a CBI investigation into the release of land in Rohtak to the real estate developer during the Congress rule with Bhupinder Singh Hooda at the helm. The SC in its detailed order said that the matter shall be looked into by the CBI without in any way being influenced by the reports and conclusions as stated in this order. The apex court was referring to the outcome of the multiple inquiries ordered by the state government, which as per the amicus curiae only concluded that there was “systemic failure” rather than considering the individual actions of those who were responsible. The SC in its order said that amicus curiae Jaideep Gupta while highlighting the May 2016 directions of the court has said the drift of the apex court’s decision showed that the state power was deliberately misused for private gain, and therefore the direction required the state to “inquire into the legality and bona fides of the actions of the persons responsible for illegally entertaining the application of the builder and allotting the land to it”. “The amicus curiae further submits that initially the matter was referred to a senior civil servant. After his report, which suggested systemic failure and that no action be taken against any official, the matter was (handed) over to a retired judge of the high court. The matter was then considered under five heads as stated in the report and with respect to the fifth head, the matter was again dealt with by another civil servant. This report also concluded that there was systemic failure rather than considering the individual actions of those who were responsible,’’ the SC said. The SC said the amicus curiae has invited the court’s attention to a subsequent judgment in the Manesar land release case, in which similar misuse of state power for private gain was the matter in issue. In that case, the inquiry is presently being conducted by the CBI. The amicus curiae, therefore, submits that on similar lines, inquiry in the present matter may also be handed over to the CBI to secure the ends of justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rohtak-land-release-independently-look-into-matter-sc-tells-cbi-101625942735327.html
11-07-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra reports 3,583 casualties in 10 days||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 8,296 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the count to 6,149,264. The tally of active cases increased to 114,000 after 6,026 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.The state saw 494 casualties, which also includes 315 fatalities owing to the reconciliation process of Covid-19 deaths. Kolhapur reported the highest toll with 26 deaths. It was followed by Aurangabad with 23 fatalities.The state has reported 3,583 casualties in the past 10 days. Of them, 2,030 fatalities were added as part of the reconciliation process of Covid-19 deaths. This has lifted the number of deaths in the state to 125,528. The case fatality rate of the state is also rising gradually and has reached 2.04%.Last month, it had reported 26,269 casualties, including 18,727 deaths as part of the reconciliation process.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director general of health services (Maharashtra) and advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said deaths are more in younger generation compared to the first wave. “Casualty figures have increased for two reasons. One, the number of cases is much higher than the first wave and going by the trend, at least one percent of the total cases lose their lives. Second, deaths are more in younger generation this time, apart from senior citizens. This is because of late detection and hospitalisation and hence casualties are higher in the state,” Dr Salunkhe said.He said that they want to bring CFR down to 1.5% or even less and attempts are being made for the same.After cases of Delta-plus variants were found, the state government has imposed stricter norms by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three. The first two levels having maximum relaxations were removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on June 25. But daily cases are not reducing in the state. On Friday, Mumbai clocked 503 cases and reported 727,136 cases till date. It also recorded 13 fatalities, taking the toll to 15,612. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 235,020 samples and had a positivity rate of 3.52%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 14.04%, according to the data issuedon Saturday. A day after vaccinating only 195,396 doses, the state improved its daily tally by administering 362,062 doses on Saturday, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.

Haryana government, however, said it is adhering to water sharing pacts, and blamed “internal mismanagement in Delhi” for the scarcity.“Haryana has reduced the water supply into the river Yamuna by 120 million gallons per day (MGD), which has led to a decrease in drinking water production in Delhi by 100 MGD,” said Chadha, during a press conference. The water released in the Yamuna is treated at the various water treatment plants (WTPs) after which it reaches households.“Water production at Chandrawal WTP has come down from 90 MGD to 55 MGD, at Wazirabad WTP from 135 MGD to 80 MGD, and at Okhla WTP from 20 MGD to 15 MGD. The water production in Delhi has come down from 245 MGD to 150-145 MGD. This is at a time when the Upper Yamuna River Board directed Haryana to provide an additional 150 cusecs of water, besides providing the legally prescribed amount of water to meet the requirement,” said Chadha.Water supply has been disrupted in areas falling under the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), central Delhi, and parts of west and south Delhi on account of the reduced supply by Haryana.“Delhi receives Yamuna water coming from Haryana at three places - CLC channel, DSB channel, and the Wazirabad pond. There has been a heavy reduction in water received at the CLC and the DSB channels while the Wazirabad pond has not received the supply,” added Chadha.AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj too attacked the Haryana government for “repeatedly stalling Delhi’s water”. “Nearly 10% of total water consumption is not being released, which means around 20 lakh people across the city are not getting enough potable water,” said Bharadwaj in a statement. The DJB has been raising the water issue with Haryana since May.“I fold my hands and request the Haryana government to not reduce water supply to Delhi as we need water to drink,” said Chadha.Denying the DJB’s allegations, a Haryana irrigation department spokesperson said Delhi it has not reduced the water released to Delhi. “...Haryana is supplying 1,049 cusecs at Munak or more than 950 cusecs of water (against 939 cusecs) at Bawana contact point, through its canal system, which is more than their legitimate share... Shortage of water in Delhi is the result of internal mismanagement; Haryana has no role in it. It is worth mentioning that due to a delayed monsoon, Haryana is facing serious water scarcity but we are still maintaining water supply to Delhi without any reduction,” the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the Delhi government has failed to ensure adequate water supply, adding that the Capital is receiving its full share from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. “Delhi is facing water shortage because the Arvind Kejriwal-led city government has failed to check water pilferage and has not been able to use its full water treatment capacity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-to-blame-for-water-shortage-in-delhi-raghav-chadha-says-101625942434777.html

He filed nine affidavits of persons whose close relatives reportedly suffered on account of lack of proper or timely treatment at the hospital. “More people died due to lack of treatment, ICUs and oxygen than Covid-19. Patients suffered due to carelessness of the government,” Chouhan alleged.The HC bench underlined that the issues flagged in the letter of the petitioner, as well as the affidavits of the nine deponents, raise serious questions involving the fundamental right to health which is an inherent part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.The HC, in its order, said the PIL raises serious questions involving the fundamental right to health, which is an inherent part of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.“VIMSAR is one of the premier medical institutions of the state catering to the medical needs of the population of western Odisha. It has to function in the manner befitting its status of providing the highest standard of care and treatment to everyone for that purpose. While during Covid-19 times all resources were indeed stretched and many medical personnel and nursing staff went beyond the call of duty to render tireless service, it is entirely possible that there were lapses. Whether this was for the reasons beyond the control of the doctors, nurses and staff of VIMSAR and whether it was avoidable, can properly be established only in a detailed enquiry,” the HC said in its order.The HC asked the inquiry officer to conclude the probe within three months and submit a report by November 1.The court said the incidental expenses of the inquiry officer in conducting the enquiry and his functioning shall be borne by the government of Odisha as per the bills raised on an actual basis without any delay.Last month, another PIL was filed in the Orissa High Court over alleged gross mismanagement and negligence in the treatment of patients in a Covid hospital of Baripada town.Advocate Bibhuti Bhusan Choudhury filed the PIL highlighting a disturbing incident at a Covid hospital in Baripada where patients, including a woman, were seen lying naked on the floor of a washroom. Besides, Choudhury also drew the attention of the court regarding the cremation of bodies of multiple Covid-19 victims in a single pyre at a cremation ground in Bolangir district.Choudhury urged the HC for a court-monitored probe into these incidents and demanded action against the hospital authorities and other officials responsible for such incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/orissa-hc-orders-probe-into-allegations-mismanagement-in-covid-hospitals-101625942315379.html

The office of career services (OCS) team can cater to both online and offline selection processes as per the needs of recruiters and guidelines of the institute,” said a spokesperson for the OCS team of IIT-Delhi.An officer from the placement cell of IIT-Bombay confirmed that the institute will go ahead with virtual placements for the upcoming season as well.IIT-Patna, which saw a 10.39% rise in the number of job offers in the last placement season, will also continue with the online mode. “This decision has been made taking the current situation and everyone’s well-being into account. Secondly, going online does have its own benefits. It draws in many more firms, owing to the fact that this mode of recruitment proves to be more cost and time-efficient. Statistically speaking, it helps a higher volume of students get placed which can be attributed to the ability to scale up the whole process,” said Kripa Shankar Singh, training and placement officer, IIT-Patna.Singh said engaging companies with the institute and its students outside the placement scenario helped in strengthening relationships. “Such interactions and engagements improve the statistics of the hiring process,” he said.Some IITs have already started approaching employers and are experiencing a welcome trend. “The registration process of companies has already started and the number is growing by the day which is very similar to pre-Covid days. It is already looking better than last year,” said Vinay Sharma, professor-in-charge, training and placement, IIT-Roorkee.Despite a slight drop in number of companies registering for placements in 2020 compared to 2019, IIT-Madras managed to place 821 students from the 2020 graduating batch, compared with 727 the previous year. “We are in the process of incorporating the lessons learnt from the previous year to evolve an improved standard operating procedure in this regard. The placement team will be reaching out to students who need specific assistance, especially with lockdown still affecting many parts of the country,” said CS Shankar Ram, advisor (training and placement), IIT-Madras.Most IITs have already started reaching out to their students with the aim of ensuring that everyone is ready to ace placement tests as well as interviews in the virtual mode. “We collaborated with various online platforms to train students in the virtual mode. The results have shown that virtual training has been successful in upskilling students,” said Bithiah Grace Jaganathan, faculty coordinator, placement, IIT-Guwahati.“IIT-Hyderabad has a dedicated career cell, focussing on conducting sessions and workshops for students such as career counselling, soft skills, resume building, technical/coding skills, group discussions, etc. All the sessions and workshops are being conducted virtually for the benefit of students,” said a spokesperson for IIT-Hyderabad.While conducting placements completely online has had its trouble, some IITs found it easier t compared to others. "In terms of participation in career guidance sessions, it has been easier for the students to connect and attend the sessions. In order to make sure that students have been provided with proper counselling and guidance, the number of speakers has also been increased by the Institute. With the online mode of (placement) sessions, it has become easy for the counsellors, experts and guides to connect and interact with the students and brief them, which was not the case earlier because of the remote location (of the institute)," said Sunny Zafar, advisor, placement cell of IIT Mandi. This institute managed to attract more companies to participate in placement 2020 compared to the previous years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iits-gear-up-for-another-year-of-online-placements-train-students-in-advance-101625942075286.html

With this, roughly 10% of the target population in the state capital is now fully vaccinated, according to official data. A total of 18,761 beneficiaries took the jab on Saturday, including 7529 second dose recipients. Till now, 349,255 people have taken their second dose in the state capital. The target population to be vaccinated in Lucknow is over 35 lakh (3.5 million). In all, 1,606,322 doses have been administered here, including 1,257,067 first doses, according to the health department data. “The enthusiasm shown by beneficiaries between 18 and 45 years of age has given the much-needed boost to the vaccination coverage. With a probable third wave of Covid, more people should come forward and take their vaccine dose,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. The vaccination started in Lucknow, along with the rest of the country, on January 16. Among those fully vaccinated, over 1.20 lakh (120,000) are in the 45 to 59 years’ age group, over 90,000 in the 60-plus age group, besides over 54,000 healthcare workers, more than 48,000 frontline workers and over 40,000 between 18 and 45 years of age. “We are working to raise the daily target of vaccination. In the next week, the number will rise considerably,” said Dr MK Singh, in-charge of vaccination in Lucknow. Some experts say the private sector should be involved more to give a boost to vaccination.“If more private hospitals conduct Covid vaccination, the average daily number will certainly rise sharply,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director of the Healthcity Hospital in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nearly-10-of-lucknow-s-target-population-fully-vaccinated-against-covid19-101625939795213.html

Sameer Dhamangaonkar, the producer representing the company “Snovel”, and I were in agreement that this was a novel that warranted adapting it to the audio medium rather than a plain narration. I had begun writing an audio-play script, drawing on my short experience of writing screenplays, and had finally found a way to adapt it and tell a visual story through sound. After the script had been approved, we started casting for it. Amey Wagh and I have been working together since our college days, where we first met. When I started directing, I used to see Amey in the lead role of whatever I did, by default. And he too has never given me any reason to feel that anyone else would have done a better job. I asked Amey to read the book and explained the project to him. He too was excited to try something new. I read the book and the script several times over and tried to place the voices of the characters to the people I knew around me. I was mostly successful in assigning unique voices to many characters. Though when I look back, I realise that I could have widened my scope a little and offered some Hindi speaking roles to actors whose first language was Hindi. It would have been a huge value addition. The project’s sound designer and music composer was another friend, Gandhaar Sangoram, with whom I had begun my journey of direction and he had been a constant in all productions. He had recently made a makeshift studio in his home and we decided to record everything there, so that we would not have to worry about studio hours and expenses and could give the project the time it deserved. We also took a decision to record scenes with up to four actors when all the actors concerned were present. We could have planned to record the part of one actor at a go and then add layers of the recordings of other actors. Usually that’s how films are dubbed. But we decided to rehearse an entire scene first, with all actors. Then, when all of us were ready, we would record the scene. It improved the give and take and also helped in getting natural vocal reactions from actors wherever necessary. Usually when recorded individually, these small things have the potential to sound fake, and by using this technique we minimised that risk. Gandhaar had composed a theme right after he had read the script, even before the recordings had started. That music piece also set a tone for many scenes and scene-to-scene transitions. I have always believed in getting music pieces in hand before starting a project. It helps me visualise the moments in the scenes. While adapting the book, I had changed the voice from third person to first person and had thus added a narrator, who was in fact the protagonist, Vishwanath, telling the story thirty years later. We approached veteran actor Dilip Prabhavalkar to see if he would be ready to play the part. I thought that there was a similarity between Amey’s voice and his. Even he accepted it graciously and was extremely warm and welcoming with any ideas and changes. After recording sessions that lasted for more than a month, we finally had the first cut of the audio book! Sameer and I listened to it individually. While we had a few minor creative differences, there was an elephant in the room that needed to be addressed. The audio book was well over three hours long. In the past “Snovel” had produced books which were hardly two hours long and they were looking to maintain that same length. Their main concern was that one audio CD could hold around an hour’s content and a content this large would increase the number of CDs. It would increase their cost of production and packaging too. I understood their predicament, but was unsure what to delete from the book. I met with them again and told them that reducing the length would imply editing ruthlessly. It was something that I was willing to take a shot at, but I was sure that it wouldn’t stay true to the original book. The beauty of the book was in the details and the descriptions and we would be losing most of that content. I also felt that we should not worry about the length if the content is good and if we have control over the medium too. After going back and forth a few times even they agreed and decided to use a different encoding format that would enable them to fit the content in just one CD. In hindsight, I think that was a good decision as in nearly a year, CDs became obsolete, and in another year, “Snovel” launched their own app and shifted their entire library there. It has been nearly seven years since the audio book released and I receive some feedback about it from listeners still. I cherish the moments when listeners tell me that they read the book after getting hooked listening to the audio book. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-intriguing-the-audience-to-read-the-original-book-101625929654196.html

Earlier this week Taliban fighters entered the capital of the western province of Badghis, seizing police and security facilities and attempting to take over the governor's office before special forces pushed them back.Insurgents have made a fresh push to gain territory in recent weeks, emboldened by the departure of foreign forces. The Pentagon believes that after taking dozens of district centres, the Taliban will make a push for provincial centres.In southern Afghanistan, too, clashes continued.India said on Sunday it had temporarily repatriated officials from its consulate in Kandahar, a major city in southern Afghanistan."Due to the intense fighting near Kandahar city, India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being," Arindam Bagchi, chief spokesperson at India's foreign ministry, said in a statement."India is closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan," Bagchi said, adding that India's consulate in Kandahar was being run by local staff temporarily.Taliban officials said on Friday that the Sunni Muslim insurgent group had taken control of 85% of Afghanistan's territory. Afghan government officials dismissed the assertion as propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-forces-repel-taliban-assault-on-provincial-capital-says-governor-101626024964794.html

Bandla was to evaluate the human-tended research experience, the company had said in a pre-flight announcement, using an experiment from the University of Florida that requires several hand-held fixation tubes that will be activated at various points in the flight profile.Aircraft VMS (Virgin Mother Ship) Eve took off from a runway in New Mexico at around 10.40 am (US eastern time) carrying spacecraft VSS (Virgin Spaceship) Unity underneath. The mother ship was to release the spaceship at an altitude of 40,000 feet. VSS Unity was to fire its engines for a climb powered at three times the sound of sound, before returning for a glide down to the runway.Branson’s flight into space has raised some questions about if he actually did cross over the barrier where space begins. The flight took him roughly 55 miles above sea-level (88.5km), whereas space is said to actually begin at around 62 miles (100km).Blue Origin, which plans to send its billionaire founder Jeff Bezos and his brother into space nine days from now, made that point about Branson’s flight two days ago. “We wish him a great and safe flight, but they’re not flying above the Karman line and it’s a very different experience,” Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith told The New York Times.The Karman line is an imaginary line that separates Earth from space and is about 62 miles above (100km) above sea level, which is where Bezos is headed. “From the beginning, New Shepard (the Blue Origin flight) was designed to fly above the Karman line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name. For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100km up at the internationally recognised Karman line,” they added in a tweet, adding, “Only 4% of the world recognises a lower limit of 80km or 50 miles as the beginning of space. New Shepard flies above both boundaries. One of the many benefits of flying with Blue Origin flight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experience-of-a-lifetime-says-branson-on-his-maiden-space-flight-101626024458589.html

11-07-2021||World||Sydney may extend Covid lockdown after 1 death due to Delta variant||As cases rise across Australia, the New South Wales government on Sunday said it may not lift the lockdown next Friday. The local government asked people to venture out only when it is ‘absolutely necessary’ to break the chain of transmission after Australia reported 77 new cases, its highest this year, according to news agency Reuters.The Australian government, which is battling an outbreak of the Delta variant, fared better than most developed nations with relatively low Covid-19 cases and deaths so far. The country reported 31,000 cases since the start of the pandemic and 911 deaths. However, the New South Wales government’s strong response comes after the nation reported its first locally contracted Covid-19 death. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian said it is unlikely that the lockdown will be lifted on July 16, adding that she will be shocked if the number of cases does not rise to 100 by Monday.Following Sunday’s record, it is likely that the three-week lockdown of more than 5 million people in Sydney and its surrounding areas will be extended. “Given where we're at and given the lockdown was supposed to be lifted on Friday, everybody can tell it's highly unlikely at this stage,” Berejiklian was quoted as saying. The recent outbreak in Sydney has infected 566 people of whom 52 people are hospitalised with 15 of them in intensive care while five require ventilation.The neighbouring state of Victoria has closed its borders with New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory in a bid to break the chain of transmission. Victoria did not report any case in the last 11 days.The recent outbreak of the Delta variant and the subsequent lockdown have led to fears regarding the economy. AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, while speaking to Bloomberg, said the closure of the city will cost the economy A$ 1 billion. Oliver also said the lockdown may lead to ‘more government lockdown assistance’ for the economy.The outbreak also indicates that plans for an Australian-Singapore travel bubble could be delayed until the end of 2021, Australia’s trade minister Dan Tehan told the Sydney Morning Herald. He said the plan has been pushed back ‘due to the third wave of the virus’.Vaccination driveThe vaccination rollout in Australia has remained slow due to supply constraints and changing medical advisories on the AstraZeneca vaccine. The health authorities said that 11 people hospitalised in Sydney are below 35 years of age and three quarters of these patients did not receive a single dose of the vaccine. Australia is vaccinating people over 40 and groups at risk due to their health conditions and people who can be exposed to Covid-19 while working. Australia has vaccinated 26% of its 26 million people with the first dose of the vaccine, according to news agency Bloomberg.(With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-may-extend-covid-lockdown-after-1-death-due-to-delta-variant-101626004602916.html
11-07-2021||World||Pakistan braces for fourth Covid wave as fresh infections witness three-fold rise||Pakistan is bracing for what has been described as the country’s fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, with the number of fresh daily Covid-19 cases registering a three-fold rise over the corresponding figures from just three weeks ago.The country’s ministry of national health services on Sunday put the number of those who tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours at 1,980, while the number of those who succumbed to the viral disease in the same duration was recorded at 27. In contrast, three weeks ago, on June 21, the new daily caseload stood at just 663. In another concerning development, the positivity rate crossed 4 per cent for the first time since May 31 when it was at 4.05 per cent.According to the health ministry, Pakistan’s confirmed tally of Covid-19 infections has reached 9,73,824 of which 22,582 cases have resulted in deaths. The official data also shows that 9,13,203 people have recovered from the infection, while more than 2,100 people are still in a critical condition.Health experts have attributed this sudden uptick in cases to the reopening of the business and tourism sectors and have urged the government to announce a lockdown so that the festival of Eid al-Adha can be observed in accordance with pandemic-related restrictions. The government has also come under fire for holding board examinations of secondary and higher secondary students, despite warnings from Opposition parties, and protests by students. Going ahead with the examinations, health experts have warned, could lead to a further spike in fresh daily infections.However, according to reports, the Pakistan government is banking on its vaccination drive to prevent any further surge in Covid-19 cases. The government says it has administered more than 19 million doses of anti-Covid vaccines and has been urging people to get themselves inoculated at the earliest.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-braces-for-fourth-covid-wave-as-fresh-infections-witness-three-fold-rise-101626002461560.html

This means the Victorian border is effectively closed to New South Wales and the ACT," the Department of Health said in a statement on Facebook.Starting at midnight, people residing in NSW and ACT will not be allowed to enter Victoria, with some exceptions. Victoria residents will be allowed to enter the state if they have a valid permit. Those allowed to return to Victoria from red zones are required to get tested and immediately quarantined for 14 days. People attempting to enter Victoria with no permit will be fined a sum of AU$4,957 (US$3,710) and made to quarantine until they can be sent back.In the past 24 hours, NSW saw 77 locally acquired new cases of Covid-19 and five from overseas. The state has a total of 514 active cases. In comparison, Victoria has no new acquired cases.Australia began its vaccination campaign in February, but delays of vaccine deliveries and concerns about AstraZeneca side effects slowed down its rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-victoria-to-close-borders-with-neighbouring-states-amid-covid-surge-101625998827347.html
11-07-2021||World||Saudi sets upper limit for subsidy cuts with gasoline price ceiling||Saudi Arabia’s government set an upper limit for the domestic cost of gasoline, a rare move to soften the impact of higher living costs on citizens.The decision, which represents a step back from unpopular subsidy cuts, comes just days after the International Monetary Fund urged officials to reduce subsidies even further.The ceiling for gasoline prices will be set at June’s levels, or 2.18 riyals (58 cents) per liter of 91 octane, as of Saturday, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. The decision was made to “decrease the burden of living costs on citizens and residents” and “support local economic activity,” a state committee for amending energy prices said in the statement.The change will alleviate the pain of subsidy reforms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a nod to complaints from Saudis about the rising cost of living under his economic diversification program. Inflation in the world’s largest oil exporter stood at 5.7% in May -- the latest figure available -- driven by higher food and vehicle prices as well as a move to triple the value-added tax last year. Even as the IMF urged Saudi Arabia to “press ahead” with subsidy cuts in a statement on Thursday, it simultaneously called for “enhancing the social safety net” to help low-income households.Saudi officials have closely monitored discontent as Prince Mohammed’s plan was rolled out over the past five years, and have occasionally reversed or eased changes that drew vocal grumbling as the kingdom’s social contract is reshaped. Because Saudi Arabia’s July gasoline prices had already risen above June’s levels, the price cap immediately brought the cost of 91 octane gasoline down by about 10 halalas (3 cents) per liter.Local gasoline prices are among the lowest in the world -- around two-thirds that in the U.S. But they’ve drawn particular ire as they’ve risen since 2015, when the subsidy reform was introduced to promote more efficient consumption and help plug a budget deficit brought on by plunging oil prices. Today, some Saudis believe that increasing oil prices should actually lead to lower costs at the gas pump because of the boost they provide to government finances.Last week, crude prices jumped briefly to the highest in more than six years in New York after a bitter fight between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates plunged OPEC+ into a crisis and blocked a supply increase. Crude’s surge, combined with a rally in other commodities, has central banks fretting about inflation again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-sets-upper-limit-for-subsidy-cuts-with-gasoline-price-ceiling-101625997348481.html

According to the health ministry, Myanmar has reported 188,752 cases and 3,756 deaths till now. On Saturday, the country saw another record high of 4,377 new cases, while 71 people succumbed to the virus. However, health experts have said the actual count is much higher than the official figures due to a significant drop in testing.A shortage of oxygen supplies to treat critical patients of the viral disease coupled with an increased spread of the Delta variant and lack of vaccine doses has added to the rebellion-hit nation’s poor response towards combating the pandemic.Yangon and Mandalay, the country’s two big cities are finding it difficult to procure oxygen supplies on time. Speaking to news agency Associated Press, Soe Win, a resident of Yangon, said he had to wait in line for hours to secure oxygen for his grandmother, suffering from Covid-19. “I have been waiting since 5 in the morning until 12 noon but I’m still in line. Oxygen is scarcer than money,” Win added.Last week, photos emerged of people waiting in queues to buy the life-saving gas in the Kalay city, located in the north-western Sagaing region.To deal with the crisis, Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Friday ordered oxygen plants to operate at full capacity along with conversion of industrial oxygen for treating infected patients. Investment and foreign trade minister Aung Naing Oo, meanwhile, said on Saturday the government is dropping all duties and licensing requirements for importing oxygen concentrators.Before February’s military coup, Myanmar, under the leadership of Suu Kyi, had weathered its second surge of the pandemic beginning August 2020 by severely restricting travel, sealing off Yangon city and curbing poll campaigning in Covid-19 hotspots where lockdowns were in place, according to AP.Suu Kyi had often appeared on television and advised the public on how to deal with the overall Covid-19 situation.However, she was ousted in February, leading to widespread protests which were mostly violent. Medical workers, who are at the forefront of combating the pandemic, spearheaded a popular civil disobedience movement that called on professionals and civil servants to not cooperate with the junta, AP reported.Military hospitals, which continued to provide treatment, were shunned by a majority of the population. Doctors and nurses, who boycotted the Junta system, started running makeshift clinics, following which they were arrested.“Under Suu Kyi, the government and volunteers worked together to control the disease, but it is difficult to predict what the future holds under military rule,” Zeyar Tun, founder of the civic action group Clean Yangon, told AP.Meanwhile, all schools in Myanmar have been closed for two weeks and stay-at-home orders have been issued for badly hit neighbourhoods in cities. The government is in talks with Russia and China to secure vaccine doses on an urgent basis.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-faces-huge-spike-in-daily-covid-19-cases-oxygen-supply-crisis-101625989015209.html

11-07-2021||World||Sputnik V gives 90% protection against Delta strain of Covid-19: Scientist||Viral vector and mRNA vaccines, including Russia's Sputnik V, provide enough protection against the new Delta strain of the coronavirus, Head of the Novosibirsk State University's Laboratory and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) Sergey Netesov told Sputnik."According to data from the UK, the US and other countries, mRNA and vector vaccines, including our Sputnik V, protect against it [the Delta variant], albeit to a lesser extent, but they do protect against it. They offered 95 per cent protection against the initial strain and now they give 90% protection against the 'delta' variant," Netesov said.He added that the vaccines already developed should be used as they are quite effective.At the end of June, Vladimir Gushchin, the head of the population variability mechanisms laboratory of the Gamaleya research center that developed the Sputnik V vaccine, said that the Russian shots guarantee almost 100 per cent protection against severe and fatal cases of Covid-19 caused by the Delta strain.Russia became the first country in the world to register a vaccine against the coronavirus, dubbed Sputnik V, in August 2020.Sputnik V, also known as Gam-Covid-Vac, uses two different engineered adenoviruses (rAd26 and rAd5 for the first and second doses, respectively) to deliver the genetic code for the spike protein of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) into human cells. Adenoviruses usually cause only mild illness in humans and by opting for two different delivery mechanisms, instead of just using one engineered adenovirus like the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines do, the Russian developers were aiming to increase the efficacy of the vaccine.According to an interim analysis from a trial published in The Lancet medical journal, the Sputnik V vaccine has 91.6 per cent efficacy. Meanwhile, the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed Sputnik V, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) have reported that Sputnik V has 97.6 per cent efficacy.Unlike for both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, there have been no reports of rare blood-clotting conditions in people vaccinated with Sputnik V from Russian health authorities or from over 60 countries now using Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-v-gives-90-protection-against-delta-strain-of-covid-19-scientist-101625983311405.html

11-07-2021||World||Amid corruption worries, Bulgaria votes in second national election in 3 months||Bulgaria votes on Sunday in a snap poll that could further drop approval ratings for ex-prime minister Boyko Borissov's GERB party, after a previous election in April produced a fragmented parliament that failed to form a viable coalition government. The current election rerun could produce similar results as the last time, the latest opinion polls suggest, amid widespread corruption and deficiencies in the rule of law and media freedom in the country.Bulgaria's current caretaker government has made public allegations of widespread corruption during the Borissov regime, claim that has also been repeated by global actors against the NATO and EU member-nation.The anti-corruption campaign of Borissov's opponents was additionally boosted by the sanctions the US Treasury imposed last month against several Bulgarian public officials and business leaders for corruption.Polls suggest a tight race between Borissov's party, which came first in April with over 26% of the vote, and its main rival, the anti-elite There is Such a People, led by popular TV entertainer Slavi Trifonov.The opposition Socialist Party is tipped to rank third, followed by the liberal anti-corruption group Democratic Bulgaria and the ethnic Turkish MRF party.The new center-left alliance 'Stand Up! Mafia Out!' emerged after last year's anti-government protests and is projected to pass the 4% hurdle to enter parliament.According to political analyst Dimitar Ganev, there are few chances for Borissov to return to the office for a fourth term regardless of whether the GERB finishes first in the election because most political groups have rejected the idea of cooperating with the ex-ruling party.The 12,000 polling stations close at 8 pm. There are 6.7 million eligible voters who are electing 240 lawmakers. Preliminary results are expected around midnight Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-corruption-worries-bulgaria-votes-in-second-national-election-in-3-months-101625978492761.html

China, for its part, sees preventing a North Korean collapse as crucial to its security interests and would need to boost ties with North Korea and other traditional allies amid fierce rivalry with the United States, some experts say.Kim said in his message that the bilateral treaty “is displaying its stronger vitality in defending and propelling the socialist cause of the two countries ... now that the hostile forces become more desperate in their challenge and obstructive moves.”Under the 1961 treaty, North Korea and China are committed to offering one another immediate military and other aid in the event of an attack.North Korea-China ties go back to the 1930s, when Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un, led Korean guerrillas as they fought alongside Chinese soldiers against Japanese colonizers in northeastern China. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1949, one year before North Korea launched a surprise attack on South Korea and started a three-year war that killed hundreds of thousands of people.China fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, while US-led UN forces supported South Korea. About 28,500 US soldiers are still stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. China doesn’t deploy troops in North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-north-korea-china-vow-to-strengthen-ties-101625977671566.html

"The mention of Imran Khan's name now only brings to mind how the people were robbed of flour, sugar," she said, reported Geo News.She said all one can recall are "queues for flour and sugar"."The elderly stood in line and they were given a mere 1.5 of sugar. Can 1.5 kg of sugar be enough for a house of 10 to 12 people?" she asked.Maryam's remarks came as she addressed a rally in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Sharda town, reported Geo News.While comparing Khan with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, she said, "When one thinks of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, one recalls 'motorways' and 'progress'."Further, she said, "no one believes in the selected"; he (PM Imran Khan) "neither has respect at home nor abroad".The PML-N vice president urged the audience to participate robustly with the whole families in the coming July 25 elections. "Promise me you will guard your votes until the results are announced," she said.Maryam said that the "lion" will emerge victorious in the valley on July 25, referring to the PML-N election symbol, reported Geo News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-election-symbol-should-be-thief-says-pakistan-leader-maryam-nawaz-101625974967698.html

11-07-2021||World||With Afghan pullout, US ditches 'forever wars'||Joe Biden's pullout from Afghanistan has stunned with its speed, but Washington already decided four years ago that it was fed up with "forever wars" and turned its attention to traditional great power competition with China and Russia.Fighting stateless terror groups like Al-Qaeda and Islamic State consumed the US security establishment, and trillions of dollars, since the September 11, 2001 attacks.Biden predecessor Donald Trump came to office in 2017 promising to quit Afghanistan, calling the war there a "mess" and a "waste."The conflicts there and in Iraq had come to be characterized by unending troop deployments, persistent levels of violence, and no ability to conclusively defeat the enemy.By 2020 Trump had overcome resistance and laid the ground for pullouts, leaving only 2,500 troops in each country by the time he stepped down in January. Biden accepted that trajectory, announcing Thursday that US military involvement in Afghanistan would conclude by August 31."We are ending America's longest war," he said. "The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies created to respond to a world as it was 20 years ago."- Challenge from Putin and Xi - The 9/11 attacks blindsided the US security establishment, forcing a whole-of-government refocus and the launching of the "War on Terror."The US and NATO allies invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban government, which had protected Al-Qaeda.And then-president George W. Bush took advantage to also invade Iraq to overthrow strongman Saddam Hussein, hoping to remake the Middle East and snuff out a broader threat.The initial assaults largely succeeded quickly, with Al-Qaeda fractured and on the run in Afghanistan, and Saddam deposed and captured in Iraq.But in both cases the United States and allies remained on the ground, hoping to rebuild each country, and unable to pull out without risking a return to the pre-9/11 situation.Then, starting in 2013, US security leaders rebooted their views when new Chinese President Xi Jinping began aggressively expanding his country's military.Seeking to counter and surpass US military strength, China began building armed bases on disputed islets in the South China Sea, added a base in Djibouti and planned other bases around Asia and the Middle East.Meanwhile in 2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin sent forces to seize Ukraine's Crimea and supported an insurgency in eastern Ukraine.Two years later Moscow mustered an aggressive campaign to influence the US presidential elections.During the same period, young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un embarked on an ambitious plan to develop nuclear weapons with missiles that could threaten the United States.Trump's 2017 National Security Strategy confirmed the pivot."China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity," it said."They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence."- New flashpoints: Ukraine and Taiwan - Reminiscent of the Cold War, the reorientation meant a Pentagon push to expand its navy, build stronger long-range bomber and submarine strike forces, and update its nuclear weapons.It has also meant countering the Chinese and Russian challenge in new domains, with the Pentagon establishing both Space Command and Cyber Command.The new priorities took root under Trump, and Biden confirmed them in March in his own national security policy."The distribution of power across the world is changing, creating new threats. China, in particular, has rapidly become more assertive," it said."Both Beijing and Moscow have invested heavily in efforts meant to check US strengths and prevent us from defending our interests and allies around the world."Instead of Afghanistan and Iraq-Syria, Ukraine and Taiwan are the new flashpoints.Both have recently received more and more advanced US weaponry to deter, respectively, Russia and China.The Pentagon created a new office focused on China. US naval vessels regularly sail the waters around Taiwan and in the South China Sea, implicitly challenging China's territorial claims.As for Russia, Biden has sought to strengthen bonds with NATO allies.Over the past week, too, US vessels took part in exercises in the Black Sea where Russian forces were conducting their own manuevers.Counter-terrorism doesn't end with the Afghanistan pullout, the Pentagon stresses.But it is turning more remote-directed -- using air and missile strikes from remote bases and vessels to act in Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda still operates."We are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-afghan-pullout-us-ditches-forever-wars-101625973856034.html

She received nursing care at home and hadn’t been vaccinated. Her respiratory symptoms rapidly worsened and she died five days later. When her respiratory samples were tested for variants of concern, both strains were found in two tests. The researchers could not say whether the co-infection played a role in rapid deterioration of her health.Earlier in January, Brazilian scientists reported two cases of Covid-19 co-infection, but the study hasn’t yet been released in a scientific journal. Researchers have also previously found evidence of people becoming infected with multiple strains of influenza.“The global occurrence of this phenomenon is probably underestimated due to limited testing for variants of concern and the lack of a simple way to identify co-infections with whole genome sequencing. Being alert to co-infections remains crucial," said Anne Vankeerberghen, the lead author of the study and a molecular biologist from OLV Hospital in Aalst, Belgium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-dies-after-being-infected-with-2-covid-19-variants-experts-concerned-101625965463462.html

Pakistan expects 500,000 refugees from Afghanistan, and authorities have said they’ll be kept in border camps.Also read: Pak’s terror groups join Taliban war, India waryBeijing, which has criticised Washington for its hasty withdrawal urged its citizens to leave the country “as soon as possible” after evacuating 210 nationals.Late on Saturday, Indian officials said staff from the country’s consulate in Kandahar were on their way back on board a special Air India flight.Apart from Kandahar, Indian officials are posted in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-won-t-take-refugees-as-more-areas-fall-to-taliban-india-calls-back-staff-101625949213977.html
11-07-2021||World||Pak’s terror groups join Taliban war, India wary||Thousands of Pakistani terrorists from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other groups are currently fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan in a clear violation of the 2020 peace deal signed by the Taliban and the US, according to reports from security agencies.The assessments come at a time of growing alarm in the international community, including India, at the Taliban’s rapid resurgence in Afghanistan that some intelligence agencies fear is poised to wrest control of key parts of the country from the Afghan government.A majority of the LeT and JeM fighters are active in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces in eastern Afghanistan and Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the country’s southeast, according to information gathered by Afghan and Indian security agencies, people aware of the matter said. All four Afghan provinces share borders with Pakistan – Kunar and Nangarhar with the erstwhile tribal areas and the other two with Balochistan.Terrorist fighters from other Pakistan-based groups such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jamaat-ul-Arhar, Lashkar-e-Islam and al-Badr have also been spotted fighting alongside the Taliban in sizeable numbers, these people said on condition of anonymity.Pakistani terrorists have also been sighted in Ghazni, Khost, Logar, Paktia and Paktika provinces in south and southeast Afghanistan, the people said, citing the latest reports from security agencies. In these regions alone, the number of Pakistani fighters from LeT has been estimated at 7,200, the people added.“LeT men are being hired as advisers, commanders and administrators by the Taliban in several areas,” one of the people cited above said. “There has also been fresh recruitment of fighters in Pakistan by LeT and JeM for fighting in eastern Afghanistan,” the person added.Reports suggest that Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the military chief of the Afghan Taliban and son of late Taliban chief Mullah Mohammad Omar, is working closely with LeT and JeM commanders.Security agencies have also learnt of hundreds of Taliban fighters being trained in LeT camps at Hyderabad, a town in Pakistan’s Punjab province located between Faisalabad and Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The training was done with the support of the Pakistani military, the people said.“The LeT and JeM terrorists are deployed in Afghanistan in groups of about 200, which includes five to eight suicide bombers. There are also reports of Pakistani intelligence officials being embedded with these groups, which is a tactic that was resorted to in the past,” said a second person.The information gathered by the security agencies is largely in line with the findings in the latest report by the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team, which was issued in June and said the Afghan Taliban had shown no signs of cutting ties with al-Qaeda and other foreign terrorist groups.“A significant part of the leadership of Al-Qaida resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region, alongside Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent. Large numbers of Al-Qaida fighters and other foreign extremist elements aligned with the Taliban are located in various parts of Afghanistan,” the UN report had said.In mid-2020, the UN sanctions monitoring team had stated in another report that 6,500 Pakistani terrorists were operating in Afghanistan, and JeM and LeT played a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the country.There have been reports that LeT and JeM, both blamed for high-profile attacks in India, have sent hundreds of fighters to Afghanistan since 2019, following increased pressure on Pakistan from organisations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Western powers to crack down on terror groups.The Taliban have dramatically expanded their hold on Afghan territory in recent months, leaving the US-backed government in control of little more than 20% of the country, according to data compiled by the Long War Journal, Bloomberg reported on Saturday. The insurgent group now holds 204 of 407 districts, up from 73 at the beginning of May, while the Afghan government only controls 74 currently. The rest are contested.The latest UN sanctions monitoring team’s report cited an unnamed UN member state as reporting that “there is regular communication between the Taliban and Al-Qaida on issues related to the peace process” in Afghanistan. The report further said that al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), which consists primarily of Afghan and Pakistani nationals, “operates under the Taliban umbrella” from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimruz provinces.AQIS is “reported to be such an ‘organic’ or essential part of the insurgency that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to separate it from its Taliban allies”, the report said, adding that the widow of former AQIS leader Asim Umar was among 5,000 Taliban prisoners freed in 2020 as part of the agreement with the US.The Haqqani Network, which has close ties with Pakistan’s military and intelligence, “remains a hub for outreach and cooperation with regional foreign terrorist groups and is the primary liaison between the Taliban and Al-Qaida”, the UN report added.Taliban’s failure to cut ties with foreign terrorists is a clear violation of the agreement the group signed with the US in Doha in February 2020, which paved the way for the drawdown of American forces. Under the pact, the Taliban had made a commitment to take several steps to prevent any group or individual, including al-Qaeda, from using the soil of Afghanistan.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said reports of LeT’s presence in Afghanistan are not new but the group’s involvement in the current violence are worrisome.“The presence of LeT in parts of Afghanistan is not new. But the withdrawal of US troops and expanding control of Taliban since last year have encouraged LeT to increase its presence and activities. Clearly, the group is looking to up its activities after lying low for the past few years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paks-terror-groups-join-taliban-war-india-wary-101625948635708.html

11-07-2021||India||Delta, not Delta Plus: Govt on Tripura's claim of 138 cases||Tripura health department claimed on Saturday that the state has at least 138 cases of Delta Plus, the new variant of Delta recently found in India. A day after, the Union health ministry disputed the claim and said there was no Delta Plus in the samples sent from Tripura to the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal. Clarifying, the Centre said 152 samples were sent from Tripura to the Kalyani institute for genome sequencing. Out of them, 3 samples tested positive for B.1.1.7 the lineage to which both Kappa and Delta variants belong. According to the Union health ministry's information, 11 samples had tested positive for B.1.617.1 (kappa) while 138 samples had tested positive for B.1.617.2 (Delta). "There was no case of Delta Plus reported among these samples," the ministry said on Sunday.Tripura's state surveillance officer Deep Kumar Debbarma on Saturday said Tripura's West District reported the maximum number of Delta Plus variant cases -- 115. “Delta Plus variant is highly infectious than plain Delta. It can infect the lungs. I appeal to people to follow corona guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus,” said director (health services) Subhasish Debbarma.Delta Plus is a mutant of Delta and Delta was majorly responsible for the second wave of the pandemic in India. Several states have reported Delta Plus and since Delta is a variant of concern, as categorised by the World Health Organization, Delta Plus has also been classified as a variant of concern. But the union health ministry and its experts have said that it is not yet known whether Delta Plus is more severe than Delta -- in severity and in transmission. They also said Delta Plus cases have been there in India since April. But its spread since April has not established the fact that it is more transmissible than Delta as the cases remain concentrated in pockets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-not-delta-plus-govt-on-tripura-s-claim-of-138-cases-101626023008901.html

In this connection, an India-Centric online propaganda magazine ‘the Voice of Hind’ ( VOH) is published on monthly basis with an aim to incite and radicalize impressionable youth by projecting a skewed narrative of imagined injustices in India to arouse a feeling of alienation and communal hatred,” the NIA said in its statement.“Searches in the case today (on Sunday) led to the recovery and seizure of a large number of incriminating documents and digital devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop and hard disks...,” it added.According to people aware of the development, at least six people, including two grocery shopkeepers, a garment seller, a medical outlet owner and a lab technician, were detained for questioning by the agency.Deputy inspector general of police (south Kashmir), Abdul Jabbar, however, refused to comment on the matter, saying that “the NIA should be contacted for confirmation”.There were also reports of the agency raiding a religious seminary in Srinagar’s Old City, following which its head was detained. “People were shocked to learn that the seminary had been raided and its head taken away. His family went to the police, who said that he was taken away by the NIA. He was a very moderate voice and used to be busy with his religious teachings,” said a neighbour of the seminary head.Superintendent of police (north Srinagar), Mubasher Hussain, however, said: “I have no information about any raids.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nia-raids-at-least-7-locations-in-kashmir-recovers-incriminating-material-101626017080262.html
11-07-2021||India||TN parties up against BJP over unconfirmed reports of splitting state’s west region into Kongu Nadu||A new controversy and unconfirmed reports have erupted in Tamil Nadu that the Union government plans to bifurcate the state’s western region, otherwise known as the Kongu region, into ‘Kongu Nadu’, HT has learnt.State BJP leaders have spoken in favour of such a move if that’s what the people desire. “Why are they (DMK) scared about this?” BJP legislative party leader, Nainar Nagendran, said in the presence of reporters on Sunday. He added that several places in Tamil Nadu end with a ‘Naadu’.“But one must keep in mind Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were divided into two. If that (bifurcation) is the desire of the people of the state, then the government must fulfil it.” BJP state general secretary Karu Nagarajan said.The speculation, that the Government of India would carve out this region into either a separate state or a Union territory, began after profiles of the new cabinet minister were released on Wednesday. The profile of Tamil Nadu’s outgoing BJP chief L Murugan, who was inducted into the Union cabinet, referred to him as hailing from ‘Kongu Naadu, Tamil Nadu’.On June 10, a vernacular daily published a report that the Centre was planning a bifurcation as a befitting response to the DMK government referring to the Narendra Modi-led government as ‘Ondriya Arasu, in Tamil meaning Union government, and not the Central government. On the same day, BJP national president of the ‘Mahila Morcha’, Vanathi Srinivasan, on her Facebook page, quoted ancient Tamil texts to support the claim that Kongu was a separate geographical region. Srinivasan hails from the western region and is an elected MLA from Coimbatore which is part of the region.The ruling DMK, and its allies, have dismissed the reports and spoken out against it. DMK MP Kanimozhi told reporters on Sunday, “Nobody can divide Tamil Nadu. No one needs to worry about such things, the state is now under a safe government.”Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) chief K S Alagiri termed the demand for a Kongu Nadu as a “figment of imagination”. Senior Congress leader Thirunavukuarasu said, “there is no chance for this. Though it has happened to other states there is no necessity for it here in Tamil Nadu for now.” Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader G Balakrishnan said that the BJP was attempting this for political gains. “This is dangerous,” he said. The people of Tamil Nadu will not allow this. Such actions by the BJP to enter Tamil Nadu through the backdoor will only cause severe repercussions for the party,” said Balakrishnan.AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran called this a divisive measure along caste lines and urged chief minister MK Stalin to clear the issue.The western regions have been the bastion of the AIADMK and two MLAs from BJP were elected from the region in the election results that were announced on May 2. The AIADMK-led alliance with the BJP won 33 of the total 50 seats. While the DMK combine swept other regions in the state, the AIADMK alliance registered its best performance in the Kongu region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-parties-up-against-bjp-over-unconfirmed-reports-of-splitting-state-s-west-region-into-kongu-nadu-101626013478641.html

The Union health ministry in its official press briefing during the week reiterated that the situation is improving but the second wave of the pandemic is not over as Maharashtra and Kerala, the two hotbeds of infections, are still reporting a comparatively higher number of cases daily. On the other hand, northeastern states too are seeing a spike.Here are 10 facts about the present Covid-19 situation as given by the Union health ministry1. About 80 per cent of new cases in India are being reported from 90 districts spread across 15 states. The break-up is: Maharashtra ( 15 districts), Kerala (14), Tamil Nadu (12)m Odisha (10), Andhra Pradesh (10), Karnataka (10), Assam (6), West Bengal (4), Meghalaya (2), Manipur (2), Tripura (1), Goa (1), Mizoram (1), Puducherry (1), Arunachal Pradesh (1).Delta troublesome, Delta Plus few, Lambda worrying: A doctor's take on 3 Covid-19 variants2. The spread of maximum new cases over the districts prove that southern and northeastern states are reporting maximum new cases3. But statewise test positivity rate shows that there are 66 districts across 17 states which reported over 10 per cent positivity rate for the week ending on July 8. And these states are not only in the south or northeast. 10 districts of Rajasthan have reported a high test positivity rate.4. The 17 states with districts reporting over 10 per cent positivity rate are: Arunachal Pradesh (10), Rajsthan (10), Manipur (9), Kerala (8), Meghalaya (6), Assam (4), Sikkim (4), Tripura (3), Odisha (3), Mizoram (2), Maharashtra (2), Chhattisgarh (1), Puducherry (1), Nagaland (1), Telangana (1), Lakshadweep (1), Himachal Pradesh (1).5. Daily cases are being reported from limited geographic locations, the ministry has said.6. Maharashtra's daily cases dipped to around 6,000 after the peak of the 2nd wave but again it rose to 12,800 on July 2. Kerala's daily cases fell to around 8,000, but then it again rose to 14,0008. Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul has said that the rate of decline in cases at present has become slow. That there are so many districts which are reporting over 10 per cent case positivity rate9. The threat of a possible third wave is looming as hill stations are seeing a sudden influx of tourists.10. Over 40,000 cases every day is not a small number, Dr VK Paul has said. "Baseline would be 10,000 cases and when it is maintained for at least three weeks, then we can say that we have brought the situation under control," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/66-districts-over-10-covid-positivity-rate-what-these-2-maps-tell-about-india-s-present-situation-101626008683128.html

Under the 'Chief Minister's COVID-19 Widows Support Scheme', a one-time assistance of ₹2.5 lakh each will be given to such women whose family income is less than ₹5 lakh.Sarma, who handed over cheques to 176 eligible beneficiaries from eight districts, namely Kamrup (Metro), Nalbari, Darrang, Baksa, Morigaon, Nagaon, Goalpara and Kamrup, in Guwahati, said the event was not a happy one for him. "This is not a happy programme for us. When we invite beneficiaries for some government schemes, we always take pride. But for today's event, we are neither proud nor happy," said Sarma, who took over from Sarbananda Sonowal as chief minister after the last Assembly election.At least 873 beneficiaries have been identified as of now under this scheme, and all the cheques will be given to them by state ministers in districts by the next week, Sarma said. "Though we have identified 873 widows, we expect that 2,000-2,500 will be there. The enrolment process is going on in districts," he said.The state has so far registered 6,159 coronavirus-related deaths, including 1,347 fatalities due to comorbidities. Sarma said the Assam government has already launched a scheme to provide ₹3,500 per month to children who lost their parents due to COVID-19."I have requested the finance minister to provide some funds to give something to other COVID-19 affected families. Assam has done something before other states have taken such initiatives," Sarma said.Beneficiaries of 'Orunodoi' and 'Widow Pension' programmes are also eligible for the one-time financial assistance under the 'Chief Minister's COVID-19 Widows Support Scheme'. According to the scheme, the beneficiary's husband should be a COVID-19 positive patient at the time of death, and it should be certified by the State-Level COVID Death Audit Board. "A beneficiary must belong to a low-income family having an annual income less than ₹5 lakh," the scheme details mentioned. It, however, stated that widows of government servants will not be covered under this scheme as they will get the family pension as per usual norms.The state Budget for 2021-22 will be presented on July 16 by Finance Minister Ajanta Neog. The Budget Session of the assembly will begin on Monday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-provide-rs-2-5-lakh-aid-to-covid-widows-101626005618648.html

When they say someone else will be the chief minister, then it will be so. Such agreements happen in a coalition government," Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.Baghel, who spoke to reporters after a meeting with party leader Priyanka Gandhi, said the Congress has three-fourth majority in Chhattisgarh and if the high command hands him any responsibility in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections, he would do go ahead with it.“The Congress has a three-fourth majority in Chhattisgarh. I met (Congress general secretary) Priyanka Gandhi ji. Now meeting (senior leader) PL Punia ji. If the high command gives me any responsibility for upcoming elections in UP, I will do it," he told ANI.Also Read: State not suffering, says C’garh health minister amid reports of rift with CMReports of friction between Baghel and the state health minister, TS Singh Deo, had been doing the rounds after the latter opposed the state government’s proposal to let private doctors set up hospitals in rural areas with the help of grants. On being asked about the rumoured friction, Deo told Hindustan Times “We are working together. I don’t think any work in the state is suffering”.The health minister also denied any talks of a “formula” on the chief minister’s post. “This whole issue came into focus when a TV channel said the formula of sharing the CM’s for 2.5 years was finalised in Chhattisgarh. This is what happened when we were all called to Delhi by the central leaders during the pre-government formation days and since then everybody has been asking this question,” Deo told HT.Punia, who is in charge of the party’s affairs in Chhattisgarh, said, "As Baghel ji also cleared these things, there is no such understanding or any formula. There is no point in such a formula as the Congress has a three-fourth majority in Chhattisgarh. Such an agreement happens in coalition governments. Chhattisgarh is running with a three-fourth majority government."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-to-work-in-up-if-congress-wants-someone-else-as-chhattisgarh-cm-101626004492259.html

Chandru is also the honorary president of the newly formed forum.The forum is targeting to file a petition of Mandamus (judicial writ to command to order to perform a public or statutory duty) by July 16 or coming Friday.“The commission conducted the survey directed by the government which was their mandate. They (backward classes commission) have collected all the data and the report is also ready as they have shared it under RTI,” AS Ponanna, former Additional Advocate General of Karnataka and senior counsel said.The senior counsel added that ₹162 crore of the state’s money has been spent on this purpose and this information should be available to the public.Siddaramaiah, from the backward yet politically formidable Kuruba community, attempted to conduct the caste census in 2015, the first since 1931 anywhere in the country, as a way to challenge the dominant caste theory in Karnataka.Successive governments, including the one that commissioned it, have steered clear of considering the sensitive nature of the information that has the potential to review the perceived size of caste groups which have allowed a few communities to have better bargaining power compared to others.Siddaramaiah, who stormed to power in 2013 on the back of AHINDA (Kannada acronym for Muslims, backward classes and Dalits) is hoping the release of the data would also help his claim to the top post from within his party to rule out the likes of state Congress president DK Shivakumar among others if the Congress returns to power in 2023.To be sure, the forum has also approached Shivakumar for his support.Karnataka’s political landscape has been ruled by the Lingayats and Vokkaligas, believed to be the two largest communities in the state, which has been challenged in the past by smaller groups who are fighting to get the same kind of representation.These small communities, who account for no more than a few thousand in each constituency, are also key for political parties as they can become the deciding factor in close contests.The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa, a Lingayat, has doled out handsomely for caste-specific programmes as a way of reaching out to groups that are not known to support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Though Yediyurappa was known to be the tallest leader of the Lingayats, some of the bigger sub-sects like Panchamasalis are demanding that one of their own be considered for the top job, should the BJP high command enforces a replacement of the chief minister.The chunk of most benefits of reservation in Karnataka and other states in the country are often taken up by the large communities, experts said, leaving hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller groups with no representation or benefits.There are at least 36 caste groups in Karnataka who have been waiting for almost a decade to get the government to look their way for better reservation opportunities, Hindustan Times reported on February 15.The recent reservation-related demands by Panchamasali, Kurubas, Vokkaligas and Valmikis among others, have added to apprehensions of smaller communities, with scattered populations across the state, of further injustices.All three major political parties in Karnataka, BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), have a core-caste or community support base which has allowed them to remain politically relevant in the south Indian state.BJP enjoys the backing of the dominant Lingayats while Dalits, communities that come under other backward classes and minorities are seen to back the Congress. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and his former chief minister son, HD Kumaraswamy-led JD(S) relies heavily on the Vokkaligas, another dominant and politically influential community found largely in the Old Mysuru region.The leaked findings of the caste census, which were not authenticated by the then Siddaramaiah-led government in 2015, indicate that the downward revision of the percentage of Lingayats and Vokkaligas from its earlier believed figures of around 17% and 14% respectively to just around 10%.But his plan to get the support of the Lingayats backfired when he, on the advice of ministers like MB Patil among others, mooted to accord the community the status of a separate religion just before the 2018 assembly elections, demonstrating the nature of deep-rooted caste-based politics in the state.“Let us see what stand the BJP will take. When questioned they say that they have not got the report itself,” he said on Sunday.According to people aware of the developments, the state backward classes commission has already submitted the report to the government, which is yet to take a call on its release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-backs-marginalised-groups-to-take-legal-route-to-release-caste-census-in-karnataka-101626000640146.html

"Whatever your politics, it's hard not to feel regret at Kitex's departure from Kerala," the Thiruvananthapuram MP said.Garment firm Kitex has recently pulled out a ₹35,000 crore proposed project from Kerala and chose Telangana for investment and said that the decision was not voluntary. For the reason of the exit, he blamed the Kerala government's "witch-hunt and apathy".Read: Kitex Group MD says he was ‘kicked out’ of KeralaWhatever your politics, it's hard not to feel regret at Kitex's departure from Kerala. Ours is a state in which industrialists are reluctant to invest& which is congenitally unable to generate employment for its talented people. We should be doing everything to support investors.Tharoor also shared an open letter written by Eram Group chairman Dr Sideek Ahmed, in which Ahmed appealed to both the Kerala government and Kitex to have an amicable discussion.Kitex group managing director Sabu Jacob has recently hit out at the Kerala government and said that the policies of the government are 50 years old. Even after he approached the government with his grievances, he got no response. Instead, industry minister R Rajeev started blaming him, Sabu alleged. "Kerala has to learn many lessons from its neighbours. Otherwise, It will become a graveyard of industries," Sabu said.What is the big Kitex versus Kerala tussle? According to Jacob, the government has treated it as "bourgeoises, exploiter capitalists, and land encroachers". Last month, government officials visited the premises of the company and made inquiries "as if they have committed a big fraud". Industry minister R Rajeev said the exit was unfortunate and the government was willing to talk to Jacob. “It is an unfortunate decision. It seems Jacob has made up his mind long before. He is leaving the state when many major companies have decided to set up their shops in Kerala,” Rajeev said. The minister also clarified that those visits at the firm were primarily because of complaints lodged with the National Human Rights Commission and many of them were filed by Congress leaders.How did Telangana grab the opportunity?Telangana minister KR Rama Rao rolled out a red carpet for the Kitex group. He also sent a provate jet to Kochi to take Jacob. "Delighted to announce the entry of KITEX group, world’s 2nd largest manufacturer of kids apparel into Telangana with an initial investment of ₹1,000 Cr. They’ve chosen KMTP, Warangal for their factories. My gratitude to Mr Sabu M Jacob, MD of KITEX group on a quick decision," KTR tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatever-your-politics-is-tharoor-s-message-on-exit-of-kitex-from-kerala-101625999981123.html

The resultant fire was so fierce that it also gutted their bike parked nearby, said police.At many places in north Kerala, soccer crazy fans took to the streets early in the morning to celebrate Argentina’s victory over their Latin American arch rivals to lift a record equalling 15th Copa America title in Rio De Janeiro.Sweets and payasam (kheer) were distributed at many places in Kerala and police had a tough time controlling them citing the restrictions in place due to the pandemic. In Kozhikode, police had to intervene to end a minor clash between fans of Brazil and Argentina.North Kerala’s obsession with soccer is well known. Fans put up huge billboards and posters and wear the jersey of their favourite players. Wayside shops to fish market talks revolve around soccer during major tournaments. When Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona died last year, many areas observed a shutdown in north Kerala as a mark of respect to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-kerala-football-fans-hurt-while-celebrating-argentina-s-win-in-copa-america-101625999257810.html

On the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic, he said that it can be fatal as there are chances that the virus will get the opportunity to spread because of the gathering of tourists as several hill stations of the country, Dr SK Sarin said to news agency ANI.On Delta, Delta Plus, LambdaOn these most-discussed variants of the SARS-CoV-2, Dr Sarin said Delta, the variant which has been termed as the most transmissible by the World Health Organization is troublesome, Delta Plus, another mutation of Delta, is also there but cases have not been reported in large numbers. Lambda is most worrying, Dr Sarin said, adding that though it has not been reported in the country so far, it can come.Is Delta Plus more virulent? Can a recovered patient get reinfected? 5 big questions answeredWhile the 2nd wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was dominated by Delta, which is still the variant behind maximum infections in the country, Delta Plus and Lambda are much in the discourse. Several states have reported Delta Plus cases but, according to scientific studies conducted so far, Delta Plus is found to be limited in some pockets of the states.Lambda, the variant first reported from Peru, has emerged as a new cause for concern as it has spread to around 30 countries. The health ministry of Malaysia has termed Lambda as a variant "deadlier than Delta".Lambda variant has not been found in India, but the Union health ministry has said that close monitoring of the global situation is going on.While Delta and Delta Plus have been classified as Variants of Concern, Lambda is a Variant of Interest, according to the World Health Organization.On 3rd wave of Covid-19The recent influx of tourists in the hill stations has become worrying as visuals emerging from these areas show that Covid-appropriate behaviour is not being adhered to in these congregations. While local authorities are on their toes to put partial restrictions in place, the issue of crowding has reached PM Modi's meeting with his council of ministers. On the possibility of a third wave, Dr Sarin said it can become fatal as these gatherings can become superspreaders. "Until people promise to the society that they'll not misbehave, I think yatras are very dangerous. It can be harmful if they don't follow Covid appropriate behaviour," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-worrisome-delta-plus-few-lambda-worrying-a-doctor-s-3-takes-on-covid19-101625996835279.html

The Centre has no right to interfere in the laws drafted by the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly,” Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Pawar, whose party is in a ruling alliance with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra, hit out at claims that the Centre is trying to "hijack the cooperative movement" in the state. He told reporters in Baramati the concept is not new, but the Centre cannot interfere in the state's cooperative sector. “It was there when I was in the central government. Unfortunately, the media is painting a different picture,” he said."As per the Constitution, cooperative institutions registered in a state come under the (jurisdiction of that respective) state," the former Union minister said, adding the Centre's newly formed ministry is about multi-state cooperative institutions.“A state cannot control a cooperative institution registered in more than one state, which is called multi-state, and the central government has control over it," said Pawar. He said taking a decision on such a multi-state cooperative institution comes under the central government's purview.The Narendra Modi-led NDA government recently carved out the new ministry, which earlier was a small department in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Union minister Amit Shah, who has been given the charge of the ministry, said the government is determined to make cooperatives and all cooperative institutions more empowered.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-no-right-to-cooperation-sector-laws-framed-in-maha-sharad-pawar-101625982920520.html

These remarks of the CM are undemocratic, unconstitutional...,” it added.The memorandum submitted to the governor by the party in this matter said that MLAs are members of committees at block, circle, sub-division and district levels and are also ex-officio members of urban bodies in their constituencies.“MLAs are accountable to the people of their respective constituencies for development and other activities. So the CM’s statement that an MLA has no work outside assembly is concocted, self manufactured and baseless only with a view to dissuade government officials from listening to opposition MLAs,” it stated.The Congress delegation led by the party’s legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia urged the governor to advise the CM not to pass such comments against the opposition in future.A similar memorandum was also submitted by the delegation later to assembly speaker Biswajit Daimary.“What can I say? It’s already written in the constitution. What does a legislature mean and a legislator does? The council of ministers is responsible towards the assembly,” Sarma said, responding to the opposition’s objections on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-says-cm-made-unconstitutional-remarks-sarma-rejects-charge-101625995297606.html

The minister said he reviewed the implementation and the compliance of the Information Technology rules 2021 with minister of state Rajeev Chandrasekhar. "These guidelines are empowering and protecting users and will ensure a safer and responsible social media ecosystem in India," the minister posted.The message comes as Twitter India on Sunday inched towards fully complying with the I-T rules by appointing Vinay Prakash as the resident grievance officer for India.After months of conflict with the government over these new IT rules, which came into effect on May 26, Twitter, which has lost its status of an intermediary in the country, has submitted the first compliance report in which it said it has taken action against 133 posts and suspended over 18,000 accounts. Facebook and Google have already released their compliance report according to the new IT rules.Former IAS officer Ashwini Vaishnaw's appointment as the new IT minister replacing senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad at a time when the government is at loggerheads with Twitter was surprising. As soon as the Odisha BJP leader took charge of the ministry, he said the law of the land should be abided by everyone, making it clear that the change in the ministry does not indicate any change in its approach towards the social media platforms, operating in India.The new minister's debut on Koo is also significant as Koo is a Twitter-like platform based out of India. The minister is already active on Twitter and has been starting posting updates on the platform. He has joined the Koo in July and his first post on IT rules on this platform carries the message of the government's support to Koo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/responsible-social-ecosystem-new-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-s-first-post-on-koo-on-i-t-rules-101625993054140.html

The highway was, however, completely blocked for a period on Sunday after a landslide in the morning at the 29th-mile area in West Bengal between the Teesta and the Rambi rivers.Sikkim has been witnessing heavy rainfall for over a week. The region is prone to frequent landslides during the monsoon. The NH10 road link between Sikkim and West Bengal keeps getting affected due to landslide damage triggered by heavy rainfall during the monsoon season.Scores of vehicles remained jammed on NH10 in serpentine queues for more than 1km on both sides of the landslide spot, the news agency reported citing its sources. The report said that the BRO has already initiated an operation to clear the highway of the landslide debris.Relentless rainfall in Sikkim is hindering the repair work to clear the NH10 highway, but the goal is to primarily open the road for one-way traffic, considering the importance of the route.Several light vehicles, travelling on the NH-10 roadway, is taking a detour via Darjeeling in West Bengal to reach their destinations, the report said.Last year, the 29th-mile stretch in West Bengal's Kalimpong district was affected by major landslides due to incessant rainfall in the monsoon.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-sees-major-traffic-jam-as-landslides-block-nh-10-repair-work-on-101625990894014.html

The health minister Jai Pratap Singh said Uttar Pradesh is aiming for stability by 2050 and the government is trying to reduce population growth rate to 2.1 per cent.Also read | 'Every community taken care of': Yogi Adityanath launches UP population policyBesides, Uttar Pradesh, Assam is pushing for a similar move with its chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma stating last week that population norms will be slowly implemented for government schemes. Here’s more on the population control measures being introduced by governments.Two-child policyThe UP law commission that has formulated a population control bill said the policy would be voluntary and nobody would be forced to follow any rule. However, if any person decides to on his or her own to not have more than two babies, they will be eligible for government schemes., while those who do not follow the policy, will face restrictions in government jobs, availing ration, and other benefits.Meanwhile, the BJP-led government in Assam may soon give effect to a 2017 resolution titled ‘Population and Women Empowerment Policy of Assam’ that proposed a bar on people with more than two children from getting government jobs and other benefits.There is already a rule in place in the north-eastern state wherein those an individual with more than two children is not allowed to contest local body elections.Over the years, several other states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have introduced such measures to bring down the population, but the success has not been equally spread. While states like Bihar and UP continue to register high population growth, others have been able to control the fertility rate.Fertility rateFertility rate may be defined as the number of children that would be born of a woman during her reproductive years. For a country’s population to remain stable, it is the total fertility rate should be 2.1.Studies suggest that India’s national fertility rate is 2.2 at the moment, but due to the uneven spread of the population, some states are now introducing new measures to incentivise couples and create more awareness on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-launches-two-child-policy-here-s-what-it-aims-to-achieve-101625992364572.html
11-07-2021||India||Shiv Sena asks Centre if Father Stan Swamy was capable of overthrowing state||The Shiv Sena on Sunday condemned the death of Father Stan Swamy, who breathed his last at a Mumbai hospital last week while in police custody on terror related charges in the Bhima Koregaon violence case, and wondered whether a physically challenged 84-year old activist from Jharkhand had the capacity to conspire to overthrow the state.Swamy died on July 5, 2021, close to nine months after National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested him from his Ranchi home alleging he was involved in January 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence. Swamy was booked under stringent anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.“Stan Swamy wanted to spend his last days with his colleagues in Jharkhand but this was not possible as he was charged by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of terror and anti-national activities. Are the foundations of this country so weak that it can be overthrown by a physically challenged 84-year old man?,” Sena Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut wrote in his weekly editorial Rokthok, in party mouthpiece Saamana.Raut said that while the prominent activists arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case were guilty of provocative speeches before the violence on January 2, it required investigation to prove if they were actually conspiring against the nation.“It is true that provocative speeches were made at Bhima Koregoan meet and after that there was large scale violence. In this apart from Swamy, Sudha Bharadwaj, Varavara Rao and Gautam Navlakha were arrested. It’s true that they are rebellious in nature and always express their anger in various forms. But whether they had conspired against the nation needs to be investigated,” said Raut.Raut said that Swamy had dedicated his life for uplifting the tribals in Jharkhand through education and making them aware of their rights.He said it was ironic that Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to talk to Kashmir leaders who have been advocating the reintroduction of Article 370 while activists like Swamy died in a prison cell.While questioning the application of anti-terror laws against people like Swamy, Raut recalled that former Union minister late George Fernandes was also charged with sedition by the then Indira Gandhi government for opposing her. “Is raising voice for the tribals and fighting for their rights an anti-national activity? How can raising voice against injustice be termed as sedition,” questioned Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-asks-centre-if-father-stan-swamy-was-capable-of-overthrowing-state-101625991757494.html

These were all resolved and the appropriate responses were sent. We overturned 7 of the account suspensions based on the specifics of the situation, but the other accounts remain suspended,” the report released on Sunday states. The report covers the period from May 25 to June 26.Twitter becomes the third major social media firm after Facebook and Google to release a report in keeping with the new rules that triggered its conflict with the Central government. The new IT rules, which came into effect on May 26, among other important requirements, mandate the appointment of three key personnel - chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with more than five million users. All these three officers have to be residents in India. Twitter, however, had failed to appoint a grievance officer and the government said it was intentionally refusing to comply with India’s domestic laws resulting in losing its status as an intermediary, which meant it could be held responsible for any unlawful content posted by users.Twitter told the Delhi high court on Sunday that it has now appointed an interim grievance redressal officer, apart from nodal contact person and compliance officer and will publish a monthly compliance report which includes the details of complaints from users via the India grievance mechanism and action taken on them, as well as information related to Twitter’s proactive monitoring efforts, under the IT Rules.Moreover, Twitter said it had suspended 18,385 accounts for child sexual exploitation and 4,179 for promotion of terrorism. “Proactive Monitoring refers to content proactively identified by employing internal proprietary tools and industry hash sharing initiatives,” the firm said in its report.Facebook, in its report last week, released under India’s new Information Technology rules, said it removed a little over 30 million pieces of content including posts and profiles’ pages between May 15 and June 15.The links taken down related to content that was violent and graphic, contained adult nudity and sexual activity, and suicide and self-injury. The report released on Friday is an interim disclosure and the company said it will publish details on July 15.Facebook-owned Instagram said it took action on two million links across nine categories in the same period. Another Facebook company, WhatsApp, has challenged the IT rules for its traceability clause.“Facebook’s India-specific numbers are more detailed than offered to other countries,” a person familiar with the matter said. According to the social media firm’s last quarter transparency report, it acted on 31.8 million urls for adult nudity from January 2021 to March 2021; while in India, the number stood at 1.8 million for the month.In terms of graphic and violent content, the company proactively took down 34.3 million posts, pages and profiles, with India’s number for May 15 to June 15 was 2.5 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-issues-it-rules-compliance-report-appoints-interim-grievance-redressal-officer-101625989357574.html

11-07-2021||India||'Every community taken care of': Yogi Adityanath launches UP population policy||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday unveiled the state's new population policy, which aims to incentivise people to help in population control. The unveiling coincided with the World Population Day, which is celebrated on July 11 every year."Increasing population can be a hurdle in way of development.

Starting 8 new flights from July 16 onwards via @flyspicejet: Gwalior-Mumbai-Gwalior, Gwalior-Pune-Gwalior, Jabalpur-Surat-Jabalpur, Ahmedabad-Gwalior-Ahmedaba. @MoCA_GoI & the aviation industry are committed to take #UDAN to greater heights!" Scindia said in the tweet.The Centre plans to operationalising 100 unserved and underserved airports and starting at least 1,000 air routes under regional connectivity scheme called UDAN scheme (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik).The scheme is aimed at enhancing connectivity to remote and regional areas of the country and making air travel affordable. It is a key component of Centre’s National Civil Aviation Policy led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and launched in June 2016.Under the scheme, nearly half of the seats in Udan flights are offered at subsidised fares, and the participating carriers are provided a certain amount of viability gap funding (VGF) - an amount shared between the Centre and the concerned states.This is one of the initial decisions taken by Scindia, who took charge of the civil aviation ministry last week.Scindia, a prominent leader from Madhya Pradesh, was sworn in as a cabinet minister after a reshuffle carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Wednesday.

11-07-2021||India||Officials, security personnel evacuated but Kandahar consulate not shut: India||India evacuated some 50 officials and security personnel from Kandahar in an air force aircraft following intense clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters who seized key areas near the city in southern Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on Sunday. The evacuation was done on Saturday, just four days after India said there were no imminent plans to close its mission in Kabul and consulates in the cities of Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif. However, officials had then said that India was closely tracking the deteriorating security situation across Afghanistan and all steps will be taken to ensure that Indian officials and nationals were not put in harm’s way. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “The consulate general of India in Kandahar has not been closed. However, due to the intense fighting near Kandahar city, India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being.” He didn’t give details of the evacuation. “India is closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan. The safety and security of our personnel is paramount,” Bagchi said. He described the evacuation as a “purely temporary measure until the situation stabilises”, and said the consulate “continues to operate through our local staff members”. Arrangements are being made to ensure continued delivery of visa and consular services through the Indian embassy in Kabul. “As an important partner of Afghanistan’s, India remains committed to a peaceful, sovereign and democratic Afghanistan,” Bagchi said. Among those flown out to New Delhi were diplomats, support staff and guards from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. They added that a very limited number of officials had remained at the consulate. The presence of hundreds of terrorists from Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand provinces is believed to have been a factor in India’s decision to pull out officials and security personnel from the city. According to a recent estimate by Afghan security agencies, more than 7,000 LeT fighters are believed to be fighting alongside the Taliban in southern Afghanistan. Kandahar city and the areas around it have witnessed a spike in fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces since last week, with reports saying the militants entered the city on Friday after capturing key districts surrounding it. The strategic district of Panjwai fell to the Taliban last weekend, just days after US forces abandoned Bagram air base near Kabul. Taliban fighters seized houses in Kandahar city’s seventh police district on Friday, triggering fierce clashes that continued till Saturday. The Afghan military said about 70 Taliban fighters were killed in fighting in the seventh police district and nearby Dand district. About 2,000 families from the seventh police district were displaced and forced to take refuge in other parts of the city. Kandahar, the second largest city in Afghanistan and the capital of the province of the same name, has for long been of strategic and commercial importance. It served as headquarters of the Taliban from the mid-1990s till 2001, when the group was ousted from power by the US invasion. New Delhi has been working on plans to ensure the safety of diplomats and some 3,000 Indian nationals in Afghanistan in view of what officials have described as a “fluid and dynamic” situation because of the fierce fighting across the country. India is also keeping a close eye on steps being taken by key countries such as the US for the safety of diplomats as it weighs its options.The Indian side also doesn’t want to take any steps that will be perceived as abandoning the Afghan government or ceding space to Pakistan-backed elements. In April last year, India shuttered its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, ostensibly because of the spread of Covid-19, though some reports suggested security was a factor in the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-security-personnel-evacuated-but-kandahar-consulate-not-shut-india-101625986417150.html

In a few hours, Branson will be decked aboard his company Virgin Galactic's passenger rocket plane, the VSS Unity, along with five others to write a new chapter in space history.Branson's upcoming spaceflight has generated much excitement in India, but for a slightly different reason. It has come to light that the space enthusiast shares a bit of heritage with India.Also Read | Richard Branson, British billionaire, set to blast off on Virgin Galactic spaceflightTwo years ago, Branson had revealed his ties with India at a press conference in Mumbai. He was in the city for the launch of his airline Virgin Atlantic's flight from Mumbai to London when he said that some of his ancestors had been from India.A post shared by Richard Branson (@richardbranson)"I knew that I had past generations living in India, but haven't realised how strong our connections were," Branson had told reporters in December 2019.The billionaire entrepreneur said a few of his ancestors were found to be of Indian descent after conducting a DNA test. More specifically, a part of his ancestral origins is from Tamil Nadu's Cuddalore district, dating as far back as 1793, Branson added.Also Read | Virgin Galactic's Unity 22 mission: Timing and other detailsOne of Branson's great grandfathers was married to an Indian named Aria, a 'saliva test' had revealed.

11-07-2021||India||Meghalaya’s festival to ward off pandemic allows only vaccinated participants||The annual Behdieñkhlam festival in Meghalaya is being celebrated on Sunday without mass festivities and fanfare by the Jaiñtia tribe- also known as the Pnars of Meghalaya due to Covid-19 fears. Only those vaccinated agains the deadly infection are being allowed to participate in the festival’s rituals and ceremonies, meant to drive away ‘Ka Khlam’ or the pandemic in Pnar language.Behdieñkhlam literally means “to expel and eliminate plague, pestilence or any form of contagion” and during this festival, the Seiñ Jaiñtia faithful led by their leaders pay obeisance to U Tre Kirot, the Almighty and invoke his divine protection and blessings by various forms of acquiescence.Every dear during the festival, evil is chastised and any plague and pestilence is banished from the land through rituals that are being summoned this year against the coronavirus. However, the celebrations will be subdued because except for leaders, priests and chosen faithful of the Seiñ Raij, the indigenous faith of the Jaiñtias, no public participation is permitted. Jaintias are a sub-tribal group of the Khasi people indigenous to the state.Local cable networks are transmitting coverage of the rituals and scaled-down revelry to ensure people watch them safely from home. “We’re trying our best to ensure seamless live coverage of the festivities so that people can participate in Behdieñkhlam while maintaining safety protocols,” Russell, the producer of a popular Pnar news and entertainment portal said.“This Covid has really spoilt everything for us … actually we are meant to participate in large numbers in the procession specifically meant to drive away the evil plague which according to me is this virus the world is suffering from today, but sadly we cannot because of the restrictions,” said a local resident Desmond, who doesn’t live far away from ‘Madan Aitnar’, the place where all festivities culminate.Ma OR Shallam, the president of Seiñ Raij Jowai said all efforts have been taken to ensure proper celebration and though the people’s absence is a major dampener, it will not prevent the faithful from appeasing the almighty following all rituals.“The festival shall observe prayers, libation and oblation, rituals and acts of beating the roofs by offering prayers to the Almighty to bless the family and to drive away the plague, pest and evil spirit from the house. Up to 40 people from each locality shall be allowed to retrieve and physically ferry the Sacred Log ‘Ka Deiñkhalam’, also known as ‘Khnong Blai’,” Shallam told HT.Only ten persons will be permitted to lead the procession carrying the sacred log to Madan Aitnar and Seiñ Raij chief said unauthorised people will not be allowed to converge at the venue or gather along the route of the procession and no dignitaries have been invited like previous times.Celebrated annually in July after the re-seeding period, Behdeiñkhlam besides expelling away pestilence etc. also seeks the lord’s blessings for a bountiful harvest.While the men folk take care of all the rituals and physical activities, the women folk stay home to prepare an assorted feast first offered in obeisance to U Tre Kirot and then the consecrated offering is partaken by the entire household.The traditional chieftain known as the Doloi watches over intricate spiritual rites performed by spiritual leader titled Wasan.The festival begins with the ritual Kñia Pyrthat, which is the sacrifice of a pig to the God of Thunder. Following this, the Wasan walks around town ringing a bell and steadily heads towards the sacred forest. The faithful then collect the seasoned tree trunks from this hallowed place and return back with them where a series of more rituals are performed. Known as ‘Symbud Khnong’, these sanctified trunks are then kept at the six localities before being taken to Madan Aitnar for final immersion.On the last day of the four day festival, the Wasan accompanied by youths of the village visits every home, climbs up the roof of each house, and wallops the roof with a thin bamboo signifying the driving away of evil spirits. The erected ‘Symbud Khnong’ is then taken down while awaiting the final procession to the sacred Madan Aitnar for the culmination.The pinnacle of the celebration is the tussle for the Khnong Blai or Ka Deiñkhlam, the main sacred log. Loud splashes and ebullient shouts of glee and cheer take over the sacred pool with people throwing mud at each other relentlessly as they battle it out for the prestigious and sacred beam which they believe will usher in happier and more prosperous days ahead.Towards sunset, all roads lead to Mynthong locality where people dressed in their carnivalesqué best converge to witness the exciting ‘Dad-Lawakor’, a football like game but played with a wooden ball. The first team that nets the ball wins and propitiously prognosticate a bountiful harvest for the side.On the sidelines there is also an emblematic killing of demons in a ritual called ‘Cher Ïung Blai’ where only males enter a thatched hut made from bamboo and grass and symbolically kill the demons inside it with spears.Meghalaya today recorded 485 new positive cases with 506 recoveries and 7 deaths. Jaiñtia hills, consisting of East and West districts, have a population of a little less than 700,000. Till date, the region has recorded a total of 5,962 positive cases including 635 active cases and 107 deaths. The state with an estimated population of around 3.2 million has administered 809,519 doses so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalayas-festival-to-ward-off-pandemic-allows-only-vaccinated-participants-101625982097130.html

As per the information on Twitter’s website, users can contact Prakash at ‘grievance-officer-in @ twitter.com’.Prakash’s appointment comes just three days after the Delhi high court on July 8 had hit out at Twitter for a delay in appointing the resident grievance officer. The US-based technological company sought a time of eight weeks to appoint permanent grievance officers and to also set up a liaison office in India, a request which was denied by the court, Hindustan Times reported.Twitter had earlier appointed Dharmendra Chatur as its interim resident grievance officer for India. However, Chatur resigned from the post in June.The new IT rules, which came into effect on May 26, among other important requirements, mandate the appointment of three key personnel - chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer by social media platforms with more than five million users. All these three officers have to be residents in India.The Centre, on repeated occasions, has hit out at Twitter over its failure and intentional refusal to comply with the IT rules. In June, Twitter lost its status as an intermediary, which meant it will be held responsible for any unlawful content posted by users.Apart from non-compliance with the I-T rules, Twitter has also faced widespread provocation for showing a distorted map of India- (where Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh were shown outside India), along with displaying child pornographic content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-india-names-vinay-prakash-as-resident-grievance-officer-101625979692189.html

11-07-2021||India||Workers attacked with grenades as Assam-Mizoram border dispute festers||Some unidentified miscreants allegedly lobbed grenades targeting road construction workers in Cachar district in Assam near Mizoram border on Saturday. No one was injured in the incident that took place at Lailapur area under Dholai assembly constituency, police said. Cachar superintendent of police Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar confirmed hearing the sound of a blast, while the workers said they were attacked with grenades. “We were at the inspection of the work when we heard the sound of a blast. We rushed to the area where the workers said some miscreants from Mizoram side threw grenades targeting them. But fortunately, no one was injured. We are going to investigate the matter,” Nimbalkar said. The incident took place a day after chief secretaries of Mizoram and Assam met in New Delhi on Friday to discuss the ongoing border dispute between both states. The meeting remained inconclusive after Mizoram sought more time on Assam’s proposal to maintain status-quo along the border and withdrawal of security forces from the disputed areas. Three districts of Assam’s Barak Valley share a 164 km long border with three districts of Mizoram. There have been border disputes between both the states since Mizoram’s formation in 1987. The disputes led to clashes in August last year and February this year. This is the second time when explosives were used to terrorise people along Assam-Mizoram border. Last year, a primary school on the Assam side of the inter-state border was bombed by miscreants at Upper Painom area in Dholai. “Some tension is going on along the constitutional boundary between both states. We are always open for discussions and resolutions of our dispute. But don’t encroach our land. As of now, Assam police are working day and night to protect our constitutional boundary,” chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said at Guwahati on Saturday. According to officials of Cachar district administration, a road is under construction from Dholai’s Dholakhal to Upper Painom area. The Assam government project was getting delayed because of obstructions made by some groups from Mizoram’s side. When a team of top-level officials visited to enquire about the status of work on Sunday, a group of people including civilians and few armed men in uniform obstructed the team. They warned them not to move further and used abusive language. The local police have confirmed that the incident took place within the territory of Assam on Saturday afternoon. On Saturday, the delegation was stopped at Lailapur area while taking stock of the work.According to the officials, miscreants from Mizoram side have so far encroached 6.5 kilometers within the territory of Assam. Senior police and administrative officials are leading an eviction process along the border in the three districts of Barak Valley in Assam.After the grenade blast, locals in large numbers have started leaving the area with their bags and baggage. “This is not the first time that Mizo miscreants have used explosives to terrorise us and capture our land. Security personnel from our district come to visit the area when something happens. But on the other side, armed men in uniform and aggressive locals from Mizoram side continuously stay at the border and encroach on land. We cannot live under such an atmosphere of terror.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-attacked-with-grenades-as-assam-mizoram-border-dispute-festers-101625975616913.html
11-07-2021||India||Middle path has to be found to bring ULFA-I to peace talks, says Assam CM||While addressing a press conference on Saturday, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that a middle path has to be found to bring the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) for peace talks. While a faction of the outfit has given up arms and is in talks with the Centre, the anti-talks faction headed by Paresh Baruah hasn’t agreed to surrender and engage in deliberations. “ULFA-I has categorically said that it can’t discuss anything unless the Government of India wants to discuss the question of sovereignty. But as constitutional representatives who take the oath to protect the constitution and the country’s sovereignty, we can’t sit in talks on that issue,” Sarma said while addressing a press conference to mark the completion of two months of his government. “These are two irreconcilable positions. If we want to resolve that, we have to find a mid-level approach. In order to find that middle path, some mediators have been conducting unofficial parleys between ULFA-I and the government. Talks will happen as and when we find a middle path,” he added. Since assuming office, Sarma has been urging Baruah to give up arms and sit for talks. His appeals to the ULFA-I commander-in-chief led the outfit to release an abducted Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in May this year. The banned outfit announced a three-month ceasefire in their operations in May citing the Covid-19 pandemic. “The mediators carrying forward unofficial talks between us have been saying the ULFA-I chief’s overtures are positive. Now we have to create a road map for talks and hopefully, we will get some good news,” said Sarma on Saturday. Formed in 1979, ULFA is the biggest terrorist outfit in Assam. It has been seeking the creation of an independent Assam through armed struggle. The outfit has camps in neighbouring Myanmar where its cadres are trained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/middle-path-has-to-be-found-to-bring-ulfa-i-to-peace-talks-says-assam-cm-101625972196727.html

This was done as part of a special drive where the police put up barricades on the main Dehradun-Mussoorie road, according to Live Hindustan.The police said the figure of 2,000 vehicles is till 5pm on Saturday.Tourists are arriving in large numbers over the past few days at major tourists spots like Mussoorie, Kempty Fall, Nainital, Haridwar and Rishikesh in Uttarakhand due to heatwave in the plains and dip in the number of Covid-19 cases. Several videos have gone viral in which the visitors are seen violating Covid norms by not wearing masks and refusing to maintain social distancing.The Uttarakhand government has ordered all tourists to strictly adhere to Covid protocol, saying such violations are a "matter of concern".The tourists have been asked to produce a negative Covid-19 test report not older than 72 hours. Apart from this, the administration is playing recorded messages asking people to adopt Covid appropriate behaviour in Mussoorie.Mussoorie's Circle Officer Narendra Pant said that those who are found violating norms are being fined.The main Mussoorie road saw a three-kilometre-long traffic jam as hundreds of people from nearby cities decided to spend time in the hill station."We came here to enjoy ourselves with family but due to heavy traffic, we have wasted a lot of time here in the car," a tourist was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.There are concerns about a third wave of the infection, but the tourists say they are taking all the precautions. "Yes it is risky. But if you are following the precautions then it is okay," another tourist told ANI."We are all vaccinated and are taking care of the Covid protocols, so I don't think there should be a problem," said Tanishq, a visitor from Delhi.According to authorities in Mussorrie, there has been a decline of 50 per cent in tourist inflow due to the restrictions this weekend in comparison to the last.The district administration has also issued guidelines to popular spots like Kempty Fall, after a video of maskless tourists thronging the place went viral on social media.The administration has put a time limit of 30 minutes for people to stay in the fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2000-vehicles-headed-to-mussoorie-sent-back-covid-19-protocol-put-in-place-101625971470981.html
11-07-2021||India||High court says Tripura’s Covid-19 vaccination figures are inaccurate||Tripura high court on Friday termed the state’s claim to have administered the first dose of Covid vaccines to 80% of all eligible people including 98% in the 45+ age category as “inaccurate” and asked for correct information at the earliest. The health department was, however, sticking to its figures.The court pointed out contradiction in data to point out that National Health Mission (NHM) director Dr Siddharth Shiv Jaiswal’s quote, published on June 25, claiming around 80% of all eligible population and 98% of residents above 45 years of age had been given their first dose of the vaccine were not accurate. The court observed that as per the government affidavit, the state has nearly 2.686 million eligible residents above 18 years of age and nearly 1.236 million residents above 45 years of age. “From any angle, neither of these two claims was accurate.... On the date when the Mission Director made these claims, the total vaccine doses administered was 2.427 million, of which, 566,458 were second doses. Therefore, the total number of people vaccinated was 1.860 million. Perhaps, he has taken the total doses of vaccines administered for arriving at this 80% coverage, forgetting that a substantial part of it was administered to the same person as a second dose,” the court order reads. The court added that roughly 1.437 million doses were administered to people above 45 years at the time and 566,458 residents got their second doses and most of them are from the 45+ age group. “Around 900,000 out of 1.236 million people over 45 years of age were given the vaccines. This certainly does not come to 98% of the population in that age group,” the court said. The court asked the NHM director to soon issue an official statement pointing out either there was an error on his side or a misunderstanding on the part of the press in understanding the figures.Reacting to the high court order, a senior health official said on condition of anonymity that the department’s calculation was correct. “We have checked our figures and we stick to the 98% vaccination coverage claim. There might be some miscommunication between our office and the court. We will submit an affidavit at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-says-tripura-s-covid-19-vaccination-figures-are-inaccurate-101625971356635.html

11-07-2021||India||'Bonalu' festivities to begin in Telangana, officials urge Covid-19 norms||Telangana is all set to celebrate the 'Asha Bonalu' festival, one of the biggest traditional folk festivals in the state, on Sunday. The event was cancelled by the state government last year in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The Bonalu festival was declared a 'state festival' by the K Chandrasekhar Rao-led government after the state's formation back in 2014.The Bonalu festival involves scores of devotees offering the traditional 'bonam' (derived from Bhojanam, meaning meals) to the goddess Mahankali at 25 temples across the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The first of these offerings -- the 'golden bonam' -- will be offered to the goddess Jagdamba at the temple in Hyderabad's Golconda Fort at 12 noon.The Bonalu festival, a month-long event, is expected to see a heavy rush from women devotees this year since many were restricted from properly making their offerings last year in view of the Covid-19 curbs. According to reports, the authorities are expecting thousands of devotees to crowd the temple premises on weekdays.Bonalu this year is the first festival allowed after Telangana conducted a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive. To reduce the risk of virus spread, both the state police as well as temple authorities will be supervising the crowd and ensuring proper adherence to coronavirus-related protocols, officials familiar with the matter told news agencies.The Bonalu festival is usually celebrated every year in the Telugu month of Ashadham (falling in June/July). The devotees worship Goddess Mahankali (a form of Durga) seeking her divine blessings to overcome all obstacles and get cured of diseases.To celebrate 'Bonalu', devotees make ‘bonam’ (meal, comprising cooked rice, milk, and jaggery) in new earthen pots (ghatams), which womenfolk carry on their heads to the temple and offer to the deity. The pots are adorned with neem leaves, turmeric, and vermilion.The Bonalu festivities begin on the first Friday of Ashadham month and continue till the end. The main festivities begin at Goddess Mahankali temple at Golconda fort in the first week, followed by Ujjaini Mahankali temple at Secunderabad, Akkanna Madanna temple at Shalibanda, and ends at the Mahankali temple at Laldarwaza in the old city of Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bonalu-festivities-to-begin-in-telangana-officials-urge-covid-19-norms-101625966543502.html
11-07-2021||India||Indian diplomats, security personnel evacuated as fighting escalates in Kandahar||India has evacuated some 50 diplomats and security personnel from Kandahar in an Indian Air Force aircraft after Taliban fighters seized key areas around the southern city in Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The evacuation was done on Saturday, just four days after India said there were no imminent plans to close its mission in Kabul and consulates in the cities of Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif. However, officials had said that India was closely tracking the deteriorating security situation across Afghanistan and all steps will be taken to ensure that Indian officials and nationals were not put in harm’s way.The Indian consulate in Kandahar has been temporarily closed after the diplomats, support staff and guards from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) were flown out to New Delhi, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The presence of a large number of terrorists from Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand is believed to have been a factor in India’s decision to pull out the diplomats and security personnel from the city. According to a recent estimate by Afghan security agencies, more than 7,000 LeT fighters are believed to be fighting alongside the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.There was no official word on the development.Kandahar has witnessed a spike in fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces since last week, with some reports saying the militants entered Kandahar city on Friday after capturing key districts surrounding it. The strategic district of Panjwai in Kandahar province fell to the Taliban last weekend, just days after US forces abandoned Bagram air base near Kabul.Taliban fighters seized houses in Kandahar’s seventh police district on Friday, triggering fierce clashes that continued till Saturday. The Afghan military said about 70 Taliban fighters were killed in fighting in the seventh police district and nearby Dand district.About 2,000 families from the seventh police district were displaced and forced to take refuge in other parts of Kandahar.Kandahar, the second largest city in Afghanistan and the capital of the province of the same name, has for long been of strategic and commercial importance. It served as the headquarters of the Taliban from the mid-1990s till 2001, when the group was ousted from power by the US invasion.New Delhi has been working on plans to ensure the safety of diplomats and some 3,000 Indian nationals in Afghanistan in view of what officials have described as a “fluid and dynamic” situation because of the intense fighting across the country. India is also keeping a close eye on steps being taken by key countries such as the US for the safety of diplomats as it weighs its options.In April last year, India had shuttered its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, ostensibly because of the spread of Covid-19, though some reports suggested security was a factor in the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-evacuates-diplomats-security-personnel-from-kandahar-as-fighting-escalates-101625967156486.html

It could happen among Hindus as well. If a Hindu boy uses dubious means to entrap and marry a Hindu girl that is also a form of ‘love jihad’,” Sarma told reporters on the sidelines of an event to mark completion of two months of his government.“Love jihad” is a term used by right-wing activists to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, but one that the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise. Several activists and legal experts argue that such laws could be used to target Muslims and infringe on the fundamental rights to equality, freedom of religion, and life and personal liberty.“We won’t like to use the term ‘love jihad’, but dubious means or cheating to entrap and marry a girl shouldn’t be done by Hindus too. We will act against such frauds. The law won’t be only against Muslims. No girl or woman should be exploited in that manner,” the CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-marriage-bill-will-check-love-jihad-of-all-kinds-cm-sarma-101625945309058.html
11-07-2021||India||Mehul Choksi alleges ‘collusion’ between India, Dominica||Mehul Choksi has claimed before the Dominica high court that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) joint director, Anurag, wrote to Dominican authorities on May 25, two days after he went missing from Antigua and Barbuda, seeking his deportation to India.The fugitive diamantaire has alleged that the way India found out about his detention in Dominica and issued a requesting letter with “such swiftness” shows “there was some collusion between two governments”.Choksi made these claims in an affidavit filed before the high court earlier this week in support of his plea seeking judicial review of the illegal entry proceedings against him. He has attached the letter, purportedly signed by the senior CBI officer on May 25, who heads the Bank Securities and Fraud Cell (BSFC) in the agency, and shared with him by Dominica’s prosecution department. HT has reviewed the affidavit.The document says that India was making an effort to get Choksi deported to India directly, without involving any court process.After Choksi filed a habeas corpus petition in the Dominica high court alleging abduction, India moved court on June 8, seeking his deportation on the grounds that he continues to be an Indian citizen and should be sent to India to face charges. The legal process in courts may take time as the matter is already adjourned till August and is expected to stretch till the end of the year.To be sure, governments usually have direct communication with each other on matters of deportation as it’s an administrative process.Anurag, who goes by only his first name, did not respond to HT’s calls on Saturday.The news about Choksi missing from Antigua came into the public domain on May 25, when Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne and the police there issued statements saying the businessman went missing on May 23 evening and a search was on for him.According to official Dominican records, he was apprehended in its territory on May 24, and was charged for illegal entry the next day. The Dominica police has said before the high court that it established Choksi’s identity only on May 27, when his driver’s licence was obtained.Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal and his wife Priti Choksi have, however, alleged he was abducted from Antigua by 7-8 men, tortured and brought to Dominica in a vessel.“There is overwhelming evidence on record to show that various important people knew that Mehul Choksi has been detained in Dominica on May 25 itself, though it was declared to the world and his family much later and the stand of Dominica police is that they got the identity of Mehul Choksi confirmed only on May 27, when they found his driving license. So, this all speaks volume. Less said the better,” Aggarwal said on Saturday.Choksi has claimed in his affidavit that a plan to abduct and take him to Dominica was hatched only after the Indian government realised that extradition proceedings in Antigua would take very long.The fugitive has also annexed the investigation report of the Antigua police, which he claims was obtained by his legal team unofficially, and concludes that his “claim of abduction is credible”.Both Antigua & Barbuda and Dominica governments have rejected the allegations.The Indian government has sought Choksi’s deportation on the ground that he masterminded the Punjab National Bank scam worth $952 million and that he continues to be an Indian citizen as his declaration for renunciation of citizenship was never accepted by the ministry of home affairs (MHA).Choksi has stated in the affidavit that he will present expert evidence to challenge this claim of the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-alleges-collusion-between-india-dominica-101625944468233.html
11-07-2021||India||Illegal mining row: K’taka min promises probe if MP Ambareesh gives proof||Rejecting the allegations of illegal mining activities at Baby Betta in Mandya, mines and geology minister Murugesh Nirani said the government is ready to order a thorough investigation if MP Sumalatha Ambareesh produces documentary evidence. Addressing the media in Mandya, the Kalaburagi district in-charge minister categorically denied illegal mining activities in Mandya. “As per my information, no mining activities is taking place around KRS dam or Baby Betta area in Mandya district. I had personally visited the spot after I was informed about the illegal mining activities. I had instructed the officials to stop stone quarrying after noticing the violation of rules. Those who violated the rules were fined, and there is a ban on stone mining,” Nirani clarified. Denying the charges of Mandya MP Sumalatha, Nirani said the government is ready to order a probe. “Let Sumalatha Ambareesh produce documents related to illegal mining activities to the government. We will order a thorough and fair investigation and take action as per the law and won’t buckle under any pressure,” Nirani assured. On Friday, members of parliament Sumalatha and the Janata Dal (Secular), led by former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, traded barbs over alleged illegal mining in Karnataka’s Mandya district, about 100 km from Bengaluru. The confrontation between the Mandya MP, the widow of popular actor-turned-politician Ambareesh, and the JD (S), which has its seeds in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, was reignited this time when Sumalatha alleged that illegal mining activities were affecting the structure of Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dam. Replying to a query on the public spat between former Kumaraswamy and Sumalatha, Nirani said he respected both the leaders and added that indulging in mudslinging in public would not solve any problem. “Both the leaders are intelligent and have enough experience in politics. It’s time they ended this public spat. Politicians should not indulge in mudslinging, and senior leaders should intervene and end this matter,” Nirani appealed. Talking about the concerns over the safety of the KRS dam in Mandya, the minister denied illegal mining activities in the 20 km radius of the KRS dam, which is a lifeline for farmers in Mandya. “Mining activities have been banned in the 20-km radius of KRS dam. Officials have been instructed to collect information regarding any illegal activities. It is very difficult to reveal the names of any politicians involved in stone mining activities, which are happening in the last 70 years,” Nirani explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-mining-row-k-taka-min-promises-probe-if-mp-ambareesh-gives-proof-101625944356023.html
11-07-2021||India||No deliberate under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths: Kerala CM||Thiruvananthapuram There is no under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths in Kerala and the state was following the death protocol in letter and spirit and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has lauded it several times, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday. His reply came when many complaints surfaced that under-reporting of Covid deaths was quite rampant in the state. The CM has underplayed reports that appeared in a section of media that in May the government had reported only 404 Covid deaths officially but actual deaths were more than 10,000. Local bodies’ death registration figures contradicted the official data in last three months in a big way, media reports based on the reply obtained under the Right to Information Act said. “Reporting all deaths under such trying circumstances is difficult. We haven’t done deliberate under- reporting. If there are complaints we will look into,” he said. He cited the case of a north Indian state and said when more than one lakh died in that state official toll was only 2461. He said such things will never happen in a state like Kerala. “Such a situation never arose in Kerala. We reported at least one death out of three. There is no deliberate attempt towards this,” he said adding the ICMR lauded it several times. But the opposition Congress said its workers have started compiling details of all Covid-19 deaths and it will release it if the government failed to do so by next week. Though the CM expressed concern over the high test positivity rate (TPR) he said there is no need to panic about this. He said in many states second wave started in March and peaked immediately but in Kerala it began in May and its progression is slow. Meanwhile the state reported 14,087 new cases on Saturday with a test positivity rate of 10. 7 per cent. The average TPR of last seven days was 10. 4, health ministry statistics show. The state has an active caseload of 1,15,226. For almost a month the state is reporting almost one- third of total cases in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deliberate-under-reporting-of-covid-19-deaths-kerala-cm-101625944234840.html
11-07-2021||India||2,146 raids in Bengaluru: 1,548 detained in crack down on criminals||The city police on Saturday raided around 2,146 homes associated with rowdies, and 1,548 people were taken into detention by the city police, said Bengaluru commissioner Kamal Pant. Raids were also conducted in Parappanna Agrahara Central Prison, he added.Pant told HT that the raids began as early as 5 am, and all senior officials were deployed for the raids and the highest number of cases booked during the raid. “We booked 561 rowdies under various sections; this is the highest in the history of any raid so far. We have also seized 91 weapons,” he said.Out of the 561 cases, 48 people booked under the Arms Act for possession of weapons, 84 booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act after illegal drugs were seized and two persons have been booked for planning to execute dacoity. Around 406 booked under other preventive sections. “We have taken bonds from them, and if they violate the conditions, they will be arrested,” Pant added.The raids come on the back of a series of high-profile murders in the city in the last 15 days. An associate of Rashid Malabari, an alleged shooter in the Dawood gang, Kareem Ali, was killed on June 22. Rekha Kadiresh, a former corporator was hacked to death on June 24 A financier named Madan and another named Krishna Murthy were killed on July 3 and 4 in the limits of various police stations.When asked if the raids were a reaction to the recent murders in the city, the commissioner said that the raids were part of the preventive action from the police. “It is not true that crimes in Bengaluru have increased. In the four murders reported in Bengaluru, three were due to personal reasons, and only Madan murder was gang-related. We have been planning this raid for some time, and since the lockdown got lifted, we thought it was the right time,” he said.Along with the raids in the eight-division of Bengaluru police, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) conducted raids in the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison. “The raids began as early 5 am, and during the raids, 200 grams of ganja (marijuana) and 29 weapons were seized. The information found during the raid has been shared with the prison department for further action,” said Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (CCB).Commissioner Pant also added that administrative transfers would be conducted across ranks in Bengaluru police to ensure that no policeman or officer stays in one particular station for more than three years. “The transfers of sub-inspectors, ASI (Assistant Sub-Inspectors), head constables have finished. The same will be conducted for constables soon. We will ensure there is no instance of any policeman staying at one post and aiding the criminals there,” Pant added.When questioned how kingpins of some gangs were missing from the city during the raids, Pant said that they will be questioned soon.Meanwhile, Bengaluru Police will now book house owners renting a place to foreign nationals accused in narcotic and drug cases for lack of due diligence, said a communication from the police department. The police noted that some landlords were not verifying documents of foreign nationals before renting out their property to get higher rent.The city police said it would undertake a three-pronged investigation in narcotics cases involving foreign nationals henceforth — the peddlers’ side, foreigner’s involvement in the drug mafia and the house owners’ side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2146-raids-in-bengaluru-1-548-detained-in-crack-down-on-criminals-101625944180285.html
11-07-2021||India||‘Attack on federal structure’: Cong, CPI(M) on co-operation ministry||Thiruvananthapuram:The formation of a new co-operation ministry at the Centre has worried many political parties in Kerala, especially the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), which have called the move an attack on the federal structure of the country. The CPI(M) has built many firms, banks and institutions in the co-operative sector and the party fears that the new ministry will usurp its power to control them, according to party leaders and experts. The Congress has also criticised the move, saying handing over the new ministry to union home minister Amit Shah makes it “more worrisome”. The state government has called an all-party meeting next week to discuss the Centre’s move. “It (co-operative sector) is a state subject and the Centre has no business in it. We have no idea why it was formed. It comes under the purview of the states; the new move violates the federal polity of the country,” said state co-operation minister VN Vasavan. Former finance minister TM Thomas Issac also criticised the move. “When Shah was in Gujarat, he was instrumental in capturing the co-operative sector in the state, which was controlled primarily by the Congress. Even Amul was not spared and the father of ‘Operation Flood’ (White Revolution) Dr Varghese Kurian was booted out of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation,” he said. “It is part of a sinister campaign.” The Congress and CPI(M) said they will raise the issue in the monsoon session of parliament. Questioning the move, Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said the new ministry was created by an executive action, not by an act of parliament. “The BJP wants total control of the co-operative movement and that is why it made Amit Shah in charge of the new ministry. It is not acceptable and the party will oppose it,” he said. The BJP underplayed the apprehensions. “It seems the CPI(M) is worried that some of its shady dealings will be exposed. The BJP always supported the co-operative sector,” said BJP leader S Suresh.The CPI(M) has enough reasons to worry in Kerala because it controls the thriving co-operative sector, experts say. It runs many banks, hospitals, infotainment parks, small-scale units, IT institutions and other firms under the co-operative sector. The CPI(M) gives employment to many party workers and sympathizers, experts say. In 2019 the government had also merged 13 district co-operative banks in the state to float the first bank of the state, Kerala Bank. All appointments in these institutions are managed by the party. The Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), which undertakes major construction and road works in the state, is also close to the CPI(M), experts say. Reported to be the country’s oldest labour co-operative institution, it was founded by social reformer Vagbadanandan. The society now employs more than 3,000 workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attack-on-federal-structure-cong-cpi-m-on-co-operation-ministry-101625943994864.html
11-07-2021||India||CID office to Covid war room: A building that encases heritage||Bengaluru: When coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic hit Karnataka last year, a heritage building in Bengaluru was turned into a war room to coordinate the state’s efforts to control the pandemic. The Balabrooie Guest House built in 1850s was, however, in news in 2014 when the government wanted to raise down the building to build a recreational club for Karnataka legislators. Residents in large numbers took to streets to protest the plan, forcing the government to give in. As TP Issar, former chief secretary of Karnataka, in his book ‘City Beautiful’, wrote that Lord Cubbon, who was the commissioner of the Mysore state, wanted Balabrooie Guest House to remind him of his hometown on the little island in the Irish Sea, where many homes were called ‘Balabrooie’ (farm on the riverbank). “Sir Mark Cubbon hailed from the Isle of Man and was buried in Maughold Church there on 17 May 1861. Not surprisingly, there are a few “Mysore Cottages” in the Isle, four of them at Ramsay,” Issar wrote in his book. The fact that this heritage building still remains a hub administrative activity, points at a unique factor of Bengaluru’s heritage compared to other cities. According to Meera Iyer, convenor of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), Bengaluru city has an everyday heritage. “If you look at Paris, it has the Eiffel Tower, while New Delhi has the India Gate and the Red Fort. But in Bengaluru, we have neighbourhoods and the elements of this neighbourhood that holds heritage value and still remains an important part of the city’s functioning,” she said. Several government buildings such as the Carlton House, which houses the office of the Criminal Investigation Department, the office of the chief postmaster general, the Bengaluru police commissioner’s offices are heritage buildings that continue to remain operational. According to Suresh Moona, Bangalore’s ‘Heritage Man’ and founder of AARAMBH (An Association for Reviving Awareness about the Monuments of Bangalore Heritage), because of this office exist and because of security reasons, these heritage buildings remain out of bounds for the common people. “Talking of everyday heritage, one of the biggest historical assets, the city has are the old houses, especially in the south Bengaluru. They were known not just for their architectural beauty but also because of their history. To give an example, one of the most beautiful heritage houses in south Bengaluru belonged to BP Radhakrishna. It was in this house, he was given the Padma Shree. The house, unfortunately, is no longer there,” said Moona. He said one of the reasons for many heritage houses in Bengaluru making way for apartment buildings, is the lack of care from the government. “I have interacted with owners of several of these houses. When I request them not to sell these houses and preserve them, the question they ask is that what benefit they get from the government. The government is not reducing property tax because it is a heritage building and for such properties, the tax is high as well. Since there is a demand for land in Bengaluru, builders are offering them large sums as well,” Moona added. However, there have been some efforts from the government’s side to promote heritage. On April 21, the Karnataka government notified the Zonal Regulations (Amendment), 2020 (ZRA). The new regulations are aimed at conserving heritage sites, buildings, precincts and natural features. They will apply to Zonal Regulations/Master Plans of all local planning areas in the state, including Bengaluru. ZRA specifies rules for identifying and preserving the state’s heritage, by large, have been welcomed by conservationists. With ZRA, Bengaluru would have a dedicated authority to identify and protect a wide range of heritage sites, including natural features. However, this authority is yet to come into effect. The Karnataka government this week decided to develop 46 Kempegowda heritage sites located in Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Chikballapura, and Tumakuru districts, in a bid to promote tourism. Chief minister B S Yediyurappa said the sites identified in three circuits would be developed at a cost of ₹223 crore for promoting tourism. However, activists believe this is not enough. According to Moona, Bangalore Urban Art Commission (BUAC) was established in 1976 and it commissioned a survey of the city’s iconic heritage buildings in the mid-1980s. The survey listed over 800 such buildings that were thought to be worthy of protection. “In 2001, the BUAC was suddenly dissolved. There is still not clear why it was done, but we believe the opposition to the rapid urbanisation from the commission led to it. The commission had opposed the construction of Vikas Soudha (a building with an identical design as the historical Vidhan Soudha). Then there were restrictions on construction on major roads like MG Road and others. This could be the reason. Since then, there is no talk to restoring the commission and massive developments continue across the city, unchallenged,” Moona said. He added that if the beauty and history of the existing heritage buildings have to be preserved, there is a need for another Bengaluru arts commission. “What is important is to make it independent and to appoint experts on heritage in this committee. Ensuring there is government involvement in the committee is very important. But in our current economic race, I don’t know if that could be a reality,” he said. Iyer, however, added that recent interest among people in heritage is a good sign. “These heritage buildings are repositories of heritage... The number of heritage walks that are taking place in Bengaluru and social media posts on the same are good signs. But the bad news is that despite the new regulations that have come, we see that the government is still not keen on heritage inclusive development. Heritage is still looked as an obstruction towards modernity and building a new city,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cid-office-to-covid-war-room-a-building-that-encases-heritage-101625943874831.html

The woman had recently filed a complaint against the accused at Amla police station, following which he was called for interrogation, but later let off due to absence of evidence, said an official.“The accused went to the woman’s house on Saturdayto talk about the (sexual harassment) complaint. But the woman’s maternal uncle scolded him and asked him to leave. The accused left, but returned two hours later with two guns. He barged into the room where the woman was sitting with her 22-year-old cousin brother and an 18-year-old neighbour, locked it and shot all of them,” said superintendent of police (Betul), Simala Prasad.After killing the three, the accused uploaded a video on Facebook, where he purportedly blamed the woman for the crime and accused her fiance (CHECK) of supplying the two guns used in the murder. He also sent a copy of the clip to the local police station via WhatsApp, following which he shot himself dead.“The woman’s fiance has been detained for questioning. Family members of both the accused and the victim are also being questioned to ascertain the truth,” said Prasad.“The fiance has, however, denied the allegations and claimed that the accused had earlier threatened to implicate him in a false case if he married the woman,” he added.According to the woman’s uncle, the accused had also threatened her family members. “The accused threatened us with dire consequences several times. My niece filed a complaint. My niece would have been alive today, if the police had acted when we lodged a complaint.”The SP said she was investigating the role of police personnel in the case and why did they allow him to go.(With inputs from Bhojraj Raghuvanshi from Chhindwara)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-accused-of-harassment-kills-complainant-ends-lifepolice-101625942345136.html
11-07-2021||India||NZ YouTube vlogger’s wife moves high court against Centre blacklisting him||YouTube vlogger Karl Edward Rice’s wife on Saturday approached the Delhi high court challenging the Centre’s alleged “arbitrary and unreasonable” decision to blacklist him and deny visa to enter India.The petitioner, Manisha Malik, said by virtue of denying visa to her husband, who has been “arbitrarily blacklisted” by the Union government, she is deprived from living with him, thereby violating her fundamental right to life and dignity as guaranteed under the Constitution.The plea, which is likely to come up for hearing next week, said Malik and her husband, popularly known as Karl Rock, are YouTube vloggers and have visited most of India to capture its beauty and contribute to the promotion of tourism here.It said the authorities have not communicated the grounds of blacklisting Rice even though several representations have been preferred by him and his wife, which has led to the separation of a married couple, lack of any opportunity or notice to them to indicate any violation of visa conditions and denial of issuance of visa to him.Union Home Ministry officials had on Friday said the New Zealand national has been restricted from entering India till the next year for violating terms and conditions of his visa.He was found to be doing business activities on a tourist visa and also violating other visa conditions, they had said without specifying.The plea said since their marriage in 2019, the couple has been living in Delhi and Rice has not been able to return to India from New Zealand since October 10 last year.“The petitioner’s husband, Karl Edward Rice, has a dual nationality New Zealand and Netherlands and has been visiting India since 2013 strictly abiding by the laws of the country and the conditions of visa.“During the entire period since 2013, while the petitioner’s husband has been granted Indian visa on various occasions, there hasn’’t been even a single allegation against the petitioner’s husband,” the plea, filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, said.Subsequent to their marriage, Rice was granted an X-2 Visa (meant for spouse/children of an Indian citizen) which had a validity period of May 2019 to May 2024 and one of the conditions in the visa for him was to exit India every 180 days or to intimate the Foreigner Regional Registration Office concerned.“Complying with the aforesaid condition of exiting the nation, while Rice left India on October 10, 2020, he has not been able to return to India because any application for issuance of an Indian visa is being rejected by the respondents.“While the petitioner has been running from pillar to post and no reasons are communicated to either Karl Edward Rice or to the petitioner herself as to on what basis her husband’’s request for issuance of visa have been rejected,” the petition said.It added that Rice was only verbally informed that he has been blacklisted and therefore he is not permitted to enter into India.The plea sought direction to the authorities to call for records pertaining to cancellation of visa and unilateral blacklisting of Rice and also sought to review or quash the decision blacklisting him and allow him entry to India.As an alternative, it has sought to direct the authorities to grant a meaningful hearing to the couple on the sudden blacklisting of Rice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nz-youtube-vlogger-s-wife-moves-high-court-against-centre-blacklisting-him-101625942195528.html
11-07-2021||India||Centre advises states to rein in holiday crowds||Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday urged states to be cautious after a spate of incidents in many parts of the country where crowds appeared to disregard Covid-safe precautions, especially at hill stations and other tourist locations across the country. Bhalla said the second wave of Covid-19 was not yet over, and that states should ensure Covid-19 protocols, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowding, are implemented strictly. The home secretary was reviewing steps taken by state governments, a home ministry statement said. During the meeting, the overall management of the Covid-19 situation and the vaccination drive in Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal were discussed. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the state has ordered a 50% occupancy cap on hotels in Nainital and Dehradun, which have recorded a rush of tourists in last couple of weeks. The state government is also issuing challans to people not wearing masks. Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur too on Friday appealed to tourists to follow the guidelines. Following the meeting on Saturday, the MHA said in a statement: “It was observed that the decline of the second wave is at variable stages in the different states/Union Territories in the country, and that while the overall case positivity rate may be declining, the case positivity rate in certain districts of Rajasthan, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh is over 10%, which is a cause for concern.” “States were also asked to follow the five-fold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, as has been laid out in MHA order dated June 29. Adequate health infrastructure preparedness (especially in rural, peri-urban and tribal areas) was also advised, with a view to tackle any potential future surge in cases,” the statement added. Among those who attended the crucial meeting were VK Paul, member (Health) NITI Aayog; the Union health secretary, and chief secretaries, police chiefs and principal secretaries of eight states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-advises-states-to-rein-in-holiday-crowds-101625942138078.html
11-07-2021||India||UP plans job curbs based on family size||A draft bill on population control prepared by the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission proposes to make people with more than two children ineligible for government jobs, disentitle those already in service to promotions and exclude them from benefits of 77 schemes.The draft bill, for which suggestions have been invited from the public by July 19, also proposes to prohibit people who have more than two children from contesting local bodies elections or receiving any kind of subsidy. It also suggests incentives such as tax rebates for those with up to two children.The draft has been uploaded on the commission’s website. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is expected to announce on Sunday a new population policy 2021-30 for the state, which is set to go to the polls early next year. Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state with a population of around 220 million.Justice AN Mittal (retd), the panel’s chairman, said all aspects were looked into and an exhaustive study of such laws was carried out before the proposed legislation was drafted. He underlined the need for a law to check the increasing population of the state. “Resources are already overstretched due to increasing population. Be it medical facilities, food grains and jobs, everything is under stress due to the rising population,” said Mittal, a former Allahabad high court judge.“Imagine if the population of the state remains 22 crore (220 million) to 23 crore (230 million) even after 20 years, then what will be the state’s condition. There will be the availability of everything in abundance for the future generation. There will be no scarcity of resources,” he said.The proposed incentives for government employees with one child include increments, promotions and concessions in housing schemes. For those who are not government employees, the incentives listed are rebates in taxes on water, housing and home loans. If a single child’s parent opts for vasectomy, then the child will be entitled to free medical facilities until the age of 20. Such children are also proposed to get free education, insurance and preference in government jobs.The draft bill said: “Public servants who adopt the two-child norm will get two additional increments during the entire service, maternity or as the case may be, paternity leave of 12 months, with full salary and allowances and three per cent increase in the employer’s contribution fund under the National Pension Scheme.” A state population fund will be constituted for its implementation. Listing the government duties, the draft bill said that maternity centres will be set up at all primary health centres.The draft bill also said that it shall be the duty of the government to introduce a compulsory subject relating to population control in all secondary schools.The Congress questioned the timing of the draft bill ahead of the assembly polls in the state. “The polls are due in seven to eight months. What is the urgency to bring the (draft) bill now when parties are preparing for the assembly polls?” said VN Madan, state Congress spokesperson. Madan said they were studying the draft bill and added that the Congress will support its positive aspects and oppose the ones the government has incorporated for its own benefits.Chief ministers of Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam have of late sought population control. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said large families were likely to lose certain state benefits.According to United Nations data, the rate of population growth is falling behind replacement rates in over half of the countries globally. The growth rate in the global population is projected to be zero by the end of the century perhaps for the first time. China has allowed two to three children per household to reverse a fall in its population after decades of the one-child policy.India is projected to overtake China as the most populous country by 2025.Adityanath will release the Uttar Pradesh Jansankhya Neeti-2021-30 (UP population policy-2021-30) on the occasion of the World Population Day on Sunday. He will also distribute kits to promote family planning among some newly married couples, a state government statement said on Saturday.On Thursday, the chief minister held a meeting on the policy and said: “For providing a better standard of living to all, it is necessary to control the population growth. And for the development of Uttar Pradesh, it is necessary to check the population growth rate. By controlling the population, we can realise the dream of a better tomorrow.”“People should be told that a small family is the basis of prosperity and with a reduced population density, people will have a better environment. For a healthy society, it is necessary to stabilise the population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-plans-job-curbs-based-on-family-size-101625942136547.html
11-07-2021||India||Choksi alleges ‘collusion’ between India, Dominica||New Delhi: Mehul Choksi has claimed before the Dominica high court that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) joint director, Anurag, wrote to Dominican authorities on May 25, two days after he went missing from Antigua and Barbuda, seeking his deportation to India.The fugitive diamantaire has alleged that the way India found out about his detention in Dominica and issued a requesting letter with “such swiftness” shows “there was some collusion between two governments”. Choksi made these claims in an affidavit filed before the high court earlier this week in support of his plea seeking judicial review of the illegal entry proceedings against him. He has attached the letter, purportedly signed by the senior CBI officer on May 25, who heads the Bank Securities and Fraud Cell (BSFC) in the agency, and shared with him by Dominica’s prosecution department. HT has reviewed the affidavit.The document says that India was making an effort to get Choksi deported to India directly, without involving any court process.After Choksi filed a habeas corpus petition in the Dominica high court alleging abduction, India moved court on June 8, seeking his deportation on the grounds that he continues to be an Indian citizen and should be sent to India to face charges. The legal process in courts may take time as the matter is already adjourned till August and is expected to stretch till the end of the year.To be sure, governments usually have direct communication with each other on matters of deportation as it’s an administrative process.Anurag, who goes by only his first name, did not respond to HT’s calls on Saturday.The news about Choksi missing from Antigua came into the public domain on May 25, when Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne and the police there issued statements saying the businessman went missing on May 23 evening and a search was on for him.According to official Dominican records, he was apprehended in its territory on May 24, and was charged for illegal entry the next day. The Dominica police has said before the high court that it established Choksi’s identity only on May 27, when his driver’s licence was obtained.Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal and his wife Priti Choksi have, however, alleged he was abducted from Antigua by 7-8 men, tortured and brought to Dominica in a vessel.“There is overwhelming evidence on record to show that various important people knew that Mehul Choksi has been detained in Dominica on May 25 itself, though it was declared to the world and his family much later and the stand of Dominica police is that they got the identity of Mehul Choksi confirmed only on May 27, when they found his driving license. So, this all speaks volume. Less said the better,” Aggarwal said on Saturday.Choksi has claimed in his affidavit that a plan to abduct and take him to Dominica was hatched only after the Indian government realised that extradition proceedings in Antigua would take very long.The fugitive has also annexed the investigation report of the Antigua police, which he claims was obtained by his legal team unofficially, and concludes that his “claim of abduction is credible”. Both Antigua & Barbuda and Dominica governments have rejected the allegations.The Indian government has sought Choksi’s deportation on the ground that he masterminded the Punjab National Bank scam worth $952 million and that he continues to be an Indian citizen as his declaration for renunciation of citizenship was never accepted by the ministry of home affairs (MHA).Choksi has stated in the affidavit that he will present expert evidence to challenge this claim of the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-alleges-collusion-between-india-dominica-101625942137324.html
11-07-2021||India||States told to reopen with caution: Centre in affidavit to Delhi HC||New Delhi Stating that reopening activities across the country was an “essential process”, the central government has informed the Delhi high court that it has asked states and Union territories to ensure that the move is “carefully calibrated”. The Centre said its decision to impose or ease restrictions has to be based on the assessment of the ground situation and that all the states as well as UTs should make sure that there is “continuous focus on containment efforts” and “uniformity in implementing graded restrictions/relaxations”.In a status report, the Union government has told a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that it has directed all the states/Union territories to ensure strict compliance with the National Directive for Covid-19 Management norms during the reopening. It said the state governments have the powers to take necessary actions against those flouting any norms.The National Directives for Covid-19 management include face coverings, social distancing, not spitting in public places, work from home, staggering of work/business hours, screening and hygiene and frequent sanitisation.“…while the opening up of activities after decline in cases is essential, the states and UTs must ensure that the whole process is carefully calibrated and any lifting of restrictions or relaxation should be made with continuous focus on containment efforts to curb the infection and to also ensure uniformity in implementing graded restriction/relaxation measures,” the Union government told the high court.The Centre said that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order on June 29 directing all states and Union territories to consider the implementation of targeted and prompt actions for Covid management till July 31.The response came on a plea which the high court initiated on June 18 after it took note of certain photographs sent to one of the judges on WhatsApp by an AIIMS doctor showing scant regard for Covid-19 protocols among street vendors in markets.While taking suo motu cognizance of the overcrowding at marketplaces, the court had said that if the behaviour of flouting norms continued, the city would be in “great trouble” .“We have paid a huge price in the second wave. We don’t know if there is any household which has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely,” the bench had observed, adding that “we as a citizen of this city are worried when we see these images”.Experts and government officials have raised the alarm on crowding at markets across cities and in tourist hot spots in hilly regions as lockdown restrictions have been lifted. On Friday, the Union health ministry warned against complacency and said the “misplaced belief” that Covid-19 is over could be disastrous for the country.The Centre has told the high court that it has shared the “framework for implementation of prompt and targeted action” with the states, which includes a “fivefold strategy for effective management of Covid-19” i.e. test, track, treat, vaccinate and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-told-to-reopen-with-caution-centre-in-affidavit-to-delhi-hc-101625942135915.html
11-07-2021||India||Assam to create separate department for indigenous groups||The Assam cabinet on Saturday approved the formation of a separate department to protect and preserve the faiths, languages and culture of indigenous communities in the state, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.“Our indigenous populations have their own language, culture and religious beliefs. But due to lack of official help from the government, several of these groups were economically weak,” Sarma added.The decision to form the ‘indigenous faiths and culture’ department was taken at a special cabinet meeting held to mark completion of two months of the new government and ahead of next week’s budget session of the assembly.“This new department will work to protect and preserve their unique cultures, languages and beliefs. Since it’s a new department and will require lot of work, the cabinet has requested the finance minister to allot a substantial sum in the next budget for it,” the chief minister said.Assam has eight major scheduled tribes (ST) besides many other smaller groups and sub-groups. A proposal to grant ST status to six more communities in the state is pending with the Centre for approval.Sarma said the new department will work independently and focus specifically on issues relating to faith, language and culture of the indigenous communities. Development work and other schemes meant for these communities will be handled by other existing departments.Saturday’s cabinet meeting also took decisions on key financial and administrative reforms, changing the existing long-winded process of sanctioning schemes and allocation of funds routed through different departments.“From now decision on all schemes of up to ₹2 crore will be approved by a departmental committee headed by the commissioner of each department and based on approval of the minister these works will be executed,” said Sarma.Schemes and projects worth ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore will be decided by a committee headed by the chief secretary, while projects between ₹5 crore and ₹100 crore will be decided by the finance minister, Sarma said, adding that schemes worth over ₹100 crore will be approved by the state cabinet.“This change is being incorporated to end so-called red-tape and bureaucratic hurdles in sanctioning of projects and their funding. This will reduce the time taken in movement of files from one department to another for approval. Officers will be able to give more time in monitoring schemes,” said Sarma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-create-separate-department-for-indigenous-groups-101625941953171.html
11-07-2021||India||Fuel price surge continues, petrol at ₹100.91 per litre in Delhi||Auto fuel prices were increased for the 38th time in 68 days on Saturday, with petrol prices rising by 35 paise and diesel by 26 paise a litre, even as international benchmark Brent crude fell by $1.61 a barrel or 2.06% at the Friday close, compared to its peak of $77.16 on Monday.The latest revision of India’s domestic fuel rates made petrol costlier by ₹10.51 per litre and diesel by ₹9.15 a litre since May 4, a day after results of five state assembly elections were declared. Petrol is now priced at ₹100.91 per litre and diesel at 89.88 a litre in New Delhi.While fuel rates of state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Petrol prices have already crossed ₹100 per litre in five metros – Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.The cost of one litre petrol in Mumbai is now ₹106.93 a litre and that of diesel is ₹97.46. The highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar, where pumps are selling petrol at ₹112.24 per litre and diesel at ₹103.15 a litre.Surging international oil rates and the domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel at pumps. Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their respective international benchmarks of previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates.International oil prices showed extreme volatility this week. While an inconclusive meeting of producers’ cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) – over restraining output on Monday pulled down crude prices initially, falling US inventories and indications of strong demand from China and India saw prices rising again in the last two days of the week.Benchmark Brent that surged $77.16 a barrel on the first day of this week, its highest since October 2018, fell over 4.8% in the next two sessions. It, however, gained 0.94% or 69 cents on Thursday and rallied 1.93% further on Friday to close the week at $75.55 per barrel, still lower than the week’s high on Monday.Meanwhile, India fuel demand is fast recovering. Petroleum consumption in June was 16.33 million tonne, about 1.5% year-on-year growth and over 8% jump compared to the previous month. Demand of petroleum products had plunged to a nine-month low in May 2021 at 15.11 million tonne due to the lockdowns in various places to contain the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.India imports more than 80% crude it processes, hence international oil prices impact pump rates of auto fuels. Exorbitant taxes are the other reason for high rates of petrol and diesel.In Delhi, central levies account for 33.29% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.07%, according to an official data of July 1. On diesel, central taxes are over 35.66% while state taxes are about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit — with revenues hit on account of the pandemic.The unrelenting upward movement of fuel rates since May 4 already saw petrol crossing the ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and UTs of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Nagaland.Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali, Darjeeling, Dantewada and Kohima.Even as international oil prices saw volatility since May 4, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude had plunged to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest in these 46 days; petrol and diesel rates went up the next day by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre, respectively.According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory.During the 66-day pause on rate hike, state-run retailers had also reduced politically sensitive petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— controls almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-price-surge-continues-petrol-at-100-91-per-litre-in-delhi-101625941654714.html
11-07-2021||Today's||How PM Nehru mishandled China||Jawaharlal Nehru’s tenure as independent India’s first Prime Minister (PM) was marked by an intense engagement, in different forms, with China. From the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 till his death in 1964, Nehru’s approach evolved from being trusting and having an almost fatal attraction for China to being ambivalent to finally turning hostile. In a recent book, Nehru Tibet and China, based on extensive archival work and examination of official documents, including highly classified ones accessed for the first time, I have attempted to capture Nehru’s tryst with China. First, a blunt truth. The conventional understanding that the two countries had developed such a close relationship that it qualified the two peoples to be brothers, captured in that evocative slogan, Hindi-Chini bhai bhai, is false. As the classified documents reveal, Nehru’s friendship with China was one-sided with little reciprocity. Suspecting India of having a hidden agenda on Tibet, China gave no space, minced no words and told India not once, but several times, that Tibet was its internal affair and it would not tolerate any interference from India. India’s lack of understanding of the depth of China’s sentiments against the Simla Convention (which determined the status of Tibet in 1914) was a key problem. Beijing argued it had not signed the treaty, treated it as an unequal pact, and blamed it on the imperial legacy. When China squeezed India out of Tibet in the Panchsheel agreement of 1954, Nehru called the five principles “wholesome” and erroneously described it as “a very important event”.India also remained immune to the use of undignified language against Nehru. China referred to him as a “lackey” of the British and the Americans and used disparaging language, calling Nehru’s resolution in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea as “parent of all evils”. But India ignored it because it needed to work with China, which was then not in the UN.Even when China was seen to be more sensitive to Pakistan’s concerns at the cost of India’s, Delhi ignored it. China went to the extent of describing India’s relations with Bhutan as part of the dark vassal system, and said the UN should examine what China called Bhutan’s enslavement. Tibet’s revolt in 1956 against Chinese occupation too was blamed on India. Yet, despite clear negative signals, Nehru remained anxious to protect the illusion of a bhai bhai relationship, keeping the contradictions in their relations hidden from the people. This was possible in the pre-internet age, when the only source of information was the government and what it chose to dish out was the only news available to the public.On the question of borders, which proved the Achilles’ heel and where accommodation of each other’s point of views was essential, and China showed flexibility, Nehru remained rigid. He declared that India’s borders were what they were, map or no map, ignoring the many infirmities that existed. In the eastern sector, the McMahon Line, set up as the border between Tibet and India in 1914, ceded the area called Tawang to India. But this remained under Tibetan occupation until 1951, when India finally occupied it.In the western sector, the border in the Aksai Chin area was undefined in the Survey of India maps when India became independent in 1947, and continued to be undefined when the maps were reprinted in the subsequent years. In 1954, after the agreement on Tibet had been signed, Nehru issued instructions to withdraw the old maps and print new ones, showing a firm line as India’s border that would not be open for discussion with anyone. But remember, this was an international border and needed consultations/discussions with the other stakeholder before a line was drawn. Nehru, however, remained uncompromising and would insist that the border was well-known by usage and custom and by the principle of watershed; and, hence, there was no need for fresh surveys and China should accept it. This was an unrealistic expectation which was the prime factor that led to the 1962 conflict. Unfortunately, Nehru himself was not sure of India’s borders. He said in Parliament, on December 8, 1959, that, in hindsight, he and his ministry had doubts about India’s position. Still, he said, that India should hold its position, the lapse of time and events would confirm it, and by the time a challenge came, India would be in a much stronger position to face it. A couple of months earlier, on October 28, 1959, foreign secretary Subimal Dutt said, “The Sikkim-Tibet boundary delimited in 1896 was the only boundary along the entire frontier which was properly delimited.” Distilled to the core, what this meant was that out of the entire stretch of an almost 3,500 km boundary line, only 220 km were delimited, and there was an obvious need to delineate the remaining boundary too. But PM Jawaharlal Nehru remained in denial. India paid a price in 1962 and continues to pay a price till today for his tragic mistake.

11-07-2021||Today's||UAPA’s inherently flawed architecture and the role of courts||The recent judgment of the Delhi High Court (HC), granting bail to three activists in the 2020 Delhi riots case, and the death of Stan Swamy, have turned the spotlight back on India’s anti-terrorism statute, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).Commentators have pointed out how UAPA’s stringent requirements for the grant of bail, coupled with how criminal trials take years, even decades, to complete, mean that individuals spend long periods in jail without being found guilty of any crime. Indeed, a 2% conviction rate shows how, in an overwhelming number of UAPA cases, it is the process that is the punishment.However, the Delhi HC’s judgment throws light on another important aspect of UAPA. The HC noted that many of the provisions of the law were broad and vaguely worded, leaving wide scope for even innocent persons to be brought within its ambit. Indeed, a perusal of UAPA shows how its terms — for example, “membership” of unlawful or terrorist organisations — can be stretched to a boundless degree, allowing the State to persecute individuals for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, possessing the wrong kind of literature, or meeting the wrong kind of people, without anything further.How this plays out in practice is revealed by taking a look at one of the very few cases in which a UAPA case actually ended in a conviction. In 2017, a sessions court at Gadchiroli convicted GN Saibaba and five other individuals under various provisions of UAPA such as membership of terrorist organisations and facilitation of terrorist acts, and sentenced all but one of them to imprisonment for life. At the time of writing, the case is under appeal in the Nagpur HC, although it is yet to be heard on merits.A perusal of the Gadchiroli case shows how the broad provisions of UAPA are not only weaponised to deny individuals bail at the time of trial, but also to subject them to years of incarceration through conviction, rare though such cases might be. In its bail judgment, the Delhi HC had noted that neither inferences nor hypotheticals were sufficient under UAPA, but individualised, particular, and factual allegations of specific acts were needed to be put forward by the prosecution to justify keeping an individual in jail. In the Gadchiroli case, the convictions themselves do not rest primarily on individualised, particular, and factual allegations. For example, interviews in which Saibaba had discussed the history of the communist movement, his presence at meetings where government policy was criticised, and offers to mediate between the State and Maoists were all used to argue that he was a member of terrorist organisations. For many of the accused, the sessions judge cited possession of Naxal literature and participation at meetings as dispositive evidence to prove offences under UAPA. Inferences were also drawn to connect the accused with “code names”, ostensibly used as aliases, without, however, any direct evidence demonstrating that the accused and the “code name” were one and the same person.By its very design, UAPA encourages not the specific attribution of an illegal act (such as an act of violence or incitement to violence) to an individual, but broad and sweeping findings of criminality, based on inferences and suggestions. The terms of UAPA — such as “front” for a terrorist organisation (without defining what “front” means), “membership” of a terrorist organisation, “inviting” support for a terrorist organisation, or organising a “meeting” in support of a terrorist organisation — facilitate this form of adjudication, whether it is used at the time of denying bail, or at the time of determination of guilt and innocence. It is for this reason that the Delhi HC bail order that insisted on giving the terms of UAPA a concrete and narrow meaning, and insisting that these provisions required specific and identifiable acts by accused persons, is of such importance. If more courts take this road, UAPA prosecutions such as the Gadchiroli case might reach a different outcome.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based advocate The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/uapas-inherently-flawed-architecture-and-the-role-of-courts-101626016898497.html
11-07-2021||Today's||It is time for the western media to correct its biases||India’s future now stands at a crossroads. Mr Modi is advocating a self-sufficient, muscular nationalism centred on the country’s Hindu majority. That vision put him at odds with the interfaith, multicultural goals of modern India’s founders. The government’s growing efforts to police online speech and media discourse have raised difficult questions about balancing issues of security and privacy with free speech.”This narrative, which, at first glance, appears to be a part of an article on an editorial page is actually a part of an advertisement put out by The New York Times (NYT), on its website, for the post of a business correspondent in South Asia. This advertisement is extraordinary, to say the least, and naturally made waves on social media platforms. So what is the newspaper saying through such an advertisement? Is it suggesting that only those who espouse this view about India and Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi or have a grudge against him need apply? In the advertisement, the border dispute between India and China is casually described as being a “drama”, even if placed in the larger context of India’s growing ambition and rivalry. Incidentally, this correspondent would also cover Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives. If someone who subscribes to this inherently prejudicial view of India is in-charge of business and economic coverage, it is bound to reflect on the tone of the coverage of the often volatile region. NYT has been biased in the past as well. It has attacked late prime ministers Indira Gandhi or Atal Bihari Vajpayee on several occasions. While it chooses to describe Modi as a Hindu right-winger, it conveniently overlooks the fact that United States (US) president, Joe Biden, describes himself as a proud Catholic or that Barack Obama often held his early political meetings in churches across the the nation.Over the past five years, NYT has ridiculed India in various ways, several times. In an article published in November 2017, the sari was linked to chauvinistic nationalism, omitting the fact that the sari is a common garment for many women all over the subcontinent. Similarly, in 2014, a derogatory cartoon was published mocking India’s Mars mission. It showed an Indian wearing a dhoti holding a cow by a rope as he knocks on the doors of the “Elite Space Club” of the West. The editorial board later apologised for the cartoon, saying that it was not its intention to downplay the Mars mission or to insult India and its citizens. The slights don’t end there. The paper introduced former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalithaa as a “former starlet” on her death to their readers. A few years ago, I spent some time with some of the editors of the paper at its headquarters in New York. I asked how such biased reportage could take place in an institution such as NYT. Their reply was that they would try to be more alert in future. But, clearly this has not happen.Let me share a personal experience. I travel in crowded metros to markets in the National Capital Region, whenever I can. There is no better way to understand the pulse of the readers. During Modi’s first term, one evening on a December 24, I boarded the Delhi Metro from Dwarka to Noida. It was around 8 pm and there was a crowd of young, enthusiastic people out to celebrate on Christmas Eve.I was delighted by this ambience when suddenly an NYT tweet appeared on my mobile phone. The tweet linked to a news item about how Christians in the Capital and other parts of the country were afraid to celebrate Christmas. The young people around me, almost certainly of different religions and communities, seemed unmindful of any differences among themselves. The tweet was based on an incorrect report. I tried to explain by tweeting a counter to this, but there was no retraction or reply. I hardly call this healthy and honest journalism.It is not that the western media has not done seminal work in highlighting injustice and inhumanity around the world. But it has made many mistakes along the way and should admit to this. Decades ago, a section of the western media condoned Adolf Hitler’s actions and described Joseph Stalin as the biggest enemy of the West. A historic blunder if there ever was one. During World War II, there were many allegations that NYT was very slow to publish news of some of Hitler’s worst atrocities against the Jews. During the period from September 1939 to May 1945, very few stories about Jewish victims allegedly made it to the front page of the paper. Clearly, it is time for the western media to introspect and course correct when it comes to factually accurate reporting and unbiased editorials about other countries, especially diverse and pluralistic democracies such as India.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief of Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/it-is-time-for-the-western-media-to-correct-its-biases-101626016543455.html
