With the birthday of both the leaders falling on July 22, representatives of both the parties have put up flexes and hoardings of Fadnavis, claiming as “Vikas Purush”, and Pawar. BJP’s state party office secretary Mukund Kulkarni on July 19 issued an appeal stating, “BJP workers should not celebrate Fadnavis’ birthday in a grand manner by putting up advertisements, hoardings and flexes. Instead, they should contribute towards battling the Covid-19 pandemic.” Though the BJP office instructed the workers and warned them to take action, hoardings wishing Fadnavis on his birthday dot the city. To counter the BJP’s campaign, NCP has also put up posters in the city. When reporters pointed out to Pawar during his visit to the city on Wednesday that some supporters have put up his hoardings, Pawar said, “I have appealed to the party workers not to erect any hoarding. If any person with ulterior motive have put up posters, police should take action against them. The BJP is ruling in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations. They can take action against such hoardings.`` Pawar said, “I have clearly appealed to all not to organise any event or do campaign by considering the Covid-19 pandemic situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-ncp-in-war-of-flexes-on-leaders-birthday-in-pune-101626892120629.html
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra begins probe into claims of irregularities in Fadnavis‘s pet project||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has initiated an open probe by the police and an administrative inquiry into alleged irregularities in the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan (JSA), a flagship water conservation project of the previous Devendra Fadnavis government. A state-appointed panel under a retired senior bureaucrat, in a preliminary investigation, pointed out several irregularities in JSA and recommended action. After it submitted a report in May, the state recently ordered the inquiries into the irregularities in around 1,000 of the total 1,728 works.The water conservation project, touted as a solution to the water shortage problem of rural areas, was a pet project of Fadnavis. The government has so far spent ₹9,634 crore on it. The committee has set the criterion according to which the district administrations can take action in irregularities. An open inquiry has been recommended in case of the irregularities related to tendering process, submission of wrong information, no actual execution on ground despite payment to contractors while in case of procedural lapses and irregularities, departmental inquiry has been recommended. Open inquiry will be conducted by the police or the anti-corruption bureau, said an official. Nand Kumar, additional chief secretary, soil and water conservation department of state government, said, “We received the report in May, after which the orders for the action have been given after studying it. The probe will be two-fold, the cases with the irregularities will have open inquiry, while the departmental lapses will be probed through departmental inquiry. The district collectorates of the respective districts will conduct the probe.”The committee looked into 600-odd complaints received by the government from across the state and 1,128 cases from 120 villages in six districts (Solapur, Palghar, Ahmednagar, Buldhana, Beed and Nagpur) referred in by the CAG. Of the 1,728 cases, the committee visited a few projects in three districts and found the irregularities. As per the scrutiny by the department, about 900 cases can attract open inquiry, while 100 may see administrative probe. It submitted its 70-page report in the first week of May, after which the state government has decided to take action as recommended by the committee. Besides the 1,728 cases, the district administrations will be free to probe other cases in the given criterion if they feel so.According to information, the committee has found that in many cases, tendering norms were not followed, wrong information was submitted about the implementation of the project, while in some projects the expected results were not achieved. Some of them could not complete the work in stipulated time, while some others failed to adhere to technical compliances.The four-member committee headed by retired additional chief secretary Bijay Kumar was constituted on December 1 after the state cabinet decided probe the allegations of irregularities in the project. The project was implemented in 22,589 villages with 6.41 lakh works were undertaken between December 2014 and March 2020. State government spent Rs9,634 crore on the project and implemented 98% of works were completed, in which Comptroller and Auditor General of India found holes after inspecting 1,128 works allotted and concluded that it failed to achieve its aim. The report was tabled in state legislature on September 8, while state cabinet decided to conduct an inquiry on October 14.“The committee has not identified the number of cases in which the irregularities have found as it was almost impossible to visit every work complained about. The committee visited number of villages in three districts, held meetings with the officials and met the complainants. The committee has found administration irregularities, lapses and irregularities in tendering process and execution of the projects. The district-level authorities will have to take a call on the type of inquiries. The open inquiries can be conducted by local police or the anti-corruption bureau (ACB),” said an official from the water conservation department.Bijay Kumar said, “The report has been submitted in May before I joined MAT. It’s now up to the government to take a call on it.”Ram Shinde, former water conservation minister and BJP leader, said, “This has been one of the best projects implemented after the independence to make villages water neutral. The project reduced the water scarcity in hundreds of villages. The inquiry is nothing, but the vendetta politics by the MVA government.”The CAG report has rapped the previous Fadnavis government for its failure in implementation of JSA envisaged to make villages in Maharashtra drought-free. Besides the deficiencies in planning and lack of provision of adequate funds for maintenance of the works, JSA failed to achieve water neutrality in drought-prone villages and increase the ground water level as intended, the report had stated. The report had stated that even after spending ₹9,634 crore, the Abhiyan had little impact in drought-prone districts, which ended deploying more tankers than in the past. Shinde also added, ““Bijay Kumar was heading the agriculture department between September 2016 and August 2018 and 75% of the implementation of the JSA was done during that period. The department was closely associated with the JSA. Now the question remains is why did the officer did not object to the irregularities at that time itself. Secondly, the irregularities have been found in just 650 of the total 6.5 lakh works undertaken, which means the percentage of works with so-called irregularities is 0.1%, which is negligible if its mammoth size is taken into consideration.The committee was asked to check which cases mentioned in the CAG report need to be probed by open inquiry and in which case, the departmental inquiry needs to be done. It was also mandated to check the type of inquiry needed to be done in 600 complaints received by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-begins-probe-into-claims-of-irregularities-in-fadnavis-s-pet-project-101626891881755.html
21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh DSP found missing from night duty, issued notice||Senior superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal has issued a notice to a deputy superintendent of police for being absent from night duty, while her two subordinates have been suspended.The SSP was on a round of the city around 2.30am on Wednesday, as part of vigil for Eid celebrations and to keep an eye on protesting teachers who could enter Chandigarh, when he found DSP Rashmi Yadav missing from night duty. As per daily practice, three inspectors and a DSP are on night duty from 12am to 5am. The DSPs get the duty on rotation after every 20 days. The DSP and inspectors report at the Police Headquarters, after which the former briefs the inspectors and checking in respective sub-divisions is carried out.But instead of Yadav, who holds the charge of DSP cyber cell and additional charge of DSP operations, her driver, Vikas, and personal security officer (PSO), Arun Kumar, were found conducting checks. The duo tried to cover up Yadav’s absence, stating that she left for her house in Panchkula after rounds. However, on checking the Headquarters’ record and questioning the inspectors concerned, the SSP established that the DSP never reported for duty. “The driver and PSO were suspended on the spot, while a notice was served to the DSP seeking her explanation about absence from duty,” said Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-dsp-found-missing-from-night-duty-issued-notice-101626891881226.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||CBSE extends deadline to submit compiled marks of Class 12 students; Board to conduct exams for private students from August 16||: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday announced that it has extended till Sunday (July 25) the deadline for schools to submit the compiled marks of Class 12 students; earlier, it was scheduled to end on July 22 (Thursday). The board further said it will conduct in-person Class 12 exams for private candidates between August and September Officials Hindustan Times spoke to said extending the deadline is unlikely to have any impact on the Class 12 results, which the board is planning to declare by July 31. Controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj wrote to heads of CBSE-affiliated schools on Wednesday stating that the board is extending to July 25 the deadline for submission of Class 12 marks. “As the last date, July 22, is approaching and teachers involved are under stress, getting panicky and committing mistakes and sending requests to CBSE to rectify these [the finalized data]…CBSE is aware of the time constraints and problems faced by the schools and teachers. Accordingly, CBSE has decided to extend the last date from July 22 to July 25, 5pm,” wrote Bhardwaj. The extension granted on Wednesday has raised questions about whether the CBSE will be able to declare the Class 12 results by July 31. Reacting to concerns, Bhardwaj told HT, “Generally, we take around 10-15 days to finalise the work [after marks have been submitted]. But since schools are facing issues in compiling results, we had to extend the deadline for submission of marks. We may have to work round-the-clock but will declare results by July 31.”The CBSE’s revised marking scheme for Class 12 students, whose board exams were cancelled on account of the second wave of Covid-19, gives 30% weightage each to Class 10 and 11 scores of a student and 40% weightage to the internal marks secured by the student in Class 12. In order to check for inflation of marks and ensure standardisation, the board has implemented an elaborate moderation scheme and asked schools to strictly follow it. After declaring the results of CBSE’s Class 12 students, the board will conduct in-person exams for private candidates between August 16 and September 15.Private candidates are those who have enrolled in the CBSE’s private or patrachar programme and they will appear for exams along with students scheduled to take their compartment tests for a second time. On June 19, HT reported that CBSE’s alternative assessment plan for Class 12 students may put private candidates at a disadvantage.“Their results will also be declared in the minimum possible time to avoid any difficulty they may face in securing admissions for higher education,” the board said in its notification on Wednesday, adding that the University Grants Commission (UGC) will be “synchronising admission schedule based on the results of these students as was done in 2020.”However, the move has not gone down well with rights activists and private candidates. Mumbai-based child rights activist and advocate Anubha Shrivastava Sahai, who has been demanding a separate evaluation method for private candidates, said the decision to conduct in-person exams in August-September for only these candidates is discriminatory.“CBSE’s claim of not having data on private candidates is incorrect. The data submitted by persons enrolling as private candidates can be used. Several state boards, including Tripura, Odisha, and Maharashtra, have come up with similar plans for private or compartment candidates. The move to conduct exams is discriminatory,” she said.Darshan Kumar, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, who will appear for a compartment paper, said, “My state is conducting engineering entrance exam on August 5 and results will come on August 25. We are expected to upload our Class 12 marks within a week to secure a seat. How can we do so under the current schedule? Students opting for several other courses will also not be able to enrol in any government college and will have to try their luck at private colleges if they don’t want to waste a year. It would have been better had the board considered our previous scores and evaluated us in a manner similar to that for regular candidates.”CBSE said unlike regular students, whose schools have recorded results of unit tests, mid terms, and pre-board exams, there are no such records available for private candidates “based on which their assessment could be done without the conduct of exams”, thereby necessitating the need for in-person exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbse-extends-deadline-to-submit-compiled-marks-of-class-12-students-board-to-conduct-exams-for-private-students-from-august-16-101626891821201.html
21-07-2021||Other||Vaccinations dip again in Delhi||New Delhi: The coronavirus vaccination drive in Delhi, which showed signs of picking up pace after an uptick in shots administered on Tuesday, saw fewer vaccinations on Wednesday, with officials attributing it to people being unaware of the functioning of vaccination centres during Eid.Delhi saw 63,265 vaccine doses administered through 729 centres till Wednesday evening, in comparison to almost 72,000 doses administered on Tuesday. Delhi recorded only administration of 25,985 doses on Monday.“The impact of Eid can be seen on the vaccination numbers. Most people may not have known that vaccination centres were running even on the public holiday. Some centres in hospitals, however, remained closed today,” said a senior official from southwest district. In the last two weeks, the number of shots administered daily crossed the 100,000 mark only twice, and has dipped as low as 10,000. The pace of vaccination has been erratic, with the Delhi government attributing it to a shortage of vaccine doses.“At the beginning of the month, we were unofficially informed that the pace of the vaccination will remain slow because of a lack of doses. We cannot operate all our vaccination sites every day because we are getting fewer doses than we can administer. It makes no sense to give every centre 50 doses; instead, we give 300 to 400 doses to each centre that is running,” said another official from South district. The number of vaccines administered had shot up in Delhi after the Centre revised the vaccine procurement policy on June 21, taking up the responsibility of procurement of doses for all states.Before this, free doses provided by the Centre were strictly restricted for those above the age of 45, whereas doses for those between the ages of 18 and 45 years were purchased by the state government at a differential pricing. With a fresh stock of 85,810 Covishield doses on Tuesday, Delhi currently has 108,300 Covishield doses and around 184,000 doses of Covaxin. Only 20% of the Covaxin stock is being utilised for first dose takers to prevent a shortage for those coming in for their second dose.“So far we have completely immunised less than 10% of our eligible population in India. This is not enough to stop the transmission of the infection in the community and thereby protect those at risk of developing severe disease from death. At least 40-50% of the eligible population has to be completely immunised to achieve that,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccinations-dip-again-in-delhi-101626891820653.html
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra vaccine drive continues to be hit by shortage||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 8,159 Covid-19 new cases and 165 deaths. While the number of fresh Covid-19 cases remains high amid experts insisting on vaccinating maximum people to prevent or delay a third wave, the state continues to face a shortage of vaccine. The vaccination drive at civic centres was suspended on Wednesday and most will remain suspended on Thursday, officials said. Mumbai recorded 430 new cases and 13 deaths, with its toll reaching 15,800. The total number of Covid-19 patients reached 6,237,755, of which Mumbai’s share is 732,582.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 94,745 while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 130,918. The state government reconciled 3,509 deaths on Tuesday. Pune leads with 18,312 deaths, followed by Mumbai reporting 15,800 and Thane with 10,937 deaths so far. There are currently 94,745 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 15,566 patients, followed by Thane with 12,087 and Sangli with 10,674. There were 222,270 tests done on Wednesday, while the number of recoveries clocked 7,839.Although the state has crossed the 30 million vaccination mark, it continues to be saddled by the shortage of vaccine supply from the central government. This can be aptly demonstrated as just 105,157 vaccine doses were administered on Wednesday at 1,131 centres across the state.Many centres were closed across the state due to shortage of vaccines. The total number of vaccines administered till date is 40,215,778. This is despite the fact that the Maharashtra legislature had recently passed a resolution demanding 30 million doses monthly.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which had suspended its drive on Wednesday, said in an official statement that it will restart it on Friday.The statement said that will receive a stock of 60,200 vaccine doses late on Wednesday night. Owing to this, the doses will be distributed to public centres on Thursday and the drive will only restart from Friday. Of the 60,200 doses that the BMC will receive, 50,000 will be Covishield and 11,200 will be Covaxin. Overall, 6,567,324 citizens have been vaccinated with at least one dose in the city. Of these, 1,513,126 citizens have been fully vaccinated.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that those who have taken two doses should be allowed to venture out. “Those who have taken two doses should be allowed to venture out in a phase-wise manner. However, we should also keep in mind the impending third wave. This is my personal opinion and the final decision will be taken by the chief minister,” said Pawar.Similar opposition leader of the state council and BJP leader Pravin Darekar said “We should allow those who are fully vaccinated to travel in local trains. Today they are spending major part of their day in standing in lines for buses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vaccine-drive-continues-to-be-hit-by-shortage-101626891761404.html
21-07-2021||Other||Dissatisfied with police probe, HC asks CBI to investigate Tihar undertrial’s death||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has questioned the prison authorities for not carrying out a proper investigation into the alleged murder of an undertrial prisoner at Tihar Jail by jail officers, and asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the allegations raised by the family. The victim, identified as Shrikant Rama Swami, was supposed to released on the day he allegedly got into a fight with fellow inmates and later died in a hospital.The court’s order comes on a plea by a woman, whose son, identified as Shrikant Rama Swami, was lodged in the Tihar jail since June 13, 2019, in connection with three FIRs which lists offences of attempt to murder, robbery, dacoity, obstructing a public servant on duty, counterfeiting and relevant sections of Arms Act. Swami’s advocate Shailendra Singh said that his client was granted bail and was supposed to be released on May 14 this year. “He was supposed to be released from the jail as he was granted bail under the guidelines of the high powered committee to de-congest jails during the pandemic. However, his dead body came out, “ said Singh.Justice Mukta Gupta on Tuesday said that the post -mortem report of the victim, Shrikant Rama Swami, has not been placed on record before the court, and noted that the investigation into the call received by the victim’s sister a day prior to the incident is also “incomplete”, despite an FIR getting registered two months back.The Director General (DG) of Prisons had informed the court that most of the CCTVs in the Tihar Jail were not working, adding that more than half of the 6,967 CCTVs to be installed in the premises are functional and that the rest would be made operational by August 15.“It is thus evident that no CCTV footage of the incident is available. However, the prime issue which now concerns this court, besides the manner in which the death of the inmate has been caused, is why no proper investigation could be carried out despite the fact that a PCR call was made from a phone number from the jail and the said phone number is duly recorded in the PCR call,” the court said in its eight-page order.“Considering the fact that as per status report filed by the jail superintendent, there was no apparent injury on the deceased. However, the case of the petitioner is that there were deep injury marks on the deceased and an in depth investigation is required... to find out the circumstances under which the deceased made a phone call to his sister expressing his apprehension of death and his subsequent death in the judicial custody... this court finds it fit to transfer the investigation of the case FIR in question to CBI,” the judge added.Pointing to a call received by the victim’s sister a day prior to the alleged assault, the plea filed by Swami’s mother also said that his body had several deep cuts which it claimed could not have been caused by a cricket bat.The jail authorities had informed the court that three undertrials were found beating Swami with cricket bats around 7am on May 14. Later, after he complained of body pain, he was taken to the hospital where he died at 11.30am. They also said that an FIR into the death has been registered at the Hari Nagar police station.The court noted that the investigation based on the mobile phone number as noted in the PCR call still appears to be “incomplete”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dissatisfied-with-police-probe-hc-asks-cbi-to-investigate-tihar-undertrial-s-death-101626891760744.html

Police said the two -- identified as Rajesh Rastogi,46, and his friend Amit Malhotra,47 -- had gone to see the property as one of them was planning to buy a flat in the under construction residential building, and suspect that they fell while looking down from the balcony of a fourth floor apartment. Police said they died on the spot.“No foul play and suspicion could be noticed or reported so far. However, we are conducting an investigation into the incident and looking for witnesses and CCTV camera footage that can help us ascertain the exact sequence of events leading to the deaths,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.Police said both the deceased lived in Krishna Nagar, just 150 metres away from the under construction building. Rastogi was a realtor and Malhotra’s family was in the jewellery business.DCP Sathiyasundaram said that the police control room was informed that two persons had fallen down from a building at B-block, behind Shriram hospital, at around 11.30am.A police team found the two men lying upside down outside the building, following which their bodies were shifted to a nearby government hospital and their families were informed.Police said the building’s guard, Gaya Prasad, told investigators that the two men visited the building to see the flat Rastogi was planning to purchase. Rastogi had visited the property earlier as well. “Prime facie, it appears that the two were looking down from the balcony that had no railing. Even the flooring was incomplete and filled with broken bricks. We spoke to the developer who confirmed that Rastogi had contacted him for a flat in the building,” the DCP said, adding that an inquest proceeding was initiated into the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-dead-after-falling-from-under-construction-building-in-east-delhi-101626891581374.html

21-07-2021||Mumbai||Two months on, a fishing village continues to bear the brunt of Cyclone Tauktae||Cyclone Tauktae brushed past the coast of Maharashtra on May 17 this year, killing at least 19 in the state, damaging between 3,000 to 5,000 acres of standing crops, and unleashing record-breaking rain and winds over Mumbai. Though the event is now firmly in the past for most city folk, a coastal community in Palghar district, around 115km north of Mumbai, continues to deal with the storm’s aftermath – allegedly with little help from authorities.Stranded barge still grounded in Palghar Fisherfolk operating in the vicinity of Vadrai beach (in Palghar’s Mahim village, 10km from the district headquarters), have been particularly affected by the grounding of a cargo barge – the Gal Constructor – which washed up on Vadrai’s rocky shore on the morning of May 18. The vessel, originally anchored in Alibag on contract to ONGC by infrastructure company Afcons, was driven north during the cyclone and remains grounded in Vadrai.At low tide, one can inspect the Constructor’s broken hull, from which several thousand litres of diesel, ballast water and bunker oil began spilling into the ocean around May 28. A spokesperson for ONGC told Hindustan Times that the barge had at least 78,000 litres of high-flash high-speed diesel (HFHSD), “majority of which was recovered directly from the barge.” There was no crude oil on board, the spokesperson said, clarifying that hydrocarbons extracted from oil wells at Bombay High are transported via submarine pipelines.Manendra Arekar, chairman of the Vadrai Sarvodaya Machimaar Society (VSMS), along with several other fisherfolk, said the barge continued to leak a dark, oily liquid for at least eight days before Afcons agreed to contain the spill Afcons later confirmed this. “There was diesel, ballast water and residual fuel oil which was used onboard, hence the dark colour of the spill,” an Afcons spokesperson admitted, seeking confidentiality.“Afcons initially began to empty all the valuables from the barge,” said Arekar, who represents owners of around 50 motorised fishing boats in Vadrai. “Machinery, containers, cranes and all sorts of things. They also began removing the stored diesel, but contracted a separate company to contain the spill only after we forced their hand.” Marginal fishermen hit hard by spillUnfortunately for fish workers, the barge is stranded right in the middle of a productive intertidal fishing ground which yields oysters, shellfish, crab, mudskippers, prawns, mullets, catfish, milk sharks, lobsters, groupers, rays and several other varieties of small fish. These provide not only incomes but also nutrition; they are a valuable source of meat for poor families.“For at least a month after the spill, fishing in the area came to a complete halt,” said 48-year old Nilesh Mahalkari, one of several Vadrai residents who rely entirely on near-shore fishing during the off season, from June to July. Things improved a little after the rains, but the quality of the shellfish, snails and oysters is still bad. People in the market are reluctant to buy from me because they know where I catch my fish. Some of the more valuable stuff, like dhoma, hekru, and prawns, are not coming to that area anymore.”Since the barge arrived on their beach, Mahalkari and others have started going to Shirgaon, 2km north of Vadrai where there is still an abundance of oysters, shellfish and snails – the three main species available in large enough quantities to guarantee a day’s income. It takes about 45 minutes to walk there one way from Vadrai, which means they have less time to collect as much as catch before the tide comes back in and the workers have to return home for lunch.‘The fish tastes like kerosene’For most of these fisherfolk, with incomes fluctuating between ₹100 to 300 per day, the barge accident led to immediate financial losses. Rajni Thapar, a fishmonger from Vadrai, remembers the sight of dead shellfish and oysters in the days immediately after the Constructor began to spill its contents. “We couldn’t sell anything from the area for over a month. The quality of the catch has gotten better only in the last ten or twelve days, but something is still not right about the way the fish tastes,” she said on the morning of July 14, as she made her way back from Shirgaon.This was a common account narrated by over a dozen fishermen and locals. “The fish tasted like rakel (kerosene). It left a burning sensation in the mouth,” said Rekha More, a fishmonger and resident of Mahim village. Women from the nearby adivasi settlement of Rawlepada, which abuts Vadrai beach, also had similar testimonies.“Just this week, I brought home some khubre (sea snails) from near the barge and boiled them. There was such a foul smell that you couldn’t eat the snails. Even the boiled water, which we use for cooking, had to be thrown out,” said Sunita Kawat, from Rawlepada, speaking to HT on July 14. A letter written by over a dozen adivasi women to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), dated June 28 – pleading with the MPCB’s regional officer to “get to the root of the problem by visiting our coast” – has so far gone unanswered. Vessel will hinder navigation, should be removed at the earliestThe fisherfolk of Vadrai unanimously said that they want the barge removed at the earliest, and voiced opposition to a growing rumour that the vessel may be dismantled on the beach itself. Locals, well aware of the ecological impacts of ship-breaking, expressed concern over how this may further affect intertidal fishing. With the on season for fishing set to begin in just over a week, even fishermen who venture out to deeper waters are foreseeing problems.“The barge is now stuck in the middle of our navigation route. The rest of the beach is too rocky, so when the fishing season starts in August, we will have to take a longer detour to reach our fishing grounds. It will take too much time, and with diesel prices being what they are, it will hurt our pockets,” said Ganesh Meher, an artisanal fisherman from Vadrai and member of the VSMS. Arekar, meanwhile, rued the lack of initiative from any authority in getting the vessel removed from the location. “We have written to Aaditya Thackeray (state environment minister) twice and made representations to everyone from the collector’s office to the maritime board. So far everyone seems to be shrugging responsibility. At the moment, we have no idea as to how and when the vessel will be moved. There are rumours going around that the barge may be broken down at location. This is not acceptable to us. Marginal fishermen have already been affected by the oil spill and we cannot take any risk that threatens the larger community, especially with the fishing season about to start soon,” he said. An official with the MPCB’s regional office in Thane, which also presides over Palghar district, claimed that it is near impossible for the barge to be simply towed away. Given the substantial damage it suffered during the cyclone, along with its age (the Constructor was built in 1978), and the fact that no tugboats will be able to reach it given the rocky shore, authorities have accepted that it will have to be “dis-assembled on site”.“It is the only way,” said the MPCB official, preferring anonymity, “The responsibility rests with the owner of the barge, and not with any other authority. The superintendent of police, Palghar, has already warned both the parent company Tirupati Vessels, as well as Afcons, saying an FIR will be filed in case the issue is not resolved.”Contesting claims on pollution from spillA spokesperson for Afcons, seeking anonymity, denied any wrongdoing on their part. “Our contract with the barge owner and ONGC had already lapsed by the time the accident took place. For a week after the spillage began, we tried to contact the owner but he was not reachable. We only stepped in because Afcons was getting a bad name in the press. We do not have any liability in the matter, and besides, no pollution from the spill reached the shore,” they said.Dr Rajendra Rajput, the MPCB’s regional officer in Thane, however, revealed that there was a total of 84,000 litres of HFHSD on board the Constructor – as against the 78,000 litres claimed by ONGC. Of this, 79,000 odd litres were recovered before they could be spilled. “But about 5,000 litres of diesel, mixed with ballast water and bunker oil were released into the sea. Containment booms were able to soak up about 3,000 litres of the spill, but the remaining 2,000 litres nothing could be done about,” said Rajput.A walk down Vadrai beach shows that several containment booms – long, tubular sponges used to soak up the spilled oil and diesel, and which are classified as hazardous waste – remain washed up on the beach, as far as the high-tide line. However, according to laboratory tests conducted by the MPCB on surface water samples from Vadrai beach over eight days in late May-early June, oil and grease were found to be below the detectable limit. “So ultimately there is no major impact that could be found,” said Rajput.These statements have been contested by locals and independent researchers monitoring the situation. “How can Afcons say that the spill did not reach the shore? The containment booms have themselves washed up on the beach and have not been cleared over two months later. The MPCB has not taken any action or served a notice to Afcons for the same. There should be an unbiased study to understand the impact of this accident, rather than plainly denying any possibility of ecological impact,” said Dhwani Shah, an independent environmental researcher who has been working with fishing communities in Palghar for the last two years.Vessel owner, officials vacillate on taking responsibilityAs far as removing the damaged vessel from the area is concerned, spokespersons for Afcons and ONGC, as well as officials in the Coast Guard and the district collector’s office and the MPCB, all repeatedly emphasised that the responsibility rests with Tirupati Vessels Pvt Ltd.Rajiv Agarwal, a director at Tirupati Vessels, did not provide an official comment for this story despite being contacted multiple times over the past week, while VK Singh, coast guard commandant, declined to comment on the matter until permitted to do so from his headquarters.Officials in the district collector’s office, too, shunned responsibility for the accident, even though the defence ministry’s national oil spill disaster contingency management plan (NOS-DCP) formally mandates them to “provide personnel and equipment for shoreline clean-up and ensure safety and protection of the local population and resources.” “We have written to the Maharashtra Maritime Board, who has further written to the director general of shipping to look into the matter. You may talk to the MMB for an answer,” said Kiran Mahajan, deputy collector, Palghar district, when contacted by HT.Captain Praveen Khara, regional port officer, Maharashtra Maritime Board, also did not respond to multiple calls and messages seeking comment, while SK Nath, head of security and safety at the MMB, could not be contacted despite several attempts to reach him.Yashwant Sontakke, joint director (water), with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), said there was “no way” to assess the true scale of impact. “We have done a site visit, conducted tests, and not found any significant pollution due to the spill. I cannot 100 percent deny that fisherfolk have been impacted, but the fisheries department is the right authority to comment on that, not the MPCB,” he said.The lack of any environment impact assessment following the incident has irked experts. “There are whole patches of mangroves along Vadrai and the adjacent Thembi beach which turned completely black with oil and died. These are breeding grounds for fish, which the locals rely on for commercial sale and personal consumption. It is irresponsible for officials to say that they cannot conclusively determine any impact, when no such attempt has been made in the first place,” said Bhushan Bhoir, a marine researcher and zoologist based in Palghar, who was present during Afcons’ clean-up operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-months-on-a-fishing-village-continues-to-bear-the-brunt-of-cyclone-tauktae-101626890380643.html

A post-mortem conducted by state wildlife veterinarians on Tuesday failed to determine the cause of death as the carcass was extremely decomposed. They have, however, clarified that there was no indications of poaching as all the tiger’s limbs and organs were in place.Histopathology reports of organ samples are still awaited, which may provide further clues. The sub-adult tiger has been established as the offspring of tigress T31 and has two siblings. While the location of one of the siblings is known to authorities, officials are combing through camera trap footages to triangulate the location of the third sub-adult. The mother is believed to be roaming in Katejhari area of the Tadoba core zone at present, the forest department said in a press note.This incident comes just two weeks after tiger T50, nicknamed Khali, died of injuries at the Gorewada Rescue Centre after being hit by a speeding vehicle on May 8 this year. Officials in the know confirmed there have been at least 22 tiger deaths in Maharashtra this year alone, based on retrieval of carcasses. However, independent data collected by NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) suggests that based on the seizure of tiger parts this year, the number may be as many as 26. Last year, the state had recorded only 16 tiger deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/subadult-male-tiger-found-dead-in-tadoba-andhari-tiger-reserve-death-toll-22-in-state-101626890320550.html
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai on red alert, chances of over 200mm rain in some parts on Thursday: IMD||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded the weather alert for Mumbai from orange category to red category, indicating widespread heavy to very heavy rains across the city, with chances of extremely heavy rain in excess of 204.5mm in isolated locations on July 22, along with chances of occasional gusty winds of 40-50 kmph, gusting to 60 kmph in some areas.IMD had initially predicted an orange category alert for July 21 and 22 which was upgraded at 1pm Wednesday. “A yellow alert indicating mainly heavy rainfall was there for Mumbai only for July 20. For July 21 we had already indicated chances of very heavy rainfall with orange alert. This has been upgraded today to red alert, indicating chances of extremely heavy rain, keeping in mind the synoptic situation,” said a meteorologist with IMD in Mumbai.Meanwhile, the city woke up to its fourth consecutive day of rainfall on Wednesday, recording 23.9mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am, down from 38.4mm recorded in the 24 hours before that. The day also saw another 50.2mm till 5.30pm. “These rains are not thunderstorms like we saw on early Sunday. It is the result of very strong westerly winds bringing in moisture from an active monsoon trough that runs along coastal Maharashtra. There is a high chance of Mumbai getting another 50mm to 100mm of rain on Thursday. Most monitoring stations across the city and suburbs saw between 50 and 80mm of rain on Wednesday. The distribution will persist, but intensity may vary from place to place,” said the IMD official.An off-shore monsoon trough at mean sea level near the Maharashtra coast is likely to remain vigorous for the next three to four days along with a shear zone in the mid-tropospheric level, and Mumbai will continue to see an active monsoon spell for the “next four-five days with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places”, IMD had said in a bulletin released on Tuesday. A cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat and a low-pressure area forming in the Bay of Bengal around July 23 will also facilitate heavy rains in the Konkan coast for a few days. There is a chance of decreasing rains only after July 24, officials said.The total rainfall for the month of July now stands at just more than 1,000mm, in excess of the 827-mm normal set by IMD. Mumbai has received 1,993.9mm of rain this season so far which 90.5% of the total seasonal normal up to September-end. Officials said the rainfall record for July is extremely likely to cross the 2,000-mm mark by early Thursday. During last monsoon, the city had recorded 1,469mm rain in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-on-red-alert-chances-of-over-200mm-rain-in-some-parts-on-thursday-imd-101626890260663.html
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Rain lashes Mumbai; 1 injured in tree fall at Andheri||The city received between moderate and heavy rainfall on Tuesday night and through Wednesday, leading to waterlogging in several parts of south and central Mumbai on Wednesday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) stated that traffic was not affected due to waterlogging. Meanwhile, a 30-year-old person sustained minor injuries on Mahakali Caves Road in Andheri due to tree collapse at 12.48pm on Wednesday. The person was rushed to Cooper hospital and was discharged after treatment. In the 10 hours ending at 6pm on Wednesday, most areas in the island city recorded high rainfall compared with the suburbs. As per BMC’s automatic weather stations, Grant Road recorded 63mm of rain, Malabar Hill 87mm, Byculla 76mm, Worli 64.26mm, Matunga 68mm, Bandra 66mm, Chembur 64mm, Nariman Point 70mm; in the western suburbs, Malad recorded 42mm rain, Dahisar 47mm, Andheri 60mm, Vile Parle 56mm; and in the eastern suburbs Ghatkopar recorded 52mm rain, and Bhandup 62mm.In a statement on Wednesday, BMC said its recently completed stormwater drains project, in collaboration with Central Railways, at Sandhurst Road Railway station ensured that the chronic waterlogging spot did not flood this monsoon. “A 415-metre-long and 1,800-mm-diameter rainwater aqueduct was laid under the railway track by Central Railway. An additional box drain has been laid beyond the railway boundary to connect this rainwater canal to BMC’s main stormwater drain. The work was done over the past four months since March 2021 in collaboration with the railways. The task was extremely challenging due to Tata’s high-voltage power lines and large water pipes located at the site of the box drain. Micro-tunnelling method was used to ensure railway traffic was not disrupted,” the statement said.Between 8am and 6pm on Wednesday, BMC received five complaints of house collapse, of which one was in the eastern suburbs and four in the western suburbs. BMC also received 15 complaints of tree collapses, of which four were in the island city, five in the eastern suburbs and six in the western suburbs. The civic disaster management department received six complaints of short circuit across the city. No other mishap was reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rain-lashes-mumbai-1-injured-in-tree-fall-at-andheri-101626890261301.html
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FYJC CET registration portal temporarily shut due to technical glitch||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) was forced to shut down the portal for registration of the optional common entrance test (CET) for first-year junior college (FYJC) on Wednesday evening to “fix technical issues”. Thousands of FYJC aspirants across the state have complained of inaccessibility to the website for the second consecutive day.The state board, however, provided no clarity on when the portal will be up and running again.The registration website was to be open between July 20 and 26, but the state education board will extend this deadline by a few days. “The optional CET portal has been shut temporarily due to technical issues. The technical team is trying to resolve the problem. Students need not worry as we will extend the deadline and award more time for students to fill applications for CET,” said Dinkar Patil, chairman of MSBSHSE. The portal — http://cet.mh-ssc.ac.in/, which was supposed to open for online applications from 11.30am on Tuesday, remained inaccessible due to technical issues till Wednesday night and was shut thereafter.“We struggled for hours to access our results and were really hoping that the rest of the process to be smooth. But since Tuesday evening, the CET website has been crashing and many of us have not yet managed to access it,” said Ankush Rahane, an aspirant. He added that even the helpline numbers made available by the state board were running busy all day on Wednesday.Results for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) were announced online on July 16, but the website crashed within minutes into 1pm. With no board exams this year due to rising Covid-19 cases, the state decided to conduct an optional CET based on the state board syllabus. Around 1.574 million students from the state registered for Class 10 for academic year 2020-21. At present, only state board Class 10 students have received their results. However, students from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) who are still awaiting their results, can also register for CET.As per a government resolution (GR) made public by the state school education department, priority in admission to FYJC will be given to students based on their CET scores. Remaining seats will be allotted to students based on merit as per marks scored through Class 10 assessment method depending on the vacancy of seats in junior colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrafyjc-cet-registration-portal-temporarily-shut-due-to-technical-glitch-101626890200536.html
21-07-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: First dose vaccinations on hold||The administration of the first dose of Covishield and Covaxin Covid-19 vaccines will remain suspended at government health centres on Thursday due to a shortage. Officials of the health department said that the focus is on administering the second vaccine shot to eligible people, to increase the coverage of the vaccinated population.“Based on the availability of the vaccine, nearly 150-200 slots are available for the second dose at 29 government health centres on Thursday. Since there has been a shortage of vaccines, the priority is to make the second vaccine shot easily available to people who are in line to get their vaccination completed,” said Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer for Gurugram.On Tuesday, only 198 first doses were administered, of which 100 doses were of the Sputnik V vaccine. About 4,560 second doses were administered, largely covering people above 45 years and front-line workers. Of the 13,330 doses administered on the day, 4,758 were given at government health centres and 8,572 at private hospitals.Over 350,000 people have completed their vaccination schedule, by taking both doses, whereas over 1,334,332 have taken the first vaccine shot. The overall doses administered in the district stands at 1,686,800, the highest in the state.According to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was in the city earlier this week, there are over 2.5 million people in Gurugram who are to be covered under the Covid-19 vaccination. Based on the CM’s estimates, at least 53.3% population has received at least the first dose and 14% are completely vaccinated.According to Yadav, the first dose inoculation of Covaxin has remained suspended for about a month now. “Doses are reserved for the second shot as per the allocation done by the state health department. Meanwhile, session sites for the first dose are planned based on the supply of Covishield,” said Yadav.The administration of the first vaccine dose has remained disrupted for the past two weeks due to low stocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19first-dose-vaccinations-on-hold-101626889964662.html
21-07-2021||Gurugram||Palam Vihar residents want stormwater drain repaired on priority||Residents of Palam Vihar blamed the local government bodies for severe waterlogging in the colony earlier this week, alleging that water stagnated on roads as the main stormwater drain in the area was not repaired or cleaned.They said that officials were repeatedly asked to fix the Leg One (L-1) stormwater drain and cover it across its one-kilometre trajectory in the area, failure to undertake which led to the flooding of arterial and main roads in the colony.The residents’ welfare association (RWA) of the E and F blocks said that the stormwater drain has collapsed at many spots in the colony and that the surface of the drain is also giving way at several points, leading to concerns of groundwater contamination. “The drain is damaged at several places and we have repeatedly taken up the matter with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). Due to the lack of cleaning and silting, the water carrying capacity has reduced considerably and it caused heavy waterlogging on Monday. Water was stagnating up to a height of two feet on internal roads, “ said Colonel (retd) Davinder Behl, the RWA president.Officials of the GMDA said that tenders for the stormwater drain were already issued but the process was delayed after a resident approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) over environmental issues that may arise from the project.Pradeep Kumar, the chief engineer of GMDA, said, “Palam Vihar residents have approached us and shared their problems, after which it was decided that a fresh tender should be prepared for carrying out this work. A detailed tender is in the final stages at NIT Kurukshetra and we will soon allot it and get the work started. The concerns of the residents, environmental and others, would be addressed through this work.”Dharmvir Malik, the executive engineer of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), said that the internal drains of the sector have been cleaned but have limited capacity. “Once the main stormwater drain becomes fully functional, this problem will go away,” he said.Residents also said that residential areas and industrial units located upstream from them were discharging sewage into the drain. “The sewage in the drain causes the release of ammonia gas, which causes foul smell. The stagnant water also leads to mosquito breeding and makes life difficult for residents,” said Amar Meena, the general secretary of the RWA.Residents said that the drain should be cleaned at the earliest and relaid so that stormwater can flow freely. “For the last three days, there has been no electricity in our side of the Vyapar Kendra market because of flooding of the basement. The electricity panels are submerged in water,” said Karamvir Singh, a shop owner in Vyapar Kendra.Kumar also said that to prevent flooding and waterlogging, the GMDA would immediately deploy personnel and machinery to clean the drain. “It should be noted that waterlogging took place due to record rainfall on Monday, but it cleared by late evening. The systems put in place worked effectively,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/palam-vihar-residents-want-stormwater-drain-repaired-on-priority-101626889963591.html
21-07-2021||Gurugram||HSVP to auction 35 acres by September||Land parcels owned by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), on which no developmental activities have been planned, will be auctioned in the next two months for residential and commercial developments, officials said on Wednesday.Officials said that they are in the process of identifying such areas within the city and have identified 35 acres so far, which are likely to be auctioned in August or September.Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, Gurugram, said that 20 to 25 such sites have been identified and details of these land parcels were shared with the district town planner to plan them for residential and commercial use. “These sites are around 35 acres and will be put for auction either in August or September,” said Yadav.Faced with a funds crunch of late, senior officials in Chandigarh directed the authority to monetise its unutilised assets. Initially, properties will be identified in estate offices one and two of the city and areas adjoining Pataudi. Later, this process would be carried out in Rewari and Dharuhera as well, said officials.HSVP officials said that every week, a review meeting will be held to bring more such land under planning and development to monetise them. Officials said that the authority owns around 1,500 acres in Gurugram that can be monetised because of the cash crunch being faced by the authority. The focus is to develop this land, they said.Yadav said that plots under estate offices one and two in Gurugram and areas in Pataudi would be auctioned. “This land would be sold either as residential plots or commercial sites to developers through e-auction,” he said.HSVP officials said that large chunks of land owned by the authority have also been encroached upon and the same will be cleared and planned for the development of commercial and residential properties. “All efforts would be made to ensure that the land owned by authority is identified and cleared from encroachments,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-to-auction-35-acres-by-september-101626889962425.html
21-07-2021||Gurugram||Khori residents seek proof of rehabilitation registry, fearful of being duped again||Residents of Khori village in Faridabad who have registered for a rehabilitation scheme announced by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) said that they are not being given any proof of registration and raised concerns of being duped, in the absence of formal documentation.Shaheen Afroz (23), a resident of Islam Chowk in Khori village, whose house was demolished last week, said, “First, the authorities are not providing any documentation proof after the registration. Second, we also learnt that the registration form comes with a clause that we will have no right over our plot in Khori village. Those who have registered are clueless about the next course of action.”According to MCF officials, over 440 families have registered for the rehabilitation scheme that was announced last week, after which registrations started at a camp set up at Radha Swami Satsang Beas, near Surajkund.Residents said that registrations are being made on a basic form, which states that they will not have any further rights on land they had in Khori.Demolitions have been underway at Khori since July 14, after the Supreme Court in June directed the Haryana government and the MCF to remove “all encroachments”, consisting of around 10,000 residential units, in the Aravalli forest area, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge in the rule of law” and talk of “fairness”.As per the rehabilitation policy, the slum dwellers will get flats for economically weaker sections (EWS) equipped with basic facilities such as electricity, water and toilets in Dabua Colony and Bapu Nagar area. The criteria for allotment is that the income of the families must not exceed ₹3 lakh annually, and the name of the head of the family should be registered in the voters’ list of the Badkhal assembly constituency of Haryana as of January 1, 2021.A social activist, requesting anonymity, said, “First, the policy is just a draft, and it has not been notified by the state government. Further, residents who are even registering for the scheme are not being given any documents or registration slip; only their names are being noted down.”Officials, however, said that due process will be followed before allotment of houses is done to those who have registered for the scheme.Garima Mittal, the commissioner of MCF, said, “Around 445 people have already registered for the scheme, and we are checking all documents before taking the registrations. After a person fills the form, there will be multiple levels of checks, likely to be done by a neutral agency, before the allotment is done. All procedures are being followed and the next course of action will be shared soon.”Jitendra Kumar, the nodal officer for the rehabilitation scheme, did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-residents-seek-proof-of-rehabilitation-registry-fearful-of-being-duped-again-101626889961390.html

Police, however, said that animals had died of electrocution and managed to keep the crowd that had gathered under control.Wednesday’s carcasses were discovered at around 6am by people of Sadarpur village, police said. “We found a CCTV footage from the area that showed the two bulls were electrocuted due to an exposed power line from a transformer at around 1.30am. However, the locals were under the impression that the bulls had been poisoned. It took a lot of effort to disperse them. We have sent the carcasses for autopsy,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1. The autopsy report later confirmed electrocution, said police.On June 29, a bull’s decapitated carcass was found in a garbage dump in the area. The police recovered a knife from the spot and a case was registered at Sector 39 police station. A probe is still underway in the incident, said Singh. “A decapitated carcass was found here just a few weeks ago. Now, two more bulls were found dead. We thought that someone was targeting the animals. But the police told us that there was no connection between the two cases,” said Himanshu Singh, a resident of the area.Wednesday being Eid, police personnel in the Gautam Budh Nagar were on high alert. “Our units were out for patrolling. Though tensions remained high in the Sector 45 area after the morning incident, there were no law and order issues. Clerics already urged the public to avoid venturing out unnecessarily because of the pandemic. Everything went smoothly,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-bulls-found-dead-in-noida-sparks-tension-101626889002347.html

However, the authority is yet to decide on the details of the scheme, including the launch date.“It will take a week to finalise things on this project, including the plot size, rates and date of the launch of the scheme,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The park is to come up in Sector 28 and has got in-principle approval from the Uttar Pradesh government. The authority is expecting ₹5,250 crore investment in this project, said the officials.The state government had on August 4 last year appointed Yeida as the agency to execute this project. Subsequently, Yeida roped in the Kalam Institute of Health Technology (KIHT), Visakhapatnam, to prepare the detailed project report.The park will provide necessary infrastructure to support the ‘Make in India’ initiative and provide world-class medical products at an affordable price for treatment, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/plot-scheme-soon-in-proposed-medical-device-park-project-101626889001751.html

But we stood firm and got these devices installed. As per our estimates, we now save about ₹70 lakh per month,” said Tanwar.The tracking systems are linked to a control room at the corporation headquarters, he said.According to a municipal corporation officer familiar with the matter, the monthly fuel consumption in the months of January, February and March was 417,000 litres, 358,000 litres and 373,000 litres, respectively. This dropped to almost 283,000 litres a month from April, he added.The officer said that earlier fuel was distributed on the basis of trips that each vehicle would be expected to cover. The corporation has its own fuel pump near Raj Nagar Extension, while it has also tied up with two private filling stations. The vehicles are allowed to refill only from these stations.“Due to lack of supervision, many vehicles never completed these trips, and these resulted in leakages,” said the officer. “With the tracking system, we can now track the vehicle in real-time and also know if it diverted from its route.”In another decision, the municipal corporation will no longer procure diesel and petrol vehicles and instead go for only natural gas or electric powered vehicles.“We have decided that we will not procure any new vehicles which run on diesel and petrol. All new vehicles that will be purchased will either be electric vehicles or running on CNG fuel. We will carry out disposing of old vehicles in a phased manner. We have categorised these vehicles into three - type A, B and C. Type A consist of those vehicles which need to be taken off road immediately, while the other two categories are also based on age of vehicle and will be phased out in a timely manner as per norms,” Tanwar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gpsenabled-vehicles-ghaziabad-civic-body-saves-70-lakh-in-fuel-expenses-a-month-101626889000518.html

According to the directives of the directorate of social welfare, the district social welfare department has been tasked to verify the students’ details and issue a timetable for distribution of scholarships/fee reimbursements. The annual income criteria for SC and ST categories is less than ₹2 lakh per annum, while for general category it is less than ₹2.5 lakh per annum, the officials said.“Till 2019, the district used to get around 18,000 to 20,000 scholarship applications. However, last year only 13,000 applications were received due to Covid-19 pandemic. We are hoping this year more eligible students will apply for the same,” said Singh.Last year, 59 students had failed to get the reimbursements, said Singh. “Since many banks merged and some students’ bank IFSC codes changed, their scholarship amount could not be credited. However, GB Nagar saw the lowest failed transactions across UP. This issue will be resolved this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-to-form-database-of-children-eligible-for-scholarships-101626888881642.html

The police also recovered 18 stolen vehicles from them. The suspects were identified as Ankit, Saurabh and Abhishek who were nabbed from near Gaur City 2 in Greater Noida West. According to police officials, the suspects were arrested based on tip-offs from two criminals who were apprehended by the Bisrakh police following an encounter earlier this week. “They are all part of a vehicle lifters’ gang active in Delhi-NCR for the past several years. We have recovered two cars, nine Bullet motorcycles and seven other two wheelers from them. They mostly targeted two wheelers, specially Bullets and sports bikes, and sold them in rural areas of western UP for around ₹30,000-35,000 each,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2. He said that the police have already traced 10 of the recovered vehicles to Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad and spoken to the owners. At least 20 vehicle thefts have been attributed to the suspects so far, the police said, adding that other members of the gang are being identified. “We are also looking for people to whom these stolen vehicles were sold. Two of the victims are brothers of sub-inspectors in UP Police. The gang’s modus operandi was to use screwdrivers to force start the motorcycles,” said another police official. The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-of-auto-lifters-gang-nabbed-18-vehicles-recovered-101626888880462.html
21-07-2021||Noida||Noida: GIMS to study safety of administering two different jabs||The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, has proposed to study 12 important issues surrounding Covid-19, including the safety of administering two different vaccines and the association of the virus with fungal diseases like mucormycosis, also known as black fungus.The proposals have been sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which will fund the approved studies.GIMS director Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta said that after the second wave of Covid infections, the ICMR had asked medical colleges in the country to propose studies on topics mainly related to the impact on patients after infection.“The last date of sending the proposal was June 30 this year. We’ve sent proposals on 12 important subjects. The main aim of the studies is to examine the impact the pandemic has had on people of different age groups,” he said.He said the studies include the role of the short-term oral medication estradiol in post-menopausal symptomatic Covid-19 patients, evaluation of efficacy and safety of cross vaccination for Covid-19, a sero-immune response based prospective observational study of booster dose of vaccine and maternal and neonatal immunogenicity pattern in Covid-19 recovered and inoculated pregnant and lactating mothers.“We will also look into Covid-19 infections after vaccination among health care workers and genomic and immunological analysis of Sars-CoV-2 mutants and its association with enhanced opportunistic fungal infection with special reference to mucormycosis. If the ICMR is unable to finance us, the GIMS administration will begin the research from their own funds,” he said.Earlier, the ICMR had approved nine studies from GIMS, many of which are on the verge of completion, said Dr Saurabh Srivastava who is the head of medicine and the nodal officer of the Covid-19 ward in GIMS. “It included and assessment of safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit Covid-19, mental and social health of healthcare workers, involved in Covid-19 management and protocol for evaluation of rapid antigen test,” he said. “This time we have also proposed to look into ways to address Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy through evidence based behavioural change in UP.” Dr Srivastava said that there won’t be a cut-off date for the study. Dr NK Sharma, the president of Noida chapter of IMA, said that such research will certainly provide better Covid-19 management techniques. “Medical science is always based on new research. It’ll certainly benefit the medical fraternity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gims-to-study-safety-of-administering-two-different-jabs-101626888820462.html

Only 50 people will be allowed in the temple at one time,” said Ujjain in-charge collector Narendra Suryawanshi.However, the state government led by chief minister Shivraj Chouhan is yet to take a decision in this regard. Last year, the state government had banned Kanwar yatra.In MP, as many as 15 people tested positive on Wednesday and the number of active cases reduced to 185.

They took five to six bags of valuables and important documents with them, alleged Rajani. The incident took place on April 25, 2016, and subsequently, a case was registered with Khar police station.After almost six years since the case was registered, Salla moved a plea for pre-arrest bail on July 7, before the sessions court. Salla’s lawyer had claimed the prosecution story is completely false, baseless and without any substance.“Applicant learnt after the alleged incident that Sheetal Maftlal was in the bungalow continuously for more than 20 days and police were visiting the bungalow for investigation. There is no nexus of the applicant with the crime,” Salla had contended.The court after referring to several documents observed that Salla’s name was “inserted at a subsequent point of time while given of report, with an intention best known to the informant.”“Considering the report dated April 26, 2016, the letter dated April 28, 2016, given by informant to the Khar Police, prima facie there appears to be no involvement of the applicant in the crime,” reads the order.The court, while granting anticipatory bail to Salla, noted that she had attended police station as and when called by the investigator, goes to show an intention of the applicant to co-operate with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tarot-card-reader-shradha-salla-gets-bail-in-2016-case-101626887740993.html

21-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sessions court refuses bail to Raj Tyagi||The sessions court refused to grant bail to Raj Tyagi, son of former Mumbai Police commissioner Ramdeo Tyagi. Tyagi was arrested on June 30 for threatening and stalking his estranged wife even after restraining orders from court.His wife, Diana, had alleged that on June 26, he called her several times and threatened her. On June 29, Tyagi allegedly followed her when she was returning after meeting her lawyer. She further said Raj was carrying a weapon, hence she rushed to Bandra police station and lodged a case against him.The accused’s lawyer had argued that he had entered the vicinity of his wife’s residence only to see his children and had no intention to threaten his wife. The prosecution claimed that Tyagi was arrested for threatening his wife and was released on bail on June 23 after being in custody for almost three to four months. The prosecution also claimed that while granting bail, the high court had imposed a condition that he should not enter the jurisdiction of Bandra police station where his wife stays. He was also restrained from intimidating his wife and children.After hearing both the sides, the court noted, “If at all it was only the intention of applicant to see his children, he could have sent message to the informant about his intention or could have sought help from police by disclosing his intention which has not been done. Therefore, it is not acceptable that the applicant went with only the intention to see his children.’The court also noted that Tyagi, soon after coming out on bail, violated the conditions. “Accordingly, only three days after being released on bail, the second incident took place. Therefore, if the applicant is again released on bail with whatever terms and conditions there is every likelihood that he will again repeat the offence,” the court noted while rejecting his bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sessions-court-refuses-bail-to-raj-tyagi-101626887620428.html

21-07-2021||Mumbai||Mucormycosis cases drop 56% in Mumbai since June 27||The number of active cases of mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, in Mumbai has dropped to 169 as of July 21, from 384 on June 27, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data. Mucormycosis is a serious, but rare fungal infection caused by a group of moulds called mucormycetes. According to doctors, it causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and can be fatal if not treated on time.So far, 825 Covid-19 recovered patients have been admitted to private, civic and government-run hospitals for mucormycosis in the city. Almost 70% of patients are not Mumbai residents. The civic body has overall spent around ₹18 crore on antifungal medicines for the treatment.At the biggest civic-run hospital, King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, so far, a total of 139 mucormycosis patients have been admitted, of which 63 are still undergoing treatment. Data shows22 mucormycosis patients are being treated at BYL Nair hospital, Mumbai Central (total 86 cases so far); 24 at Lokmanya Tilak General (Sion Hospital) (total 78 cases so far); 13 at JJ, Byculla (145 total cases so far); 11 are under treatment at Dr RN Cooper hospital (42 total cases so far). Health officers said the flattening of the pandemic curve has resulted in a drop in the number of patients. “Admission of patients with mucormycosis has declined drastically in the last one month as the daily count of Covid-19 patients has dropped. Most patients who are getting admitted now are referred patients from other hospitals,” said Dr Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Doctors have observed that some patients who have undergone surgeries for removal of the dead tissues with the infection are returning to hospitals with the residual mucus. “On an average, each patient has to undergo at least two-three surgeries, which includes aggressive surgical debridement. In severe cases, patients have to undergo five-six surgeries too,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM hospital, which has a special ward to treat mucormycosis patients. Medical history shows that mucormycosis has a mortality rate of around 50%. However, in Mumbai, the fatality rate stands at 20%. Doctors have attributed this to timely intervention with the rise in awareness among people. Over ₹18 crore spent on anti-fungal medicines “Between May 25 and July 21, a total of 31,248 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin B have been procured for treatment of patients with mucormycosis,” said Dr Deshmukh. An analysis of the price shows that over ₹18 crore have been sent for procurement of the antifungal medicines. There are two types of drugs—Liposomal Amphotericin B and plain Amphotericin B. The first one is considered more effective, but the cost is much higher than the later. One vial of Liposomal Amphotericin B costs between ₹5,900 and ₹6,200. As per treatment protocol, when the black fungus infects the nose, sinus or palate, doctors give 5mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight. For instance, if a person is 60kg, he would require 300mg of the dose. Each vial consists of 50mg of the drugs. So, a patient needs 6 vials which costs ₹36,000 daily. But when the infection reaches the brain, doctors have to give 8-10mg per kg of the body weight. This doubles the daily medical expenditures.Dr Deshmukh said, “Many patients who get admitted at private hospitals with mucormycosis are referred to KEM hospital when they can’t afford the expensive treatment. At present, most of the admitted patients are such referral patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mucormycosis-cases-drop-56-in-mumbai-since-june-27-101626887500380.html

The BMC had last month appealed to citizens to file complaints against private hospitals charging more than the cap amount prescribed by the Central government.The Central government has put a cap of ₹780 per dose for the Covishield vaccine, ₹1,410 for Covaxin and ₹1,145 for the Sputnik V vaccine. All private hospitals in the city were asked to follow the cap announced by the Central government. The civic body had on June 11, appealed to the citizens to register a complaint with the health department of the BMC via email address complaint.epimumbai@gmail.com.Following this appeal, the BMC has received 29 complaints, of which 20 are related to vaccine overcharging. Of these 20 complaints, 16 are against private hospitals in Mumbai and the remaining four are of outside Mumbai. The remaining nine have been categorised as other complaints.According to BMC records, the 16 complaints of overcharging of Covid-19 vaccination are against 12 private hospitals in the city, while five are against two private hospitals in the western suburbs and the remaining are against private hospitals across the city.In total there are 412 vaccination centres, of which 103 are private hospitals running the vaccination centres and the remaining are public centres, run by the civic body and the state government. As of Tuesday, out of the total 6.5 million vaccine doses administered in the city, 2.7 million doses were administered in these private vaccination centres. A private hospital against whom the complaint has been received by the BMC said, “We are not overcharging anyone for Covid-19 vaccination. As per the norms, we are supposed to display the amount on the Co-WIN portal. It is for everyone to see there and also, we cannot put any amount which is more than the cap prescribed by the government. We feel the complaint could be from before the cap came into effect, by around June 8, 2021.”However, the BMC has maintained that they have received the complaints after the cap came into effect. Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department said, “We have got complaints after the cap for vaccination came into effect. We will have to verify whether the complainants are talking about the charges before the cap comes into effect. I have asked the health officers in each ward to investigate and submit a report regarding the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccination-overcharging-mumbai-civic-body-gets-16-plaints-against-12-pvt-hospitals-101626887440373.html
21-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra had plans to live stream porn content: Mumbai Police||Actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra, his brother-in-law Pardeep Bakshi and their manager Umesh Kamat had plans to start from February 20, 2021, live streaming of porn content through a new application, ‘Bollyfame’. However, the plan was dropped as Kamat was arrested on February 7, the probe has revealed.A crime branch officer said after some apps were removed from mobile app stores by Apple and Google in 2020, and Maharashtra cyber-crime officers booked directors and owners of various over-the-top (OTT) platforms and websites for allegedly showing obscene content, Kundra and his associates came started working on a new app to live stream porn content.They, the officer said, even created a WhatsApp group in the name of the future application, Bollyfame, and Kundra had revealed his plans on the group to Kamat and others. As per Kamat’s statement to police, initially, they wanted to launch the live streaming in January 2021, but it was delayed and February 20 was fixed as the launching date, the police officer added.Kamat also revealed in his statement to police that Kundra had told them on WhatsApp that they will shut down the Hotshot app and will also remove the obscene contents to avoid the investigation, the officer added.The racket came to light after the property cell received specific information about a porn filming racket and registered a case on February 4, 2021. The cell raided a bungalow in the Madh area and arrested five persons, including two women engaged in shooting a pornographic film. Police claimed to have rescued a young woman, who was allegedly lured into acting in a short film and forced to perform sex on camera.During the investigation police also found the alleged involvement of actor and model Gehana Vashisht in filming porn. Police arrested Kamat as she revealed that bought porn films from her and sent the films to the UK for uploading on Hotshots. Kamat then led police to Kundra.During the course of the probe, the property cell inspected Kundra’s office in Andheri on Tuesday and seized the server and several other electronic equipment from his office to scrutinise the technical aspects to gather more evidence.Kamat, who was also buying pornographic films shot by another arrested accused, Rowan Khan, was working as per the instructions of Kundra and contacted directors like Vashisht, Khan and several others and buy pornographic videos from them and sent those videos to the UK, from where those were uploaded on mobile app Hotshot, said the crime branch officer. The crime branch has so far frozen various bank accounts having deposits of around ₹7.5 crore, including an amount of around ₹3 crore lying in a bank account of wanted accused Yash Thakur, a native of Madhya Pradesh, currently residing in Singapore. The officer said he was running the app Nueflicks. Police are now scrutinising evidence seized from Kundra’s office like subscription hits, WhatsApp chats, agreement papers, emails and account details. Another police officer said the groups mainly targeted young women coming from outside to the city to try their luck in the film and television industry. Police officers said taking advantage of their desperation and helplessness, the accused allegedly lured them by offering roles in short films or web series. Initially, they would ask them to perform some “bold” scenes, but eventually either offer them more money to act in porn films or threaten them with the help of agreements, if they refused to budge.The officers said the gang has exploited many women and men by making several pornography films. The accused have been operating the racket for about two years. Khan threatened actors and forcing them to act in porn videos, said the crime branch officer.The Mumbai Police crime branch claimed Kundra had got a mobile application Hotshot developed for running a pornographic film racket and used to control its entire operation himself through WhatsApp groups and business was operated from his Andheri office.Kundra, along with one Sourabh Kushwah, according to the remand application, had in February 2019 started a company namely, Arms Prime Media Pvt Ltd. Around six months later, the company developed a mobile phone application, Hotshot, and then sold it to Kenrin Ltd., a London-based entity owned by Kundra’s relative Pardeep Bakshi for $25,000. In December 2019, Kundra resigned from Arms Prime Media, after which, one Sanjay Tripathi, a witness in the case, took it over.The mobile phone application, available only to paid subscribers, was used to upload pornographic content, shot in Mumbai and surrounding areas, police claimed. The remand application added that other accused and witnesses in the case have revealed that the pornographic films shot in Mumbai were transferred to Kenrin, London, from where the obscene content was uploaded on the Hotshot app. Kundra controlled the entire operation of the app through three WhatsApp groups that he had created in the name of “HS,” and that Kundra was the administrator of these WhatsApp groups.Police further claimed that it was through these groups — HS Accounts, HS Take Down and HS Operations — Kundra monitored the content, payments to artists and the revenue generated through the app. Bakshi made the payments based on Kundra’s instructions. Kamat was operating from office premises belonging to Kundra and coordinated with Kernin Ltd.Police on Monday night arrested Kundra and one Ryan Thorpe, a Nerul resident and an expert in information technology, who allegedly helped maintain the mobile phone application through two of his associates. Both Kundra and Thorpe are in police custody till July 23 for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raj-kundra-had-plans-to-live-stream-porn-content-mumbai-police-101626887380407.html

At least 42 Congress MLAs including four cabinet ministers were present at his residence who later accompanied him to Golden Temple and the shrines in a luxury bus.Most of his supporters there were seen without masks and violating social distance norms and this even worsened during their visit to the Golden Temple, which was already witnessing a heavy rush of devotees seen standing in long queues.The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) employees were trying to maintain social distancing among the devotees but after the group led by Sidhu entered the shrine complex, they were seen jostling with each other.“They are part of the government. If they are violating the norms, how can they ensure the compliance of the guidelines in public? How can they teach lessons to the general public,” asked an official of the SGPC, who was performing his duty in the shrine.The officials of the government refused to comment on this mass violation of Covid-19 containment guidelines at a time when courts have taken a dim view of any laxity which may precipitate the third wave of Covid-19 infections in the country.The situation didn’t improve even later in the day when Sidhu’s supporters were seen violating the guidelines at Durgiana Temple and Ram Tirath Temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-norms-go-for-a-toss-during-navjot-sidhu-s-show-of-strength-in-amritsar-101626886721136.html

21-07-2021||Patna||Pandemic holds up employment for govt care girl inmates||The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has delayed employment of girls of government care institutions run by the state social welfare department by at least three months, officials said on Wednesday. Under an initiative aimed at making them economically independent, altogether 14 inmates were sent to a Bengaluru institution in December last year to join diploma course in hotel and hospitality management. However, according to officials, their training period, which was supposed to start last month, has been postponed due to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, thereby delaying placement of the girls.“They were sent for training in hospitality and housekeeping, but the entire session has been delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown in Bengaluru. Training sessions are three months late now,” Rajkumar, director, social welfare department, said. Nearly 700 girls, who have either been abandoned or have left home, have been staying at government care institutions across Bihar. Those above 18 years of age have been staying at an after-care home in the state capital, the lone such institution in the state. Currently, over 250 girls stay there. Minor girls stay at 11 care homes in different districts of the state. Among the 14 girls who were sent to Bengaluru, five are from Patna, three from Motihari, and rest from Begusarai, Gaya, Purnia and Madhubani. According to officials, these girls would have been employed by now if the situation was normal. “They had received job offers from various leading hotels in Bengaluru,” Rajkumar said, adding that their placement will be done only after practical training is over. The department is in touch with these girls and their faculty heads, he said. “Another batch of 30 government care institution girls are also preparing to join the course, and if situation allows, they will be sent to Bengaluru in a few weeks.” Another official of the social welfare department, Dilip Kamat, said it is for the first time that such a facility has been provided to girls at government care institutions. The child welfare committee is bearing the cost of training of these girls, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pandemic-holds-up-employment-for-govt-care-girl-inmates-101626882520091.html

On the first day of 2021, Jharkhand recorded 1,659 active cases. The figure kept decreasing gradually till the end of February, before the caseload started heading north as the second wave started making its presence felt since mid-March. The number of active cases peak on May 8 at 61,195.Officials said the falling number is encouraging, as the active cases have decreased despite the health department not lowering guard on daily Covid-19 testing. “We are conducting around 50,000 tests everyday. But, positive cases have remained in double digits every day, which is encouraging. But, we cannot lower guard as we are technically still not out of the second wave, while the threat of another wave persists. The health secretary has directed to increase daily testing and ensure that contact tracing is done of all positive cases. We are especially focusing on incoming passengers from other states at railway stations and airport,” a health department official said on Wednesday.On Tuesday, the health department conducted 53,185 tests, of which only 33 samples were found positive, thereby recording a positivity rate of 0.06%.

21-07-2021||Patna||Bihar: Boost to medical oxygen in state facilities by Aug||Cryogenic liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks and 30-bedded Covid-19 dedicated paediatric intensive care units (PICU) would be set up at 10 existing state-run medical colleges in Bihar by August 31 as part of the government’s preparation for the third wave of the pandemic, officials said. A separate 10-bed PICU, dedicated for Covid-19 patients, would also be set around the same time at 36 district hospitals in the state, officials said. For storage of medical oxygen, four institutions, including the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), all in Patna, and the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital at Laheriasarai in Darbhanga, will have two cryogenic LMO tanks of 20 kilo-litre capacity each. The remaining six institutions, including the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH) in Gaya, Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JLNMCH) in Bhagalpur, Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) at Pawapuri (Nalanda) and the Government Medical College Hospitals at Bettiah and Madhepura will have one cryogenic LMO tank each of 20 kilo-litre storage capacity. These tanks will be installed in medical colleges on a rental basis, with the government paying roughly between ₹35,000 and ₹40,000 per tank monthly. The firm installing them will be responsible for the maintenance of tanks and supply of oxygen, officials said. The state has also decided to instal 20 kilo-litre cryogenic LMO tanks at all its upcoming medical colleges, including Bhojpur, Samastipur, Jhanjharpur and Purnia. “In addition to oxygen tanks, the government had also decided to have Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants at 122 locations for supply of piped oxygen at medical colleges, district hospitals and sub-divisional hospitals,” said Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey. Each of the 36 district hospitals in the state would have at least one such oxygen generation plant. All the 122 oxygen plants would be ready by August 31, he added. One such plant was commissioned at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna on July 18 while seven others were also on the verge of being commissioned shortly, the minister added. The PSA plant at IGIMS will generate 233 litres per minute oxygen would cater to refilling around 50 D-type oxygen cylinders, each containing around 47 litres of oxygen, in a day, said officials. These steps had been taken given the sharp increase in demand for oxygen during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic in April and May, said officials. Even during the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey claimed that the state managed its demand for medical oxygen with cooperation from the Centre. “The daily requirement of medical oxygen went up 14 times from 16 metric tonnes during the first week of April to 232 MT in 20-25 days. Despite the steep increase in oxygen demand, which no doubt created pressure on the system, we were able to arrange and provide oxygen to all government and private hospitals with cooperation from the Centre. The Centre increased our allocation and also helped in the transportation of medical oxygen, while we increased the number of refilling plants,” added Pandey..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-boost-to-medical-oxygen-in-state-facilities-by-aug-101626882340092.html
21-07-2021||Patna||Floods cause further delay in Panchayat polls||Panchayat polls in Bihar could be delayed further and start from mid-September onwards instead of August as planned earlier, state poll panel officials said, citing flood-like situation in several districts and an intensifying monsoon.The State Election Commission (SEC) has earlier planned to hold polls in 10 phases from August.Several districts in north Bihar, particularly Darbhanga and East Champaran, have witnessed flood-like situation after incessant rains over the past few days. “We want the major part of monsoon to be over so that there is good participation of voters and polling personnel face fewer difficulties in reaching distant places. Right now, things are a bit difficult because of rains, which has hampered communication systems. By September, things would be easy,” said a top SEC official familiar with the matter. “We have to complete the election process by November end so that panchayat bodies come into existence by December,” the official said. At present, the panchayat raj institutions ( PRIs) in the state are being run through advisory committees for a period of six months from June to December following an ordinance brought by the state government. The panchayat polls, scheduled to be held in March- April, were deferred owing to litigation over non-availability of specified electronic voting machines( EVMs) and outbreak of second wave of Covid pandemic in April. Top officials said a new schedule is being worked out based on feedback from the districts and after assessing ground level preparations at 1.14 lakh booths and availability of single-post EVMs. The SEC is also planning to hold election in initial rounds in such blocks where preparations are already at an advanced stage and there is less disruption from rains. Sources said over 1.50 lakh out of the total 2 lakh EVMs requisitioned from across the country have arrived in respective districts. “The first level checking of EVMs will start from August 1 and the process will be completed by August 20,” said SEC secretary Yogendra Ram. This time, the SEC will hold elections for four posts in three-tier PRIs ( gram panchayat member, mukhiya, panchayat samiti member and district board member) through EVMs while polling for two others posts in gram kutcheries , panch and sarpanch, would be held through ballot papers. Security deploymentState’s paramilitary forces, district armed police and Home Guards would be deployed at 1.14 lakh booths during the panchayat polls. Senior SEC officials said at least one police officer and three constables would be deployed on every booth. Panchayat polls in the state over the past one decade have been largely peaceful but there were incidents of large-scale rigging and violence in the 2007 panchayat polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/floods-cause-further-delay-in-panchayat-polls-101626882280063.html

Phoolan Devi belonged to the Nishad community, which consists mainly of boatmen and accounts for 14% of UP’s population along with other subcastes. She was shot dead in New Delhi on July 25, 2001.Sahni, a former Bollywood set designer and now Bihar’s animal husbandry minister, has got built 18 such statues, each 18-foot high.“Phoolan Devi is still alive in our thoughts for her struggles for the pride and prestige of women of our community. We are celebrating July 25 as her martyrdom day in Bihar and UP and we are going to install 18 idols of Phoolan Devi in UP and some in Bihar,” Sahni said. “I will attend one such programme in Varanasi on July 25,” he said. Sahni, who had earlier announced that his party would contest on at least 165 of the total 403 assembly seats in UP and hinted at an alliance with BJP, said Phoolan Devi wanted to bring the Nishad community on one platform and ensure injustice is not done to them. The VIP was founded by Sahni in November 2018. In 2019, the party fought parliamentary polls from three seats in Bihar in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress, but drew a blank. It, however, won four seats in 2020 assembly elections in Bihar. “Right now, we are focusing on the 2022 UP elections. I am sure we will have more MLAs in Uttar Pradesh and MPs from Bihar, UP and Jharkhand in the 2024 general elections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sahni-bets-on-phoolan-s-legacy-for-vip-footprint-in-up-101626882220082.html

The idea is to attract customers in the available time. We have also introduced light cocktails in our afternoon course. People also don’t prefer hard drinks in the afternoon. Nothing like the weekend crowd, but we are managing to keep things moving with new innovative ideas,” said Karan Kripalani, owner of Hippie@Heart.The live music or bands which were popular features for weekend evenings have now become popular during afternoon hours.“In Kalyani Nagar, many bars and cafes have changed their weekday menu and provide dishes which were earlier reserved only for the weekend,” said Rohan Deshmukh, resident of Kalyani Nagar.Few people are opting to visit cafes to beat the boredom of work-from-home and continuing work with a sip of coffee.“I generally come to Starbucks at 11 am and spend time here. I am doing this at least twice a week. Even a few important meetings of our office take place at coffee shops,” said Kalyani Sakhare, who works at a real estate firm at Balewadi high street.Many restaurant owners do feel that timing should be extended till 10 pm for dine-in on weekdays.“We are ready to follow all norms set by the PMC and continue with seating arrangement with 50 per cent capacity, but the timing should be extended.

21-07-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka BJP legislative party meeting cancelled amid buzz over Yediyurappa||Amid speculations of a leadership change in the Karnataka government, chief minister BS Yediyurappa has cancelled the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislative party meeting he called on July 26, the second anniversary of his government, in a possible signal that he may still be in control, some BJP leaders indicated.It was speculated that a new leader could be elected in the BJP legislative party meeting that the CM called after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and other senior BJP leaders a couple of days ago in Delhi. However, its cancellation has added to the confusion on Yediyurappa’s political future. Two leaders in the know of the developments said instead of the legislative party meeting, Yediyurappa has called for a dinner meeting of all MLAs on Sunday. The leaders emphasised that it shall not be seen as a meeting of the legislative party. Some BJP leaders say the cancellation is Yediyurappa’s message that a leadership change is not imminent. “You have seen the developments in the last few days. People are rallying behind the chief minister,” said a legislator from Bengaluru on the condition of anonymity. Even though Yediyurappa denied any plan to step down at the conclusion of his meeting with Central high command during New Delhi visit last weekend, many in the party continued to suggest that he will soon step down in accordance with a transition formula agreed upon. These speculations were further strengthened with an audio clip, allegedly of party state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, hinting at a change of guard. Meanwhile, more pontiffs from the religious mutts across the state visited Yediyurappa on Wednesday and extended their support to the chief minister. Among prominent seers who visited Yediyurappa was the pontiff of Siddaganga Mutt, Tumkur, which has a large following among the Lingayat community in the state. Siddaganga seer said it was the view of all pontiffs to allow Yediyurappa to continue as chief minister. “Our wish is that he remains CM for a full term,” he said. Yediyurappa is hosting seers for the second consecutive day after meeting several of them on Tuesday. Veera Someshwara Shivacharya Swami, one of the pontiffs who met Yediyurappa on Tuesday said any move to replace Yediyurappa will have big consequences for the BJP. “Friction is common in politics, let anyone say anything, we have confidence that BS Yediyurappa will continue as the chief minister and complete the term. If there are any shortcomings in this, it will have big consequences for the party,” he said. BJP MP from Bengaluru North and former Union minister D V Sadananda Gowda on Wednesday said there was no chance of leadership change in Karnataka as the BJP central leadership was pleased with the developmental activities and the handling of Covid-19 in the state. “I don’t think there is any truth in the ongoing discussion about the leadership change because these decisions are taken by our Central leaders keeping in view the political situation in the states,” the former chief minister told reporters in Bengaluru. He added that Yediyurappa had explained the prevailing situation in the state and government’s Covid management and developmental credentials to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home minister Amit Shah, and the party realised that a change was not required.“It is my strong gut feeling that there is absolutely no chance of leadership change. These are all speculations,” he said. On pontiffs of various Lingayat matts rallying behind Yediyurappa, Gowda said, “Whenever we do some good work, people appreciate it. As a result, people stand in his favour.” The MLAs who quit the Congress-JD(S) coalition to join the BJP are also concerned about the speculations. The Yediyurappa government’s expansion last week honoured a long standing promise to reward the rebel MLAs who helped the BJP return to power in the state in 2019. “Initially when there was a delay in giving us cabinet positions, it was Yediyurappa who stood by us. We don’t know what is going to happen because there is no clear message from the Central command on change in leadership, we will wait and watch,” said one of the MLAs who had joined BJP after quitting the previous JDS-Congress government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-bjp-legislative-party-meeting-cancelled-amid-buzz-over-yediyurappa-101626877061130.html

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Fear defeats more people than any other thing in the world||Not so long ago when I was in Australia, on one of the islands within the Great Barrier Reef, preparing for my first-ever snorkelling experience with three other first-timers, our young guide gave us a clear and simple advice. “We will not go far from the beach to remain in the shallow zone but if fear of any kind is radiated, you’ll end up drowning even when there are no chances for it. Just remember, you’ll be safe.” And we did return safely to the beach after 45 magical minutes in the water. Rather, we were back with a thrilling experience, catching glimpses of rare aquatic life. With the fear of coronavirus everywhere, this memory keeps crossing my mind and as it echoes, I go on sharing it with others. Truly, the pandemic has enveloped most of us in fear despite the choice to remain calm. Fear is no panacea; instead, it only snatches away every ingredient of our much-needed tranquillity. Yet, we hold on to it tightly. We forget when calmness is gone, we become more helpless and perplexed. In other words, it makes us cry before we are hurt and if several medical studies are to be believed, fear not only disturbs the digestive system but also plays havoc with our immunity, for which we have been ubiquitously concerned since the pandemic’s arrival. Hence, isn’t it the worst companion? Whenever my octogenarian maternal grandmother called up during the second wave, she always began the conversation with the latest number of Covid deaths. “Don’t go out, just stay home. Keep washing your hands,” she would add after sharing the gravest Covid news she had read or heard. But when my aunt from the village would call, I could sense the serene ringing in her words, which may also be resonating with several books on psychology. She reminded me that it’s all in the mind. “There are many taking all precautions but still scared. But if we tell our mind (also refers to it as a parrot), that we are safe and healthy; we will remain so, because our thoughts hold huge power for our body. We should only think what we want to experience and it works.” The fear of Covid was so high with an elderly woman in the neighbourhood that whenever any vegetable seller would come up, she would throw a fit. “Don’t come here! Go back, right away.” When children would play near her house, she would chase them away angrily. With all precautions in place at her home, neither she nor other members in her family ever got infected with Covid but the fluctuation in her blood pressure turned into an everyday tale. A late uncle of mine who was told by doctors that he may survive only for few months due cancer eventually ended up living for many years. We all believe that it was because what we always believed in and often said: “Cancer can do nothing to me, and I don’t even think that I have any disease.” For an obvious reason, American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson came up with this thought: “Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world.” I absolutely agree. rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fear-defeats-more-people-than-any-other-thing-in-the-world-101626870160025.html

The family members were trying to race ahead of the train to catch it in Varanasi when the driver lost control and the vehicle crossed the divider, and smashed into a truck trailer in the opposite lane, Hindustan Times' sister publication Live Hindustan reported.The incident happened in Rohaniya area of Varanasi.According to Live Hindustan report, Lilavati and his elder son Ashutosh needed to catch a train from Prayagraj to go to Siwan in Bihar.

Ajit occupied the front seat, while the back seats were taken by Lilavati and her grandson Chandan. When the car reached Prayagraj station, the family learnt that the train had already left from there. They then decided to board the train from the next station at Gopiganj. However, when the car arrived at Gopiganj, the train had left from there as well. The next stoppage was Varanasi, and the family decided to drive fast in order to reach the station before the train.Owing to the speed, the car went out of control on the highway near Rajatalab in Varanasi. As a result, the vehicle ran over the divider and drove into another lane before colliding with the trailer. The car’s hood was blown away in the incident. Local people informed the police, but even after they arrived, it took several hours to evacuate those trapped inside the damaged car.

Gowda’s remarks came after similar denials by Yediyurappa and the party's state unit.“I don't think there is any truth in the ongoing discussion about the leadership change because these are the decisions which are taken by our central level leaders keeping in view the political situation in the states,” he told reporters in Bengaluru, according to news agency PTI.Yediyurappa met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on July 16 (Friday) and BJP president JP Nadda the next day. He then denied allegations about his resignation and said that the meeting was only to discuss issues related to the state. He also said that he would visit Delhi again to meet with the leaders in the first week of August.Also read | Yediyurappa shares what Amit Shah told him on Lok Sabha polls, Karnataka affairsGowda, a former Karnataka chief minister himself, further said that there were no reasons to remove Yediyurappa from the top post and the central leadership has appreciated the government’s actions to handle the Covid-19 pandemic and also other development activities. “It is my strong gut feeling that there is absolutely no chance of leadership change. These are all speculations,” he said.When asked about the support expressed by various Lingayat seers in favour of the CM, Gowda replied, “Whenever we do some good work, people appreciate it. As a result, people stand in his favour.”“I feel that there is no chance for leadership change. Rest is left to the national level leaders,” he further reiterated.State home minister Basavaraj Bommai also said that Yediyurappa would continue as the CM. “Chief minister is going to continue, he himself has said it. Our in-charge Arun Singh had also said it. Through all these speculations and rumours they are trying to create political instability,” PTI quoted Bommai as saying on Wednesday.Last month, BJP state in-charge Arun Singh visited the state and met with all members of the unit hearing their complaints and demands. Following this, he too had denied any change of leadership within the government. Some members of the Karnataka BJP unit have expressed their displeasure with Yediyurappa on many occasions earlier, causing the speculations.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bjp-leader-sadananda-gowda-says-no-chance-for-leadership-change-in-karnataka-101626867517661.html

While he was born in Bardhaman in Bengal, he spent his later years in Patna, Bihar.A museum dedicated to Dutt, a freedom fighter and an associate of Bhagat Singh, was developed in Bardhaman in 2015 but awaits inauguration.The museum is located close to Dutt’s ancestral house in Oanri village where he was born in 1910. Dutt was arrested along with Bhagat Singh in the Central Assembly bomb case in 1929. While Bhagat Singh was hanged to death, Dutt was awarded a life sentence and was deported to the Andaman Cellular Jail. Later, he was shifted to Hazaribagh Jail; from there to Delhi and then to Bankipur jails. Also Read | With eye on Nishad votes, VIP to install Phoolan Devi’s statues in UPIn 1938, he was released because of deteriorating health on the condition that he would not participate in any political movement. Dutt, however, joined Mahatma Gandhi’s freedom movement and was again jailed. He was finally released when the country gained Independence. The freedom fighter died on July 20, 1965.On his 56th death anniversary on Tuesday, his daughter and retired Patna University teacher Prof Bharti Bagchi said, “The honours that he deserved continue to elude him even after five decades of his death.” Though, she added, Dutt’s ancestral house at Oanri in Bardhaman has been renovated and has been declared a heritage monument. “The museum was developed by the West Bengal government, but I donated my land for it. The building was ready in 2015 but has remained locked since,” she said. “Batukeshwar Dutt Sanrakshan Samiti, a committee of the locals, monitors the museum work. They say some work is still pending and that’s why the inauguration has been delayed,” she said. HT tried calling committee members several times to ascertain what was causing the delay but could not get through. Dutt’s house in Patna’s Jakkanpur locality, where he spent his last years, was also set to be declared a protected monument but nothing came of that either. “This house was built by my father. And in 2007-08, there was an initiative by the Archaeological Survey of India, Patna Circle, to get this house declared a protected monument. But soon, the official who took steps in this direction got transferred, and the matter got sidelined,” Bagchi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bengal-museum-for-freedom-fighter-batukeshwar-dutt-awaits-inauguration-101626867821204.html

To get around this difficulty, the state government in 2016 had enacted the Odisha Offices of Profit (Removal of Disqualifications) Amendment Act to declare that MLAs who are appointed as chairpersons of district planning committees, special development council and Western Odisha Development Council would not be disqualified from being the members of the legislative assembly.Also Read | Two sentenced to 20-year rigorous imprisonment for raping minor in OdishaHowever, Beura, in his petition before the high court said the 22 BJD MLAs who were appointed as chairpersons of several district planning committees and special development councils have been given minister of state status, giving them pecuniary advantage. Those MLAs, by virtue of being ministers of state, drew a sumptuary allowance, daily allowance and travelling allowance, while enjoying government accommodation and vehicles.The petitioner told the high court that in the case of Brundaban Nayak vs Election Commission of India in 1965, the Supreme Court had ruled that complaints under Article 192 of the Constitution seeking disqualification of MLAs must be disposed of as expeditiously as possible. As per the process, the governor has to obtain the opinion of the Election Commission of India (ECI) and dispose of the applications within a prescribed period.A public relations official in the governor’s secretariat said the order copy from the high court is yet to reach the governor. “He will go through the order once it reaches him and take necessary steps,” the official said.BJD MLA from Koraput, Raghuram Padal, who heads the special development council in the tribal-dominated district, said he does not consider the state government giving him minister of state status as office of profit. “We are doing a lot of work for people and these allowance can’t be called profit,” he said.Similarly, Rajendra Dholakia, BJD MLA from Nuapara and chairman of Nuapara District Planning Board Committee, said he too does not consider his status office of profit. “The state government must have given me the responsibility after a lot of deliberations and vetting by law department. I, therefore, don’t think I hold an office of profit,” he said. A BJD spokesperson, meanwhile, refused to comment on the high court order, saying it was for the governor to comply with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/orissa-hc-asks-guv-to-dispose-of-plea-to-disqualify-mlas-for-holding-office-of-profit-101626862779623.html

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said the “cyberattack on the selective Indians” could not have happened without the Centre’s approval. It questioned who will take responsibility for the snooping while demanding a probe by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC).

We’ll be making Mutton Biryani and Seekh Kebab or Shami Kebab. Everything is made from scratch, at home... My father (late Ebrahim Alkazi, theatre doyen) had an Arab background, and there was a typical dish Jareesh, which we made out of broken wheat, meat and spices. There are very fond memories of eating that while growing up. And they are part of our heritage. But, we tend to not to have it in summer months,” he says. Ustad Shujaat Khan, sitarist, reminisces his childhood, Eidi and Sheer Korma. He adds, “This Eid, there will be five different kinds of meat that we’ll prepare. We’ll also make the Sheer Khurma, Shami Kebab, and Biryani. I remember, as a child, I used to come back from namaz and get Eidi, and wait for Sheer Korma to get ready. When I was young, artistes would come in to wish my father (sitarist, late Ustad Vilayat Khan), and spend the day, hang out, and laugh. I miss meeting more and more musicians now.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dilli-wali-eid-mubarak-feel-at-home-with-festive-delights-101626857217093.html

The farmers leaders have said that 200 farmers will go to Jantar Mantar daily from the Singhu border till the time the monsoon session of Parliament is on.Talking about the Independence Day, Roy said that the number of people has been scaled down to 50 per cent."The deployment of staff for security checks has been in force for two months. Internal checks at markets, near Chandni Chowk area and inside Red Fort are being done," added Roy.The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has already shut the Red Fort for the public from July 21 to August 15. The historical site usually remains closed for seven days before Independence Day, but this year, the duration has been extended, the ASI said.The Delhi Police had earlier suggested closing the Red Fort from July 15 in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and security reasons. According to news agency PTI, the police made the suggestion in a letter on July 12.Earlier this year on Republic Day, farmers protesting against the three farm laws reached Red Fort during a tractor rally, which led to clashes with the police.The Prime Minister of India hoists the Tricolour and addresses the public from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi every year during the Independence Day as part of the celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kisan-panchayat-independence-day-delhi-police-gears-up-with-3-layered-security-101626855166737.html

This is completely false,” Jain said, adding both hospitals and media had flagged the shortage of the life saving gas daily and claimed there were many deaths in Delhi and other parts across the country.Delhi, along with other regions, recorded a massive surge in cases and deaths due to the viral disease in April when the pandemic was in its worst form.They (Centre) will soon say there was no COVID-19. If there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen, then why were hospitals going to High Court for shortages? This is completely false: Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Centre saying 'no deaths due to lack of oxygen' pic.twitter.com/FTz56X6kUwThe national capital’s health infrastructure saw a near collapse as hospitals struggled with a severe shortage of medical oxygen and could only manage to procure very limited supplies for a very short duration. Many seriously infected Covid-19 patients reportedly died due to the dire unavailability of the life saving gas. On many occasions, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged the Centre to provide a daily quota of 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi.However, the AAP-led government also faced the ire of the public and the Centre over the oxygen crisis in April and its unpreparedness to tackle the pandemic. Last month, a war of words broke out between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the AAP after the former, citing a Supreme Court appointed audit panel report, alleged the Delhi government exaggerated its demand for oxygen by over four times between April 25 and May 10.Meanwhile, health minister Jain also said on Wednesday that the Delhi government had formed an audit committee to provide compensation to the victims, which had been stopped by the Centre through the lieutenant governor (L-G). Underlining that complete data of deaths due to oxygen would have been out if the committee was formed, Jain further said, “The Centre is rubbing salt on wounds. We’ll appeal to the L-G to allow us to run the committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-minister-hits-out-at-centre-s-no-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-remark-101626854612837.html

21-07-2021||Mumbai||Red alert in Mumbai, chances of over 200mm rain in some parts till July 22||An initial orange category alert for July 21 and 22 was upgraded to red at 1pm by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), indicating higher chances of severe weather events.“A yellow alert indicating mainly heavy rainfall was there for Mumbai only for July 20. For July 21, we had already indicated chances of very heavy rainfall with orange alert. This has been upgraded today to red alert, indicating chances of extremely heavy rain, keeping in mind the synoptic situation,” said a meteorologist with the IMD in Mumbai. “These rains are not thunderstorm rains like we saw on early Sunday. It is the result of very strong westerly winds bringing in moisture from an active monsoon trough that runs along coastal Maharashtra. Mumbai could easily see another 50 to 60mm of rain by this evening,” said the official quoted above.Also Read | Heavy rain over N-W India likely to gradually reduce from todayOn Wednesday, the city woke up to its fourth consecutive day of rainfall, recording 23.9mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am (down from 38.4mm recorded in the 24 hours prior). Widespread heavy to very heavy rains are expected across Mumbai, with chances of extremely heavy rain (in excess of 204.5mm) in isolated locations through the day, along with chances of occasional gusty winds of 40-50 kmph, gusting to 60 kmph in some areas.An off shore monsoon trough at mean sea level near the Maharashtra coast is likely to remain vigorous for the next three to four days, along with a shear zone in the mid-tropospheric level, and Mumbai will continue to see an active monsoon spell for the “next 4-5 days with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places,” the IMD said in a bulletin released Tuesday. A cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat and a low pressure area forming in the Bay of Bengal around July 23 will also facilitate heavy rains in the Konkan coast for a few days. There is a chance of decreasing rains only after July 24, officials said.The total rainfall for the month of July now stands at close to 990mm, in excess of the 827mm normal set by the IMD. Seasonally speaking, Mumbai has now received 1943.7mm of rain, or 88% of the total seasonal normal up to September-end. Officials said that the rainfall record for July may well cross the 2000mm mark in the next 24 hours. For comparison, during monsoon season last year, July had recorded 1469mm of rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-rain-to-continue-till-friday-but-no-indication-of-extreme-weather-yet-101626849038735.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||The lost recipes of festive feast||The way we celebrate festivals has changed over time. What used to be a grand affair not so long ago, is now more intimate and personal. And delicacies that took hours to prepare and had a distinct aroma and flavour to them, are now replaced with quick and ready to eat variants. The festival of Eid ul-Adha today, reminds one of many such great dishes that have been part of the celebrations for generations.“We used to wait entire year to eat bakra musallam (the grilled goat). It was an intricate process; the whole goat was marinated and then grilled in a pit. The meat was shared by the entire community. Now families are nuclear and everyone celebrates it in the close circle and that’s why community dishes are on the verge of extinction,” says Osama Jalali, chef and restaurateur, adding, “All the grilled items used to be the speciality of this Eid. Mutton parchey (fine thin lamb slices, marinated and grilled) used to be another popular dish. Kacche kimme ki tikiya (minced meat kebab) and fresh organ meat such as kaleji were equally popular. One recipe that everyone loved in Rampura cuisine and is completely lost now is gosht ka halwa..” Dahi pakori, or dahi phulki as it is called in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, is also an Eid treat, says food historian and author Anoothi Vishal. “I’d look forward to not just the dahi bada aunty served but also the dry fried seviyan full of dried fruit. While many people know of seviyan cooked in milk, the dry ones, roasted in ghee with sugar and dried fruit are decadent,” she says.It’s all about mutton biryani, mutton qorma, or those frozen packet kebabs now, says food blogger, Sarah Hussain. “My nani, Christina Khan, one of the finest cook I have seen, told me that people have almost forgotten how delicious it is to eat mutton stew, lamb leg roast, bihari boti, kafta kebab and lohori karahi,” she says. Remembering his favourite dishes that are rarely cooked now, chef Anees Khan, says, “Dum or Kimami Seviyan, sweet vermicelli dum cooked with sugar, saffron, nuts and mawa still make me fall on my knees. Traditional sheer kurma which takes six-seven hours to prepare, slow cooked kacchay ghost ki biryani are least known now. More often people on festival days order food from the local caterer) and the tradition of passing down recipes is dying a slow death.”Recipe Gosht Ka HalwaIngredients250 gms mutton mince fine1500 ml milk200 gm ghee5 table spoon green cardamom powder200 gm khoyasugar to tasteSaffron water half litre Almonds and cashew and pistachioStepsIn a heavy bottom pan Boil 500 ml of milk with3 tbsp cardamom powderOnce it comes to boil add the fine paste of meat and let it boil together.

21-07-2021||Bangalore||Lingayat mutts and leaders rally behind BSY amid row||Heads of several mutts in Bengaluru met Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa amidst speculations of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) replacing him, despite him saying that the decision would depend on the party high command.“I will have to abide by the decision of the party high command,” the CM is reported to have told the delegation of priests. The political and religious leaders of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, which comprises 16 per cent of the state’s population and the biggest vote base for BJP, promised their support to Yediyurappa following the meeting.The Lingayat community is back in focus with speculations of Yediyurappa’s departure. Yediyurappa has been the face of the Lingayat community in the party and has enjoyed big electoral support from its members.One of the pontiffs who attended the meeting said that Yediyurappa told them that he would abide by the BJP high command’s decision.Several of the mutt leaders who attended the meeting have warned the BJP against any move to dislodge the 78-year-old. Veera Someshwara Shivacharya Swami said any move to replace Yediyurappa will have big consequences for the BJP. “Friction is common in politics, let anyone say anything, we have confidence that BS Yediyurappa will continue as the chief minister and complete the term. If there are any shortcomings in this, it will have big consequences for the party,” he said.Muruga mutt seer Sri Shivamurthy Sharanaru held a press conference in support of the senior BJP leader, in Chitradurga district on Tuesday in support of Yediyurappa. “Yediyurappa may belong to the Lingayat caste and religion. But he is a leader for all. He is a mass leader who treats everyone equally. He has worked for the development of people of all castes and religions equally. That is why he must continue as the CM of the state,” the seer said. “Yediyurappa is a grassroots level leader. He has built the party from the scratch. He should not be disturbed. We are here to support him and express solidarity with him. The party will suffer if he is removed,” the Murugha mutt seer added.Yediyurappa is said to have told the delegation that he will have to abide by the decision of the BJP high command, giving some credence to speculation that a change of leadership is on the cards. “Yediyurappa only said that he is not in a position to speak anything on the issue and will have to abide by the decision of the high command. He did not say anything else,” Balehosur mutt’s Dingaleshwar Swamy, who led the delegation of pontiffs, said.“When we questioned Yediyurappa what happened, he said he will not comment on that, and the high command’s decision is final. He did not say anything else. The unanimous opinion of the pontiffs is: don’t replace Yediyurappa. If it is done, you (BJP) will face bad consequences in the days to come,” he added.The pontiff told reporters that if in any situation Yediyurappa is replaced, the BJP will probably get decimated in Karnataka. “This is not only our opinion but of a majority of people of the state,” he added.On Monday, senior Lingayat leader in the Congress party and the former minister MP Patil had said the Lingayat community would be upset if the BJP high command removed Yediyurappa from the post. “Surely, the Lingayats will be displeased with the BJP’s central leaders if they remove the Lingayat leader BS Yediyurappa from the post of the chief minister,” Patil tweeted.Another Congress leader and president of All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (the largest group within the Lingayat community) Shamanuru Shivashankarappa, who met the chief minister on Monday, said the latter should continue with the post.Shivashankarappa, who met Yediyurappa at his residence for over an hour, had told media that the Veerashaiva community was standing firmly with Yediyurappa and any efforts to dislodge him would not go down well with the community. ”If they dislodge Yediyurappa, the BJP will suffer the same fate that happened when Nijalingappa and Veerendra Patil were removed.The BJP must think about this history before venturing into any adventures. It is BB Shivappa and BS Yediyurappa who toiled hard and built this party. If they remove him, they will be ruined,” he had said.As the speculations continue, Yediyurappa has called the legislative party meeting on July 26. This decision comes after he returned to the state after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda in New Delhi last week.On his return, he told the media that the central leadership asked him to continue. “The central leaders have asked me to continue as chief minister and strengthen the party. We must follow their instructions from time to time. There is no question of leadership change,” Yediyurappa told reporters on his return from Delhi.However, since returning to Karnataka, Yediyurappa has not issued any public statements denying the rumours of his replacement.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/lingayat-mutts-and-leaders-rally-behind-bsy-amid-row-101626846727441.html

An official, requesting anonymity, said, “It becomes easier to hurl lethal weapons over the compound wall, narcotic drugs stuffed inside rubber balls, mobile phones, among other things, for use of the inmates.”The PMC has now served the 40 house owners notice for building illegal structures in the vicinity of the jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/illegal-construction-near-patna-jail-poses-security-threat-say-authorities-101626843758252.html

21-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The ABCD boy||The evening showers have stopped one hour ago, but the roadside ditches are still full of rainwater. Some prudent scooterists have actually kept their protective plastic capes wrapped around themselves, in case it rains again. All around, the homeless people living in the area have emerged from the Oberoi Hotel flyover they used as shelter. On this central Delhi avenue, pavements are alight with their cooking fires—from a distance they look like candles.Tonight, the traffic light by the flyover is missing one of its most regular sights—a man often wearing a hat who’s used to going from one car window to another, wordlessly asking for money, and who flashes comradely salutes to most, even to those who decide to ignore him.When the light turns red, a big white car halts, all windows closed. There must be AC inside, shielding its occupants from the humidity outside. The windows are covered with rain drops. A child appears on the road, as if out of thin air, and walks towards the driver’s window. The boy cannot be more than 5 or 6 years old, his head barely reaching the side mirror. He’s wearing a pink T-shirt that is too big for him, and that falls like a kaftan around his thin figure. One expects a usual traffic signal sight—the child knocking on the car window for money. But he doesn’t do that.Instead, he slowly, concentratively writes ABCD on the misty window with his left hand. The next moment the light turns green. The car drives away, along with the rest of the stranded traffic. The boy is no longer seen.That same evening, lawyer Rohan Agrawal posts on his Instagram a picture of a child drawing a similar ABCD on his car window—he clicked it from inside the car.But this picture, he says, was taken at the traffic light outside Bhikaji Cama Place Metro station, and the boy in it is wearing a purple shirt and a chain around his neck. This means that there are at least two kids in our city who, on rainy days, practice their ABCD this special way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-abcd-boy-101626835701092.html

Party rank and file lined up with garlands, banners, flags and bouquets at Golden Gate, the main entrance to Amritsar from National Highway 1, to welcome Sidhu, who was accompanied by four working presidents and Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra, and Nawanshahr MLA Angad Singh Saini. Amritsar has sent Sidhu to Parliament three times.Talking to reporters, Sidhu reiterated his focus on the Punjab model. “The 18-point programme released by the Congress high command will pave the way for people to be shareholders of power. Let the power given by the people be returned to them in the form of development,” he said.Meanwhile, a group of 20 farmers arrived outside the Bhagat Singh museum to show black flags to the state Congress chief. They later said they wanted to question Sidhu over the party’s poll promises for farmers. Police kept the protesters at bay till Sidhu left the venue.“The protesters wanted to question Sidhu. The Congress leaders were on the other side and wanted to avoid clashes. No lathicharge was done,” Avtar Singh, station house officer of Banga, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-given-a-warm-welcome-in-amritsar-101626827707537.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||LG to decide on reopening of spas, Delhi govt tells high court||The Delhi government on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that it has forwarded the file for the reopening spas in the national capital to lieutenant-governor (LG) Anil baijal, who will take a final decision in the matter.Justice Rekha Palli said irrespective of when the city government plans to resume spa services, it should consider imposing conditions such as mandatory vaccination of both staff and client, as well as capping the visitor numbers to spas. It granted time to the Delhi government till July 27 to decide on the resumption of services.The court was hearing a plea by spa owners, who contended that they were aggrieved by the “inordinate delay” in allowing spa centres to reopen. The plea sought directions to the authorities to decide the matter of reopening spas in Delhi within a week.A lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 15, to control the second and most deadly wave of Covid-19 that raged on till Mid-May. All spas along with malls, bars, gyms, restaurants and shops were closed; but except for spas, all other facilities were allowed to reopen in a staggered manner in June.On Tuesday, Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan informed the court that the file has been sent to the LG for his final decision and sought time from the court.Advocate Manik Dogra, appearing for spa owners, said thousands of employees have been affected by the indefinite closure. He said as a precautionary measure, they were ready to get the staff vaccinated before reopening.The court noted the submissions and posted the matter for further hearing to July 27.The petitioners have also challenged the guidelines issued by the government on June 26, 2021, through Delhi Disaster Management Authority, by virtue of which salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed.referring to an order of the high court, passed on January 14, directing reopening of spas that were closed during the first wave of the pandemic, the petitioners said the slightly higher percentage of risk due to the proximity of the client and the service provider can be obviated by prescribing stricter measures and safeguards rather than continuing to keep such establishments closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-to-decide-on-reopening-of-spas-delhi-govt-tells-high-court-101626827149134.html

You should have passed an order by now. Ultimately, he wants to run them. If he is not entitled in law, please pass an order. What is this – you are involved in an FIR – and that is the end of it?” the judge said.The court granted time to the police to clarify their stand and posted the matter for further hearing to July 30.Kalra, through his counsel, challenged the May 11 show cause notice issued by the joint commissioner of police (licensing) suspending the registration of the two eateries in Khan Market. He was granted an opportunity to submit his reply within 15 days.Appearing for Kalra, senior advocate Maninder Singh argued that he submitted the response on June 9; however, since he did not hear back from the authorities, he again wrote to them on June 17. Till date, officials concerned have neither withdrawn the suspension order nor decided on the show cause notice.Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Tripathi sought time to take instructions in the case.In his petition, Kalra also said the order of suspension was issued without first affording an opportunity to show cause and it is, therefore, punitive and illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/navneet-kalra-moves-hc-challenging-suspension-of-registration-of-khan-chacha-town-hall-101626826895118.html

It is one of the busiest stretches in the city. The work on the ₹39-crore project will begin in September this year and tenders have already been floated for the same. All old trees, growing on both sides of the road, will be transplanted to other places. As per information, the total length of the road to be widened is nearly 3.5km. From the Phase-7 light point to the one near Punjab School Education Board (PSEB), the road will be widened from 30 metres to 60 metres. From PSEB light point to Army canteen in Phase-10, the road will be widened from 10.5 metres to 30 metres, while from Army canteen lights point to Phase-11 light point, the road will be widened from 10 metres to 30 metres. GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said, “Tenders have already been floated and we are hopeful of starting the project in September this year. Residents have long been demanding for the widening of this road stretch due to the traffic congestion.” NS Kalsi, former executive engineer, GMADA, said, “Once widened, traffic will be streamlined and there will fewer accidents. We also request the authority concerned to widen the road from Kumbra Chowk to Bawa White house in Phase-11, which ends at the railway station in Mohali.” MC cycle track project a non-starter Even after three years, the ambitious cycle track project of the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) has remained a nonstarter. In October 2019, the civic body has decided to construct a 6km cycle track from Phase-11 to Spice Chowk in Industrial Area, Phase-7 (till cremation ground) at a cost of ₹2.27 crore, but nothing has been done. At present, there are no cycle tracks in Mohali. The proposed cycle track was to start from Phase-11 in front of NIPER in Sector 67, pass through Kumbra Chowk, PCL light points, and go on till Industrial Area, Phase-7, Mohali. City mayor Amarjeet Singh Sidhu said, “I fail to understand why this project was not implemented.

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn releases full grant-in-aid, MC still expected to fall short of funds||The UT administration has released ₹125 crore as grant-in-aid (GIA) to the municipal corporation (MC) for the second quarter of the current fiscal.Belying concerns in the MC for a cut in the GIA, the administration has released the full due amount. UT officials said there would be no cut in the GIA for the last quarter too.The release of funds has given the much-needed financial relief to the MC. Recently, the UT had junked its request for the release of ₹90 crore as additional grant for the current fiscal. The additional grant was sought in lieu of the estimated loss in revenue on account of stay on hike of water tariff.“Even though we are getting the full GIA for July, August and September, the MC will still be short on funds for taking up new development works. The GIA will go in for revenue expenditure like salaries, establishment costs, etc.,” said an official of the MC.Regarding the MC facing a financial crunch, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma had recently met UT adviser Dharam Pal and had raised the issue of the pending ₹40 crore grant for developmental works in 13 villages. He had also requested the adviser to follow up with the Union home ministry on the issue regarding the release of grants to the MC as per the Delhi Fourth Finance Commission recommendations, besides expediting handing over the Registration and Licensing Authority to the MC, and settling the issues of Chandigarh Housing Board on the Delhi pattern. ₹50 crore for village development released earlier this year The UT had approved an annual GIA of ₹502 crore in its budget of 2021-2022 for the MC. In the first quarter also, it had released the full due amount. Earlier this year, the UT had released ₹50 crore for village development in addition to the GIA.The corporation started the current fiscal with a deficit budget of ₹670 crore. The finances of the MC received a major setback when the UT administration decided to stay the hike in the water tariff till March 2022: the civic body was expecting to earn an additional revenue of ₹90 crore from the hike, which was imposed in October last year.“Even though the administration has released the dedicated funds for road recarpeting, village development, and increased the GIA by ₹50 crore over the last fiscal year, the MC is still struggling to start new development works as it is running a deficit budget,” said the MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-releases-full-grant-in-aid-mc-still-expected-to-fall-short-of-funds-101626811058974.html
21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of Eid-al-Adha, Covid blues hit Manimajra’s goat market||The challenges posed by the two Covid waves and the consequent lockdowns have adversely affected the celebration of festivals in the city, and Eid-al-Adha, which will be celebrated on Wednesday, is not impervious to them either.Even till a day before the festival, goat traders of Manimajra reported minuscule sales. While customers could be seen thronging the market, the traders here said they weren’t making any money.Jeera Khan of Manimajra, one of the oldest goat traders here, said, “Most customers are coming to do window shopping. They are waiting for the prices to fall before they make a purchase. Even today I barely sold any goats. People will come to buy them from us at the last minute.”Eid-al-Adha or the festival of sacrifice celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God’s will. A goat is sacrificed on this occasion, and the meat is divided into three parts: a part is kept for personal consumption, another is distributed among friends, family and neighbours; and one part is distributed among the poor.Worst year for selling goats in 40 yearsKhan has the most expensive goats in the market. Named Lallu, Kullu and Shaukeen, the three Amritsari goats that weigh around a quintal each were being sold for ₹60,000 per goat on July 19. However, Khan didn’t find any takers and had to reduce the price of the goats to ₹45,000 each on Tuesday; he was still unable to sell them. Khan added that besides 2020, this was the worst year for selling goats in over 40 years since he had started the business.The market price, this year, was set low with most goats being sold for around ₹20,000, said one Alam from Baddi: “Due to the lockdown, people didn’t have money to spend. We would have sold the goats for double the price if it was pre-Covid time. We didn’t have anything special to feed the goats and they just survived on grazing pastures near our villages.”In 2020, a 150-kilo goat Gabbar Singh was put on sale for ₹1.5 lakh at this mandi, however, it couldn’t be confirmed whether it was sold at the same price. In 2019, a 105-kilo Sheru was sold for ₹80,000.A customer, Abdul Sajid of Manimajra, present here on Tuesday said he had come to the market a day before as well, but wasn’t able to strike any deal: “Everyone has been hit financially so we have been requesting the traders to offer fairer prices on the goats. Hopefully we will find a goat by today.”Prayers to be offered early in the morningAfter the pandemic started, this would be the first Eid where namaz will be offered at the mosques in the city. President of the Muslim Welfare Society, Mohammad Sadiq Sheikh, said, “Namaz will be offered early in the morning and at most masjids of the city to prevent crowding.

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC issues notice to Chandigarh MC over hazards of Dadumajra dump||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday issued a notice to the municipal corporation, acting on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a Sector-27 resident seeking an end to the air pollution suffered by the people of Dadumajra and surrounding areas.The notice has been issued to the Chandigarh MC for November 26.The PIL filed by Amit Sharma seeks directions to the MC and other state authorities to ensure an end to the air pollution, unbearable stench, and the frequent fires that release toxins in the air, and to address the various health issues being faced by over 50,000 people in Dadumajra and around.Through the petition, Sharma has also sought directions to the MC to follow the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, to reduce the quantum of garbage dumped at Dadumajra.The petitioner has also urged the high court to order an inquiry/probe into the MC’s failure to follow the directions of the National Green Tribunal on waste management and processing. “Why were environmental laws flouted, and what is the outcome of the crores of taxpayers’ money spent on study tours for waste management?” the petition has asked.107% more cases of pneumonia in DadumajraThe petitioner stated that Dadumajra/Dhanas had 107% more cases of pneumonia in 2020 as compared to all the other colonies in Chandigarh.The petitioner pointed out that the “wretched quality of air and life in the area is further aggravated by the frequent toxic fires in the mountain of garbage that is only getting higher by the day. With the MC able to process a mere 13.36% of the waste dumped here last year, and only 16.09% from January to May in 2021, the problem of unprocessed garbage is threatening to swamp the Dadumajra area”.“It is also leading to increased incidents of fire in the dump that the office of the medical officer of health (MOH) is neither able to prevent nor explain. The fire in March this year lasted a week and covered the entire city in a haze, hindering visibility and causing respiratory issues among people in the vicinity,” said the petition.The petitioner accused the MOH of “willfully failing” to manage the waste, the fires, and the health of the people in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-issues-notice-to-chandigarh-mc-over-hazards-of-dadumajra-dump-101626811008843.html

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh house grab case: Man who bought property surrenders||After evading arrest for almost four months, Saurabh Gupta, who had purchased the Sector-37 house which was illegally usurped from its owner, surrendered before court on Tuesday. He was arrested and sent to one day police custody. Police had even announced reward of ₹50,000 for a who can provide information which can lead to his arrest. Saurabh is among the nine people named in the FIR lodged on charges of kidnapping and torturing Rahul Mehta in April 2017, to secure general power of attorney of his 338 square yards house. It was bought by Gupta in March 2019. Since the beginning, Saurabh had claimed he was unaware of the dispute and was a victim of cheating. He had even sought anticipatory bail, saying that had he known about the dispute, he would not have invested about ₹3 crore in the property. However, he didn’t get relief from the court. In March, police had arrested journalist Sanjeev Mahajan, realtor Manish Gupta, suspended Chandigarh Police inspector Rajdeep Singh, Satpal Dagar, brother of a UT deputy superintendent of police, and Gurpreet Singh, who impersonated Mehta to execute the property’s sales deed in March 2019. A police challan has already been filed into the case. Around 10 men are accused of kidnapping and torturing Mehta, 48, the only surviving heir of his family, to secure the general power of attorney of his house and sell it to Manish’s brother Saurabh Gupta for ₹2.9 crore. Among the other accused are liquor baron Arvind Singla and businessman Khalendra Singh Kadyan, to whom the property’s GPA was transferred, slain bouncer Surjit Singh, and Ashok Arora, Shekhar and Daljit Singh, who purportedly acted as witnesses in the sale of the house. After the transfer of the GPA, Rahul was abandoned at a stud farm in Gujarat in June 2017, before being shifted from one charitable home to another in Maharashtra, Delhi and Rajasthan, where he was finally traced. Later, Gurpreet, Singla and Kadyan had surrendered before the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-house-grab-case-man-who-bought-property-surrenders-101626811005518.html

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Shame that Modi doing injustice to farmers, says Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday said it was a shame that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was doing injustice to the country’s farmers by not resolving the deadlock over their demand for the repeal of the three contentious agriculture laws. Speaking to mediapersons outside Parliament after the Lok Sabha speaker adjourned the House, Sukhbir said “It is the responsibility of the PM to resolve the grievances of farmers who have been protesting at the borders of Delhi for months. But the government is impervious to their sufferings. Such an attitude does not bode well for a healthy democracy.” Holding placards, the MPs of SAD and and its alliance partner Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), including former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, said the BJP-led Centre used its majority to disallow adjournment motion moved by them to hold a discussion seeking repeal of the agriculture laws. Rajya Sabha MPs Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Naresh Gujral were also present. “It was because of this that we decided to boycott a meeting held by the Prime Minister to review the Covid pandemic situation,” Sukhbir added. The SAD-BSP MPs said it was unfortunate that the NDA government was not ready to recognise the sacrifices of farmers and even refused to pay tributes to 500 farmers who died in the course of the agitation. They condemned alleged attempts to defame and suppress the movement. “The Union government should not act in the interests of the large business houses that want to corporatise the agriculture sector. The laws are also against the spirit of federalism,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shame-that-modi-doing-injustice-to-farmers-says-sukhbir-101626809381006.html
21-07-2021||Other||Ludhiana: Buddha Nullah overflows, floods roads||Despite tall claims made by the authorities regarding continuous cleaning of the Buddha Nullah, the drain overflowed near the New Kundanpuri area and entered the adjoining roads and internal streets following heavy rains on Tuesday. Water logging was also witnessed in the low-lying areas alongside the nullah including, New Kundanpuri, Upkar Nagar, Chander Nagar. After the water level of the drain rose above the road level in these areas, the sewer lines got choked. Accumulated rainwater also entered the houses and shops in the Chander Nagar area, leaving residents a harried lot.Rakesh Kumar, a resident of the Chander Nagar area, said, “Rainwater enters the houses and shops here and in the new Kundanpuri area almost every year. The furniture also gets damaged due to the same. People place temporary barricades to prevent the water from entering their premises. Despite all this, the authorities do not pay heed to the problem.”The rising level of nullah kept the officials on toes on Tuesday, and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also inspected different points of the drain.Sabharwal said teams have been deployed to keep a check on the level of Buddha Nullah. Sandbags were placed at the banks of the nullah at few points including the New Kundanpuri area, to prevent it from overflowing, and the situation came under control.Resident submits complaint with human rights panelIrked over the issue of rainwater accumulation in areas alongside buddha nullah, Keemti Rawal, a resident of Chander Nagar and social activist, forwarded a complaint to the State Human Rights Commission, seeking action against the officials.Rawal said,” Lakhs of residents live in areas alongside Buddha Nullah and face a harrowing time when the city witnesses rainfall. Rainwater enters the houses and chokes sewer lines. Sometimes, it also results in water contamination. The authorities have failed to resolve the issue, due to which I submitted the complaint.”Mercury drops by 3 notches following heavy showers Rain showers of 125.4mm lashed the city on Tuesday, causing the maximum temperature to plummet by three notches at 25°C, while the minimum was recorded at 23.8°C.The maximum rainfall recorded in Ludhiana since the meteorological observatory was set- up in 1970, was on July 12, 1980, at 237.8 mm. On July 16, 2018, 136.2 mm was recorded in the city. Weather experts said the conditions will remain the same for the next 24 hours, but the intensity of showers will be less.Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, said, “If we are witnessing 125mm rainfall within a few hours, it is an indicator that the rainfall is not well distributed. While Ludhiana witnessed heavy rainfall, districts in southwestern Punjab including Bathinda and Fazilka remain dry or witnessed light drizzle. The proper distribution of rainfall is very important. The concern is that the duration of rain has decreased and intensity has increased. Within few hours we receive heavy rainfall which leads to waterlogging. Such rainfall does not help in groundwater recharging the water slips off the service and enter the storm sewerage,” said Dr Sidhu.In 19 days of July, the district had received 72.2 mm of rainfall. With 125.4mm rainfall received today, the total rainfall has reached 197.6mm. The average rainfall during the months remains 217mm.Waterlogging causes traffic snarls, damages vehicles in cityAt a time when the movement of traffic has already been disturbed in different parts of the city due to the ongoing construction works, rain water accumulation added to the woes of the commuters.After the recent rain on Tuesday, heavy traffic jams were witnessed on Ferozepur Road, Link Road near the bus stand, Old GT Road (railway station road), Transport Nagar, Gill Road, among other areas. Many vehicles also developed snags near the New Kundanpuri area, alongside Buddha Nullah, and people were seen pushing their vehicles amid heavy rainfall and water logging.Construction work already causing jamsMandeep Singh, a resident of Model Town Extension, said, “Congestion at Ferozepur Road, Pakhowal Road, Malhar Road, and Model Town-Jawaddi Road, due to construction works, was already taking a toll on the movement of traffic. Water logging added to the woes. Heavy traffic jams were witnessed near Verka plant on Ferozepur Road and the road outside Transport Nagar. The authorities should deal with the problem at the earliest,” the resident said.“Potholed roads further add to the misery. There is always a danger of a road accident during rainfall as the potholes are not visible due to water logging. The issue is raised every year, but no authority pays heed to the problem,” said Jaskirat Singh, a resident of Model Town.Meanwhile, the traffic police officials stated that they had asked the civic body to deal with potholes and water logging in around 12 chronic areas in advance. But water logging was still witnessed due to which the traffic movement was also disturbed, they added.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Traffic) Gurdev Singh said,” We had forwarded a list of problematic areas to the MC including Dholewal Road, Vishwakarma Chowk, Giaspura, Sherpur Chowk, Chandigarh Road, Samrala Chowk, and Transport Nagar. At many sites, the problem was resolved by the MC but water logging was still witnessed in other areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-buddha-nullah-overflows-floods-roads-101626809379797.html

The SGPC has spent ₹1.75 crore to save people during the pandemic. These services will continue,” said Jagir Kaur.‘Draft sent to Rajya Sabha panel on NCERT syllabi’Kaur said the SGPC has sent a draft to include authentic history in syllabus books prepared by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for different classes. “During a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I had raised the issue of distortion of Sikh history in the syllabi. Suggestions were sought from the Rajya Sabha committee in this regard. An appeal will be made to the Rajya Sabha Committee to publish the books only after showing them to the SGPC first,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/faced-with-opposition-sgpc-changes-plan-to-raze-oldest-operational-golden-temple-serai-101626809198772.html

21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Waterlogging returns to haunt Ludhiana||The heavy rain that pounded on the city on Tuesday was enough to wash away the tall claims of the civic body regarding monsoon preparedness as most of the city areas were submerged in water. Waterlogging threw life out of gear, leaving the residents a harried lot. Rainwater was accumulated on Chandigarh Road, Rani Jhansi Road, Ferozepur Road, Brown Road, Old GT Road near Dholewal Chowk, Gill Road, and Panjpeer Road among other areas. Waterlogging was also witnessed outside the MC’s Zone-C office and DC’s residence near Rakh Bagh. Other areas which were inundated included Sector 32, Field Ganj, Sham Singh Road, New Kundanpuri, Transport Nagar, and Haibowal, where residents rued that they were unable to even step out of their houses. Shopkeepers also complained of the brunt their business bore as customers couldn’t reach their shops. One of the residents of New Kundanpuri, Ratan Singh, said, “Rainwater accumulation continues to haunt the residents of our area. Despite repeated requests made to the local councillor and MC officials, nothing concrete has been done. The authorities claim that it is a low-lying area due to which waterlogging is witnessed. It seems like the people living in such areas will remain underprivileged.” Highlighting the need to install storm drains across the city, residents slammed the public representatives for their failure to address the perennial problem. Presently, storm sewer lines have been installed in around 10% of the city area. Kumar Gaurav, president of Yuva, an NGO, said, “The councillors and MLAs, who have been elected by the public, have failed to provide any relief in terms of waterlogging. The public should start questioning the candidates, when they come to seek votes.”Installation of storm sewer, cleaning of drains bring partial reliefThough waterlogging was seen on Panjpeer Road, Dholewal, where internal drains were said to be cleaned, shopkeepers near Domoria bridge area were relieved as the rainwater was flushed out effectively. The storm sewer on Old GT Road near the Clock Tower also brought partial relief, while Rani Jhansi road remained waterlogged even after installation of draining facility. Vehicles stuck in pitsFew vehicles, including a truck and a tractor trailer, got stuck in pits after the sand, which was poured to cover the site after building a storm drain, displaced near Rekhi cinema Chowk. A similar situation was also witnessed in BRS Nagar’s Block E as the authorities failed to recarpet the road after fixing sewer lines and a car got stuck in the depression. Former councillor Parminder Mehtra slammed the civic body for ‘mistimed’ project to install storm drains. He said either the drains should have been built before the monsoon or the road construction work should have been completed in time. Situation under control: Municipal chiefAlong with other employees, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also stayed in the field to expedite the work of draining of accumulated rainwater. Sabharwal, who spent over two hours to oversee the work, said, “Water accumulation was witnessed at large due to incessant and heavy rainfall, but the accumulated water was drained out in a short period of time in comparison to previous years as the civic body had already cleaned the drains, sewer lines and road gullies. We are keeping a check on the water level of Buddha Nullah and the situation is under control.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu and Sabharwal also visited different parts in the city in the evening to take stock of the situation. No complaint submitted to MC flood control roomEven as most of the areas witnessed waterlogging, MC officials claimed that no complaint was lodged with their flood control room set up in Daresi area. Officials said the control room remains operational 24x7 and people can contact them on 0161-2749120. Sabharwal also visited the flood control room and found two officials missing. Explanation has been sought from the officials. Meanwhile, power cuts were witnessed across the city, including in Focal Point areas, parts of Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Model Town, Sarabha Nagar and BRS Nagar. PSPCL officials were on their toes with feeders being switched off from grid substations due to bad weather.

Those selling sacrifical animals also witnessed a slump in business. Earlier, streets would be lined with sacrifical animals in both cities and rural areas. However, this time around only a few vendors were spotted. “Now, most dealers only sell animals at designated places. The sales were moderate as three years of lockdown has left several people in economic distress. I, too, have not been able to afford sacrificing an animal for two years. This year, too, I will be skipping the ritual,” said Aijaz Ahmad, a general store owner in old city.Kashmir Chamber Of Commerce and Industry chairperson Sheikh Ashiq said Eid would give impetus to small businesses in the region. However, for the last couple of years , not much activity was seen in the region. “This time the businessman have managed to do some business. Around 20% sales were seen this year. Things are getting better but businesses will only improve subject to cash flow in the market. Due to liquidity crunch, the spending power of people is down.”A rush was seen outside bakeries and readymade garment shops in the city. “As there were no restrictions, we had prepared several varieties of sweetmeats,” said Bashir Ahmad, manager of a prominent city bakery.The decline in Covid cases encouraged people to step out and make purchases. However, officials had warned people to observe strict standard operating procedures during Eid celebrations. The government has already imposed restrictions on congregational Eid prayers. However, people have been asked to observe prayers in localities in small numbers. Meanwhile, authorities have said that train services in Valley will remain suspended for two days following Eid.Officials said that according to guidelines and standard operating procedures, the train service on the Baramulla-Banihal track will remain suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday as passenger rush could lead to violation of norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rainfall-covid-put-a-damper-on-eid-festivities-in-jk-101626808356539.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||11-yr-old likely to be country’s first documented case of bird flu||An 11-year-old boy, who died of a respiratory tract infection at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Tuesday is likely to be country’s first documented case and death of bird flu (H5N1) in humans, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said.“The samples were sent to NIV-Pune and the National Centre for Disease Control is now following it up,” Guleria said.The boy was admitted to the hospital’s paediatric department in June-end, a senior AIIMS doctor in know of the matter said. “Initially the doctors suspected Covid-19, then influenza. The boy’s samples were sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing. He was found to have bird flu and contact tracing was immediately conducted,” the doctor said, asking not to be named.It is, however, unclear how the boy contracted the infection.According to experts, the virus can be transmitted through contact with faeces and secretions from nose, eye, and mouth of an infected bird. The infection doesn’t usually pass on from humans to humans as the virus is not well adapted to attach to receptors in human cells. It usually happens in people handling dead birds, bird droppings, or infected poultry.The infection leads to lower respiratory tract pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans. It is difficult for humans to get the infection, but once infected avian influenza can be extremely deadly.The mortality rate of the infection can be as high as 60%. In comparison, Covid-19 kills fewer than 3% of the people it infects, according to official data.So far, there have been 862 cases of laboratory confirmed H5N1 infections across the globe, of which 455 succumbed to the infection, pegging the case fatality ratio (CFR) at nearly 53%, according to a May 21 bulletin by the World Health Organization.This year, H5N8 and H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in birds from across India. The country notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in birds on February 18, 2006. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, West Bengal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim, Odisha, Meghalaya, Karnataka, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Chandigarh.“I don’t have specific details of the case so I won’t comment on the case per se; but it won’t be right to call it the first case because there is always a possibility that there may have been a case earlier that did not get documented since not all places have the facility to run specialised tests, such as gene sequencing or certain types of serological tests. There is no documented human case of bird flu, but it’s a respiratory viral disease and symptoms are similar to other such infections. AIIMS has the facility that is probably why it got picked up,” said Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/11yrold-first-likely-victim-of-bird-flu-101626807890463.html

21-07-2021||Delhi||In 1st judgment in Delhi riots cases, court slams police for shoddy probe||A city court on Tuesday acquitted a man accused of rioting, unlawful assembly, and dacoity — the first judgment to be delivered in multiple cases related to the northeast Delhi riots cases — and pulled up the Delhi Police for an investigation “that is way short” of what was needed.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said that prosecution miserably failed to prove its case, forget beyond reasonable doubt, as the testimonies of the witnesses did not match. The court set the accused, Suresh alias Bhatura, free and ruled that he could not be connected to the offence in any manner.Suresh, who thanked the judge with folded hands in the video conferencing hearing, was appearing from Mandoli jail. He was lodged there since his arrest in April 2020.“All the major witnesses are at variance with each other on material terms, impacting the prosecution’s version. It is indeed proved from the testimony of the witnesses that the offence as stated out in the charge­ sheet happened, i.e., formation of unlawful assembly of 15-20 people, rioting, ransacking the shop of the complainant, i.e., shop no. 27/5, Main Babarpur Road, Delhi. There is no testimony worth its salt which connect the accused to the present offence in question,” the judge said.“As can be made out on the cumulative reading of the entire testimonies of all the witnesses, the identification of the accused is not established at all. The investigation carried out is way short of the desired one,” he added.Suresh was arrested on April 7, 2020 on a complaint by Asif, identified by his first name only, who ran a rented shop in the Babarpur area. On February 25, 2020 when he heard commotion, he saw 15-­20 people armed with sticks and iron rods. He alleged that the mob was inciting others to damage and loot the shop because he was Muslim. The complaint said that he tried to reason with the mob, but to no avail, and was threatened with dire consequences if he intervened. Later, the owner of the shop, Bhagat Singh, went to the police and brought head constable Sunil Kumar to the spot, after which the rioters ran away.Communal riots had broke out in the north east part of the national capital amid nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Delhi Police have registered around 750 FIRs in connection with the riots that killed 53 persons and left 400 others wounded over four days.The police’s investigation has been under criticism from various fronts, including social activists, student groups, and politicians.In its judgment on Tuesday, the court has said that the complainant Asif was not an eye­witness to any incident of the rioting or other connected offences that took place on Feb 25, 2020. It also said that Bhagat Singh, the owner of the shop, and the witness whom the prosecution relied the most, denied identifying the accused on two occasions, and also in the court.The judge noted that Singh was told by head constable Sunil and the investigating officer of the case, Nishant Chaudhary, that Suresh was involved in the rioting, rather than the other way round.The court said that the seized articles from the shop were not sealed by the IO, and neither was there any recording of the incident. It also held that the identification of the accused by the head constable was “untenable”.“If PW6 (HC Sunil) identified the accused at the time of rioting itself, then why he did not record any entry to the said fact on the said date or even till the FIR was filed on February 28, 2020? He also never gave anything in writing to the concerned police station stating that he had identified the accused. He has admitted that till March 1, 2020, he never gave any statement regarding the involvement of the accused in the present offence of rioting and other offences,” the judge noted in his 21-page judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-1st-judgment-in-delhi-riots-cases-court-slams-police-for-shoddy-probe-101626806949938.html

21-07-2021||Other||Monsoon-related ailments rise by 50% in Mumbai: Doctors||Monsoon-related ailments have increased by 50% in the city, said doctors who have warned citizens against self-medication as it can delay diagnosis among patients with Covid-19 infection.Due to change in the season, city doctors have witnessed a spurt in the number of cases related to humid weather and waterborne diseases. “They [cases] definitely have increased. Among current hospital admissions of fever cases, about 60-70% are monsoon-related fevers,” said Dr Anita Mathew, infectious disease specialist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund. Similarly, Dr Amit Nabar, head of the emergency medicine and head of surgical intensive care unit (ICU) at SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim, said the hospital has recorded almost 60% rise in ailments especially for malaria and dengue. As per doctors, compared to July last year, the number of monsoon-related ailments has increased this year due to relaxations in lockdown-related restrictions, resulting in free movement of people after the flattening of the pandemic curve in the second wave. “We did not treat many patients with monsoon-related ailments last year because citizens were confined to their houses due to the national lockdown, and construction activity was also low. This year, mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue, chikungunya and malaria cases have increased in the past few weeks, mainly because movement of people has also increased. Normal seasonal flu and gastroenteritis cases have also gone up,” said Dr Shalini Suralkar, consultant physician at LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai. Till July 18, 240 cases of malaria, 17 cases of leptospirosis, 10 and 13 swine flu cases have been reported in the city, as per the data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Virologists said the number of mosquito-borne diseases will increase further after the rain slows down. “It is known that during downpour, the eggs of the mosquitos get washed away. So the number of mosquitoes-borne diseases always remains low during heavy rainfall. But as soon as the rainfall subsides, the population of mosquitoes increases, giving rise to cases of malaria and dengue,” said Dr T Jacob John, virologist and retired professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.Wockhardt Hospital at Mumbai Central has already recorded two cases of leptospirosis – a bacterial disease that causes serious illness, leading to jaundice-reduced platelets, multi-organ failure and death. “Due to heavy rains in Mumbai over the next four-five days, we are going to have more cases of leptospirosis. The infection occurs due to flooding and waterlogging during monsoon, which we are witnessing now,” said Dr Behram Pardiwala, internal medicine at the hospital. Treatment dilemma amid pandemic Covid-19 shares similar symptoms with seasonal infections which often cause treatment dilemmas among doctors. “It is difficult to identify Covid-19 and non-Covid illnesses at times as the symptoms overlap each other. But with a proper case history and correlation with laboratory parameters and clinical examination, we can differentiate between the two illnesses,” said Dr Harish Chafle, consultant intensivist and chest physician at Global Hospitals, Parel.To overrule any possibility of misdiagnosis, all hospitals are conducting reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests among patients with similar symptoms such as fever, cough and respiratory tract infections. “A Covid-19 workup, including RT-PCR, is done for every patient coming with acute febrile illness, and the coronavirus isolation protocol is advised to all until the final diagnosis is made. Special focus has to be paid on the locality from where the patient comes from,” said Dr Nabar. However, amid the pandemic, doctors have strictly prohibited people from self-medication. “It is advisable for a patient to seek medical help if the fever does not subside within two-three days. Also, look for red flag signs such as very high temperature more than 103°F, rash, delirium, severe headache, breathlessness, any bleeding, yellowness of eyes or urine or any other unusual symptoms,” said Dr Suralkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoonrelated-ailments-rise-by-50-in-mumbai-doctors-101626806855649.html

21-07-2021||Lucknow||Extending an olive branch Cong withdraws expulsion of three veterans||The Congress appears to have extended an olive branch to the party’s expelled old guards, withdrawing expulsion of three veterans who, along with seven others, were expelled from the party for indulging in anti-party activities in 2019. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and other party leaders welcomed the three veterans at UPCC headquarters here on Tuesday. The UPCC had expelled 10 senior leaders, including former ministers, for indulging in anti-party activities when they gathered at the residence of their colleagues to celebrate birth anniversary of India’s first prime minister late Jawahar Lal Nehru and former prime minister late Indira Gandhi here on November 14, 2019 and November 19, 2019 respectively. Action to expel them was taken on November 24. This was considered as one of the reasons for an apparent divide in Congress between the party’s old guard and Lallu’s team. “Following approval of All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Sonia Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu, the disciplinary committee of Uttar Pradesh Congress has with immediate effect withdrawn expulsion of former legislators Nek Chand Pandey, Bhudhar Narain Mishra and Gajendra Singh Solanki. AICC secretaries Dhiraj Gurjar and Rohit Chaudhary expect from these legislators that they will play an important role in strengthening the Congress in future,” said UPCC spokesman Ashok Singh in a press statement. Priyanka, during her three-day tour to the state capital last week, had given a call to the party’s old guards and the youngsters to join hands to strengthen the party. She had also asked party’s state leaders to withdraw expulsion of old guards. An expelled leader, however, said withdrawal of expulsion of only three veterans in an expelled group of 10 raised a question mark on the entire exercise of taking all sections of the party together. “We all (10 leaders) had gathered to celebrate the birth anniversary of former prime ministers and did not indulge in any party activity. Those expelled included former minister Ram Krishna Dwivedi and he later died following illness. Action against six leaders is yet to be withdrawn. We were asked to tender an apology. Why should we tender any apology when we did not indulge in any indiscipline,” said an expelled leader. When contacted, Lallu said the Congress was reaching out to all the veterans and all those committed to the party would be welcomed. “Withdrawal of expulsion of three expelled leaders is a good gesture on the part of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is party’s incharge for UP. Veterans will certainly be helpful to the Congress. A united party is need of the hour. The Congress should get everybody together,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department of political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/extending-an-olive-branch-cong-withdraws-expulsion-of-three-veterans-101626806495625.html

Every monsoon, TMC serves a notice to those residing in these areas. For decades, they have been staying illegally and have managed to get electricity and water connections. Gholai Nagar in Kalwa, where the landslide occurred on Monday was also shortlisted by TMC. The list also includes areas within Lokmanya Nagar (1), Majiwada-Manpada (2), Kalwa (6) and Mumbra (5). Santosh Kadam, chief of Regional Disaster Management Cell, said, “We cannot estimate how many stay in the landslide-prone areas but there are 14 such spots in the city.” Additional commissioner of TMC, Sandeep Malvi, said, “We are currently focusing on providing temporary shelter to those who have been affected by the landslide in Kalwa.” Meanwhile, some reside in the hilly terrains of Mumbra, Lokmanya Nagar and Atkoneshwar Nagar in Kalwa that fall under the forest department. “With orange alert in the city, we have requested those residing in these areas to move out for their own safety. These are illegal settlements and we cannot provide them with alternatives,” said an officer from the forest department, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-civic-body-lists-14-landslide-prone-areas-within-city-101626806375649.html

Amarinder said the state was expecting 2.46 lakh doses to arrive on Tuesday but noted that vaccines remain in short supply as it has run out of Covishield and was left with a mere 3,500 Covaxin doses as of Monday.Punjab has already vaccinated more than 90 lakh people (nearly 37% of eligible population) and has been utilising the stock without any wastage, said the CM. While the first dose has been administered to 75 lakh people, 15 lakh had got the second dose too. The Centre needs to arrange for delivery to the state to meet the shortfall and enable inoculation of the second dose, while continuing with the vaccination, said the CM. Disability schemes’ benefit to mucormycosis patients Reviewing the state’s Covid situation through a virtual conference, the CM announced extension of benefits of existing schemes for persons with disability to those suffering from disability caused by mucormycosis. The benefits will be extended as per the nature and degree of the disability, he said.

21-07-2021||Mumbai||Clearing slums along slopes in Mumbai : An uphill task||The two landslides in the city in Surya Nagar in Vikhroli and New Bharat Nagar area of Mahul in Chembur, which killed over 30 people on Sunday, have once again raised questions on the responsibility and steps to ensure safety of those living in illegal structures in vulnerable locations.In the backdrop of collapse of illegal structures, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) prepared a draft suggestion note which stated that high cost of living in Mumbai and changing policies regarding increasing the protection date of slums in city are a few reasons why citizens opt to reside in dangerous conditions. The note stated the BMC, in consultation with the state, should formulate a policy on the lines of cluster development or affordable housing etc. for dishoused citizens residing in illegal houses. Not a first As per the 2011 census, 41% of the city’s total 12.8 million population lives in slums. According to the BMC’s data, until 2018, the city had around 250 landslide-prone spots, of which the maximum, 200, were in the eastern suburbs. Ninety-four incidents of landslides were reported in the city between 2011 and 2018, in which around nine people lost their lives and 26 have been injured.Over the past two years, the damage caused by such incidents has increased. For example, a landslide which caused a retaining wall to collapse in Malad East on July 2, 2019, resulted in 32 deaths. In 2020, a landslide was reported on Western Express Highway. There were no injuries in the incident. The common factor in most such incidents is the structures or houses are constructed illegally on government land owned by the collector or the forest department. In Sunday’s incidents too, the land was owned by the suburban collector, leading to a blame game between the BMC and collector’s office. HT reported on Tuesday how the BMC maintained it had asked suburban collector Milind Borikar to take the measures last month. However, the collector’s office said that as per the state government’s directives, it is the BMC’s responsibility to clear encroachments, irrespective of title of the land. Bharat Marathe, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “The question is to where to keep lakhs of citizens residing in such illegal structures after evicting them. In case of Chembur landslide, we have shifted the victims to empty project-affected people tenements.” The BMC’s draft suggestion note stated: “Due to high cost of living in Mumbai and increasing migrants from outside, there is tendency of people compelled to stay in such unauthorized, unsafe areas for meeting their day today needs/ survival.” The BMC’s note also suggested that 3D mapping be done every six months. Solutions?State housing minister Jitendra Awhad said the low-cost housing scheme can be an alternative. Awhad said, “The state can support the civic body as the scheme will require huge funds because of the large number of families residing on hill slopes across the city. I will speak to the chief minister in this regard.” Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, urban development department, said, “We can amend the rules as per the requirement and provide additional FSI (floor space index), so they can be relocated. While doing so, securing these (old) sites is also important to ensure they will not be encroached upon in the future.” Officials from urban development said that the only permanent solution to the issue is resettlement of these families, but its implementation is not easy as it requires strong political will and investment. “Gradient lands are very dangerous because those are hills and activities such as tree cutting etc. make them even poorer. All such land should be de-populated completely,” said another official from the urban development department. Mahesh Pathak, principal secretary, urban development, said there is no option but to take preventive measures at the landslide-prone sites. Civic activist Godfrey Pimenta said, “The slopes of hills in Mumbai are perfectly stable. No landslide will occur if they are not disturbed. However, these slopes have been illegally encroached upon by cutting them into vertical faces. More than 60 lakh people are staying in these slum colonies or kuchha structures. These areas are highly vulnerable during contingencies like floods, fire and commotion and we need adequate preventive measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/clearing-slums-along-slopes-in-mumbai-an-uphill-task-101626806257279.html

On June 19, a complaint was filed by Sanjay Bansal alleging that the petitioners had posted some objectionable comments on social media against Champat Rai on the basis of false allegations made by one Alka Lahoti from Nagina with the intention of promoting enmity or hatred among sections of the society. It was alleged in the complaint that the social media post had hurt religious feelings of Hindus.The petitioners’ submission was that from the reading of the FIR, no offence was made out and the FIR was malafidely lodged which did not disclose commission of any offence by the petitioners. Therefore, the impugned FIR deserved to be quashed.The court, after hearing concerned parties, observed, “Bare perusal of the impugned first information report shows that even if the allegations made in the impugned first information report are taken in their entirety they do not constitute the offence alleged.”“From the aforesaid it prima facie, appears that the impugned first information report cannot be sustained in view of the law laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal,” the court further said while fixing July 27 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/objectionable-post-against-ram-temple-trust-secy-hc-stays-arrest-of-two-accused-asks-govt-to-file-reply-101626806255568.html

According to ratings agency ICRA, the target of operationalising 100 airports under Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) will see a delay of two years from 2024 to 2026 due to the impact of the pandemic. The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had launched the UDAN scheme in 2016 as a regional connectivity scheme (RCS) to enhance regional connectivity. However, as per ICRA, only 47% of the total routes and 39% of airports (unserved and underserved) have been operationalised under UDAN as on May 31. The number of new RCS routes which started operations increased at a healthy pace and stood at 102 in financial year (FY) 2019-20 and 120 routes in FY2020-21. They have, however, declined on 77 new routes in FY2021-22 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICRA said that during FY2018-19 to FY2021-22, ₹3,350 crore has been incurred by the Central government towards the UDAN scheme, while the budgeted outlay for FY21-2022 is only ₹1,130 crore. Moreover, the slow progress of UDAN implementation is not only attributable to delayed upgradation of infrastructure at some of the RCS airports, delays in securing necessary regulatory approvals, low demand on few routes awarded but also to the adverse and unpredictable weather conditions that lead to inconsistent operations and also resulted in closure of operations by airlines in a few cases. “The second wave of the pandemic, which started from mid-March will further impact the UDAN scheme going forward, with aviation being one of the worst-hit infrastructure sectors,” said Shubham Jain, senior vice-president and group head, corporate ratings, ICRA. The civil aviation ministry set a target of operationalising 100 unserved and underserved airports and starting at least 1,000 RCS routes by 2024. Off this, 52 unserved and underserved airports and 357 routes are operationalised as on May 31. To improve RCS network and achieve its target by 2024, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) even launched UDAN 4.1 as a special bidding round under UDAN 4.0 in March to award 392 routes. “The award and implementation of UDAN 4.1 may get delayed significantly due to the second wave of the pandemic in India and its effect on the Indian aviation industry. We expect the target of operationalising 100 airports under UDAN by 2026, with a delay of two years,” Jain said. He added, “The weak credit profile of domestic airlines is expected to have an impact on the existing routes under UDAN scheme, particularly for smaller airlines given the stretched liquidity position, low utilisation in some of the routes and will also impact future bidding of routes under the scheme.” Moreover, there has been a significant impact on financial health of airline operators due to Covid-19 pandemic. According to ICRA’s estimates, Indian airlines will report a significant net loss of approximately 210 billion in FY 2021-22 and estimated net loss of ₹127 billion in FY2021-22, with the industry debt level increasing to around ₹500 billion in FY2021-22. “While some airlines have sufficient liquidity and/or financial support from a strong parentage, which will help them sustain over the near term, there are other airlines, which are already in financial stress. Until the cash inflows improve, the airlines will require funding support to meet their expenses,” ICRA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2nd-covid-19-wave-to-delay-100-udan-airports-by-2-years-101626806137609.html

State starts inquiry into 2019 Israel tour of officials||Maharashtra government’s director-general of information and publicity (DGIPR) has started an inquiry into the tour of five of its senior officials to Israel in November 2019. The inquiry has begun on the heels of the demand by the ruling Congress to probe if the Pegasus reports have any Maharashtra connection. The department has issued notices to the officials, asking them to submit a report on the tour as a preliminary inquiry has found several violations of set rules related to foreign tours.Five senior officials, including a director of the department, had toured Israel between November 15, 2019 and November 25, 2019, when the formation of the government after the Assembly polls was in full swing. The tour was chalked out hurriedly without taking any mandatory permission from the chief minister and the central government or the Election Commission of India (ECI). The team of officials did not submit a report on the tour even one-and-a-half years after it took place, the preliminary inquiry revealed.“Notices have been served to the officials, asking them to submit details of the tour, including objective, itinerary, meetings that took place and efforts by them to ensure that the department benefited from the experience, among others. The account of the expenditure on tour has not been settled as yet, although more than ₹20 lakh was spent. The officials have been directed to submit their say as soon as possible,” said an official from the general administrative department.“The officials had extended their tour by a few days, when the extension of any such official tour is not permitted. The permission from the chief minister of the state is mandatory for any such foreign tour, along with a few ministries of central government. Since the model code of conduct was in place when the tour was being chalked out, the permission from the ECI too was necessary. The DGIPR had taken the permission by the then chief secretary, but it was not sufficient. The rules also mandate for an official invitation from the government of the country they are visiting. In this case, the tour was planned on the basis of the letter given by the consul-general of Israel in Mumbai. We have found gross violation of the laid down rules related to foreign tours of officials,” another official from the government said.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Monday had demanded that the state government should probe if there is any links related to Maharashtra in the Pegasus leaks. The illegal and unauthorised phone tapping done by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, who headed the state intelligence department during the Fadnavis government, is being probed and the truth will soon come to the fore. But there are also doubts if there are any Maharashtra links to Pegasus leaks and any IPS officer who was posted at Mantralaya was working on it? A few officials from the DGIPR of the state had visited Israel during the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Questions, including if they got any training, by whose permission they had gone, did they submit any report to the government, how many times did they go to Israel, were there any scheduled meetings in Israel, had government had any correspondence with NSO or any presentation was made to the state government, need to be answered. A probe into the issue will throw light on these questions,” Sawant said.In January 2020,former Madhya Pradesh CM and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijay Singh, in a series of tweets, said: “Is the @OfficeofUT going to give details in public that who was behind snooping and tapping in #maharashtra Who were the officers of Maharashtra Govt who went to #Israel to talk to#NS0 the brain behind malware #pegasus @PawarSpeaks.”After the demand, the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had announced a committee of senior officials from the home department but the probe never took off. Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the team of officers had gone to Israel but it was well after the Assembly polls ended. “The team had gone to study the farming and farm techniques in Israel. Maharashtra government during my tenure as the CM never had taken any services of the NSO. Let the government probe into the case.” The DGIPR is also checking about several Israel tours of a senior officer from DGIPR during the Fadanvis government. The department also has the information about the logistics support provided by a local agency in Israel. “The officials who went on tour may not have direct links with the alleged phone tapping controversy as none of them has any technical knowledge required. We believe that it was a leisure tour organised to oblige senior officials from the government,” a senior official from the GAD said. When contacted, Dilip Pandharpatte, director-general of information and public relations, refused to speak on the issue. Aditi Tatkare, minister of state for general administration, said she was not aware of any probe. “The publicity department does take cognisance of the media reports related to the government. I am not aware if any such probe has been started and if there was any official complaint made by Sachin Sawant.” Meanwhile, upping its ante against the Centre, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday demanded a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee in the Pegasus snooping controversy. Sena MPs wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, making the demand, and handed over the letter to the Speaker. Sena’s Lok Sabha group leader Vinayak Raut said, “The issue of phone tapping that has come out is extremely serious. The phones of several prominent people, including ministers who are now serving, have been tapped. Therefore, a probe must be done through JPC.” Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that the incident is not just a “threat to freedom” but also “betrayal of the people” of this country. He further demanded that prime minister Narendra Modi or union home minister Amit Shah must speak on this matter. “Gradually more names will come forward and we are confident that names of political leaders from Maharashtra will also be there. We are sure that Information and Technology and such softwares have been used and possibly be in use to stop us. This is a big conspiracy and nobody can dare to do this without the support of the government,” Raut said in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pegasusmaharashtra-connection-state-starts-inquiry-into-2019-israel-tour-of-officials-101626805896120.html
21-07-2021||Other||Home vaccination drive will start in Mumbai from August 1: State to HC||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it will be starting the home vaccination drive in Mumbai from August 1. The state informed HC that its original plan of starting home vaccination on experimental basis from Pune was changed to Mumbai after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) submitted that through a door-to-door survey, it had identified around 3,505 people in 24 wards who are bedridden and severely ill. The court expressed satisfaction over the state government’s decision to formulate the much-delayed policy for home vaccination of severely ill, elderly and bedridden persons and also lauded BMC’s initiative. The court, however, did not mince words and said that the Centre had failed to rise to the occasion by not acceding to the requests for door-to-door vaccination policy and instead stuck to the near-to-home vaccination policy suggested by NEGVAC. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, which sought directions from the Centre, state and BMC to start door-to-door vaccination facility for persons over 75 years of age, the specially-abled and the bedridden.On Tuesday, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and advocate Akshay Shinde appearing for the state government, submitted that a draft policy for home vaccination of needy persons had been prepared as per HC’s directions. Kumbhakoni submitted that as on Monday, it had identified 17,288 bedridden and immobile persons who requested jabs at their residence online. He added that physically disabled, patients on stretchers, wheelchair-bound persons and patients whose immunity is compromised and terminally ill patients who cannot go to vaccination centres were eligible for receiving vaccination at home. Kumbhakoni then submitted that as on Monday, the BMC had identified around 3,505 patients who expressed interest for home vaccination and hence it was decided to start the drive in Mumbai from August 1 rather than at Pune. The response till Monday from Pune was 50 persons only. He added that the drive in Mumbai would strictly adhere to vaccination protocols. Kumbhakoni then assured the bench that the draft policy would be finalised without major modifications and a status report of home vaccinated persons would be placed before the court in the next hearing.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for BMC confirmed the willingness of the civic authority to conduct home vaccination free-of-cost from August 1. Sakhare added that a policy was required for private hospitals so that they can also provide facilities of home vaccination. Advocate Dhruti Kapadia said that the initiative by the state government was welcome and added that people over 80 years should also be added in the list of persons eligible for home vaccination. After hearing submissions, the bench noted in the order, “The Centre did not rise to the occasion. However, we record our satisfaction that the state has risen to the occasion and today we find some light at the end of the tunnel.” The bench then sought a status report from the authorities and posted hearing of the PIL to August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/home-vaccination-drive-will-start-in-mumbai-from-august-1-state-to-hc-101626805895512.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: After slump, slight uptick in vaccinations in Delhi||After a significant dip in inoculations over the last two days, vaccination picked up pace with just under 72,000 doses administered in the Capital on Tuesday, according to data from the government’s CoWIN platform.Delhi had over 195,000 doses of Covaxin and 67,880 Covishield doses on Tuesday morning. The vaccines were administered through 730 out of the total 1,374 vaccination sites in the Capital.The city saw an uptick in vaccinations last Tuesday as well, with over 129,000 doses administered - the only day in the week when the number of shots crossed the six-figure mark.“There is a shortage of vaccines, we are not getting as many as required. So we cannot run all the vaccination sites,” said a senior east district official.The Capital saw only 25,985 doses -- 4,360 doses of Covishield and 21,625 doses of Covaxin -- administered on Monday, according to Delhi government’s vaccination bulletin.The government stopped administering Covaxin for first dose takers in June after running out of vaccines for those coming for their second dose after receiving the first jab in May. Only 20% of the total stock of Covaxin doses are being used for the first jab.“There are days when we end up giving more Covaxin shots because there is a shortage of Covishield. The use of Covaxin for first dose was stopped completely earlier; it resumed only about two weeks ago,” said another southwest district official.After seeing peaks of over 200,000 jabs a day thrice after the Centre changed its policy from June 21 and took control of vaccine purchase for all, the pace of the drive has been erratic. Vaccinations peaked on June 26, when the city administered over 207,000 doses of Covishield and Covaxin. In fact, Delhi vaccinated over 200,000 in a day on three occasions in four days between June 26 and 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-slump-slight-uptick-in-vaccinations-in-delhi-101626804938377.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: With curbs on festivities, Eid to be muted affair this year as well||The city will once again observe a muted Eid-ul-Azha, in the shadow of the pandemic, on Wednesday with strict curbs on gatherings and large-scale festivities. The bigger mosques in the capital, including the Jama Masjid and Fatehpuri Masjid, will hold prayers with a handful of people in attendance.Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid, said Eid prayers will be offered by the staff of the mosque and a few others. “Since there is a ban on public gatherings, a larger congregation will not take place. We have appealed to people to offer prayers in the same manner as they did on Eid-Ul-Fitr, in compliance with Covid protocols,” said Ahmed. He added that sacrifice could be conducted in cooperation with resident welfare bodies and police while complying with hygiene and sanitation rules.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday reiterated that a ban on all religious gatherings was already in place and places of worship were open but not to visitors. DDMA also said meetings were conducted with Muslim religious leaders and masjid committees last week.Jama Masjid, one of the country’s largest mosques, will also remain shut to visitors. “According to government guidelines, bigger mosques will remain closed to visitors. Only the staff from the mosque will offer Eid prayers on Wednesday,” said Ansar-Ul-Haq, assistant public relations officer, Jama Masjid.Maulana Mohammad Furquan Qasmi, imam, Sunehri Masjid in Chandni Chowk, said prayers will be offered with only about 10-20 people due to restrictions. “Due to the pandemic, only a handful of people will offer the Eid namaz with adequate physical distancing and other protocols in place,” said Qasmi.Similar to last year, the pandemic has adversely affected the sale of goats. On Tuesday, Old Delhi’s Meena Bazaar, usually teeming with customers, saw a tepid footfall with goat sellers roaming across various locations in search of buyers.Mohd Imran Khan, a goat seller, said the annual market has been disrupted by the pandemic. “During normal (pre-Covid) times, the market used to be crowded with little space to even stand. This time, I have not sold a single goat. People are not ready to pay the amount we seek. There has been no business,” said Khan. Procured from Etah in Uttar Pradesh, he was hoping to sell four goats for a lakh each but is yet to find a buyer.Kanwar Singh, a goat seller from Rewari, who was roaming around Urdu Bazaar in search of customers, said he will not make a profit this year. “We arrived with 15 goats this time and three are yet to be sold. This time, we couldn’t make much profit; people have been affected by the pandemic and are not ready to spend as much as they did in the past,” he said.Mohammad Chand, who sells cutlery outside Jama Masjid, said his business was lukewarm. This year, he had not purchased a goat for sacrifice. “People who used to purchase four goats every year have bought only two. Those who used to get one or two are not planning to buy one this year. Even I’m not getting one this year,” said Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-with-curbs-on-festivities-eid-to-be-muted-affair-this-year-as-well-101626804816757.html

Our counsellors will help.”On Tuesday, the Delhi government said the dedicated helpline receives an average of 250-300 calls every day. Individuals can call the helpline -- 180011688 or 10580 -- from 7:30am to 8:30pm on all working days to talk to trained counsellors, the government said.The special PTM which started on Monday will continue till July 31. This is the first time that the PTMs are being conducted in collaboration with teachers from municipal corporation schools in Delhi for the students transitioning to state government schools from corporation schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emotional-well-being-of-students-is-our-prioritysisodia-101626804815511.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||Two days of rain inundate 20 underpasses in Delhi||Flooded underpasses that are meant to decongest traffic-heavy stretches become the symbols of the city’s poor drainage system whenever it rains heavily in the Capital. Following rains on Monday and Tuesday, traffic from at least 20 underpasses was diverted after they were all flooded with rainwater, Delhi traffic police officials said.They said that though drainage at the Minto Bridge has been fixed by the authorities after a man drowned there last year, there are several underpasses across the city that get flooded every year even after moderate showers.Traffic police records show that traffic from at least 20 underpasses was diverted on Monday and Tuesday after these roads witnessed heavy flooding. On Monday, a man drowned in the inundated underpass at southeast Delhi’s Pul Prahlandpur, which has been on the police’s list of most vulnerable waterlogging spots.Besides Pul Prahladpur, the underpasses that were severely impacted were Airport Road underpass, Narela-Lampur underpass, Mehrauli underpass, Zakhira underpass, National Highway-8 underpass, Mehram Nagar underpass and Azadpur underpass. Traffic from all of these routes had to be diverted as the police along with road owning agencies pumped water out.Earlier this month, the Public Works Department (PWD) wrote to the traffic police to temporarily halt traffic movement around underpasses and low-lying areas, if the depth of the flood water crosses 20cm. However, traffic officials said that at a time when enforcement teams are firefighting on-ground, trying to manage traffic jams, diverting traffic while also pumping out water, these “half-hearted” measures do not yield results.“Once the water starts accumulating, it takes minutes for underpasses to get flooded. Though our teams are vigilant around these stretches but commuters are often unable to gauge the depth of the water on the stretches and often think they will be able to pass by. Monday’s case was slightly different though but year-after-year we find ourselves in the same position despite repeated reminders to the road owning agencies,” said a senior traffic official.Also Read | Rain continues for second day in Delhi, triggers waterlogging, snarlsTraffic cops and experts said the sight of underpasses getting flooded to the roof with rainwater is not new, especially in areas around outer Delhi. They said the drainage issues at the Minto Bridge -- which became an iconic picture whenever Delhi recorded heavy rain -- might have been rectified but there are several such underpasses across the city where the problem is much worse. Rescuers including police and teams from the Delhi Fire Services often have to fish out cars, buses and commuters that get trapped in the water.A senior PWD official said since most of the underpasses that witness heavy waterlogging are old, and the drainage capacity is not enough to flush out rainwater quickly. He said the department is now planning to redesign the drainage systems of these underpasses, adding that Pul Prahladpur is on top of their list.“On Monday, when water started accumulating at Pul Prahladpur, we deployed around eight pumps to flush out water. However, these pumps take time to flush out the water when it is constantly raining. Just like Minto Bridge, there is a plan to redesign the drainage at these underpasses. We will share the details of that once the plan is ready,” the official said.Sewa Ram, professor (transport planning) at School of Planning and Architecture, said that Delhi needs a dedicated traffic management plan for monsoon so that vehicular movement can be management more smoothly. He also said that road owning and civic agencies should also be made accountable for risking public life and ignoring the basic rules of designing roads and drainage.“Why should anyone lose their life because of the carelessness of authorities? In every other country when a road is designed, agencies ensure that the drainage can handle water load at least three times its original capacity, but that is not done here. We know that such a problem occurs every year, then why can’t have set diversion plans that will come into effect when waterlogging starts. Agencies can also partner with Google so that commuters can get real-time information on which roads are closed off in advance,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-days-of-rain-inundate-20-underpasses-in-delhi-101626804760688.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||Tilak Nagar: Domestic help held for kidnapping employer’s daughter||A 23-year-old domestic help was arrested for allegedly kidnapping her employer’s three-year-old daughter from their home in central Delhi’s Patel Nagar and demanding ₹42,000, including her salary, for her safe return.Police said the accused allegedly kidnapped the girl on Monday afternoon as she was annoyed at being scolded by her employer.According to police, the accused allegedly called the child’s mother and threatened to kill the toddler and commit suicide if she did not receive the ransom amount in her bank account.The domestic help was caught and the kidnapped child was safely rescued within three hours, after the Rajasthan Police -- acting on a tip-off from their counterparts in Delhi -- intercepted a bus, heading to Alwar, they were travelling in near Bhiwadi-Alwar border, senior police officers said.A senior Delhi Police officer said the child’s mother, who is a single parent and works in a costume export company in Delhi, approached the Patel Nagar police, claiming that her daughter was kidnapped by her domestic help between 3pm and 3.30 pm, while she was out for work.“The complainant told us that she had scolded the domestic help in the morning for not doing household work properly,” said the officer.Police said a case of kidnapping for ransom was registered and multiple teams scanned the CCTV cameras from the complainant’s neighbourhood, which purportedly showed the help leaving with the child.Investigators learnt that the suspect belonged to Alwar in Rajasthan and had been working at the complainant’s house for the past eight months. Suspecting that she may have left for her hometown, police teams contacted their counterparts in Rajasthan’s Bhiwadi, Alwar and Sikar areas and sought their assistance in rescuing the child.“The Rajasthan Police started checking private and public vehicles entering Rajasthan through Delhi borders. Around 6pm, the Bhiwadi police found the suspect travelling in a bus with the child. The suspect was caught and the child was safely rescued. We sent a team along with the complainant,” said the officer, adding the team returned with the suspect, the child and her mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tilak-nagar-domestic-help-held-for-kidnapping-employer-s-daughter-101626804755609.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||Forest dept survey finds 1,684 trees concretised along roads, housing colonies||An ongoing survey by the south division of the Delhi government’s forest department has found that at least 1,684 trees have been concretised along roads and in residential colonies, with officials claiming that they have issued fines totalling ₹38.7 lakh. The survey, which began last December and covers areas under the south division, aims to identify all such damaged trees and take steps for their revival.“So far, over 1,600 concretised trees have been identified across the area. Most of these are native species such as semal, neem, jamun, amaltas and gular, among others. The trees are aged between 10 years and 40-50 years,” said a senior forest official, who did not wish to be named.According to officials, around 180 trees along the road stretching from Greater Kailash-I (near the Ring Road) to R block red light, and then from there to M-block market, were found to be concretised by different government agencies.The senior official said that the survey may be extended to other divisions -- north and west.“Notices have been issued to offenders. While a fine of ₹38.7 lakh has been imposed, only ₹1.8 lakh has been deposited so far. Besides, corrective measures are being undertaken for affected trees,” said Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), south division.Apart from house and shop owners, the public works department (PWD) and the three municipal corporations --- South, North and East --- are among the offenders, an official said.Filling concrete within one metre radius of a tree trunk is a violation under the Delhi Trees Preservation Act, 1994, as well as of directions issued under the National Green Tribunal’s 2015 order, and can attract a penalty of ₹10,000 and above, depending on the damage.Officials said many of the trees identified by the survey were found to be old with their roots choked and partially dried up, even as the canopies of some others had become sparse.Tree officers who have been carrying out the survey explained that concretisation may even result in gradual decay in some cases. “The trunks and roots of many trees have been cemented while laying/re-laying of pavements, drains or other such construction works on main roads as well as in residential areas. Many residents, while making a driveway or levelling the entrance to their houses or shops, have cemented the area within one metre radius of the trees, which doesn’t leave enough space for water or air to percolate to the roots, resulting in its gradual decay and death,” said an official requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, a senior PWD official said that corrective measures are already being taken at several sites. “Restorative measures will be taken if any tree has been damaged,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.Officials in the South MCD said that they ensure that the contractors remove the concrete if the bases of any tree gets cemented during their work. “Many times, long after the work is over, residents making driveways or guard boxes also end up cementing the soil around the trees,” said a senior SDMC official, requesting anonymity.The Delhi high court had last September asked the state forest department to set up a helpline or a link on its website for people to report complaints of concretisation or any other damage caused to trees. The order came after a petition was filed by a resident of Old Delhi where a number of old trees were concretised over the decades leading to their decay.C R Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem in Delhi University, said that agencies and even individuals need to realise that concretisation of trees is an offence, as it eventually kills the tree. “Trees along the roads are avenue trees that provide shade and oxygen that act as filters against dust and pollution. They already have limited space to grow. When these trees are concretised, their root systems do not get enough space to develop or take the nutrients for its growth from the soil and water. During the monsoon, rainwater has to seep into the soil allowing tree growth, but if it’s layered with concrete, it will eventually die,” said Babu.He pointed out that many trees in Delhi are dying due to termite attack, noting that most such trees are left vulnerable by concretisation. He also pushed for increasing the minimum radius around trees for filling concrete from 1 metre to 2 metres.Last year, HT had reported several instances of concretisation of trees after which action was taken by the forest department against offending agencies.In October 2020, a number of trees on Maharishi Dayanand Marg in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash were found to be concretised and damaged during trenching activity that was being taken up by the public works department (PWD) for constructing a storm water drain in the area. Last September, around 30 full-grown tree bases were concretised at Meera Marg in Lodhi Colony during construction work being taken up by the road-owning agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forest-dept-survey-finds-over-1-600-trees-concretised-along-roads-housing-colonies-101626804696769.html

Work is still going on,” he said.A senior police officer said the accused was arrested and the cut pipes were recovered within two hours of the theft being reported on July 17.“The arrested man, Pawan, is an alcohol addict and lives in a house near the hospital. He stole the copper to arrange money for buying alcohol. He was previously involved in two gambling cases,” said DCP Singh.Dr Nayyer, however, said the recovered pipes were cut and cannot be used, and that the ward will need new pipelines.He further said that the crime was captured on the hospital’s CCTV camera. “The CCTV footage of the incident showed that the three people stuffed the pieces of the pipe in a sack and left the hospital on a motorcycle. The vehicle number was noted and all the guards were informed. Two of them came to the hospital on the same motorcycle the next day and were caught by a guard. They were handed over to the police. The recovery was made within 24 hours,” said Dr Nayyer.The DCP said that the medical superintendent of the hospital had filed a complaint regarding the theft on July 17 at the Mangolpuri police station. The complainant said that the theft took place on July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/24yrold-arrested-over-theft-of-copper-pipes-connected-to-hospital-s-oxygen-plant-101626804696112.html
21-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sero survey: Covid antibodies found in 80% of Chandigarh’s adult population||The preliminary findings of the first sero-survey of Chandigarh’s adult population, being conducted by Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has revealed that around 80% adults have been exposed to Covid-19 and that they have developed antibodies against the virus.Sero survey examines how many people in a population have antibodies against Covid-19, developed naturally or post vaccination. The survey is conducted by using an antibody test, also known as a serology test, and it helps to examine if an individual’s immune system has responded to the infection.“The department of biochemistry of GMCH-32 plans to test 1,200 adults from 30 randomly selected clusters in Chandigarh, including population from urban, rural and rehabilitation colonies. So far, we have tested 662 adults from urban and rural areas, of which 524 (79.4%) tested positive in the serology test,” said GMCH-32 director-principal Dr Jasbinder Kaur.The sero-survey results also found that antibodies are present more in the urban population than the rural population. Of the total persons tested, 132 were from rural areas and 91 (68.8%) of them were found sero-positive. Besides, 208 people from eight clusters and 322 people from urban sectors were also tested, wherein sero-prevalence stood at 83.5% and 79.8% respectively.“However, we are testing more adults in Chandigarh and the complete results of the sero-study will provide an accurate reflection of Covid-19 spread among the population of Chandigarh. The study will also help in studying immune response to the vaccine,” said Dr Kaur, adding that the survey will enable the health authorities to work out better mitigation strategies for prevention and control of the disease. “It will also help in prioritising the at-risk population,” she added.Children also highly exposed to virus in ChandigarhThe sero-survey of Chandigarh’s paediatric population, which is being conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has revealed that children in the city were highly exposed to Covid-19 infection. As per the preliminary findings, 71% of UT’s children, in the 6 to 18 age group, have developed natural antibodies against Covid-19. So far, PGIMER has tested 1,968 of the targeted 2,700 children. Antibodies in children have formed without Covid vaccination, indicating that children were infected with the virus and have recovered from it. PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram, said, “So far, we have found that around 67.4% children in UT’s sector areas, 74.3% in rural and 73.2% in colony areas have developed natural antibodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sero-survey-preliminary-findings-covid-19-antibodies-found-in-80-of-city-s-adult-population-101626796474976.html

21-07-2021||Pune||CM’s prayer: “Let there be sea of devotion in Pandharpur and warkaris be allowed to perform wari on foot again”||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Tuesday, said he would like to see devotees thronging the temple in Pandharpur. Thackeray was speaking after he performed the ‘’maha puja’’ of Lord Vitthal and Goddess Rukmini at a temple in Pandharpur, Solapur district, on the occasion of ‘Ashadhi Ekadashi’. The chief minister said he prayed for an end to the Covid-19 crisis and good health of everyone in the state, adding, “”Let there be a sea of devotion in Pandharpur and warkaris be allowed to perform ‘’wari’’ on foot again, and for that, I prayed to Lord Vitthal to eradicate Covid-19 and bless people in the state with good health.” As per the long-standing tradition, the chief minister performed the puja with his wife Rashmi Thackeray at 2.30 am. Ashadhi Ekadashi, one of the most important Hindu festivals, marks the culmination of a pilgrimage called the ‘’wari’’ that devotees (known as warkaris), undertake from across the state on foot, to Pandharpur. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government has not allowed the pilgrimage on foot since last year. The palkhis (palanquins) carrying ‘’padukas’’ (footwears) of saint-poets Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram, left for Pandharpur in flower-decked buses with a limited number of warkaris from Pune district on Monday. Thackeray’s son and state minister Aaditya Thackeray was also present on the occasion when chief minister performed the puja. Warkari couple Keshav Kolte and Indubai Kolte got the opportunity to perform the rituals alongside the Thackerays. Every year, a warkari couple is chosen to perform the official puja with the chief minister. Thackeray said, “I have seen lakhs of warkaris here (in normal times before Covid-19 outbreak), I have seen the sea of devotion flowing every year in Pandharpur. I want to see that picture again and I pray to Lord Vitthal to restore the same by ending the Covid-19 crisis.” He said devotion and self-confidence are needed to come to Pandharpur on foot after covering a long distance, “and that self-confidence helps one wade through challenges”. He noted that every year lakhs of warkaris used to come here on this day, but many of them could not even go inside the temple’s sanctum sanctorum for ‘’darshan’’ and had to return home by just visiting of the temple from outside. “It is the devotion that makes them come here on foot and this provides a strong foundation on which the state and the nation are standing,” he said. Thackeray said he is fortunate that he got the opportunity to come to Pandharpur and perform the ‘maha puja’’. Appreciating the structure of the temple’’s sanctum sanctorum, he said, “Every pillar, every stone and every idol here expresses something.” He asked Solapur district guardian minister Dattatray Bharne to showcase this heritage to the world and suggested undertaking a project for it. The CM handed over a cheque of ₹5 crore on behalf of the state government to the Pandharpur Municipal Council.

21-07-2021||Pune||Students in Pune gear up for Class 11 CET exams||The wholesale market at Appa Balwant chowk see rush of students buying books for the upcoming first common entrance test (CET) for admissions to first year junior college (FYJC) courses. The state education board has announced to conduct CET on August 21. Although the exam is optional for students, many youngsters turned up at the wholesale market for books on Tuesday to purchase CET related books. Students are also enrolling at private coaching classes to crack the test. “As there was no class 10 board exam this year, I scored less than expected marks. Hence, to get a good college for the Science stream, I need to score well in the CET examination. I have come to buy books on four subjects as per the CET syllabus,” said Shruti Jathar, who visited Appa Balwant chowk on Tuesday. Kishore Mhatre, a book stall owner at Appa Balwant chowk, said, “The demand for CET books, guides, notes and other study material has risen since last couple of days. As the exam is going to be held for the first time, the syllabus is new and we are getting the study material in phase wise manner from publication companies.” The CET exam comprises four subjects — Mathematics, Science, Social Science and English. Each subject is given 25 marks weightage and the duration to appear for the exam is two hours. It will be conducted in multiple-choice questions (MCQ) format. Meanwhile, many coaching institutes are offering discounts for CET preparation and class 11 studies. Some are also giving one-month crash course for students to prepare for the CET exam. “We are offering classes for CET exam. As it is the first time that the exam will be conducted, students need to score well to get admissions to their desired colleges.” said Prof Kedar Takalkar, founder-director of Takalkar Classes. Prof Sandeep Bendre, running another private coaching class, said, “We are getting many enrollments for Class 11 CET exams and are starting the online batch from tomorrow (Wednesday). There are two batches as per subjects and we will cover the syllabus in the next 20 days and last 10 days will be for revision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-in-pune-gear-up-for-class-11-cet-exams-101626788254516.html
21-07-2021||Delhi||Long way home: Rescuers struggle to rehab dogs after SGACC shuts down||Many rescue dogs in the Capital are once again facing an uncertain future as one of Delhi’s oldest institutions for sheltering abandoned animals, Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre (SGACC), is temporarily shutting operations from August 1. Former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, who started SGACC, said the hiatus was to ensure upgraded infrastructure, better staffing and animal sensitivity training. In a statement issued on her Twitter handle, she said, “As of 01.08.2021, after 40 years of functioning, the hospital will be shut down for a complete overhaul.” The statement further mentioned that the centre will be closed to any future rescues, and existing animals will be rehabilitated. “It will be closed to any future rescues, and existing animals will be rehabilitated. We will rebuild this institution again – physically (with the entire dog section rebuilt, with new infrastructure) and more importantly, in terms of staffing,” it stated.In the meanwhile, animal rescuers are aiming to rehabilitate at least 500 dogs from SGACC, battling limited resources and the lack of publicity.Social media to the rescue Elaborating on the changes underway at the SGACC, Mohit Sharma, who has been working at the centre for nearly three-and-a-half years says, “New shelter construct hoga, toh aur space nahin hoga humare paas to rescue dogs and large animals.” In a bid to amplify the cause, the volunteers are using social media to find prospective families. The response so far has been underwhelming, however. “It’s disheartening. Very few people have come forward,” shares Manta Sidhu, from Angel Eyes NGO, who is helping SGACC.Forever homes, no more fosters The rehabilitation process is now focussing on finding forever homes rather than foster ones. Underscoring the need for them, Sidhu says, “It gets difficult for dogs to move from one place to another. It will be tough for them to adjust again with the new dogs here.” The plight of desi breeds Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal for the adoption of Indian dog breeds last year, and various celebs advocating for the desi breed, denizens are still unsure. Animal volunteer Garima Dabla working with the team says, “There is still some hesitancy in adopting abandoned dogs or the indie breed even though these dogs are healthy, vaccinated and spayed/ neutered.” Welcome to spend time at the centre As humans often form instant bonds with animals, the centre is allowing to-be pet parents to visit and spend time with the dogs to make the process smooth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/animal-rescuers-appeal-to-rehome-dogs-after-sanjay-gandhi-animal-care-centre-shuts-down-101626717510988.html

Jim Banks, picked by McCarthy to be the top Republican on the panel, or Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Both are close allies of former President Donald Trump, whose supporters laid siege to the Capitol that day.In the hours after the insurrection, both Banks and Jordan voted to overturn Joe Biden's presidential victory. Pelosi said she had spoken with McCarthy and told him that she would reject the two names.“With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee," Pelosi said.McCarthy said in a statement that Pelosi’s move will damage the institution of Congress.“Unless Speaker Pelosi reverses course and seats all five Republican nominees, Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts," McCarthy said.The speaker’s decision is certain to further inflame tension between the two parties over the insurrection and the House panel that almost all Republicans opposed. Most in the GOP have remained loyal to Trump despite the violent insurrection of his supporters that sent many of them running for their lives. McCarthy had wouldn’t say for weeks whether Republicans would even participate in the probe, but on Monday, he sent the five names to Pelosi.Pelosi said in the statement that she had accepted McCarthy’s three other picks — Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong and Texas Rep. Troy Nehls. But McCarthy said that all or none would participate.Like Jordan and Banks, Nehls voted to overturn Biden’s victory. Armstrong and Davis voted to certify the election.McCarthy’s picks came after all but two Republicans opposed the creation of the 13-person select committee in a House vote last month, with most in the GOP arguing that the majority-Democratic panel would conduct a partisan probe. House Democrats originally attempted to create an evenly split, independent commission to investigate the insurrection, but that effort fell short when it was blocked by Senate Republicans.Banks recently traveled with Trump to the U.S.-Mexico border and to visit him at his New Jersey golf course. In a statement after McCarthy tapped him for the panel, he sharply criticized the Democrats who had set it up.“Make no mistake, Nancy Pelosi created this committee solely to malign conservatives and to justify the Left’s authoritarian agenda,” Banks said.Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, was one of Trump’s most vocal defenders during his two impeachments and last month likened the new investigation to “impeachment three.” Trump was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate both times.The chairman of the panel, Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, has said that the committee will have a quorum to conduct business whether GOP members are present or not.Pelosi named eight members of the panel earlier this month — seven Democrats and Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who has strongly criticized Trump and has been the most outspoken member of her caucus against the insurrection. Cheney, who was demoted from GOP leadership in May over her comments, was one of the two Republicans who voted in favor of forming the committee, along with Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.The panel will hold its first hearing next week, with at least four rank-and-file police officers who battled rioters that day testifying about their experiences. Dozens of police officers were injured as the crowd pushed past them and broke into the Capitol building.Seven people died during and after the rioting, including a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who suffered medical emergencies. Two police officers died by suicide in the days that followed, and a third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters. A medical examiner determined he died of natural causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-block-trump-allies-from-jan-6-panel-gop-may-boycott-101626889888851.html

Clubhouse previously required either an invite from an existing user to join the platform or the users had to request to join a waitlist. The platform witnessed explosive growth in the initial days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic but now faces competition from social media networks, especially from Twitter Spaces.“Twelve never-boring months later, we’re thrilled to share that Clubhouse is now out of beta, open to everyone, and ready to begin its next chapter. This means we have removed our waitlist system so that anyone can join,” Clubhouse said in a blog post.The company said the earlier limitation was aimed at being able to grow in a “measured way” and keeping things from “breaking” as the platform scaled, adding that they always wanted to be open. The app was initially available only for iOS and in mid-May this year, Clubhouse was launched on Android.Also Read | Facebook rolls out live audio, podcasts in US in a challenge to ClubhouseClubhouse said it had added 10 million people since its Android launch and the team has gone from 8 people to 58."We know there will be many more ups and downs as we scale, and competition from the large networks will be fierce. But we believe the future is created by optimists -- and we're excited to keep working to build a different kind of social network," the company added.Last week, Clubhouse introduced the 'Backchannel' feature which allows users to send direct messages on the platform. The company said around 90 million direct messages were sent since the launch of Backchannel. Apart from messaging friends on the platform, the feature is aimed at helping speakers coordinate with co-hosts or exchange questions from the audience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/live-audio-app-clubhouse-no-longer-invite-only-as-competition-with-twitter-grows-101626888316184.html

To serve the worshippers is a very noble and honourable task," said Mona, who declined to give her family name.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pushed through social and economic reforms as part of plans to modernise the conservative Muslim kingdom and attract foreign investment under a diversification drive.Under his reform plan, known as Vision 2030, the crown prince lifted a driving ban on women, allowed adult women to travel without permission from guardians and granted them more control over family matters.But the reform plan has been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including on women's rights activists.Saudi Arabia has restricted the haj to its own citizens and residents for the second year in a row, barring millions of other pilgrims from abroad in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Samar, another soldier watching pilgrims near the Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure that Muslims believe was built by Abraham, said she was encouraged by her family to join the military, after psychology studies."This is a huge accomplishment for us and it is the biggest pride to be in the service of religion, the country and the guests of God, the most merciful," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-the-first-time-saudi-women-stand-guard-in-mecca-during-haj-101626883624928.html

The United States closed land borders for all non-essential travel at the start of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in March 2020 and continued extending it on a monthly basis. It has been extended for another 30 days even as they have allowed Canadians to fly in.The extension came days after Canada announced its decision to allow fully vaccinated visitors from the US starting August 9. According to Reuters report, the Biden administration is yet to decide whether only fully-vaccinated individuals would be allowed whenever the land borders get opened up for non-essential travel. On the other hand, Canada has announced that only fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents currently residing in the US will be allowed from August 9.Also Read | Canada extends ban on passenger flights from India till Aug 21 over Covid-19The White House is reportedly planning a new round of high-level meetings to discuss the travel restrictions amid pressure from businesses in Canada and the US to open the land borders, as per Reuters. The airline and tourism industry has suffered a huge loss during the pandemic due to restrictions on non-essential travel.The reopening of businesses and easing travel restrictions in the US have been made possible due to the high vaccination rate but the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant combined with vaccine hesitancy in many communities have threatened the gains. The Delta variant, first identified in India, accounts for about 83% of Covid-19 cases in the United States, health officials said on Tuesday. During a Senate hearing, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said that deaths from the infection averaged 239 per day over the past week, nearly 48% higher than the previous week.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-land-borders-with-canada-mexico-to-remain-closed-until-august-21-101626877992948.html

The rapid transmission of the 'variant of concern' first detected in India appears to be driven by multiple factors, including relaxation of social distancing measures and inequitable vaccine distribution around the world, the WHO said.“It is expected that it will rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant circulating lineage over the coming months,” the UN health agency said in its weekly epidemiological update.The Delta variant is wreaking havoc across the globe and now accounts for more than 75% of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in several countries including India, Bangladesh, Australia, South Africa, Britain, Singapore, Indonesia, Russia, and China among others, as per the report. The US health officials said on Tuesday that the variant of concern accounts for about 83% of cases in the United States, threatening the gains made through the massive vaccination drive.Also Read | Covid-19: Delta variant now accounts for 83% of US Cases, informs CDCOver the past week, Indonesia reported the highest number of new Covid-19 cases, followed by Britain, Brazil, India, and the US. Despite a worrying rise in coronavirus cases per capita, the UK has removed virtually all restrictions, prompting experts to warn the country about the impending threat.The WHO report said growing evidence supports the Delta variant’s increased transmissibility but the exact mechanism for it remains unclear. Citing a study from China, the UN health agency said that the time interval from the exposure to the first positive PCR result may be shorter for the Delta variant as compared to non-variants of concern. The study also suggested that the Delta variant may be able to replicate faster and be more infectious during the early stages of infection.“The evolution of transmission patterns as the pandemic continues will likely be influenced by the impact of the Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and by the emergence of more transmissible variants, or variants with properties of immune escape,” the WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-delta-variant-now-in-124-countries-to-dominate-within-months-says-who-101626873949180.html
21-07-2021||World||US deputy state secretary to visit China as tensions soar||Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will travel to China this weekend on a visit that comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing soar on multiple fronts, the State Department said Wednesday.Sherman will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and others in the northeastern city of Tianjin on Sunday as part of her current trip to Asia, which also is taking her to Japan, South Korea and Mongolia.Sherman will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China since President Joe Biden took office, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Wang and veteran Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in Anchorage, Alaska, in March for what proved to be a contentious first exchange. John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, traveled to Shanghai for meetings with his Chinese counterpart in April, but Sherman now outranks him.Sherman’s visit to China follows a significant deterioration in already badly strained U.S.-China ties in just the past two weeks, and there had been questions about why the trip was not announced at the same time as the rest of her travel to the region.Senior U.S. officials would not confirm suggestions that the Chinese had initially offered only lower-level officials for Sherman to meet. But they said the Biden administration would not have agreed to the visit unless they were assured Sherman would be able to see top-ranking officials in person. The officials were not authorized to preview the trip publicly ahead of Wednesday's formal announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The State Department said the administration was “exploring opportunities” to engage face to face with Chinese officials at senior levels.“These discussions are part of ongoing U.S. efforts to hold candid exchanges with PRC officials to advance U.S. interests and values and to responsibly manage the relationship,” the department said in a statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “The Deputy Secretary will discuss areas where we have serious concerns about PRC actions, as well as areas where our interests align.”The officials said Sherman’s agenda would be wide-ranging and cover areas of contention as well as a smaller set of areas of convergence, such as a mutual desire to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table for nuclear talks. But they allowed that the differences are vast and stark and likely to occupy most of the discussion.On Monday, the administration accused China of being behind a massive hack of Microsoft Exchange email server software and indicted four Chinese nationals on charges they tried to steal U.S. trade secrets, technology and disease research.Last week, the U.S. issued separate stark warnings against transactions with entities that operate in China’s western Xinjiang region, where China is accused of repressing Uyghur Muslims and other minorities. The administration also advised American firms of the deteriorating investment and commercial environment in Hong Kong, where China has been cracking down on democratic freedoms it had pledged to respect in the former British colony.At the same time, the administration reaffirmed a Trump-era policy shift that rejects nearly all of China’s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea and reminded Beijing that any military move against the Philippines in disputed areas would trigger a response under a U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty.U.S.-China relations have also been aggravated by China’s increasing threats toward Taiwan and its policies in Tibet.Those issues, all carried over from the Trump administration, came on top of persistent tensions over China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan, and concerns about predatory Chinese investment in the developing world and its attempts to gain supremacy in the global high-tech telecommunications sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deputy-state-secretary-to-visit-china-as-tensions-soar-101626870620728.html

The committee cited the “irreversible loss of attributes conveying the outstanding universal value of the property” as a reason for the removal of the site from the world heritage list.“Any deletion from the World Heritage List is a loss to the international community and to the internationally shared values and commitments under the World Heritage Convention,” Unesco said in a statement.The six areas in the historic centre and docklands of the maritime mercantile City of Liverpool were included on the World Heritage List in 2004. The areas of the heritage site were the world’s major trading centres in the 18th and 19th centuries, a testimony to the development of maritime mercantile culture. The modern dock technology, transport systems and port management were the significant features of the maritime city.Also Read | Unesco recommends Great Barrier Reef be listed 'in danger', Australia hints China’s handReason for removalIn 2012, however, the World Heritage Committee sounded alarm bells over the proposed construction of Liverpool Waters, a massive redevelopment of the historic docklands north of the city centre. While moving it to the list of world heritage in danger, the committee warned that the redevelopment project would “alter the skyline and profile of the site.”“The project has since gone ahead along with other developments both inside the site and in its buffer zone. The Committee considers that these constructions are detrimental to the site’s authenticity and integrity,” Unesco said after Liverpool’s removal from the world heritage site.Liverpool mayor Joanne Anderson expressed disappointment over the World Heritage Committee’s decision taken during its 44th session in Fuzhou. Anderson said she is concerned by the decision which comes a “decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes.”“We will be working with Government to examine whether we can appeal but, whatever happens, Liverpool will always be a World Heritage city. We have a stunning waterfront and incredible built heritage that is the envy of other cities,” she added.Liverpool has become the third property to lose its world heritage status after Dresden in Germany and the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in Oman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-english-city-of-liverpool-stripped-of-its-world-heritage-status-by-unesco-101626869911463.html

Donning a blue suit and a cowboy hat, Bezos addressed a conference after his brief trip into space, during which he thanked the workers of Amazon for "paying" for his trip. However, the well-intended gratitude has failed to resonate with critics who have accused the billionaire of being "tone-deaf".“I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all this,” the 57-year-old Bezos said during a news conference, after becoming the second billionaire in just over a week to ride in his own spacecraft. The statement immediately stirred a backlash on the internet as people pointed out reports claiming inhumane working conditions and lack of breaks that Amazon workers are forced to work under.Former secretary of labour and a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, Robert Reich wrote that Bezos has crushed unionising attempts for decades. "Amazon workers don’t need Bezos to thank them. They need him to stop union-busting — and pay them what they deserve," Reich said on Twitter.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also criticised Bezos saying, "Yes, Amazon workers did pay for this - with lower wages, union busting, a frenzied and inhumane workplace, and delivery drivers not having health insurance during a pandemic." She also added, "Amazon customers are paying for it with Amazon abusing their market power to hurt small business.""Jeff Bezos forgot to thank all the hardworking Americans who actually paid taxes to keep this country running while he and Amazon paid nothing," wrote US Senator Elizabeth Warren on the micro-blogging site."It's time for Jeff Bezos to take care of business right here on Earth and pay his fair share in taxes," she also said.Meanwhile, Representative Earl Blumenauer, who is on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, proposed legislation that would tax space travel for non-scientific research purposes. "Space exploration isn’t a tax-free holiday for the wealthy," said, adding, "We pay taxes on plane tickets. Billionaires flying into space—producing no scientific value—should do the same."Bezos stepped down as the chief executive officer (CEO) of e-commerce giant Amazon earlier this month to focus on side projects including his space exploration company Blue Origin. However, time and time again he has faced increasing activism within his own workforce for gruelling working hours.Several Amazon workers have also spoken about the lack of break times and how the company puts too much reliance on rigid productivity metrics and has unsafe working conditions. Earlier this year, an effort to unionise workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama failed. The workers have alleged that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity before and during the warehouse voting.Meanwhile, Bezos has said that he financed the rocket company by selling $1 billion in Amazon stock each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-thanks-amazon-workers-for-paying-for-his-space-trip-sparks-backlash-on-social-media-101626855592800.html
21-07-2021||World||Pakistan bans TikTok for 4th time, for inappropriate content||Pakistan has again banned Chinese-origin popular video sharing platform TikTok on the account of the "continuous presence of inappropriate content on the platform and its failure to take such content down". Pakistan Telecommunications Authority on Wednesday notified about the blocking under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016. This is reportedly the fourth time that the app was shown the door in the country. All the earlier bans were reversed when the app promised to moderate its content.In October 2020, the app was banned for the first time in Pakistan after the authorities received complaints of indecent and immoral content. The ban was lifted within 10 days following TikTok's assurance of taking action against inappropriate content.The Peshawar high court had imposed a ban on Tiktok in March which was lifted in April. In Jule, the Sindh high court asked the telecommunication authority to block TikTok as it was spreading immorality and obscenity. This order was also lifted after three days.TikTok is very popular in Pakistan, though the anti-TikTok sentiment is also very strong. The app, which is banned in neighbouring India, has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan.The ban order passed by the Singh high court was in response to a petition filed by a resident of Punjab province, who alleged that TikTok was promoting crime as people were using weapons and drugs in the videos.Between January and March, TikTok removed 6,495,992 videos making it the second market to get the most videos removed after the USA, where 8,540,088 videos were removed, TikTok said. Pakistan-made videos were also banned, a spokesperson told Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bans-tiktok-for-4th-time-for-inappropriate-content-101626853759583.html
21-07-2021||World||Tom Barrack, Donald Trump’s close friend and political ally, arrested||Federal authorities in the US on Tuesday arrested Tom Barrack, a long-time close friend and political ally of former president Donald Trump, for allegedly acting on behalf of a foreign government, the UAE, without registering as a foreign agent.Barrack, 74, was charged with obstruction of justice for lying to federal agents in an interview in 2019 about his association with the foreign government. Matthew Grimes, an associate of Barrack, was also arrested. A third person, UAE citizen Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, is at large. All three were charged with seven counts of crime in an indictment unsealed in a New York City federal court. The arrests took place in California.Barrack was a lead speaker at the Republican convention in 2016 at which Trump was nominated as the party’s nominee, and after election served as chairman of Trump’s inauguration committee.Barrack joins a growing number of people from Trump’s orbit to face legal troubles, ranging from indictment to arrest to sentencing. The most recent case was that of Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Organization chief financial officer, who was arrested and charged with participating in a “sweeping and audacious” tax fraud scheme.The former US president himself is facing two criminal investigations. In New York, he is being investigated for allegedly manipulating the value of his company’s assets to seek loans or cut tax liabilities. In Georgia, he is being probed for alleged attempts to influence the 2020 presidential election.Announcing the arrests and indictments, assistant attorney general Lesko said, “The defendants repeatedly capitalised on Barrack’s friendships and access to a candidate who was eventually elected president, high-ranking campaign and government officials, and the American media to advance the policy goals of a foreign government without disclosing their true allegiances.”The indictment details some of the work that Barrack did to benefit his UAE employers. In May 2016, Barack, who was advising Trump’s campaign, had inserted a favourable mention of the UAE in the candidate’s speech on his energy policy. After Trump was elected, Barrack allegedly continued advocating for the UAE, and with more influence. The indictment alleges he pushed the candidacy of an individual favoured by the UAE as ambassador to that country. “In May 2017, Barrack agreed to provide Alshahhi with non-public information about the views and reactions of senior United States government officials following a White House meeting between senior US officials and senior UAE officials,” said the office of the US attorney for the eastern district of New York in a statement. The 45-page indictment gives specific and granular details of his actions.Matt Herrington, a lawyer for Barrack, said his client “made himself voluntarily available to investigators from the outset. He is not guilty and will be pleading not guilty today”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tom-barrack-donald-trump-s-close-friend-and-political-ally-arrested-101626850719531.html

At least 12 people have also lost their lives, according to a report by the Bloomberg news agency.Zhengzhou reportedly saw a record 457.5 millimetres (18 inches) of rainfall in the 24 hours through 5 pm on Tuesday. Due to the heavy rains and flooding, inbound flights have been suspended in the city, while rescue operations are underway to evacuate locals to the safe area.Several parts of the city also saw loss of power, while roads submerged in the rainwater. Chinese President Xi Jinping declared the deadly flooding "extremely severe", state media reported."Some reservoirs had their dams burst... causing serious injury, loss of life and property damage. The flood control situation is extremely severe," Xi was quoted as saying, adding events were at a "critical stage".The Chinese president has also asked officials to step up disaster relief measures.The iPhone cityHenan's Zhengzhou city is known to house the largest iPhone-making plant in the world. It is owned by Taiwan's Hon Hai precision Industry Co. The massive flooding has hit the city just as the company is preparing to ramp up production ahead of Apple's launch event for the latest devices.According to reports, the factory can produce 5,00,000 iPhones a day and is known as "iPhone City" by locals.The company is now monitoring the situation, a representative was quoted saying by Bloomberg.The Henan flooding has also worried the authorities as the province is the second-largest food supplier in China. It accounts for about a quarter of the country’s wheat harvest and is a major centre for frozen food production. It is also a key hub for coal and metals.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dam-burst-18-inches-of-rain-in-24-hours-how-china-s-iphone-city-was-flooded-101626848689450.html
21-07-2021||World||12 killed, 200,000 evacuated as incessant rainfall batters central China city||At least 12 people were killed and more than 500 rescued after a subway line was flooded in Zhengzhou city, in China’s central Henan province, which has been hit by the highest daily rainfall, local media said on Wednesday. Authorities have issued the highest warning levels for the province as the situation is expected to worsen. The municipal meteorological bureaus of Henan province as well as Zhengzhou have raised the emergency response for the disaster to level I.Zhengzhou, which has a population of more than 12 million, saw a record-high hourly precipitation of 201.9 mm from 4pm to 5pm on Tuesday, according to the Henan provincial meteorological centre. “As of 7am on July 21, almost 200,000 people were evacuated in an emergency and 36,000 city residents were affected by the disaster,” the city authorities said.Images shared on social media showed passengers dealing with the rising water levels inside a train carriage. Rescue and relief authorities had to cut open the roof of the carriage to pull out people to safety, news agency AFP reported.The heavy downpour in Zhengzhou has also led to severe waterlogging in several areas. More than 80 bus lines have been suspended and more than 100 have been temporarily detoured. The subway service has also been temporarily shut.The level of rainfall in the city witnessed over the three days was one seen only “once in a thousand years”, local media cited meteorologists as saying, according to Reuters. The city’s Guojiazui reservoir has also been breached.State media further reported that Zhengzhou’s transportation system continues to remain paralysed and schools and hospitals in the city have also been cut off due to severe waterlogging.Since Tuesday, several kindergarten children have been trapped in their schools while a large hospital in the city, which has more than 7,000 beds, has no power and all back up supplies are exhausted, according to the People’s Daily. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou had been rushing to find transportation to shift about 600 critically ill patients, the People’s Daily added.On the other hand, roads in a dozen populous cities of the Henan province are also flooded. Images and videos shared on social media showed people wading across the streets amid the high current of water. Henan is a major logistics hub in central China and is also home to several cultural sites.Chinese President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, has described the flooding menace in Henan province as extremely severe, adding flood prevention efforts have become difficult. “Some rivers have exceeded monitoring levels, some dams have broken down, while some railway services have stopped and flights cancelled, causing heavy casualties and property losses,” Jinping said on Wednesday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-killed-200-000-evacuated-as-incessant-rainfall-batters-central-china-city-101626843767054.html

Maryam Sharif has recently targeted Imran Khan's kids "being raised in the lap of the Jews" referring to the PM's former wife Jemima Goldsmith.Reacting to the attack, Jemima took to Twitter and wrote that this was the reason she had left Pakistan in 2004. "I left Pakistan in 2004 after a decade of antisemitic attacks by the media & politicians (& weekly death threats & protests outside my house). But still it continues," Jemima wrote on Twitter.Imran Khan's election symbol should be 'thief', says Pakistan leader Maryam NawazI have absolutely no interest in you, your sons or your personal lives because I have better things to do and say but if your ex drags in families of others out of spite, others will have nastier things to say.

The latest figure is up from 50% from the first week of July.In a testimony before the Senate Health Committee, Walesnky also said that areas of the country with limited vaccination coverage are allowing the spread of the highly transmissible variant, which was first identified in India. "Each death is tragic and even more heartbreaking when we know that the majority of these deaths can be prevented with a simple, safe, available vaccine," Walensky said as per a Bloomberg report.The top federal medical official also said that the best way to prevent the spread of Covid-19 variants is "to prevent the spread of disease, and vaccination is the most powerful tool we have."She also told the senators that the "overwhelming majority" of Covid-19 deaths are occurring in the unvaccinated population. Earlier as well, Walensky had stressed on the need for maximum people to be vaccinated, warning that this "becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.""We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk. Communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well," she had said last week.The US has inoculated less than half of the population so far, while states that have the lowest rate of vaccination are seeing a surge in cases amid the threat of a third wave looming over the country. States that have the lowest rate of vaccination are Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.Over the last few weeks, the national vaccination campaign chalked out by the Biden administration has slowed down significantly. The US is administering 5,21,000 doses daily, an 85 per cent decrease from a peak in April when 3.38 million doses were administered every day.The country has a total caseload of 34,173,020 and as many as 609,521 people have succumbed to the viral disease that first originated in China in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-now-accounts-for-83-of-us-cases-informs-cdc-101626835351988.html
21-07-2021||World||Eid al-Adha in pandemic's shadow: How the world is celebrating Bakrid||Muslims around the world were observing Tuesday yet another major Islamic holiday in the shadow of the pandemic and amid growing concerns about the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus.Eid al-Adha, or the “Feast of Sacrifice,” is typically marked by communal prayers, large social gatherings, slaughtering of livestock and distributing meat to the needy. This year, the holiday comes as many countries battle the delta variant first identified in India, prompting some to impose new restrictions or appeal for people to avoid congregating and follow safety protocols.The pandemic has already taken a toll for the second year on a sacred mainstay of Islam, the hajj, whose last days coincide with Eid al-Adha. Once drawing some 2.5 million Muslims from across the globe to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the pilgrimage has been dramatically scaled back due to the virus.This year's hajj has been limited to 60,000 vaccinated Saudi citizens or residents of Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, pilgrims wearing masks and maintaining social distancing performed the symbolic stoning of the devil in the valley area of Mina — using sterilized pebbles they received ahead of time.“This is (a) very, very, very big moment for us, for me especially,” said pilgrim Arya Widyawan Yanto, an Indonesian living in Saudi Arabia. He added that he was happy he had the chance to perform the pilgrimage. “Everything was conducted under very strict precautions.”Yanto said he hoped for the pandemic to end and for all Muslims to be able to perform the pilgrimage in a safe way.Indonesia marked a grim Eid al-Adha amid a devastating new wave of coronavirus cases in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. Vice President Ma’ruf Amin, also an influential Islamic cleric, appealed to people to perform holiday prayers at home with their families.“Don’t do crowds,” Amin said in televised remarks ahead of the start of the holiday. “Protecting oneself from the Covid-19 pandemic is obligatory.”The surge in new cases is believed to have been fueled by travel during another holiday — the Eid al-Fitr festival in May — and by the rapid spread of the delta variant.In Malaysia, measures have been tightened after a sharp spike in infections, despite a national lockdown since June 1. People are banned from traveling back to their hometowns or crossing districts to celebrate. House visits and customary trips to graveyards are also banned.Healthy worshippers are allowed to gather for prayers in mosques, with strict social distancing and no physical contact. Ritual animal sacrifice is limited to mosques and other approved areas.Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah has urged Malaysians not to “repeat irresponsible behavior,” adding that travel and celebrations during Eid al-Fitr and another festival on the island of Borneo led to new clusters of cases.“Let us not in the excitement of celebrating the Feast of Sacrifice cause us all to perish because of Covid-19,” he said in a statement.Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin urged Muslims to stay home. “I appeal to you all to be patient and abide by the rules because your sacrifice is a great jihad in Allah’s sight and in our effort to save lives,” he said in a televised speech on the eve of the festival.The World Health Organization has reported that globally, Covid-19 cases and deaths had climbed after periods of decline, with the reversal spurred in part by the delta variant.Lockdowns will severely curtail Eid al-Adha festivities in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia’s two largest cities.Sydney resident Jihad Dib, a New South Wales state government lawmaker, said the city’s Muslims were sad but understood why they would be confined to their homes with no visitors allowed.“It’s going to be the first Eid in my life I don’t hug and kiss my mum and dad,” Dib told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Iran on Monday imposed a week-long lockdown on the capital, Tehran, and the surrounding region as the country struggles with another surge in the coronavirus pandemic, state media reported. The lockdown begins Tuesday.Not everyone is imposing new restrictions. In Bangladesh, authorities have allowed an eight-day pause in the country’s strict lockdown for the holiday that health experts say could be dangerous.British Muslims were celebrating in the wake of coronavirus restrictions being lifted in England this week, but against the backdrop of surging infections that are forecast to increase even further as the country opens up.“Eid is about sacrifice, and Muslims, just like everyone else, have had to make huge sacrifices over the past 18 months, staying apart when normally you would come together,” said Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who recently tested positive for Covid-19. “There are brighter days ahead,” he said in a video message.Eid al-Adha recalls the Quranic tale of Prophet Ibrahim’s test of faith and his willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of submission to God.In Egypt, Essam Shaban traveled to the southern province of Sohag to spend Eid al-Adha with his family. He said ahead of the start of the holiday that he planned to pray at a mosque there on Tuesday while taking precautions such as bringing his own prayer rug and wearing a mask.“We want this Eid to pass by peacefully without any infections,” he said. “We must follow instructions.”Shaban looked forward to pitching in with his brothers to buy a buffalo for slaughtering, going door-to-door to give some of the meat to the poor, and to the traditional festive meal later in the day with his extended family.“It’s usually boisterous with laughter and bickering with the kids,” he said. “It’s great.”But others will be without loved ones.In India, where Eid al-Adha starts Wednesday, Tahir Qureshi would always go with his father for prayers and then to visit family and friends. His father died in June after contracting the virus during a surge that devastated the country, and the thought of having to spend the holiday without him is heartbreaking.“It will be difficult without him,” he said.India's Muslim scholars have been urging people to exercise restraint and adhere to health protocols. Some states have restricted large gatherings and are asking people to observe the holiday at home.Meanwhile, the pandemic’s economic fallout, which threw millions of Indians into financial hardship, has many saying they cannot afford to buy sacrificial livestock.In Indian-controlled Kashmir, a disputed, Muslim-majority region, businessman Ghulam Hassan Wani is among those cutting back.“I used to sacrifice three or four sheep, but this year we can hardly afford one,” Wani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eid-al-adha-2021-in-pandemic-s-shadow-how-is-the-world-celebrating-bakrid-101626834096290.html

New York state's environmental protection services issued the air quality advisory as fine particle matter is expected to rise above 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air, multiple news agencies reported.As per the report by news agency AFP, it is not uncommon for smoke from fires in the west of the country to reach the New York area. However, they usually remain high enough to not affect air quality. This time, the smoke was lower than usual, it reported quoting an expert.On Tuesday, the air quality index (AQI) for fine particulate matter reached 170 in New York. This is considered harmful even for healthy individuals and nine times above exposure recommendations of the World Health Organization. In the Philadelphia state, the AQI hit 172.Other northeastern cities, including Boston and Hartford, Connecticut, also had readings above 150.Every year in summer, the western part of the United States is hit with large wildfires mainly due to the rise in heat levels caused by climate change. This year as well several large fires have ravaged the region, notably in California, Nevada and Oregon.According to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in the US, more than 80 large active wildfires have charred almost 1.3 million acres (526,090 hectares) of drought-parched vegetation in recent weeks in 13 western states.Several hundred additional fires are burning in western and central parts of Canada. This includes 86 fires classified as out of control on Tuesday in British Columbia alone, leading officials there to declare a state of emergency.In the Ontario province, more than 2,000 people have been evacuated in recent days as the experts have mulled that these wildfires may spread further.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pollution-alert-in-ny-as-canada-wildfire-plunges-air-quality-aqi-above-150-101626831351479.html
21-07-2021||World||Harvey Weinstein brought to California to face further rape charges||New York prison officials have handed convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein over to California to face additional sexual assault charges, ending the former movie mogul's lengthy fight to delay his extradition.Weinstein, 69, was booked into a downtown Los Angeles jail Tuesday afternoon, records showed. He could be arraigned on 11 sexual assault counts, including four counts of rape, as early as Wednesday morning, according to his LA attorney, Mark Werksman. The district attorney's office had no immediate comment.Weinstein's lawyers had been trying to negotiate to stop the transfer, but it had been expected to happen soon, his spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said."We will be fighting so that Harvey can receive his needed medical care and of course, so that he can be treated fairly," Engelmayer said. "Due process, presumption of innocence and a fair trial are all still his right."A New York judge in June approved Weinstein's extradition to California, denying his lawyers' request to keep him at a state prison near Buffalo, where he is serving a 23-year sentence for a rape conviction last year, until the start of jury selection in the Los Angeles case.Weinstein's lawyer, Norman Effman, argued he should remain in the New York facility's hospital-like maximum-security setting while receiving treatment for health problems including loss of eyesight.Weinstein's time in custody in California will count toward his New York sentence, officials said.Weinstein was charged in January 2020 with 11 sexual assault counts in California involving five women, stemming from allegations in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills from 2004 to 2013. The charges include rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint and sexual penetration by use of force.Weinstein maintains his innocence and contends that any sexual activity was consensual.The California charges were announced shortly before Weinstein's conviction in New York City on charges that he raped an aspiring actress in 2013 in a Manhattan hotel room and forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment.He is appealing that conviction.A lawyer for one of Weinstein's accusers applauded Tuesday's transfer, which was repeatedly delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as legal arguments over paperwork and his medical needs."The opportunity to hold Weinstein accountable for his actions in California gives voice to the survivors including my client, Jane Doe 4," attorney Elizabeth Fegan said in a statement. "They deserve to be heard and to have Weinstein answer for his actions. Our hope is that a guilty verdict in California will ensure that Harvey Weinstein will spend the rest of his life behind bars – securing justice for women everywhere."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvey-weinstein-brought-to-california-to-face-further-rape-charges-101626830439085.html

21-07-2021||World||Rockets hit Kabul while Ghani holds Eid prayers||At least three rockets hit near the presidential palace on Tuesday shortly before Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was to give an address to mark the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.There were no injuries and the rockets landed outside the heavily fortified palace grounds, said Mirwais Stanikzai, spokesman for the interior minister.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack on its Amaq news channel.Police quickly fanned out across the area. One car parked on a nearby street was completely destroyed. The police said it was used as launching pad for the rockets.The palace is in the middle of a so-called green zone that is fortified with giant cement blast walls and barbed wire, and streets near the palace have long been closed off.The barrage came as the US and Nato complete their final withdrawal from Afghanistan. Many Afghans are worried whether their country will fall deeper into chaos and violence as foreign forces withdraw and the Taliban gain more territory on the ground.“This Eid has been named after Afghan forces to honour their sacrifices and courage, especially in the last three months,” Ghani said in his address to the nation following morning prayers for Eid al-Adha. “The Taliban have no intention and willingness for peace. We have proven that we have the intention, the willingness and have sacrificed for peace.”However, Afghan forces have complained about being left without reinforcements and supplies, often running low on food as the Taliban advanced. In many instances, Afghan troops surrendered rather than fight.Washington’s watchdog monitoring US spending in Afghanistan reported that troops are deeply demoralised and corruption is rampant. After their pullout, the US and Nato are committed to spending $4 billion annually on Afghan forces until 2024, the majority of that money coming from Washington.Ghani said he deplored his government’s decision to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners to get peace talks started last year as a “big mistake” that only strengthened the insurgents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-hit-kabul-while-ghani-holds-eid-prayers-101626812104515.html
21-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh approves auction of 17 coal blocks, triggers wildlife concerns||The Chhattisgarh Cabinet has approved auctioning of 17 out of 18 coal blocks identified by the Centre in the state, triggering concerns on the impact of mining activities in wildlife-rich areas that are home to several elephants, sloth bears and leopards.Activists believe the approval was granted despite no increase in demand for coal.An official familiar with the matter said the nod for the auction was given at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “...Barra coal block, which is in Raigarh district, has been exempted from the auction,” the official said, asking not to be named.Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Ravindra Chaubey said Barra was exempted from the auction in view of the presence of a major human settlement in the area.Chaubey added that the decision to remove Barra coal block from the list was taken at the request of public representatives and ministers.“The activists have the right to express their views but, in this case, the Centre had asked for approval of the state government. The decision and jurisdiction are of the Union government and I believe the activists should pressure the government in Delhi,” he said.A senior official in the environment ministry said: “We can intervene only when the project proponent comes to us for forest clearance or wildlife clearance. We can also comment or study the matter if we are asked to by a court if there is a legal case involved. On the overall issue of mining in the state, we cannot intervene.”A response from the coal ministry wasn’t immediately available.As per official data, Chhattisgarh produces around 150 million tonne of coal annually and has around 58,589 million tonne of reserves. The 17 blocks, which are expected to generate around 8,000 million tonne of coal, are located in Dharamjaigarh, Sarguja, Surajpur and Koriya forest divisions.According to MSTC Limited, the enterprise which is carrying out the auctions for the Centre, a large forest area comes under the region where the blocks are located. On its website, the enterprise said the coal blocks involve between 15% to 40% of forest land. Tributaries to the Atem, Mahan, Pajhar Nadi and Kelo rivers flow through the area.Sudiep Shrivastava, an environmental lawyer, expressed concerns over the impact on the wildlife of the area. “...in some areas, even tigers are also found,” he said, adding that below 50% of the area around the blocks is forested but the landscape is crucial for wildlife.Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, an NGO, said the state government should have opposed commercial mining as Chhattisgarh is already facing consequences in the form of environmental destruction and displacements. He added that the state government will not get any special revenue because of low rates.“The auction is not for the country’s coal requirements but for corporate profits as 44 of the 70 previously allocated coal blocks (between 2015-20) are yet to start operations. New power plants are also not being established and the demand for coal is also not increasing. That is why this auction is also an exercise to eliminate Coal India (government-owned coal mining and refining corporation),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-approves-auction-of-17-coal-blocks-triggers-wildlife-concerns-101626892033706.html

According to the forest department, the incident took place in the early hours of July 19 when forest personnel intercepted a group of timber smugglers in the Basab Nala area of the park. Based on specific information, forest personnel had carried out night patrolling inside the park and came across the group of smugglers who were engaged in felling of trees. The smugglers allegedly fired at the forest team, which retaliated with counter fire. This went on for a few minutes before the smugglers reportedly escaped from the park. Since it was dark, the forest staff too returned back. Carcass of the female elephant aged around 18 years with bullet injury marks was found at the same spot the next afternoon by the forest team. They also found nine felled trees in the area. “The circumstantial evidence suggested the elephant was used for dragging of logs by the miscreants. The team further ascertained that the miscreants entered the park from Arunachal Pradesh side,” said an initial report by the forest department on the incident. An FIR on the incident has been filed at the Jeypore police station and a post-mortem of the carcass was carried out. It was found that the elephant had sustained injuries from three bullets. It is not yet clear if those bullets were fired by forest personnel or the smugglers or both. Further investigation is underway to nab the smugglers. In another development, a 71-year-old man was killed in an attack by a wild elephant in Digboi forest division on Wednesday morning.

On Wednesday, health minister Rajesh Tope told news agency ANI that no Covid patient had died in the state due to lack of oxygen. “We filed an affidavit to this effect in the court also. We had diverted 100 per cent oxygen meant for industrial use for medical purposes,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.His remarks come after Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut earlier in the day said that the Centre is “lying” about the oxygen shortage, and that a “case should be filed against the government”.“I am speechless. What would have happened to the families of those who lost their loved ones to oxygen shortage after hearing this statement?” Raut told ANI.Interestingly, the Shiv Sena is a part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ruling dispensation in Maharashtra.With Tope’s statements, Maharashtra has joined the wagon of four other states, including Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, which have also denied Covid-19 fatalities owing to oxygen shortage as claimed by the Centre.On Tuesday, Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo told ANI that they’re an “oxygen-surplus state”. “There could have been some issues regarding management, otherwise, there is no death due to lack of oxygen,” he added.However, Deo also blamed the Centre for taking credit for “all good things” and blaming the states for “everything that is bad”.Besides Deo, Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishna, Madhya Pradesh medical education minister Vishwas Sarang, and Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey backed the Centre’s remark of no Covid-19 deaths due to lack of oxygen.On Wednesday, the health minister of Tamil Nadu M Subramaniam emphasised the state government’s take on the oxygen shortage issue. Speaking to ANI, he said, “There were no deaths due to oxygen shortage in Tamil Nadu. The chief minister has worked on a war footing to prevent this."Meanwhile, following attacks by opposition leaders, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra on Wednesday said that the onus was on the states and Union territories (UTs) to report on Covid-19 fatalities due to oxygen shortage, adding that such data wasn’t shared with the Centre.“If the Opposition says the Centre has not put the correct data, then they should ask their own state governments what has gone wrong,” Patra said.He blamed the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led states for not sharing oxygen shortage-related deaths to the Centre. Notably, Chhattisgarh that has backed the Central government on this issue is a Congress-ruled state.Among the opposition leaders, who have slammed the Centre are Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and Delhi deputy chief minister and AAP leader Manish Sisodia.Also Read | Centre lied in Parliament over deaths due to oxygen shortage: SisodiaThese developments come after the newly-appointed Union minister of state for health and family welfare, Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that no deaths “due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states/UTs”. She was responding to a question that several coronavirus patients died on roads and hospitals due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of the virus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-5th-state-to-back-centre-s-claim-of-no-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101626885224822.html

The temple locally known as Swapneswar Mahadev is located by the side of Ghateswar temple in the village and is made of square stone Khandolite stone blocks with no binding or cementing as is seen in most Odisha temples of 11th and 12th century onwards such as Jagannath temple and Konark temple.Dhir said the stone blocks were placed one over other in symmetry to make the temple wall and roof.“No evidence of iron clamps has been seen. The neatly chiselled blocks denote an era when Kalingan traditional temple architectural style was in its infancy. The temple is devoid of any external embellishments on both the inner and outer walls; even the parsadevata niches are empty,” said Dhir, a noted historian.Nayak said the temple is believed to have been built after the post- Gupta era. “The region was a part of the South Toshali area of the ancient Kalinga kingdom and finds mention in the copper plate inscriptions of the post-Gupta period. The Kanasa plates of Sri Lokavigraha and Olasingh plates of Bhanuvardhana, issued in the 6th-7th century throw light on the worship of Maninagesvar (Shiva) and Naga Cult of the South Toshali region. Taking into account the material and style of this temple, it is evident that it was built at least 1300 to 1400 years ago, and is among the oldest intact temples in the region,” he said.Anil Dhir, who had earlier completed the detailed survey of the Prachi Valley and the ancient Jagannath Sadak said similar temples were seen in the Mahendragiri hill ranges of southern Odisha.Dhir said the ancient monument is in a very precarious state and on the verge of collapse. Growth of thick vegetation on the top and the sides has caused severe damage. The thick roots have split the stone blocks and developed wide cracks and the rear wall is dangerously leaning backwards. The sanctum sanctorum gets flooded because of the leaks in the roof. The entire temple may crumble down anytime if proper measures are not taken immediately.Superintendent of Bhubaneswar circle of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Arun Mallick said the agency would soon study the temple for its exact history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6th7th-century-shiva-temple-discovered-in-odisha-claims-intach-101626884621013.html

The cricketer-turned-politician is said to have invited All India Congress Committee member and in-charge of the party’s affair in Punjab, Harish Rawat, to the programme.According to news agency ANI, the invitation sent to Singh, a retired Army Captain has been signed by about 60 Congress legislators. The ruling camp has about 80 MLAs in the state.Earlier in the day, about 60 of the lawmakers, including a number of ministers, turned up at Sidhu’s Amritsar residence in an apparent show of strength amid the ongoing power tussle between the new Congress president and the chief minister. SinghOn Tuesday, the CM’s advisor Raveen Thukral said Singh will not meet Sidhu until the latter publicly apologised for the personal derogatory social media attacks against him. The duo have been at loggerheads ever since the Amritsar (East) MLA attacked the CM over the Guru Granth Sahib desecration cases.Singh had also reportedly written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, expressing his reservations over the appointment of Sidhu as the state unit chief, stating the move could have an "adverse" impact on the party's prospects in the assembly elections which are likely to take place early next year.The central Congress leadership had formed a three-member team, comprising Rawat and senior party leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and JP Aggarwal to resolve the months-long crisis in one of the remaining few states where the grand old party is in power. However, there seems to be no end to the feud at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-invites-captain-to-elevation-event-sends-note-signed-by-60-punjab-mlas-101626881512125.html

21-07-2021||India||‘Not surprised’: Pro-talks ULFA leader Anup Chetia on name in Pegasus list||Leader of pro-talks faction of the banned United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), Anup Chetia, said on Wednesday that he was not surprised to find his name on the list of those under possible phone surveillance using Pegasus spyware in India . One of the founding members of the outfit formed in 1979, 64-year-old Chetia is part of the pro-talks faction of the ULFA, talking with the Centre for the past few years. “As former members of ULFA, we once indulged in anti-India activities. So, I am not surprised that my name has come up in that list. I am sure my phones are being tracked all the time,” said Chetia. As unearthed by a collaborative investigation involving 17 media organisations, and reported by The Wire, which is one of the 17, the phone numbers of Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Patel, opposition leaders Rahul Gandhi and Abhishek Banerjee, activists, and 38 journalists, including three from HT and one from its sister publication Mint, were among thousands of potential targets around the world. The investigation was based on a data leak of around 50,000 numbers obtained by Amnesty International and Paris-based Forbidden Stories, a non-profit.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number on the list does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. Amnesty International subsequently forensically investigated 67 of these phones, and found 23 hacked and 14 showing signs of attempted penetration.While NSO Group, the Israeli firm that makes Pegasus, has maintained that only governments are its clients, India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has called the investigation an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”.The fact that Chetia was still in touch with several leaders of the anti-talks faction of the outfit, ULFA-Independent, of which Paresh Baruah is the commander-in-chief and his stance on several issues including the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which he opposed and even threatened in 2018 to walk out of talks if it was not scrapped, were seen as a possible reasons for his name to figure on the list. “I have not indulged in any anti-national or criminal activities in the past 18 years. Because of my past, it is natural that I could be under surveillance. But I’m not bothered about it,” he said. The Pegasus list also had the name of another prominent leader from Assam, Samujjal Bhattacharya, adviser to the influential All Assam Students Union (AASU). Despite repeated attempts, he couldn’t be reached as his phone was switched off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-surprised-pro-talks-ulfa-leader-anup-chetia-on-name-in-pegasus-list-101626880540847.html

It has directed the state health department to conduct a mass testing campaign for Covid-19 on July 23 (Friday) in districts where the seven-day average of positivity rate is more than 10%.“The Health and Family Welfare Department is directed to conduct a mass testing campaign on Friday, 23rd July 2021 with a target of 3 lakh tests across Kerala with special focus on Districts where the seven-day average TPR is above 10%. Further, the number of daily tests shall also be enhanced urgently to the peak testing capacity for the effective containment of the pandemic,” the order said.Also read | Zika virus disease: 3 more test positive in Kerala as tally goes past 40, says health minister Veena GeorgePreviously, the state government on July 16 had relaxed the Covid-19 restrictions in Kerala for three days from July 18 to July 20 on account of Bakri Eid celebrations on July 21.Shops selling textiles, footwear, jewellery, home appliances, electronic items, fancy stores and repair shops were allowed to function between 7am and 8pm on the three days.Following this, the Supreme Court said that the easing of curfews in the state for three days owing to the Bakri Eid celebrations was “wholly uncalled for.” The top court also said that the government giving in to pressure from traders disclosed a “sorry state of affairs.”The court had also urged the Kerala government to heed to the Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and follow the law laid down in its July 16 order passed in the matter of Kanwar Yatra in Uttar Pradesh, where the court had noted that all sentiments are subservient to the Right to Life.Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association had urged the Kerala government to reconsider its order on relaxing the restrictions. The medical body’s president Dr JA Jayalal said that the way in which the lockdown was implemented was “controversial.”“The way in which they adopted the lockdown is very controversial. They are giving intermittent lockdowns for two days,” news agency ANI quoted him as saying.“We are definitely not saying that the entire lockdown has to be enforced. But if a policy of two days of lockdown is undertaken and the rest of the days are free, a rush is natural. Instead of that, you can evenly distribute it and ensure people are wearing the mask,” he further added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-imposes-complete-lockdown-on-july-24-25-mass-covid-19-testing-planned-at-districts-with-high-positivity-rate-101626876894804.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for July 21 and 22 in Mumbai, with extremely heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places.The severe weather conditions have been fatal for more than 30 people in the Maharashtra capital, after rain triggered landslides, led to collapsed houses and even electrocutions. The suburban train services in Mumbai were also disrupted, and several long-distance trains were diverted, short-terminated or rescheduled for waterlogging and flooding.A meteorologist at the regional centre of the IMD Mumbai said the rainfall is the result of “very strong westerly winds bringing in moisture” from an active monsoon trough running along coastal Maharashtra. On Wednesday, Mumbai gauged 23.9mm of rain till 8.30am, down from 38.4mm recorded in the previous 24 hours.The situation in Delhi wasn’t much better either with at least 20 underpasses getting inundated following incessant rains in the city on Monday and Tuesday, Delhi traffic police officials said.However, IMD in its evening bulletin on Wednesday, mentioned that rainfall activity over northwest India is likely to reduce further from Thursday onwards. The department had earlier said that widespread and heavy rain over northwest India will likely begin to reduce from Wednesday onwards.The bulletin added that a cyclonic circulation lies over northwest Bay of Bengal, and under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to form over the water body during the next 48 hours. “It is likely to move west-northwestwards along the monsoon trough during the subsequent two to three days,” the IMD bulletin further stated.Here are the key IMD alerts for Mumbai and other states and Union territories (UTs):1. Extremely heavy to very heavy rain is very likely over Mumbai till July 23. The IMD has issued a red alert for the city for today and tomorrow. The intensity of rainfall, however, is likely to reduce from July 24 onwards.2. Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy showers are very likely to continue over west coast and adjoining regions, and Gujarat during the next four to five days. Extremely heavy falls are also very likely over Konkan, Goa and ghat areas of central Maharashtra on July 21 and 22.3. Light to moderate rainfall is very likely at scattered places over Delhi in the next 24 hours.4. Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is very likely over western Himalayan region, including Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, and adjoining northwest Indian states of Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh today. Although the rainfall intensity has been predicted to reduce further from July 22 onwards, it is likely to pick up again from July 25.5. Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls is likely over east India and adjoining central India between July 21 and 24. Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is also very likely over Telangana and coastal Andhra Pradesh on July 21 and 22. The same weather event is also very likely over Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, and east Madhya Pradesh on July 22.6. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar will likely observe moderate to severe thunderstorms with lightning during the next 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lowpressure-in-bay-of-bengal-to-bring-rain-in-these-states-till-july-25-imd-101626875362080.html

Stating that there will be a collective leadership, Shivakumar said he only had political differences with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal- Secular (JD-S).Shivakumar’s statement came a day after Congress leader and former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah, both of whom are in Delhi, denied speculation of any difference with the former. "We are together. We are building the party together... there's no rift in Karnataka Congress," he had said.When asked about his meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Shivakumar said talks were held about the party’s stand on the current political crisis in Karnataka BJP over the leadership issue. “There is a lot of trouble in Karnataka BJP. There will be a change of leadership. We had to plan our stand. A lot of people are trying to approach us and a lot of issues are there. We discussed all those issues as well as phone tapping,” Shivakumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, Shivakumar had said the Congress party’s ethos is to work together. “We are a national party. We believe in collective leadership. Even the elections will be contested this way. There are questions, but one or two individuals are not important. There are several leaders in the Congress, and we will go to the election together.”Even as the party continues to sit in opposition ever since the BS Yediyurappa-led BJP overthrew a coalition government of the JD-S and Congress in July 2019, supporters of both Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah have been openly backing them as the Congress’ chief ministerial candidate for the next election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/collective-leadership-no-cm-candidate-in-karnataka-congress-dk-shivakumar-101626875186485.html

The court has twice deferred its verdict in the case.On June 24, the high court had granted interim protection to Maheshwari, a resident of Bengaluru, and directed against any coercive action towards him. The UP Police challenged this order in the Supreme Court on June 29. In anticipation of the move, Maheshwari had filed a caveat in the top court a day before, urging it to hear his representation as well.He had earlier informed the Karnataka high court that he is ready to appear before the UP Police, only if he is assured that he would not be arrested.

People speculate that future waves may affect children more as most of the adults will be vaccinated in the next few months while we do not have any approved vaccine for children at this point," Dr Kumar said, advising the people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour at their home and limit their social engagements to reduce the chance of contracting the infection and passing them on children.Speaking on the impact of Covid-19 on children, Dr Kumar said that the pandemic can have a severe effect on children’s mental and physical health owing to factors such as confinement at home, illnesses in the family and stress from job loss for parents or financial insecurity."Children may express psychological distress (sadness) by acting out differently as each child behaves differently. Some may become silent while others may express anger and hyperactivity," Dr Kumar said."Though we don’t know how the virus is going to behave and affect children in the future, we need to protect our children from the contagion," he added.The leading paediatrician said that caregivers should show patience with children and make an attempt at understanding their emotions. He suggested watching out for signs of psychological changes in children."Look for signs of stress in young children, which could be excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. Families also need to support children to cope with stress and also allay their anxiety," he said.Dr Kumar said the vaccine available for pregnant women and lactating mothers "will give a certain degree of protection to the growing foetus and newborn against the deadly infection."The child health expert said that the deadly second wave of Covid-19 has affected children equally."Covid-19 is a new virus and it affects all age groups because we do not have natural immunity against this virus," he said, pointing at data from the National Centre for Disease Control / Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme dashboard which showed approximately 12% of the Covid-19 infection was contributed by patients less than 20 years of age.Recent surveys have shown similar seropositivity in children and adults. "However, due to a larger number of people getting affected during the second wave of the pandemic, the number of infected children was more as compared to the first wave. However, the mortality rate in children so far is lower as compared to adults and is usually seen in children with comorbidities," Dr Kumar said.The doctor, however, cautioned against a new syndrome seen among infants as well as adolescents, called the multisystem inflammatory syndrome. He said three types of clinical course have been observed — persistent fever with raised inflammatory parameters, classical Kawasaki disease-like presentation and shock, left ventricular dysfunction with the inotropic requirement.He said most patients report it two-to-six weeks after the peak of Covid-­19 infections in the affected population."For establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, advanced investigations are required. All suspected cases should be referred and managed in a tertiary care hospital with HDU/ICU facility. If identified early, all these cases can be treated," Dr Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/severity-of-future-covid-19-waves-on-kids-speculatory-says-top-paediatrician-101626866462574.html
21-07-2021||India||Oust BJP, Mamata Banerjee tells regional parties on TMC’s martyr’s day||Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the alleged use of the Israeli software Pegasus for snooping on politicians, activists and journalists and made on open appeal to Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar to put together an opposition front to defeat the BJP in 2024 national elections.She also urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance into the allegations that the Central government could have used the Pegasus software to hack phones of prominent political opponents and critics. She suggested that the apex court should form a special investigation team in the matter.“I definitely know that my phone was tapped…Only judiciary can save democracy. Oust spying and save the nation,” Banerjee said during an hour-long virtual address on the TMC’s martyrs’ day, the big annual event held in the memory of 13 youth Congress workers killed in police firing in Kolkata on July 21, 1993.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah became the prime targets in her speech.“Pegasus is bigger than Watergate,” said the Bengal chief minister, referring to the Watergate scandal that rocked the US government and led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974.Like last year, Banerjee addressed people virtually due to the Covid pandemic but for the first time, giant screens were installed in public places and TMC offices not only in Bengal but also in states such as Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Tripura. Banerjee spoke in Bengali, English and Hindi to reach out to her audience.In Delhi, leaders of regional parties assembled at the Constitution Club of India to listen to the speech.“I will be in Delhi from July 27 to 29. I urge Sharad Pawar Ji (the Nationalist Congress Party chief) to hold a meeting. Mr Prime Minister please don’t disturb us,” said Banerjee.“I don’t know what will happen in 2024 but we have to start our planning now… We will not be defeated. I am confident we will win,” she said, indicating that the TMC is keen to form an alliance against the BJP in the next Lok Sabha polls. After her party’s thumping victory against the BJP in the Bengal assembly elections, Mamata Banerjee’s party is looking to expand its base and forge an opposition alliance to challenge the saffron party nationally.“Only two and a half years are left until the elections. Let us form an alliance and show the path to the nation. I am a worker. I will follow you and your instructions. Chairs do not last forever but love of the people lives on,” said Banerjee.“If our front comes to power we will give free ration to the entire country,” said Banerjee referring in great detail to the rationing system and other welfare schemes implemented by her in Bengal.“I cannot call up Sharad Pawar Ji, P Chidambaram, the Delhi chief minister or the Odisha chief minister because my phone is tapped. See I have put a plaster on the camera of my phone. Instead of a democratic state you (BJP) want to have a surveillance state,” said Banerjee. She held up her mobile phone which had a brown tape pasted on the backside.“Before the assembly polls, I was in a meeting with our party leaders. My phone was there. They recorded everything,” she said.“Modi Ji I am not criticising you as a person but you and Amit Shah Ji have only come up with dark laws. You only want violence and disturbance. India is the land of Swami Vivekananda, Nehru, A P J Abdul Kalam and Bhagat Singh. India needs development and integrity. But all we can see is despair and instability,” said Banerjee.“Mohabbat kaam se hota hai, maan ki baat bolne se nahi (you can spread love through your work, not by speaking your mind),” said Banerjee, referring to the Prime Minister’s monthly radio show ‘Maan Ki Baat’ through which he addresses the nation.“We have to build up agitation across the nation against rising prices of diesel, petrol and LPG,” said the Bengal chief minister.The BJP Bengal unit countered Banerjee by paying homage to its workers killed in political violence.Claiming that 124 BJP workers have been killed since the 2008 panchayat polls, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh held a peaceful agitation at Rajghat in New Delhi while party workers held programmes in Bengal’s districts and Kolkata.“Mamata Banerjee’s government uses Pegasus to snoop on people and opposition leaders. She has a better idea about the technology,” Ghosh said in Delhi.Mamata Banerjee was a Youth Congress leader in 1993 and led an agitation on July 21 against the then Left Front government in the state. Over the years, the martyr’s day rally has emerged as a symbol of the TMC’s struggle since its birth in 1998 and serves as a platform from which Banerjee sends out messages and declares future plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oust-bjp-mamata-banerjee-tells-regional-parties-on-tmc-s-martyr-s-day-101626869260142.html

21-07-2021||India||Pegasus project: Surveillance, phone tapping debates in Parliament over yrs||Opposition lawmakers on Tuesday disrupted Parliament proceedings and demanded urgent debates over the alleged targeting by Israeli spyware Pegasus of politicians, journalists, and constitutional authorities. Issues such as surveillance and phone tapping have been raised in Parliament earlier as well. In responses to parliamentary questions over alleged illegal phone tapping, the governments including the present one, have maintained that there have only been lawful interceptions.The current government has since 2014 repeatedly cited Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, saying it allows for interception “in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with the foreign States, or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offense.”In response to Asaduddin Owaisi’s question on alleged unlawful surveillance in 2019, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the then electronics and information technology minister, told Lok Sabha that the allegations were part of attempts “to malign the government”. Prasad dismissed the allegations as “completely misleading”.In February 2021, Lok Sabha member Maneka Gandhi asked the government whether it had found the presence of Pegasus spyware in the country or has it launched an investigation into the use or sale of any spyware on surveillance in the country. Sanjay Dhotre, the then minister of state for electronics and information technology responded by saying there is no such information available with the government.Rajya Sabha member Ravi Prakash Sharma in November 2019 sought to know the number of cases of phone tapping authorised in 2018 and 2019 and the steps taken to check unauthorised and illegal phone tapping. In response, then minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy gave no details about authorised phone tapping. He insisted no illegal tapping has taken place. Thus “no question arises” about steps the government has to take to check unauthorised and illegal phone tapping, he added.In 2015, Parliament member Vishnu Dayal Ram asked the government about the strength of the surveillance agencies. He also sought details of specific organisations of government engaged in surveillance.Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, the then minister of state for home affairs, responded saying the assessment of the strength of security and intelligence agencies in the country is a continuous process. He refused to name such agencies of surveillance. Chaudhary said that details in this regard cannot be disclosed in the interest of national security.In July 2015, the government told Parliament that “the present regime appears to be adequate and currently there is no proposal to bring out any new regulatory framework for lawful interception.”Following the 2019 WhatsApp breach using Pegasus, the government told Parliament that it is working on the Personal Data Protection Bill to safeguard the privacy of citizens. The bill was tabled in Lok Sabha in December 2019 and was later referred to a parliamentary panel for a review.In March 2015, the government said it intercepts calls “in unavoidable circumstances”. It added for this, the order may be issued by an officer, not below the rank of joint secretary, who has been duly authorised by the Union home secretary. The government said a provision that in remote areas or for operational reasons, where obtaining of prior direction for interception of message or class of messages is not feasible, the required interception of any message shall be carried out with the approval of the head or second officer of the authorised security agency at the central level and at least inspector general of police at the state level.The government added on average, 5,000 interception orders per month are issued by the Union home secretary on the requests by law enforcement agencies.Trinamool Congress lawmaker Derek O’Brien said his party will not allow Parliament to run until the government holds an open discussion on Pegasus. “The government tries to do politics with Covid. We do not want discussion on farmers. Repeal farm laws and tomorrow discuss Pegasus or TMC’s position is that there will be no more Parliament (proceedings) till August 13.”Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor said if the government has been engaged in snooping, it needs to give an explanation. “If they say, they have not done it, then it is a more serious national security concern as some other governments might have done it since NSO (whose spyware Pegasus enables the remote surveillance of smartphones) only caters to vetted governments.”Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut has sought a joint parliamentary probe on the issue.The government has again maintained the country has well-established processes to check unauthorised surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-project-surveillance-phone-tapping-discussions-in-parliament-over-yrs-101626865959862.html

The Tamil Nadu government is planning to extend the facility to all the temple elephants in the state.Parvati had recently contracted cataract in one of her eyes. After Parvati's condition was reported, Hindu Religion and Charitable Endowment minister P Sekar Babu and local ministers P Moorthy and Palanivel Thiagarajan visited the temple along with experts from Tamil Nadu University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences and diagnosed the condition of Parvati’s eyes.The 24-year-old pachyderm contracted eye disease due to dehydration, veterinarian said. The prolonged treatment by the experts is helping the pachyderm and the cataract is disappearing fast.Dedicated to goddess Meenakshi and her consort Sundareshwar, the temple is one of the oldest and most beautiful temples in Tamil Nadu. Spread over 14 acres in the heart of Madurai city, the temple is paved with granite stones.A few years ago, a portion of this granite floor was removed and paved with mud to provide comfort to the elephant. The mud floor is comfortable for the elephant to walk around, according to the temple management. Finding the mud floor helpful to elephants, the temple authorities have decided to extend this mud flooring in the stable.The temple management has also decided to float tenders for repairing Veeravasantha Rayar Hall damaged by the fire in 2018. The granite stones for repair works are stored in the temple farm at Senkulam. Once the tenders are finalized, the hall renovation work will start, temple authorities said.After the state government was informed about the temple management decision to extend mud flooring for elephant Parvati, the state government is now contemplating on extending this facility for all the temple elephants in the state. The decision will be placed at the state assembly shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madurai-meenakshi-temple-elephant-to-get-additional-mud-flooring-in-stable-101626862574547.html
21-07-2021||India||After Centre, these states also claim no deaths reported due to oxygen shortage||Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo has said that his state has a surplus of oxygen and no deaths were reported in the state due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Deo made the remarks on Tuesday, after the Centre informed the Rajya Sabha that no deaths due to lack of oxygen has been specifically reported by states/Union territories.Also Read: Centre lied in Parliament over deaths due to oxygen shortage, says Sisodia"It is true that no patient died due to the lack of oxygen in Chhattisgarh. Our state is an oxygen-surplus state. There could have been some issues regarding management, otherwise, there is no death due to lack of oxygen," Deo told news agency ANI.He further accused the Centre of taking credit for all goods things and blaming the states for all bad things."At least they (Central government) admitted that health is a state subject. Otherwise, it appeared as if they are taking everything under their control. They take credit for all goods things and blame states for everything that is bad," said Deo.Apart from Deo, Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishna also said on Tuesday that the state government ensured adequate availability of oxygen in both government and private hospitals and there was no death due to lack of the life-saving gas.He further mentioned that a dedicated team looked after the state's oxygen supplies.Madhya Pradesh and Bihar too have accepted the fact that no deaths were reported due to shortage of oxygen."No deaths took place due to lack of oxygen in our state. Union health minister stated the same in Rajya Sabha.

"We received the Centre's support and oxygen allocation was increased. We facilitated oxygen in all hospitals," Pandey told ANI.He also attacked the Congress party, saying it doesn't want to help people. and only raises issues in Parliament.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday accused the opposition-ruled states of doing politics on the issue while earlier admitting that there was no death due to shortage of oxygen.BJP leader Sambit Patra noted that a Delhi government committee had told high court that there was no evidence to suggest that around 21 people had died due to shortage of oxygen in Jaipur Golden hospital on April 23-24 night after the hospital management reported the matter.

He submitted the reply as a written response to a question by Congress MP KC Venugopal about the subject.👉एंपावर्ड ग्रुप और संसदीय समिति की सलाह को नजरंदाज कर ऑक्सीजन उपलब्ध कराने का कोई इंतजाम नहीं किया👉अस्पतालों में ऑक्सीजन प्लांट लगाने में कोई सक्रियता नहीं दिखाई 2/2Quoting the Centre’s reply, Vadra tweeted in Hindi, “The deaths happened because - In the pandemic year, the government increased oxygen exports by 700 per cent. The government did not make arrangements for tankers transporting oxygen.”She further said that the government also ignored the advice of the empowered group and the parliamentary committee and no arrangement was made to provide medical oxygen.“Ignoring the advice of the Empowered Group and the Parliamentary Committee, no arrangement was made to provide oxygen. No activity was seen in setting up oxygen plants in hospitals,” she said in a subsequent tweet.Also read | States, UTs did not report deaths due to oxygen shortage: BJPIn his written reply, MoS Dr Pawar also told Parliament that health is a state subject and all states and UTs in India report the number of Covid-19 infections, deaths to the Union health ministry.Following this, Congress’ KC Venugopal, who raised the question initially, said that the minister had misled the house. “I am totally surprised.

Sex-reassignment op to blame?||Weeks after complaining about a sex-reassignment surgery gone wrong, the first transgender candidate from Kerala to file nomination in the recently held Assembly election, Anannyah Kumari Alex, allegedly killed herself on Tuesday. Alex, who was also the first from her community to become a radio jockey, was found hanging in her flat in Kochi.Health Minister Veena George ordered a probe into the death. “A transgender organisation had also given complaint regarding this. An expert committee will be formed to study issues related with sex reassignment surgery,” George was quoted as saying by The News Minute.Alex had once said if transgenders join the mainstream, then definitely there will be colourful changes in society. She was reportedly working as a make-up artist and a freelance fashion stylist.Alex had recently raised allegations of medical negligence against a doctor and a private hospital and sought justice on the matter. She said she was facing serious health issues ever since she underwent a sex-reassignment surgery she underwent in June last year. She alleged that she was unable to work due to severe physical pain even after a year of the surgery.“I’m a victim of gross medical negligence. My private part looks like a piece of meat, it has no resemblance to a vagina. I want to conduct a resurgery, I want justice,” she was quoted as saying in an article by The News Minute.She said she had been experiencing severe pain in the vaginal area and could not bear to even stand for a long time or sit. “Even when I stand for a longer time, sneeze, laugh or even brush my teeth, I have severe discomforts. I have also been experiencing breathing difficulties,” she said.Earlier, Alex was in the news after she filed her nomination as an Assembly election candidate in the Vengara constituency of Malappuram district. She had set to contest against Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader PK Kunjalikutty as a Democratic Social Justice Party (DSJP) nominee. However, she suspended her campaign a day before polling, alleging that she was being harassed and received death threats from leaders of her own party. As she could not withdraw her nomination at the time, she urged voters to not extend their support to the DSJP.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-first-transgender-poll-nominee-ends-life-sex-reassignment-op-to-blame-101626860510532.html

In June, the central bank raised the interchange fee from ₹15 to ₹17, while for non-financial transactions the fee has been raised from ₹5 to ₹6.The fee is charged by banks to merchants processing payments through credit card or debit cards. As per the revised rules, the customers will be eligible for five free transactions every month from their home bank ATMs.Customers can claim free transactions from ATMs of other banks, too, which include three withdrawals in metros and five in non-metro cities.The changes were announced on the basis of the suggestions of a committee set up by the RBI in June 2019. It was set up under the chairmanship of the chief executive of the Indian Banks’ Association to review the entire gamut of ATM charges and fees with a particular focus on interchange structure for ATM transactions.The central bank had said these charges were allowed to be hiked owing to the increasing cost of ATM deployment and expenses towards the maintenance of ATM that banks incur. News agency PTI reported that as of March 31, there are 115,605 onsite ATMs and 97,970 off-site teller machines in the country and around 900 million debit cards issued by different banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atm-cash-withdrawal-fee-to-pinch-more-from-august-1-101626860291634.html

Hence, she approached the high court on Tuesday with an urgent plea, he said.The HC said "the ad interim relief is granted in an extraordinary urgent situation before the court and the same shall be subject to the outcome of the petition".The court also issued notices to the state government and the hospital's director, and sought their response on July 23.The petitioner approached the court, saying her Covid-19-infected husband was suffering from multi-organ failure and was on life support system, and according to doctors, he has slim chances of survival, Patel said.The HC directed the petitioner and the assistant government pleader to communicate its order to the hospital for collection of the patient's sample, looking at the criticality of the situation when his health condition is said to be deteriorating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-hc-orders-collection-of-critical-covid-patient-s-sample-as-wife-wants-child-101626858737099.html
21-07-2021||India||Centre lied in Parliament over deaths due to oxygen shortage: Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday accused the Central government of “lying” in Parliament that no deaths were caused due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Addressing a digital press conference, Sisodia said there was “utter mismanagement” of oxygen supply during the second wave in the country and blamed the Centre’s policies for the “disaster” that unfolded in the country. “The Centre blatantly and shamelessly lied to the Parliament on Tuesday. There was a genuine oxygen crisis across the country between April 15 and May 10. During this period, there was utter oxygen mismanagement by the Centre because of which, there was chaos in hospitals. The Centre is now lying to hide its mistakes. It changed its oxygen distribution policy after April 13 which led to a total disaster. The Centre will have to take responsibility for this,” said Sisodia. “Today, to reinforce that lie, BJP spokespersons held a press conference and bashed non-BJP state governments, including that of Arvind Kejriwal [Delhi]. This has been etched in the history now that when the country was battling a brutal second wave of Covid-19, the Centre, because of its foolish policies, pushed the country into a full blown oxygen crisis… Why is Prime Minister Modi lying?” he said. Also Read | Delhi minister hits out at Centre’s ‘no deaths due to oxygen shortage’ remarkBJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Wednesday said the Delhi government itself submitted an affidavit in the court claiming none of the 20 Covid-19 deaths that happened in Jaipur Golden hospital between April 23-24 in the national Capital were caused due to oxygen shortage. Responding to this, Sisodia said, “We are saying this to the court that the Centre is not allowing us to make a committee which is to investigate all such deaths... If you ask us today, we have no data of deaths that happened due to oxygen shortage. We will be able to get such a number only if the Centre allows us to form the committee.”Delhi endured a punishing fourth wave of Covid-19 infections between April and May that left the health infrastructure overrun, medical workers overwhelmed, and led to crematoriums running out of space. Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, while over 13,000 died of the infection between April and May alone. Cases in the city began to peter out towards the middle of May on the back of a lockdown, which the state government imposed from April 19. The situation worsened with the city reeling under an acute shortage of oxygen.The deputy chief minister alleged that the Centre “troubled” non-BJP-ruled states by allocating them oxygen from distant places. “When CM Kejriwal took responsibility and admitted that people indeed died due to oxygen shortage, the Centre stepped back. Kejriwal had ordered the constitution of a special committee which was to investigate every Covid-19 death due to oxygen shortage in Delhi, fix responsibility for the lapses, and give compensation to such families. But, the Centre, through the L-G, did not allow us to make this committee. They just want to hide real facts. If you (Centre) have the courage to face the truth, then allow Kejriwal to form this committee and conduct an independent inquiry into each death caused due to oxygen shortage,” Sisodia said. In a writtten statement in Parliament, the Central on Tuesday said no deaths specifically due to lack of oxygen were reported by states and Union territories during the second Covid-19 wave. Responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen during the second wave, minister of state (health), Bharati Pravin Pawar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha ,“Due to unprecedented surge in demand of medical oxygen during the second wave -- the demand in the country peaked to nearly 9,000 MT as compared to 3,095 MT during the first wave -- the Central government had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution to the states.”“Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union health ministry to all states and UTs... Accordingly, all states and UTs report cases and deaths to the Union health ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by States/UTs,” stated Pawar’s reply. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said, “If there was no shortage of oxygen, why did hospitals move court? Hospitals and the media were flagging oxygen shortage issues daily. Television channels showed how hospitals were running out of the life-saving gas. It is completely false to say that no one died due to oxygen shortage. There have been many deaths due to oxygen shortage in Delhi and many other places across the country.”The country has been coming out of a deadly second wave of the outbreak which overwhelmed the medical infrastructure to the point of a breakdown. At its peak of second wave, India recorded 414,188 infections in a span of 24 hours on May 6. The cases have receded gradually since, and India recorded its lowest daily spike in 125 days at 30,093 infections on Tuesday. But on Wednesday, it recorded 42,015 fresh cases of coronavirus infections, taking the cumulative tally past 31,216,337, data from the Union ministry of health and family welfare showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-lied-in-parliament-over-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortagesisodia-101626856659184.html

The health ministry dashboard on Wednesday showed India's daily Covid-19 toll as 3,998, which is a massive jump from Tuesday's 374 deaths. Not only Tuesday, but India's daily Covid-19 toll has also now come down to hundreds from thousands.The rise in the number of daily cases on Wednesday also owes to Maharashtra's 14th Covid data reconciliation. India on Tuesday recorded 30,093 fresh cases, the lowest in 125 days. Within 24 hours, the tally jumped to 42,015.After the 14th reconciliation, Maharashtra's positive case tally has increased by 2,479, while the toll has increased by 3,509.India's overall Covid-19 situation is improving while the country now stands at the crucial juncture between the receding second wave and a possible third wave. Most of the states are seeing a steady decline in the number of daily cases and daily tolls. But Maharashtra, Kerala and the northeastern states are still not out of danger.Amid the apprehension of a possible third wave of the pandemic, any sudden change in India's daily Covid-19 graph draws scrutiny. Wednesday's rise in the number of cases and deaths is however a backlog and not a 24-hour spurt. Maharashtra too has not seen any unnatural increase in infection or death in the last 24 hours. It is not clearly known when the deaths that the state government reconciled on Tuesday took place.What is data reconciliation?Adding backlog data to the state's tally is known as the process of data reconciliation. This may happen if some cases, deaths remain undocumented when they took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-reconciles-over-3-000-covid-deaths-pushing-india-s-daily-toll-to-3998-101626845777446.html

This comes a day after the Himalayan state, which shares its borders with Darjeeling, reported at least 97 cases of the Delta variant. “Darjeeling registered 79 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, which was the second highest number of fresh cases in West Bengal. North 24 Parganas recorded 82 cases, the highest in the state. Kolkata registered 60 cases,” said an official of the state government.

The neighbouring Kalimpong district in north Bengal, which also shares borders with Sikkim, is also likely to follow suit, officials said. As Sikkim depends on Siliguri, the biggest town in North Bengal, for almost everything, the order has come as a major inconvenience for the people of the neighbouring state. “One of the major reasons behind the high number of Covid-19 cases in Darjeeling is the presence of a large trading hub like Siliguri. Kalimpong, which is also a hilly district, recorded just 16 fresh cases on the same day,” said an official. With Sikkim reporting prevalence of the Delta variant of coronavirus, state health minister MK Sharma said, “Delta variant was found in 97 of the 98 random samples sent for genome sequencing at Kalyani in West Bengal. The samples were sent on June 23 and we were informed about it via email on Monday.” Sikkim has been reporting a large number of daily Covid cases for the past three months even as the fatality rate is only 0.59%. Sikkim was one of the few states in the country to report Covid cases very late last year. So far, it has reported 325 Covid deaths. The state with 700,000 population has so far reported 23,796 Covid cases while the number of active cases is 2,462.

21-07-2021||India||'Travel only if fully vaccinated': Govt's 7-point advisory after 4th serosurvey||Around 67.6 per cent of Indians now have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2 either through infection or through vaccination, the government's fourth serosurvey results have revealed. While this means that more than half of the population is immune as of now -- amid the apprehension of a third wave -- the ministry has issued a warning regarding travelling and said one should not undertake travelling at this time without being fully vaccinated.Here is the Centre's 7-point advisory:1. No room for complacency: The finding of the fourth serosurvey offers a ray of hope, but there is no room for complacency as a large chunk of the population, 32%, is still vulnerable.2. Not a statement on district-wise situation: The government said that the local- or district-level situation might be different from the overall situation as national serosurvey is only a bird's eye view of the overall immunity situation of the country.3. State-level action needed: States must continue local serosurvey to find out the percentage of population immune against Covid so that state-level action can be taken up.4. Future waves of infection possible: The Union health ministry said that the findings of the serosurvey indicate that future waves of infection are possible because some states have reported higher immunity against Covid, while some are in the lower rung. States which in the serosurvey reported lower immunity are naturally at a higher risk of future waves.5. No non-essential travels: Since the first week of July, as states are relaxing their restrictions, mobility has gone up not only in tourist spots but also in local markets. Prodded by the government, states have again brought back some restrictions. The government on Tuesday said non-essential travels should be discouraged.6. Congregations be avoided: Though many states have relaxed public gathering norms, given the situation, societal, public religious and political congregations must be avoided, the government said. Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi government have recently cancelled Kanwar Yatra.7. Travel only if fully vaccinated: Stressing on full vaccination, which is the complete course of two vaccine doses to be taken in a recommended gap, the government said travelling should be undertaken only if the individual is fully vaccinated.In the wake of uncontrolled crowding and the Covid-19 situation plateauing in some areas, some states have again mandated negative RT-PCR test report for entry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travel-only-if-fully-vaccinated-govt-s-7-point-advisory-after-4th-serosurvey-101626829889408.html

The explosives left two personnel injured. Drones have since been repeatedly spotted hovering over military installations in the region.Singh also pointed out that, in the past, drones from across the border have been used to drop currency, arms and ammunition inside Indian territory. “Picking up this kind of a target has added a new dimension to our security threats from terrorists. We have taken countermeasures. Certain additional technologies have been deployed along the border. We are trying to take extra precaution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-dgp-hints-at-pak-ordnance-factory-role-in-iaf-base-attack-101626828230718.html

The 45-year-old has been accused of streaming a mobile phone application called Hotshots app streaming pornographic content shot in Mumbai and surrounding areas. So far, Mumbai police have not found any active role of Shilpa Shetty in the case. "We have not been able to any find any active role (of Shilpa Shetty) yet. We are investigating. We will appeal to the victims to come forward and contact the Crime Branch Mumbai and we'll take appropriate action," joint commissioner of police (Crime), Milind Bharambe said.Timeline of the case> In February 2019, Raj Kundra started a company named Arms Prime Media Pvt Ltd.> Six months later, the company developed a mobile phone application called Hotshot, which has been named by police as the porn streaming app.> The app was then sold to Kenrin Ltd., a London-based entity owned by Kundra’s relative Pardeep Bakshi for $25,000.> In December 2019, Kundra resigned from Arms Prime Media. but Kundra used to control the entire operation of the app through three WhatsApp groups.> The Hotshots app was taken down by Apple App Store in June 2020 and Google Play Store removed the app in November 2020. In both cases, the reason was the content.> In February 2021, Mumbai Police registered a case after a woman approached the police and complained that she was forced to do a porn film.> Subsequently, two more cases were registered and the property cell of the Mumbai crime branch made several arrests in connection with the case.What is Hotshots?The mobile application at the centre of the racket is a paid streaming application, which is no longer available. According to the description, the app offers exclusive and original short films, hot photos and videos of some of the "hottest celebrities from all over the world". The content is marked as 18+.Investigation so far has revealed that Raj Kundra's Viaan Industries had an agreement with UK-based Kenrin, owned by Kundra's brother-in-law, about the responsibility of content creation for the app. Though the UK-based company was the front of the entire operation, the shooting used to be done by Kundra's company while the subscription money used to come in the name of Kenrin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-kundra-s-porn-app-case-no-active-role-of-shilpa-shetty-found-yet-say-cops-101626826566037.html
21-07-2021||India||Will the OPEC deal bring petrol, diesel prices down?||On July 18, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reached an agreement to increase its crude production by 400,000 barrels per day on a monthly basis till the halted output is fully restored. OPEC is a cartel of 13 countries which produce 29% of the total crude oil in the world. Brent crude prices have fallen sharply after the announcement. Brent Crude closed at $68.62 per barrel on July 19, 6.75% lower than $73.59 on July 16.As of July 20, 2021, petrol and diesel prices did not increase for four consecutive days. This was the longest period without a price increase since May 3. Petrol and diesel prices changed only twice during the March 27-May 3 period, when assembly elections in Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were being held.Will the OPEC deal lead to a fall in petrol and diesel prices in India?Here are four charts that explain this.Brent crude was falling even before the OPEC dealBrent crude reached $78.34 per barrel on July 2, 2021. This was the highest price since October 23,2018. It has fallen gradually since then, gained momentum once again and then fallen sharply after the OPEC deal to reach $68.62 per barrel on July 19. An agreement among OPEC members to boost production is not the only factor behind the softening of crude oil prices. A renewed surge in Covid-19 cases in advanced countries and the possibility of re-imposition of restrictions or fall in demand is also a cause. “Oil has run into stiff headwinds in July after rising in seven of the past eight months as the global economy rebounded from the pandemic. The salvaged OPEC+ deal has removed a layer of uncertainty for the market, but the latest Covid-19 resurgence is a reminder that the recovery will be bumpy”, a Bloomberg report said.Crude production will not reach pre-pandemic levels even after OPEC dealData from OPEC’s monthly oil market report shows that world’s total oil production in the quarter ending June 2021 was 88.62 million barrels per day (mbpd). While this is marginally higher than the 86.64 mbpd in the quarter ending June 2020, it is significantly lower than the 93.9 and 91 mbpd produced in the quarters ending June 2019 and June 2018. OPEC’s own production cuts have played a significant role in global production being lower than pre-pandemic levels than that of non-OPEC members.Will fuel prices in India fall significantly?Even though crude oil prices have fallen significantly between July 2 and 19; from $ 78.34 to $ 68.62, petrol-diesel prices have not come down significantly in India. In fact they have only gone up except in the last four days. The price of petrol and diesel was ₹99.16 and 89.18 per litre in Delhi on July 2, 2021. This had increased to ₹101.84 and 89.87 per litre on July 20, 2021.Is the government; to be sure, government-owned oil companies, not passing on the benefits of fall in crude price to the consumers? There are two factors worth highlighting here. Brent crude prices do not represent the price of crude oil imports to India. The petroleum ministry releases what is called the price of Crude Oil Basket (COB) for India. On July 19, 2021, India’s COB was $71.2 per barrel, $2.58 more than the $68.62 at which Brent was priced. Then there is also the question of the role of the rupee dollar exchange rate. The average rupee-dollar exchange rate was ₹73.27 per dollar in May 2021. This had fallen to ₹74.79 per dollar on July 19, 2021. This means that exchange rate dynamics have neutralised the price of gains from softening of international crude oil prices to some extent.﻿Tax cuts hold the key to any significant relief in pricesWhile petrol-diesel prices could ease significantly if crude prices crash from where they are now, it needs to be underlined that tax burden is a major reason for the current level of high petrol-diesel prices in India. Petrol-diesel prices had not reached their current levels even when crude oil prices had crossed the $100 per barrel mark between Feb 2011 and Sep 2014. The total tax component in petrol and diesel prices per litre had increased from ₹37.77 in April 2020 to ₹56.33 in July 2021 for petrol and from ₹28.02 to ₹44.94 for diesel in Delhi.The government in its reply to a parliament question on July 19 said that Rs1,01,564 lakh crores have been collected through union excise duty between April and June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-the-opec-deal-bring-petrol-diesel-prices-down-101626812617019.html
21-07-2021||India||The 1991 Budget, in hindsight||On July 24, 1991, Manmohan Singh presented the first Budget of the PV Narsimha Rao government, a Budget that would change the face of the Indian economy. While the intellectual argument for reforms had been gaining momentum for a long time before 1991, it took an economic crisis and deft politics, both within and outside his party, by Rao — he was heading a minority government at the time — to actually see them through. The reforms triggered a sharp debate when they happened, but they have come to enjoy a rare bipartisan consensus in the last 30 years and survived many regimes.At a time when the Indian economy is trying to come out of its largest ever contraction, the nature of economic challenges is very different from what they were 30 years ago. The 30th anniversary of Manmohan Singh’s first Budget is an opportune moment to look at the 1991 Budget in hindsight, retrace the journey, and, perhaps, ask the right questions.How serious was the immediate crisis before 1991 Budget?Manmohan Singh’s 1991 Budget speech made no attempt to hide the extent of the economic crisis prevailing then.“The new Government, which assumed office barely a month ago, inherited an economy in deep crisis. The balance of payments situation is precarious...We have been at the edge of precipice since December 1990 and more so since April 1991...The people of India have to face double digit inflation which hurts most the poorer sections of our society. In sum, the crisis in our economy is both acute and deep. We have not experienced anything similar in the history of independent India.”How bad was the foreign exchange and inflation situation at the time?A look at inflation and foreign exchange reserve and trade numbers suggests that the balance of payment crisis was much bigger than the inflation crisis.We have inflation data going back to 1961-62 under the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers or CPI (IW) series. CPI (IW) had been in double digits from October 1990 onwards when Singh presented his Budget in July 1991. It would stay above the 10% mark until September 1992.Annual growth in CPI (IW) was 11.2% and 13.48% in 1990-91 and 1991-92. The country had seen worse or comparable inflationary episodes before. The oil-shock years of the 1970s were the worst. CPI (IW) grew at 20.59% and 26.75% in 1973-74 and 1974-75. 1966-67 and 1967-68 had seen inflation to the tune of 12.11% and 12.36%. 1980-81 and 1981-82 were also consecutive double-digit inflation years. (See Chart 1)“The current level of foreign exchange reserves, in the range of ₹2,500 crore, would suffice to finance imports for a mere fortnight,” Manmohan Singh said in his Budget speech.This particular statistic went on to become the biggest artefact associated with the pre-reform economic crisis in 1991. Because India does not have monthly trade and foreign exchange figures before 1990, it is difficult to ascertain whether the foreign exchange crisis in 1991 was the most severe the country ever faced. However, monthly average calculations based on annual import and foreign exchange reserve numbers since 1970-71 do show that the pre-reform crisis was indeed the most severe. Arguments over the roots of this crisis triggered a sharp debate among various economists back then, and the basic tenets of this continue to be relevant today. ( See Chart 2)‘An idea whose time has come’: The 1991 Budget’s case for economic liberalisationThe Indian economy had its share of fiscal, inflationary and balance of payments crisis even before 1991. Where the 1991 Budget differed was in its firmness to unleash wholesale policy reform. The speech articulated this unequivocally.“Macroeconomic stabilisation and fiscal adjustment alone cannot suffice. They must be supported by essential reforms in economic policy and economic management, as an integral part of the adjustment process, reforms which would help to eliminate waste and inefficiency and impart a new element of dynamism to growth processes in our economy. The thrust of the reform process would be to increase the efficiency and international competitiveness of industrial production to utilise for this purpose foreign investment and foreign technology to a much greater degree than we have done in the past, to increase the productivity of investment, to ensure that India’s financial sector is rapidly modernised, and to improve the performance of the public sector, so that key sectors of our economy are enabled to attain an adequate technological and competitive edge in a fast changing global economy.”The real liberalisation push came not in the Budget but via drastic changes in industrial and export-import policy which were announced with the Budget. In his essay The Road to the 1991 Industrial Policy Reforms and Beyond published in the collection India Transformed: 25 Years of Economic Reforms, former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Rakesh Mohan (who was then working in the industry ministry) provides an account of Singh’s firm resolve to push the reform process.“Within a few days of his appointment (as finance minister), Manmohan Singh called a meeting of all the secretaries of the major economic ministries and the chief economic adviser... Manmohan Singh outlined the full economic reform programme that was to be followed over the next five years — and more importantly, over the next six weeks. The latter included immediate action to be taken on industry policy. He said quite clearly that he had the full mandate of the Prime Minister to do whatever had to be done to solve the crisis... Since he knew that some of the mandarins present were not on board with the kind of liberalising economic reforms envisaged, he added: “If any of you have any difficulty with the proposed reform programme, we can find other things for you to do!” This was perhaps the most firm and forceful that I ever saw Dr Manmohan Singh.”The unfulfilled promise of 1991 industrial policy reform and continuing quest for a new industrial policyThe 1991 Industrial Policy document looked at five major areas: industrial licensing, foreign investment, foreign technology agreements, public sector and The Monopoly and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act of 1969. In all these areas, the policy thrust was towards removing restrictions on entry of capital, both foreign and domestic. Industrial licensing was abolished in all sectors except 18 industries where it was preserved on account of security and strategic concerns. The policy also said that the “portfolio of public sector investments will be reviewed with a view to focus the public sector on strategic, high-tech and essential infrastructure”. This was the first signal of withdrawal of government from business — a policy that would gain further momentum with the disinvestment of public sector enterprises, a process which continues to unfold even today.While private industry has made significant achievements in India in the three decades of economic reforms, the cherished goals of the 1991 industrial policy are still unrealised to a large extent, especially when they are seen from a macroeconomic lens. The share of manufacturing in GDP has not increased much. It was 14.5% in 1991-92, and stood at just 17.1% in 2019-20, the year before the pandemic disrupted economic activity. The stagnant share of manufacturing even after three decades of reforms is the biggest proof that there are other structural impediments to an industrial revolution in India.That India has not been able to realise the objective of increasing the efficiency and international competitiveness of its industrial production can be seen from the composition of its exports. The World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database of the World Bank uses a 2000 paper by economist Sanjaya Lall to classify exports by their level of technological sophistication. There are five mutually exclusive categories in this classification: primary (rice, tea, petroleum, etc.), resource-based (vegetable oils, cement, etc.) low technology (textile fabrics, jewellery, etc.), medium technology (passenger vehicles, industrial machinery, etc.) and high technology (turbines, pharmaceuticals, etc.) products.The share of high technology exports in India’s export basket has barely increased; from 2% in 1991 to 6% in 2019, the latest period for which this data is available. For China, this share increased from 9% in 1992 to 35% in 2019. (See Chart 3)While India did enjoy some success in exporting medium technology goods, whose share increased from 11% to 21%, this has not been an unambiguous blessing. This year’s Economic Survey made this point in the most effective manner when it attributed Bangladesh’s export success to its prioritisation of labour-intensive commodities unlike India. While Bangladesh’s export basket is in keeping with its labour abundant reality — textiles, footwear and apparel constitute 90% of its exports — around 40% of India’s exports is capital or technology intensive, the survey pointed out. Using the Bangladesh export example, the survey asked the country’s exporters to learn from this and specialise in products in which India is competitive. As India continues to experiment with various kinds of policy tools to promote industry, be it the Make in India programme or the latest Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, the question of an effective industrial policy is as relevant and perhaps elusive as it was in 1991.To be sure, economic reforms did play a critical role in the rise of IT industry in India. According to NAASCOM, the industry association of India’s IT industry, the IT sector is a $194 billion industry which employs 4.47 million professionals and contributes around 8% of India’s GDP. The IT sector also generates significant export earnings for the country; $128.6 billion in 2019-20, according to data from RBI.The rise of India’s IT industry would not have been possible if the pre-reform restrictions on imports and foreign currency use had not been lifted, which led to the absurd situations such as IT companies having to keep waiting for approvals to import computers. Writing in the collection India Transformed: 25 Years of Economic Reforms Infosys founder Narayana Murthy also talks about two critical reforms which were critical in the growth of the IT industry in India. The first was a removal of condition of multinational companies necessarily diluting equity holding in their Indian subsidiaries to 40%. This encouraged global IT giants to set up entities in India and generated significant positive spill over effects for the domestic players. The second was the abolition of the office of Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) which had a mandate to decide on the pricing of Initial Public Offerings of companies. The officer did not have the necessary skill-set to evaluate business prospects of evolving sectors such as IT. The CCI had valued Infosys shares at ₹11 in 1990. The company finally got listed in 1993 at ₹95 per share, after it could work with specialised investment bankers before listing, once the office of CCI was abolished.The question of fiscal consolidationOne of the biggest milestones of India’s post-reform phase was the adoption of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management (FRBM) Act in 2003. The FRBM Act gives a legal mandate to the Union government to keep its budgetary deficit under check. The original Act called for an elimination of revenue deficit and bringing down the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by 2008. The fiscal glide path, the term used for bringing down the deficit as prescribed under the Act has since been adjusted owing to the adverse economic developments. The 1991 Budget made the first noise about the need for fiscal consolidation.“In the macro-management of the economy, over the medium term, it should be our objective to progressively reduce the fiscal deficit of the Central Government, to move towards a significant reduction of the revenue deficit, and to reduce the current account deficit in the balance of payments,” Singh said in his Budget speech. Fiscal deficits, while they have come down compared to where they were in 1991, have not stabilised to the levels envisaged in the FRBM Act. The pandemic’s shock is likely to administer a long-term shock to fiscal consolidation.The issue of fiscal conservatism or prudence has always been a polarising one among economists. Even Singh tried to pre-empt some of this criticism while arguing for fiscal prudence in his 1991 speech. “During the period of transition (to a low deficit phase), it shall be our endeavour to minimise the burden of adjustment on the poor. We are committed to adjustment with a human face. It will also be our endeavour that the adjustment process does not adversely affect the underlying growth impulses in our economy,” he said.The economic virtue of fiscal intervention gained popularity after British economist John Maynard Keynes gave his idea of government investment acting as a multiplier of growth in a recession affected economy during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Keynesian ideas held sway after the Second World War until the 1970s, often referred to as the Golden Age of capitalism. A neoliberal economic revolution after the Oil Shocks brought fiscal conservatism and deregulation of finance back in favour.Questions have been raised about the purported virtue of fiscal prudence, especially during an economic downturn by many economists across the world. The view found a reflection when the FRBM Review Committee under the chairmanship of NK Singh submitted its report in 2017.“One disadvantage of headline fiscal balance rules is that they do not have counter-cyclical properties. For example, when growth – and therefore revenues – is above potential, policymakers should ideally be reducing fiscal deficits, and thereby creating fiscal space that can be used in downturns. However, adhering to a fiscal deficit target necessarily results in those extra revenues being spent. Similarly, during downturns, as automatic stabilizers work, one would want the fiscal deficit to expand, but that is precluded by adherence to a headline deficit rule, thereby making fiscal policy pro-cyclical. There is widespread evidence that fiscal policy in emerging markets tends to be pro-cyclical rather than counter-cyclical, in part because of political incentives to run large deficits in good times when financing is available.”The question of fiscal prudence bringing a pro-cyclical element to economic policy — as was pointed out by the NK Singh Committee — is extremely relevant given the fact that India’s fiscal stimulus to deal with the pandemic’s economic shock has been among the smallest among major economies. (See Chart 4)The nature of tax burden and the question of tax evasionThere is one area where the vision set in the 1991 Budget has seen a reversal: the objective of raising the share of direct taxes in overall tax revenue. “The revenue from direct taxes, both as a proportion of GDP and as a percentage of total tax revenues, has registered a steady decline over time. This trend has to be reversed, so as to restore equity in, and balance to our fiscal system,” Singh said in his Budget speech.According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database, share of direct taxes in total tax revenue of Centre and states fell from 18.3% in 1981-82 to 16.3% in 1990-91. This share would increase consistently in the post-reform period to reach a peak of 43.2% in 2009-10. It has since then fallen steadily. It fell to 36.1% in 2015-16 before rising marginally to 38.9% in 2019-20. Recent numbers are likely to be even lower, thanks to the corporation tax cuts in 2019, fall in direct taxes due to the pandemic and the increased reliance on petrol-diesel taxes in the post-pandemic phase. The goal of reversing this decline in the share of direct taxes is still worth pursing.It needs to be understood that this objective cannot be pursed without rationalising the tax structure and plugging various loopholes which existed 30 years ago and continue to, today. The absurdities of India’s tax system in 1991 are best captured by this exemption Singh abolished in his speech.“Over the years, those with an instinct for gambling have increasingly patronised the races. I propose to withdraw the income-tax exemption of ₹5000 (India’s per capita GDP at factor cost was ₹7167.28 in 1991-92) in respect of earnings from races, including horse races. I am sure that persons who place bets will now also have the added pleasure of sharing their earnings with the government.”The problems facing India’s tax system are far from over. This is best seen from the fact that amount of taxes raised, but not realised by the Union government stood at ₹12.98 lakh crore at the end of 2019-20 (latest available data). To put this number in context, the gross tax revenue of the Union government was ₹20.1 lakh crore in 2019-10.Of the ₹12.98 lakh crore of revenues not realised, ₹10.42 lakh crore was under dispute, while the rest was on account of lack of assets or the assessee not being traceable. The fact that amount worth almost half of the Centre’s gross tax revenue is mired in dispute raises serious questions about the transparency and simplicity (or lack of it) of India’s tax system. The fact that Goods and Services Tax, which is the biggest indirect tax reform in independent India, had serious teething troubles when it was launched in 2017 and continues to suffer from multiplicity of slabs only underlines the importance of simplifying India’s tax regime.While the current government’s tax policy has its share of blames, especially on the question of tax burden becoming regressive, the United Progressive Alliance government, where Singh was the Prime Minister, also did not do justice to the ideals of a simple transparent tax system, by decisions such as retrospective taxation. (See Chart 5)The moral dilemma of conspicuous consumption in a poor economy which also runs a trade deficitThere is practically no rationale against the removal of arbitrary, often stifling, regulations on private enterprise which existed in India before the 1991 Budget. However, there is merit in engaging with the line of argument which was given by many left-leaning economists. This critiques the liberalisation of trade, which had begun in a piecemeal manner before the 1991 reforms and has increased significantly in the last three decades. The logic which was given was that it was the rich who had contributed to the rise in current account deficit by spending scarce foreign exchange on items of luxury consumption.“There is no time to lose. Neither the government nor the economy can live beyond its means year after year,” Singh said in his Budget speech referring to the high fiscal deficit and current account deficit along with a shortage of foreign exchange.Ashok Mitra, one of India’s most original Marxist economists, and also a cheeky polemicist, attacked Singh’s logic in his column Calcutta Diary in the July 27, 1991 issue of the Economic and Political Weekly. “It is simply not true that the nation as a whole has been living beyond its means. It is only a minor segment of the nation, the top-most decile, which has lived it up since that egregious doctrine of borrow and spend , borrow again and spend again, became official policy in the eighties,” Mitra wrote.Singh himself had tried to pre-empt the attack on this front in his Budget speech. “In highlighting the significance of reform, my purpose is not to give to fillip to mindless and heartless consumerism we have borrowed from affluent societies of the West. My objection to the consumerist phenomenon is two-fold. First, we cannot afford it. In a society where we lack drinking water, education, health, shelter and other basic necessities, it would be tragic if our productive resources were to be devoted largely to the satisfaction of the needs of a small minority...Our approach to development has to combine efficiency with austerity. Austerity not in the sense of negation of life or a dry, arid creed that casts a baleful eye on joy and laughter. To my mind, austerity is a way of holding our society together in pursuit of the noble goal of banishing poverty, hunger and disease from this ancient land of ours.”Singh’s Budget speech also referred to the Congress manifesto’s promise of “measures to curb conspicuous consumption” while increasing excise duty on refrigerators, air-conditioners, motor cars, etc.Conspicuous consumption has increased by leaps and bounds in the three decades since Singh’s warning in 1991, even as millions of Indians continue to live in penury. The richest Indians can enjoy almost all the pleasures money can buy inside and outside the country. Sure, India does not face a foreign exchange crisis today like it did in 1991, even though we continue to run a large trade deficit. Capital inflows and remittance incomes have helped on this front. The possibility of a capital-flight driven balance of payment crisis is remote, if not non-existent today. However, the question of forcing some sort of austerity on the rich to pursue the goal of providing relief to the poor continues to be as relevant and it is politically difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-1991-budget-in-hindsight-101626811201778.html
21-07-2021||India||Wise to reopen primary sections first, says govt||New Delhi: Director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Dr Balram Bhargava on Tuesday said it would be wise to first open the primary section if states decide to reopen schools as younger children are better equipped to handle Covid-19, followed by secondary and senior secondary schools.“Once India starts reopening schools, it will be wise to begin with the primary section as children have a lower number of ace receptors to which virus attaches, making them much better at handling viral infections than adults,” he said during the Union health ministry briefing on Covid-19 on Tuesday.He, however, stressed that for such a step to be considered, it must be ensured that school teachers and other support staff such as attendants, bus drivers etc. are fully vaccinated.Bhargava was asked if it was now time to reopen schools as many districts in the country were reporting less than 5% Covid-19 test positivity rate.The fourth round of pan-India sero survey conducted by ICMR also showed that the seroprevalence in children between six and nine years of age was 57.2%, making it almost similar to adults.“There was a slight change in this current round of sero survey. In that, we also included children between six and 17 years of age. Over 50% showed exposure to the virus,” Dr Bhargava added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wise-to-reopen-primary-sections-first-says-govt-101626810329871.html
21-07-2021||India||No crisis should be politicised: Mandaviya hits out at Oppn||New Delhi: Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who took over following a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month, accused Opposition leaders in Parliament on Tuesday of politicising the pandemic by criticising the government’s Covid-19 response and appealed for all states to come together to avert a third wave of infections.Mandaviya was replying to the discussion on the pandemic in Rajya Sabha, where MPs criticised the government’s handling of the second wave of infections, the medical oxygen crisis, and problems with the vaccine drive.“In the discussions so far, it is seen that anything good that happened in managing the pandemic, the members say it was due to the efforts of the local state government and the chief minister, but for anything that went wrong, the fault was with the Modi government,” said Mandaviya in his response.The minister heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, listing out steps taken in the early days of the pandemic as well as over the past year.He responded to some specific allegations, saying the Union government followed the demand of the states on vaccines when they wanted to procure directly, and repelled criticism over vaccines.“Some were asking why did India put a lockdown in March last year. India put a lockdown in order to ramp up vast medical infra. Lockdown was meant to prepare against the helplessness we saw in other countries,” he said.“But we are not complaining,” he added. “We must not forget that no crisis should be politicised. PM Modi has said in the past that when 1.3 billion people work together and take a single step on any issue, it means the country is going ahead with many steps -- in a crisis situation it always helps to move ahead together,” he said, appealing for everyone to work together.“When vaccination was launched, there was misinformation. We also must remember that vaccines had shelf life of six months – how could it be that we didn’t use it, and we shouldn’t give it to others,” he said, addressing criticism that the government gave away doses, which led to a shortage.“We gave vaccines because we had doses that were expiring, because we believe in the motto that the world is a family,” he said.Mandaviya also said that several Indian companies were stepping up production of doses and India could also have access to new vaccines in coming months. “Zydus Cadila and Bharat Biotech have started trials on children. I expect their trials to be successful. We need to trust our scientists. I trust my scientists and indigenous companies,” Mandaviya said, while adding that Serum Institute of India has become supplying 110-120 million doses a month and Bharat Biotech is expected to supply 35 million in August.Earlier, opposition members of the Upper House questioned the government’s preparedness and called for better coordination with the state governments.Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Manoj Kumar Jha said the government machinery entirely failed in taking appropriate steps during the second wave, and added that the crisis was the result of continuing disregard for health care “from 1947 till now”.“For one-and-a-half months, the whole country lived through a nightmare... Even MPs were not heard, what of the common man?” he said. “We witnessed undignified death, the next generations will not forgive us,” he added.Shantanu Sen of the Trinamool Congress said that during the second wave, there were bodies filling up at cremation and burial grounds. “Please make sure in the third wave, bodies don’t pile up on the street,” he said.“Lancet, the oldest medical journal, World Health Organization, the Supreme Court and several high courts, and even countries like Brazil, Canada and the UK have categorically criticised the Covid fighting policy of India. What can be more shameful for us,” he added.Tuesday’s was the first time the Covid-19 crisis was discussed in parliament following the devastating second wave of infections in April-May.Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Congress’s Mallikarjun Kharge said the government’s Covid-19 death toll figure of 400,000-500,000 is “false” and conservative, and claimed the average number of deaths cannot be less than 5.2 million.The Congress alleged that Modi “failed” in tackling the pandemic and made former health minister Harsh Vardhan a scapegoat.“There are about 638,565 villages in the country. Even if there were five Covid-19 deaths in a village, the total death toll would have been 3,191,825,” he said. “There are 7,935 urban cities, even if you take 10 deaths in each city, the toll would have been more than 793,500. Similarly, there would have been an estimated 360,000 deaths in 19 metros. On an average, it comes to 52.43 lakh deaths. It cannot be less than this. Still, they (government) say it is only 4-5 lakh. They keep saying this,” Kharge added.As Kharge’s remarks drew angry protests from the treasury benches, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma urged them to allow the debate to take place. “A serious topic is being discussed. The ruling party should listen patiently. When you speak, we will also listen patiently. This is not the right way of debating,” Sharma said.Mandaviya addressed this point in his reply and said death figures are provided by states and the Union government merely releases it.On cooperation between the Centre and the states, Mandaviya said the “PM met the State heads some 20 times, to ask for their feedback regarding how the pandemic can be best tackled, and drafted measures accordingly”.The minister said a package of over ₹23,000 crore has been approved for strengthening the health infrastructure, including setting up 24 million hospital beds and 20,000 ICU beds with a special focus on paediatric care to handle any possible third wave of the pandemic.Mandaviya also said that the government has taken several steps to enhance manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-crisis-should-be-politicised-mandaviya-hits-out-at-oppn-101626810023436.html
21-07-2021||India||Amid row over Eid relaxations, Kerala logs 16,848 Covid cases||Thiruvananthapuram: Even as the Supreme Court pulled up the state for allowing a three-day relaxation for Bakrid festival, Kerala on Tuesday clocked another spike in Covid-29 infections reporting 16,848 cases with a high test positivity rate (TPR) of 11.91 per cent. Statistics released by the state health ministry shows it is the highest tally and TPR in a month and the state contributes more than 50 per cent of total cases of the country -- in last 24 hours the country reported only 30,093 cases with a TPR of 1.68 per cent. Of 430,000 active cases, the state’s share is 126,000. Though many experts have started talking in terms of a possible third wave, the state government stuck to its repeated theory that the second wave started very late and what the state was witnessing is the peak of the second wave. But a close look at infection pattern shows the state is showing no sign of plateauing. When infections started declining rapidly across the country, Kerala is the only state that reports high volume of cases for more than a month. After the SC rap, the state has decided not to give any relaxation after Bakrid and weekend lockdown will continue for one more month. “On Friday we will do three lakh tests. High TPR is a big concern and we should increase our vigil and surveillance,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after the pandemic review meeting. As the threat of third wave looms large, some experts have called for a strict monitoring of high incidences in Kerala and Maharashtra. But others said the presence of antibodies in Kerala is only half of the national average. “In the latest sero survey around 67 per cent of the total population in the country have antibodies but in Kerala it is below 30 per cent. So there are large pockets of uninfected people who are susceptible. It was expected,” said public health expert Dr N M Arun. He said it was too early to talk about a third wave but the state needs utmost vigil. As cases rise exponentially last week the CM had announced a series of relaxations for Bakird which came in for heavy criticism. At least 40 people will be allowed in places of worship and shops and business establishments will opened till 8 pm. And the number of pilgrims in Sabarimala hill temple was also doubled from 5000 to 10,000. On Tuesday the SC had criticised the state and warned that it will be held responsible for any possible outcome. Besides concessions for Bakrid, certain activities like film shooting and relaxations for places of worship were also announced. But many experts and the apex body of doctors, Indian Medical Association, came down heavily on it saying “it was most ill-timed and inappropriate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-row-over-eid-relaxations-kerala-logs-16-848-covid-cases-101626808415751.html
21-07-2021||India||Stalin urges PM not to proceed with marine fisheries bill in House||Chennai: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday urged the Union government not to move the Indian Marine Fisheries Bill, 2021 during the current session of Parliament. “This issue is of grave concern to Tamil Nadu, particularly among the coastal districts,” Stalin said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Many provisions in the proposed Bill go against the interests of the local fishermen communities and certain clauses infringe upon the rights conferred to the States under the State List of the 7th Schedule of Constitution of India.” Stalin said the union government has proposed to move the Bill without adequately addressing the concerns and well-being of Indian fishermen who are traditionally engaged in this occupation for their livelihood for generations.“While we understand and appreciate the need to protect and preserve the marine eco system, we also consider it equally important that the livelihood and interests of the traditional fishermen are clearly protected,” said his letter released by the government. “As the proposed Bill has many disturbing clauses, like criminalisation and imprisonment of fishermen, use of force against fishermen, levy of charges, levy of huge penalties etc., it has resulted in widespread protests and disquiet.” Stalin asked for the Bill to be put through wider debate and discussion. After the union government had obtained all views from stakeholders on the Bill in its present form, he said a decision on moving a fresh Bill could be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-urges-pm-not-to-proceed-with-marine-fisheries-bill-in-house-101626808295785.html

The primary health centre was catering to poor patients and its destruction was in the news then. Later UAE-based VPS Health Care group, owned by NRI businessman Dr Shamseer Vayalil, promised to rebuild the health centre. “Built at the cost of ₹10 crore, the new hospital and laboratory will have all modern facilities,” said district medical officer NK Sakeena, adding that it will cater to at least 200,000 patients in a year. Located at remote Vazhakkad village, the hospital was designed by the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and students of the School of Architecture and Planning at Thrissur Engineering College. The building component used is glass fibre reinforced gypsum panel, also known as Rapidwall, which can withstand natural calamities, said VPS Health Care authorities. “It has all modern facilities. Experts from many fields rubbed shoulders with local people for such an initiative,” said VPS Health Care chairman Shamseer Vayalil. The hospital has an advanced laboratory, modern imaging department, oxygen beds, concentrators and a stabilisation unit to attend to sufferings from oxygen saturation, said the group in a statement. “What is makes it different is that it is made of eco-friendly technology eliminating the usual brick and cement structure with an aesthetically pleasing design.” Three years ago, flood had ravaged many parts of the state claiming 500 lives -- it was dubbed as the flood of the century. After the disaster, the government had undertaken an initiative, called ‘Rebuild Kerala’, to piece together damaged infrastructure and lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floodhit-primary-health-centre-turns-into-hi-tech-hospital-in-kerala-s-malapuram-101626808175722.html
21-07-2021||India||Kerala minister lands in row over viral clip on molestation case||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala forest minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) AK Saseendran has landed in a controversy over an alleged audio tape of his conversation with the father of a woman, who filed sexual harassment complaint against another NCP leader, in which he was purportedly heard asking the parent to settle the issue. Talking to reporters on Tuesday, the minister refuted the allegations. While he did not deny his telephonic conversation, he said he did not know that it was a sexual harassment case. However, the woman’s father while talking to reporters alleged that the minister called him several times and asked him to withdraw the compliant and settle the issue amicably. The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party sought the minister’s resignation saying he violated the “oath of office” by “forcing a sexual assault victim to withdraw her compliant”. “He has no right to continue in power,” said VD Satheesan, leader of the opposition in state assembly. Youth Congress leader Veena Nair on Tuesday met Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and sough his expulsion. BJP state president K Surendran said, “He has violated his oath of office forcing the victim to withdraw a sexual harassment case.” However, Saseendran said he called up the woman’s father since both (accused and complainant) were members of the NCP and he wanted to know about the issue. He claimed that he backed out after he came to know harassment charges were also involved. According to the police, the woman from Kollam in south Kerala had filed a complaint at Kundara police station on June 28, alleging that NCP state executive member G Padmakaran had caught hold of her hand and tried to molest her inside a hotel owned by him in March. In her police complaint, she said the NCP leader wanted to know why she joined the BJP when everyone else in her family belonged to the NCP. In 2020 local body elections, she unsuccessfully contested on the BJP ticket. In his purported conversation with the father, the minister is heard saying that there was a minor issue in the party, and it should be settled in a good manner. In the audio clip, when the man asks if the minister was seeking to settle the issue of a hotel owner’s bid to sexually assault his daughter, the minister purportedly says he knew about the issue, and it should be settled in a good manner. HT cannot indepenently verify the autheticity of the audio clip. Later, the victim’s father claimed they were being pressurised to withdraw the compliant, an allegation Saseendran denied. “Since both belong to the NCP, I made an inquiry. I never pressurised either the father or daughter,” he said, adding that he was told about a verbal duel, not harassment or assault. The woman’s father said he would file a complaint with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayarghavan said he was not aware of the issue and will react only after studying it. Party insiders, however, said senior leaders were upset with the development. NCP state president PC Chacko defended the minister, saying he was only trying to ascertain facts about the compliant. This is not the first time Saseendran has landed in a controversy. During the first Pinarayi Vijayan government, Saseendran, then transport minister, was forced to quit in 2017 after his alleged inappropriate conversation with a woman journalist surfaced. He was later inducted after the journalist withdrew her compliant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-lands-in-row-over-viral-clip-on-molestation-case-101626808115675.html

Sonia Gandhi ji, AICC in-charge of Manipur, Shri @BhaktaCharandas ji, former Union Minister, will arrive in Imphal by 9 AM tomorrow to meet with senior leaders and other leaders of the party,” he said in a tweet.The development came as reports claimed that Konthoujam, a six-time lawmaker who heads the state Congress unit, has stepped down. The former minister could not be reached for his response as his mobile phone was switched off. He was appointed state Congress president in December 2020.News reports also indicated that some other Congress leaders were also on their way out. Kh Joykishan was among those who was said to have resigned as the state unit’s vice president. Joykishan, who represents Thangmeiband assembly constituency in Imphal West district, rejected the media report. “It is not true,” he said.Yamthong Haokip, MLA from Saikul assembly constituency, who was said to have quit the party could not be contacted for his comment. His phone was also switched off. The Congress emerged as the single largest party in the 2017 assembly elections, winning 28 out of 60 seats but could not form the government. Instead, the BJP, which won 21 seats, came to power with support of four National People’s Party MLAs, four Naga People’s Front MLAs and one MLA each from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party and an Independent.The strength of the 60-member assembly has been reduced to 54 (BJP-24, INC-17) after three members were disqualified and three Congress MLAs resigned earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-sends-top-leader-to-imphal-amid-reports-of-state-president-quitting-party-101626808057228.html
21-07-2021||India||Maha probes officials’ tour to Israel in 2019||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government’s director general of information and publicity (DGIPR) on Tuesday started an inquiry into the tour of five of its senior officials to Israel in November 2019, an official familiar with the developments said, adding the probe comes on the heels of the demand by the Congress, which is part of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi government, to probe if the Pegasus leak had any state connection. The general administrative department, which governs the information and public relations department of the state government, has issued notices to the officials asking them to submit a report related to the tour, the official said, adding that the preliminary inquiry conducted earlier had found several violations of the set rules related to the foreign tours.Five senior officials headed by a director of the department had gone to Israel between November 15 and 25, 2019. “Notices have been served to the officials asking them to submit the details of the tours, including object, itinerary of tours, meetings that took place during the tour and the efforts by them to ensure that the department was benefited from their experience among others,” said an official from general administrative department. When contacted, Dilip Pandharpatte, director general of information and public relations refused to comment on the issue.“The officials had extended their tour by a few days, when the extension of any such official tour is not permitted. The permission from the chief minister of the state is mandatory for any such foreign tour, alongwith the ministry of external affairs, finance and home affairs is mandatory. Since the model code of conduct was in place when the tour was being chalked out, the permission from the ECI too was necessary. The DGIPR had taken the permission by the then chief secretary, but it was not sufficient. The rules also mandate for the official invitation from the government of the country they are visiting. In this case, the tour was planned on the basis of the letter given by consul general of Israel in Mumbai. We have found gross violation of the laid down rules related to the foreign tours of the officials,” another official from the government said.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Monday had demanded that the state government should probe if there were any links related to Maharashtra in the Pegasus leaks. “The illegal and unauthorised phone tapping done by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, who headed state intelligence department during Fadnavis government, is being probed and the truth will soon come to the fore. But there are also doubts if there are any Maharashtra links to Pegasus leaks and any IPS officer who was posted at Mantralaya was working on it? A few officials from the office of director general of information and public relations (DGIPR) of the state government had visited Israel during the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The questions including if they got any training, by whose permission they had gone, did they submit any report to the government, how many times did they go to Israel, were there any scheduled meetings in Israel, had government had any correspondence with NSO or any presentation was made to the state government, need to be answered. A probe into the issue will throw light on these questions,” Sawant said.Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said the team of officers had gone to Israel but it was well after the assembly polls ended. “The team had gone to study the farming and farm techniques in Israel. Maharashtra government during my tenure as the CM, never had taken any services of the NSO. Let the government probe into the case.”The DGIPR is also checking about several Israel tours of a senior officer from DGIPR during the Fadanvis government. The department is also has the information about the logistic support provided by a local agency in Israel. “The officials who went on tour may not have direct links with the alleged phone tapping controversy as none of them has any technical knowledge required. We believe that it was a leisure tour organised to oblige senior officials from the government,” a senior official from the GAD said. Aditi Tatkare, minister of state for general administration, said she was not aware of any probe. “The publicity department does take cognizance of the media reports related to the government. I am not aware if any such probe has been started and if there was any officials complaint made by Sachin Sawant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-probes-officials-tour-to-israel-in-2019-101626807755703.html
21-07-2021||India||House IT panel likely to take up Pegasus issue on July 28||A parliamentary committee on information technology chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is likely to take up on July 28 the alleged illegal surveillance mounted on journalists, activists, opposition leaders, etc, using Israeli military-grade spyware Pegasus, a person familiar with the matter said.The panel, going by the notification HT has accessed, will hear what the ministry of electronics and information technology, ministry of home affairs and the department of telecommunications have to say on this.“GoI has denied resorting to unauthorised surveillance. The question this raises is, if #Pegasus is only sold to governments, which other govts (China/Pak?) are using it to snoop on prominent Indian citizens? Shouldn’t the authorities call for an independent investigation,” Tharoor had tweeted on July 18.This is not the first time that the panel has taken up the issue of the Israeli spyware. In 2019, after instant messaging service WhatsApp had reported being vulnerable to the spyware attack, the panel had called these same ministries to explain their stand.At the time, At the time, the issue required an unusual vote to take up the matter as BJP members resisted the suggestion -- a casting vote by Tharoor finally broke a tie.“It’s been proved that phones examined in India had invasion of Pegasus. Since this product is only sold to vetted govts, question arises which government? If GoI says they haven’t done it, some other govt did it, then it’s a more serious national security concern,” news agency ANI quoted Tharoor as saying on Tuesday.The maker of the spyware — Israel-based NSO Group — has said that it only supplies the software to governments. On Monday, reports had surfaced that claimed that apart from 38 Indian journalists, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and two of his aides, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, political strategist Prashant Kishor and former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa’s phones had also been hacked. The list also included the number of a woman who had accused former chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment and the numbers of 11 of her friends and family members.The investigation by a global consortium of media houses also named public health experts Gagandeep Kang and M Hari Menon and diplomats from at least five countries as potential targets of Pegasus software.Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who defended the government in Parliament hours before being named as a potential hacking target, and Jal Shakti minister of state Prahlad Singh Patel, were the high-profile government names in the list of people who were allegedly snooped on.The consortium published on Sunday that 38 Indian journalists, including three current Hindustan Times staffers and one from sister publication Mint, were among 180 journalists potentially targeted worldwide, including Financial Times editor Roula Khalaf, and reporters from the Wall Street Journal, CNN, New York Times, and Le Monde.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.The Indian government has denied any involvement. But the opposition has called for a probe into the allegations..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-it-panel-likely-to-take-up-pegasus-issue-101626807695635.html
21-07-2021||India||police file case against Adhikari over allegations of phone tapping||Kolkata: The police in East Midnapore district on Tuesday filed a case against Bharatiya Janata Party’s Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of opposition in the West Bengal assembly, accusing him of intimidating and insulting government officials and tapping their phones. The case has been filed by the police on their own accord based on a video in which Adhikari purportedly said that he has all the records of phone calls made from the office of chief minister Mamata Banerjee to her nephew, Trinamool Congress’ national general secretary and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee. East Midnapore superintendent of police Amarnath K said at a press conference on Tuesday that Adhikari said in the video that he has the phone records of police officers too, which he should not officially have. “Hence, a case has been registered under the Official Secrets Act. He made some communal statements as well for which Section 295 (A) of the Indian Penal Code has been added. A charge under the Disaster Management Act has also been added as more than 50 people had assembled for the meeting violating Covid-19 restrictions,” Amarnath K said. In the 35-second video clip, which was shot outside the SP’s office in Tamluk on Monday, Adhikari can be heard referring to the chief minister as “aunt” and Abhishek Banerjee as “nephew”. “The role of the IO (investigating officer), inspector-in-charge and the superintendent of police will be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Then you will understand that no aunt can save you. Phone calls are made to you from the nephew’s office. I have all the phone numbers and call records. If you have the state government, we have the central government,” Adhikari can be heard saying in the clip. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video or identify of the police officers being referred to in it. But a section of the local media in the state reported that the statement was made at a public meeting in East Midnapore district on Monday afternoon and Adhikari was referring to local police officers. Adhikari’s comments have created quite a stir in the state, especially as they surfaced a day after opposition parties cornered the BJP in Parliament, accusing the central government of using military grade Israeli spyware Pegasus to snoop on opposition leaders, journalists, activists and government officials. TMC has said in Parliament that Abhishek Banerjee was among those whose phones were tapped. Adhikari didn’t deny the charges. “One should not give importance to this. The TMC and police are synonymous,” he said.The TMC reacted sharply, saying the video confirms the illegal use of Pegasus malware by the BJP. “Adhikari should be arrested immediately and interrogated in custody. He has proved that Pegasus was used to snoop on many people, including Abhishek Banerjee. This is a heinous crime. The Centre is misusing its powers,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. West Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson, Samik Bhattacharya, played it down. “Suvendu Adhikari is a seasoned politician. He made the statements at a political rally. If the police can lodge cases against Adhikari, why is Mukul Roy being spared? After joining the BJP (in 2017) he told a television channel that his phone was tapped by the TMC government,” he said. Mukul Roy, who was a national vice-president of the BJP, returned to the TMC on June 11 along with his son. Adhikari is a legislator from East Midnapore’s Nandigram where he defeated chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the recent assembly polls by 1,958 votes. His father and one of his brothers are TMC Lok Sabha MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-file-case-against-adhikari-over-allegations-of-phone-tapping-101626807636189.html
21-07-2021||India||Siddaramaiah denies rift with Shivakumar||Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday refuted claims of a rift between him and Karnataka Pradesh Congress president DK Shivakumar. Addressing media during a press conference in New Delhi, which was attended by both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah said: “There are no rifts within the party. There could be small differences in the party, which could be resolved. In a democratic party, these are common… there are no differences that could harm the party. Rahul Gandhi has asked us to work together. He said the (political) atmosphere in Karnataka is good, and we should return to power. We are following that advice,” Siddaramaiah said on Tuesday. DK Shivakumar said the Congress party’s ethos is to work together. “We are a national party. We believe in collective leadership. Even the elections will be contested this week. There are questions one or two individuals are not important. There are several leaders in the Congress, and we will go to the elections together.” Speaking to the media earlier on Tuesday, Siddaramaiah said that DK Shivakumar and he are together. “We’re building the party together. There’s no rift in Karnataka Congress, and the party will come back to power. Why should there be a rift? We are fighting against the corruption of BJP,” Siddaramaiah said. Siddaramaiah had come to New Delhi, following a call from the party high command. The leaders are expected to meet party president Sonia Gandhi amid a speculations power tussle. The meeting is expected to be regarding the appointment of office-bearers and strategies for the upcoming Assembly elections in 2023. “I am in Delhi because Rahul Gandhi wanted to meet me by 4 pm today (Tuesday), this is what KC Venugopal told me. I don’t know what subject matter he is going to discuss,” Siddaramaiah said. “There is no rift…I have no problem with any leader. We want to prepare to help people to throw this Govt out of power…this meeting had nothing to do with constituency or power,” he has said on arrival. Congress leader’s Delhi visit assumes significance as a section of MLAs and leaders including Chickpet MLA B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan and Kampli MLA J N Ganesh are openly backing him to lead the state in the event of the Congress getting a majority in 2023 polls. On Monday, Siddaramaiah in a response to a question whether the party was ready in case the BJP is unable to handle its internal crisis, said “Congress is ready to face elections at any point of time. I don’t feel that an early election will take place because if Yediyurappa is removed, another person will be made the chief minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-denies-rift-with-shivakumar-101626807395729.html

A search for the missing is underway, they added. According to inspector general of police (IGP) (Bastar range) Sunderaj P, seven persons went missing after attending a social gathering two days ago. “...(the) villagers from Kunded under Jagargonda police station limits went to a nearby village to attend a social gathering a couple of days back and they are yet to return home. We are trying to verify the information about a few of them being taken captive by Maoists,” he said.Sukma superintendent of police Sunil Sharma said that four others, including a village head, on Monday had reportedly gone to hold talks with the rebels on the alleged abduction of the villagers but did not return. According to people familiar with the developments, the rebels suspected that the missing persons had appeared for a police recruitment test, and hence, may have taken them in captivity.No case has been registered so far and talks are underway between tribal leaders and Maoists, the people cited above added.ITBP trooper killed in gunbattleA paramilitary trooper of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) was killed and another was injured in an exchange of fire between security forces and Maoists in Chhattisgarh’s Left-wing insurgency-affected Naraynapur district on Tuesday.The Bastar IGP said the gun battle broke out near Aamdai Valley after a party of the ITBP’s 45th battalion was out to clear the movement of Chandan Kashyap, the member of Chhattisgarh assembly from Narayanpur constituency.“After the convoy of Kashyap passed through the area around 10 am, a small action team of Maoists opened fire on the ITBP jawans. One jawan, Shiv Kumar Meena, died while assistant sub-inspector Keshav Ram suffered minor injuries,” Sunderaj P said, adding that Ram was out of danger and undergoing treatment at a local hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-feared-abducted-by-maoists-in-chhattisgarh-101626806136793.html
21-07-2021||India||US seeks to extradite 26/11 accused to India||The Biden administration has urged a California court to clear the extradition of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana to India for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack.US government attorneys urged the court to “conclude that India’s extradition request contains sufficient evidence of probable cause on each of the criminal charges for which India seeks Rana’s extradition”.Rana, 59, has been declared a fugitive by India, where he is facing multiple criminal charges for his involvement in the 2008 terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. A warrant was issued for his arrested in India in August 2018.US attorneys, Tracy L Wilkison and Christopher D Grigg, in a proposed order titled Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law, said, “Having found that all of the requirements for certification of extradition have been satisfied, the Court certifies the extradition of Tahawwur Hussain Rana to the Secretary of State and commits him to custody pursuant.”“Based on the evidence submitted by India, RANA allowed fraud against the Indian government to occur through the creation and submission of forged documents. The purpose behind such fraud is irrelevant under the Indian criminal provisions,” the document, filed on July 15, said.The Indian government has accused Rana of conspiring with David Coleman Headley to assist the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.“In any event, RANA knowingly allowed Headley to obtain the business visa and the cover that he needed to conduct terrorism-related surveillance operations in India, ultimately leading to the three-day terrorist attacks in Mumbai,” the document said.Headley, a Pakistani-American who scouted the Mumbai targets for LeT operatives, visited India using the Indian branch of Rana’s Chicago-based company, First World Immigration Services, as cover.Headley is serving a 35-year-jail sentence in a plea deal with the US government that protects him from extradition.Also Read | Tahawwur Rana, 2008 Mumbai terror attack suspect, to remain in US custodyAccording to the document, the evidence establishes that the Mumbai attacks were committed by LeT, a terrorist organisation targeting India.“Rana was aware that Headley was involved with LeT, and that by assisting Headley and affording him a cover for his activities, he was supporting the terrorist organisation and its associates. Rana knew of Headley’s meetings, what was discussed, and the planning of the attacks, including some of the targets. Further, it was foreseeable that these attacks would lead to death, injury, and destruction of property,” it said.Rana’s attorneys, John D. Cline and Patrick W. Blegen, however, argued that the “government has not satisfied the requirement” of provisions of the Extradition Treaty that a request for extradition be supported by “such information as would justify the committal for trial of the person if the offense had been committed in the Requested State”.Rana was held guilty by a jury in a Chicago court in 2011 for providing material support to a terrorist plot against a Danish news publication and to LeT, and was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2013.The court, however, acquitted him on the charge of conspiracy to provide material support for the Mumbai attack.Rana was released in 2020 on humanitarian grounds when he tested positive for Covid-19 and rearrested shortly after in Los Angeles on India’s extradition request.In another motion filed in the California court on July 15, the US attorneys urged the court to find that India has the jurisdiction to charge Rana for “(a) conspiracy to wage war, to commit murder, to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, to use a forged document, and to commit a terrorist act, in violation of Indian Penal Code (lists sections)..; (b) waging war, in violation of IPC (section); (c) conspiracy to wage war, in violation of (another section of) IPC; (d) murder, in violation of IPC (section); (e) committing a terrorist act; and (f) conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.”(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-seeks-to-extradite-26-11-accused-to-india-101626806076767.html
21-07-2021||India||Compensation for Covid deaths: Centre seeks time till mid-Sept to frame rules||The Centre has sought from the Supreme Court an additional period of four weeks to frame guidelines on the grant of ex-gratia relief to families of victims of Covid-19 under the National Disaster Management Act (DMA) 2005.According to a top court judgment on June 30, the central government was given six weeks to frame guidelines under Section 12 (ii) of the 2005 Act which talks of minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected due to Covid-19. Under this provision, the Centre needs to demarcate the categories of beneficiaries and decide on the amount of ex-gratia accordingly. The period of six weeks is supposed to end on August 11.In an application filed in the apex court on Monday, the Centre said the NDMA is in the process of framing guidelines and is at an advanced stage of finalising the ex-gratia scheme.“The exercise to frame appropriate guidelines for payment of ex-gratia payment to the victims of Covid-19 disaster under Section 12(iii) of the DMA is in active consideration of the NDMA and going on. This exercise, though at an active advance stage, requires a little more in-depth examination before the same is finalized and implemented,” the application read.As per data available with the ministry of health and family welfare, over 4.14 lakh people had died due to the virus till Tuesday.“Any accelerated formulation, in the respectful submission of the applicant, may result in undesirable results,” the Centre said.The application requested the court to grant additional four weeks to enable the NDMA to prepare a “comprehensive and robust formulation”.Ideally, an application filed in a disposed case is heard in the Supreme Court by the bench that passed the judgment. One of the judges of the two-judge bench who passed the order, Justice Ashok, has since retired. The judgment was authored by Justice M R Shah.In the wake of the Centre’s application, the Chief Justice of India can decide to assign this for hearing before a new bench or the bench with only Justice Shah as a member.The significant ruling by the court in June was based on two separate public interest litigations (PILs) filed by two lawyers, Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal. The two petitioners had highlighted a notification issued by the ministry of home affairs, the nodal ministry for DMA, on April 8, 2015, by which the government had quantified an ex-gratia compensation of ₹4 lakh to victims killed in a notified disaster for getting relief under Section 12(iii) of the 2005 Act.Since Covid-19 was declared as a “notified” disaster on March 14, 2020, the PIL demanded the April 2015 notification to be extended to such victims.The June 30 judgment accepted the principle that the Centre was liable under Section 12(iii) of DMA to provide compensation. On the quantum, the court left it to the wisdom of NDMA to determine the amount by taking into consideration the availability and requirement of funds under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for meeting other priorities and fund requirements under other heads of prevention, preparation and mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic.The court also directed the Centre to frame a “simplified procedure or guidelines” for issuing an official document or death certificate to the family of those who succumbed to the virus.“If a person has died after he was found to be Covid positive and he has died within two to three months, either in the hospital or outside the hospital or at home, the death certificate or official document must be issued to the family members of the deceased stating the cause of death as ‘died due to Covid-19’,” the bench had remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-4-more-weeks-to-frame-rules-on-relief-to-covid-victims-families-101626804936034.html
21-07-2021||India||SC quashes part of UPA-era constitutional amendment||The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the Parliament could not have introduced a law regulating cooperative societies within states and Union territories under the 97th Constitution amendment of 2011, without first getting it ratified from half of the state legislatures.However, the three-judge bench of the top court by a 2:1 majority held that the Constitution (97th Amendment) Act 2011 will be valid and operational with regard to multistate cooperative societies which relate to cooperative societies existing across many states or union territories.The majority view of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said, “We declare that Part IXB of the Constitution of India is operative insofar as multi-state co-operative societies are concerned…. Part IXB, insofar as it applies to co-operative societies which operate within a State, would therefore require ratification under Article 368(2) of the Constitution of India. In the present case, ratification not having been effected, the Amendment is non est.”Article 368 refers to the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution.The third judge on the bench, Justice KM Joseph supported the majority view to the extent that Part IXB does not apply to state cooperative societies. He went a step further and held that the law cannot apply to multi-state cooperative societies either.Justice Joseph in his separate dissenting view said, “To sustain these provisions, the court would have to resurrect the dead provisions contained in Article 243ZI to 243ZQ and Article 243ZT. The Doctrine of Severability must apply on surer foundations. It is my view that unless the provisions, which have been found unconstitutional are kept alive, Articles 243R and 243ZQ are plainly unworkable.”Article 243ZR related to multi-state cooperative societies.The 97th constitutional amendment, which dealt with issues related to effective management of co-operative societies in the country, was passed by Parliament in December 2011 and had come into effect from February 15, 2012.The matter came to the Supreme Court by an appeal filed by Centre against a Gujarat high court judgment of April 22, 2013 which struck down the entire Part IXB of the Constitution introduced by the 2011 Constitution Amendment Act as “non est” (which means “does not exist”).The Part IXB contained Articles 243ZH to Article 243ZT, which empowered Parliament (for multi-state cooperative societies) and state legislatures for other cooperative societies to make laws.These laws could prescribe standards of incorporation, regulation, winding up, composition, tenure, audit, submission of periodic accounts and reports, provision for reservation and penalty clauses.The high court found that the process adopted by Parliament to introduce the law was wrong as cooperative societies were a subject reserved exclusively for States under the Seventh Schedule. Any change required ratification of half of the state legislatures, the HC held.The Centre’s appeal was argued by Attorney General KK Venugopal who said that since the passing of the Constitution Amendment law of 2011, 17 out of 28 States have already enacted legislative measures and therefore, it can be said that more than half of the states had accepted and applied the provisions of Part IXB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-quashes-part-of-upa-era-constitutional-amendment-101626804819445.html
21-07-2021||India||PM briefs floor leaders on Covid management, 6 parties skip meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that Covid-19 response should not be a matter of politics and that India has been able to check the disease at a second wave while some countries have suffered as many as four waves. He made the remark while addressing a meeting of Parliamentary floor leaders.According to three leaders present in the meeting, the PM used an Olympic analogy to underline that good pandemic management of a state is a matter of satisfaction for the entire country. “If an Indian athlete wins a gold medal in the upcoming Olympics, it is a matter of national pride and not which party in power helped him or her. It’s same for the pandemic management too,” Modi said at a briefing for floor leaders on Covid-19.The meeting, conducted by Union home minister Amit Shah, was boycotted by six Opposition parties—the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Akali Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal, CPI(M) and CPI—as they maintained that any discussion on Covid should take place in ParliamentThe Prime Minister spoke about how India’s vaccination programme—the largest in the world—has gained pace and pointed out “that the first 10 crore doses took around 85 days while the last 10 crore doses have taken 24 days.”He also informed the leaders that the daily closing stocks show an average of more than 1.5 crore vaccines at the end of the day throughout the country,” said an official press release.Modi stressed on the need for proper planning of vaccination, especially at the district level, based on the advance availability indicated by the Union health minister, and expressed concern over only 80% of India’s healthcare workers being vaccinated till now.“Modi said 100% of them must be vaccinated,” said a leader present in the meeting.Parties close to the BJP hailed Modi’s efforts. Pashupati Paras of the LJP described Modi as the “best PM of the world”. AIADMK said, “Modi is a deity in all Indian households.”Biju Janata Dal leader Pinaki Mishra asked the PM to keep the share of vaccine doses for private hospitals to only 10% in states such as Odisha, which doesn’t have too many private health facilities.Trinamool leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said Bengal got only 2.5 million doses as against the allotted 7.5 million doses for July, and requested the PM to give more vaccines to the state.DMK leader TR Balu was critical of the Centre’s role and alleged that the government is clueless in the battle against Covid-19. Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav cautioned that in many UP villages, people shut their door to vaccine teams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-briefs-floor-leaders-on-covid-management-6-parties-skip-meeting-101626804756812.html
21-07-2021||India||No deaths reported due to lack of O2 by states in 2nd wave: Centre||No deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and Union territories during the second Covid-19 wave, the government said in a written statement in Parliament on Tuesday.Responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen during the second wave, minister of state (health), Bharati Pravin Pawar in a written reply in Rajya Sabha said,“Due to unprecedented surge in demand of medical oxygen during the second wave— the demand in the country peaked to nearly 9000 MT as compared to 3095 MT during the first wave— the central government had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution to the States.”“Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union health ministry to all states and UTs… Accordingly, all states and UTs report cases and deaths to the Union health ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by States/UTs,” Pawar replied.However, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a statement said, “There was an actual shortage of oxygen during the second wave’s peak period of the pandemic. The central government has been running a cover-up since the very start of the pandemic. It is because of their flawed policy and implementation that the country had to endure an oxygen crisis during the toughest phase of the pandemic.”“The Delhi Government wanted to account for the reason behind deaths during the pandemic, we had constituted a ‘Death Audit Committee’ to work towards that. The central government however did not want their fallacies to be unveiled so they did not let us go through with the committee as they knew what truth will come out in the open,” he added.The government came under flak in the parliament with several members criticising the Centre for severe oxygen shortage during the second Covid-19 wave. Trinamool Congress’ Shantanu Sen said, “People were dying on the roads because of scarcity of oxygen and it was a matter of shame since it happened in the 21st century.” During Covid, the Centre took unilateral decisions and hands of state governments were tied, he added.Pawar, in her reply mentioned, government actions that included provisioning medical oxygen, and other consumables to ensure clinical care of patients in view of the steep rise in cases during April- May 2021.“A dynamic and transparent framework for allocation of medical oxygen in consultation with states and UTs and all the stakeholders such as relevant ministries, manufacturers/suppliers of liquid oxygen, etc. was prepared. The active caseload of the state and UT was the primary determinant of oxygen allocation. Other factors such as case doubling rate, available medical infrastructure, etc. were also given due consideration,” the reply read.Further, the allocation was kept dynamic as per the changing pandemic load.At the peak of the second wave in April and May, several cities reported an acute lack of oxygen that left critical patients gasping for breath. Prominent hospitals approached the courts and in some states -- such as Goa -- hospitals told the judiciary that patients died due to oxygen shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deaths-reported-due-to-lack-of-o2-by-states-in-2nd-wave-centre-101626804756246.html
21-07-2021||India||Antibodies in 68% Indians||Roughly two out of three Indians may have some protection from Covid-19, government experts on Tuesday said, citing the latest sero survey findings that they described as a “ray of hope”, but added that a large part of the population is still vulnerable and future waves cannot be ruled out.The study covered 28,975 people who were tested for antibodies for Sars-CoV-2. In all, 67.6% of the participants tested positive as a result of either an infection or because they took a vaccine.“Two-thirds of the general population, above the age of six, had antibodies. More importantly, a third of the population did not have antibodies, which is roughly 400 million people,” said Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), at the government’s routine press briefing.The official said that among the people surveyed, 12,607 did not take any dose of a vaccine. Among the rest, 5,038 had one dose and 2,631 had two.The seroprevalence among the unvaccinated was 62.3%. In those who had a vaccine, the prevalence rate was 81% for those with one shot, and 90% for those who took both doses.Samples were taken “in the last 10 days of June and the first week of July”, Bhargava said, and added that the survey design was different from the past nationwide sero surveys since this one included children above the age of six. “But the survey was held in the same 70 districts spread across 21 states,” he said.India’s third nationwide sero survey, which covered 28,589 people, was completed in early January, when prevalence was 24.1%. Till January 10, India had roughly 10.4 million infections. India’s second wave of infections broke out in late March and peaked in April-May. Till July 10, roughly the time when the latest sero study ended, the cumulative cases were at 30.8 million.Also Read | Covid-19 antibodies last at least nine months after infection, here's howHaving Sars-CoV-2 antibodies offers protection from Covid-19 – the higher the concentration, the lower are the chances of a reinfection or symptomatic disease, research has shown. In the real world, this has meant that a past infection or vaccination helps prevent symptomatic or serious disease, if not an infection altogether.“Implications of this sero survey clearly show there is a ray of hope, but there is no room for complacency. We must maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour, and community engagement,” said Bhargava. He also clarified that the survey could not be used to estimate local-level parameters.“State-led sentinel sero survey should inform further local-level action. State heterogeneity indicates possibility of future wave of infections. Where sero prevalence is lower, chances of future wave of infection is higher,” he said to reiterate the need to maintain curbs on activities.“Societal, public, religious and political congregations should be avoided. Non-essential travel must be discouraged, and [people should] travel only when fully vaccinated. The way forward is to ensure full vaccination among health care workers as soon as possible and to encourage vaccination in vulnerable groups,” he said.A second government expert, too, stressed on the need to maintain precautions. “The important thing to note is that 40 crore people have no antibodies. We would like them to gain protection through vaccination and not an infection. Because such a large pool of vulnerable population is still among us -- one out of three -- the pandemic is in no way over. Second wave is still persisting. Danger of outbreak is still very much there,” said VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (Health).Experts said that the findings should be seen cautiously and warned against making assumptions about so-called herd or population immunity. “The aggregated data at the national level is a piece of good news but not a reason to celebrate or have unreasonable optimism. We should be very careful and not jump the gun in declaring that we are nearer the threshold of population immunity. We can still have major outbreaks, as we see in the UK, Israel, and others,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Also Read | Sero survey in Punjab to focus on 6-17 age groupHerd immunity or population immunity refers to a level of protection in a community where there are too few people left for an infectious pathogen to spread. For Sars-CoV-2, this level was initially thought to be around 66% for the virus that was first seen in Wuhan. For the Delta variant, the threshold is believed to have risen to 80-87.5%, since the mutations make it spread significantly faster.But the concept has also been tricky in the case of Covid-19 for other reasons. Herd immunity is a concept accounted for in the case of vaccination-induced immunity. Additionally, antibodies from a natural infection can vary between people and tend to wane after a particular amount of time.Dr Babu said these were among several caveats to keep in mind. “One, even if this is truly representative, there is a high proportion of uninfected and unvaccinated persons in India. Two, there can be a disproportionately higher susceptible pool of uninfected persons in certain regions and some age groups. We should ramp up the vaccination coverage and widen it to ensure susceptibility levels should decrease. Finally, we do not know much about the proportion of reinfections in the community and antibody waning in the general population,” he added.Protection from Covid-19 also depends on a second line of defence of the immune system, which involves T cells and B cells. At the same time, new variants of the coronavirus can help the virus evade immunity from a past infection as well as vaccination -- although people are still expected to be somewhat protected from severe disease and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antibodies-in-68-indians-101626804217418.html
21-07-2021||India||No party wants law to clean up politics, rues Supreme Court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that no political party was interested in framing a law to decriminalise politics by banning candidates against whom grave charges have been framed by the courts, adding that the legislative wing of the government has not been keen on taking a step in this direction.“There is unity in diversity,” quipped the bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai. “Unfortunately, we can’t legislate. We have been telling the legislature to take action against the candidates against whom charges have been framed but nothing has been done. Nothing is done and nothing will ever be done by any party,” the court said.The bench was hearing a contempt petition filed by advocate Brajesh Singh, who alleged wilful disobedience of court orders by various political parties during the Bihar assembly elections in 2020.Singh’s petition cited a Supreme Court judgment in February 2020, making it mandatory for all political parties to put up on their websites and also publish in two newspapers information regarding the pending criminal cases against candidates being fielded by them and the reasons for selecting them. Singh contended that several parties failed to put in public domain the details of criminal antecedents of their candidates, apart from just citing their winnability as the factor for picking them.Also Read | Centre seeks 4 more weeks to frame rules on Relief to covid victims’ familiesWhile delivering its judgment last year, the top court noted an “alarming increase of criminals in politics”. Both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress welcomed the verdict at the time, and said it will help deal with the criminalisation of politics.The order was passed in response to contempt petitions, which, among other things, pointed out that despite directions given by court in an order on September 25, 2018, for decriminalisation of politics, the government and the Election Commission of India (EC) failed to take concrete steps on the issue.The Supreme Court, in its 2018 judgment, asked for an enactment of a law to decriminalise politics, instructed candidates to fill in details of pending criminal cases against them in the form provided by EC, and ordered the disclosure by parties of the background of the candidates on public platforms.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who represented the Election Commission of India, apprised the bench that there were 427 candidates with criminal antecedents who contested the assembly elections in Bihar in 2020. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) topped the list with 104 tainted candidates, followed by the BJP, which fielded 77 such candidates.Singh pointed out that after the apex court’s judgment in February, the Election Commission (EC) on March 6 wrote to all recognised political parties, making it clear that a failure to abide by the court orders will be treated as a breach under Paragraph 16A of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, under which the election symbol of a party can be suspended or withdrawn.However, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), submitted that there were myriad issues in suspending an election symbol in a polity such as India, where even panchayat polls are conducted on the party’s election symbol. “Should the symbol of a national party be cancelled because directions haven’t been followed in a state or at a panchayat level? These are issues to be pondered over,” he said.The bench asked Sibal: “Are we then expected to put our hands up in the air? If we don’t go through the route of Paragraph 16A, how do we go about it?”Sibal replied that the top court should authorise EC under Article 324 (power of superintendence, direction and control of elections) to debar any candidate against whom the charges under offences entailing more than seven years in jail have been framed.But the bench retorted that a five-judge bench in 2018 clarified that a constitutional court could not issue such directions since there was no provision in the Constitution or any statute to back such a sanction. “But we will definitely think over your suggestion. You give us a note, and we will see what we can do within the parameters of the 2018 judgment,” it said.The bench added: “What we are sure about is that the legislative branch will never do this. I am sure about this that not in the near future but in any future, they won’t do it.”Also Read | SC quashes part of UPA-era constitutional amendmentUnder the Representation of People Act, an MP or an MLA convicted by court and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of more than two years is disqualified from contesting elections for the imprisoned period and a further period of years from his release. There is no provision for disqualifying any candidate prior to conviction. The Act disqualifies a candidate for the use of corrupt practice in the elections, which needs to be proven by another candidate in opposition before a court.In a separate case, where the Supreme Court is monitoring the constitution of special courts for expediting the trial of sitting MPs and MLAs, statistics have revealed that a total of 4,442 cases were pending against MPs and MLAs in special courts across the country as on September 1, 2020. Out of this, sitting legislators are accused persons in 2,556 cases.Senior advocate Harish Salve, who also appeared for EC, told the bench that the suspension of an election symbol should be the last resort in instances of “most egregious defaults” by the political parties because too many political parties will be thrown out of the electoral arena if every default will lead to taking away the election symbol.“Winnability is always the chief criteria in picking up candidates and that is why the voters will have to understand this, reject this. For now, the court may censure all the parties in default and issue a warning that if they don’t follow the court orders, 16A (suspension of symbol) will be the final route,” Salve added.The court also heard counsel for various parties, including the BJP, Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Lok Janshakti Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and NCP, as it reserved its order on issuing further directions in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-party-wants-law-to-clean-up-politics-rues-sc-101626804215480.html
21-07-2021||India||Lok Sabha halted, Rajya Sabha disrupted over Pegasus snoop list||Protests over prominent politicians, journalists, constitutional authorities and even sitting ministers being allegedly targeted by Israeli spyware rocked Parliament on Tuesday with Opposition lawmakers repeatedly disrupting both Houses and demanding urgent debates on the subject.The Lok Sabha failed to transact any business and the Rajya Sabha managed to hold a debate on the country’s Covid-19 situation later in the day.The disruptions came a day after a global investigative consortium reported that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa, election strategist Prashant Kishor, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Abhishek Banerjee and two sitting Union ministers were among people potentially targeted by Israeli phone hacking software Pegasus.“There are issues of concern. We should not read only in the newspapers or see it on the TV,” said Congress’s deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, demanding a debate.To be sure, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. In the absence of digital forensics of specific devices, it is not possible to conclusively establish that the phones linked to these numbers were hacked.Opposition leaders from the Congress and the TMC had given notice under Rule 267— to suspend other business and take up debate on the Pegasus controversy. YSR Congress also gave a similar notice to demand a special package for Andhra Pradesh. In the Lok Sabha, MPs rushed down to the Well of the House over the Pegasus row, oil price hike and farm laws.As soon as the Lok Sabha assembled at 11am, Opposition members started shouting slogans and showing placards against the government. The House was adjourned within five minutes.When it reassembled at 2pm, the protests resumed. One of the placards in Hindi said that while people are unemployed, the government was busy with “jasoosi” (spying).Some Congress members held placards about Gandhi’s name appearing in the list of potential targets. TMC members shouted slogans against Banerjee’s phone number being in the list. Other parties such as Shiromani Akali Dal, YSR Congress and Aam Aadmi Party also protested over separate issues.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla urged the members to restore normalcy, reminding them that it is improper to raise issues from the Well. “You are all senior leaders. Don’t try to create a wrong precedent in the House,” Birla said.The House was finally adjourned for the day at 3pm.The Rajya Sabha was also disrupted in the morning but assembled for the Covid debate in the afternoon.Amid the protests, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu said that members had the right to raise important issues but “if 15 people today, 17 people yesterday, give notice under Rule 267 on a variety of issues, what is the way for the chairman to admit notices and then take the House forward?”The TMC said it will continue to disrupt Parliament till the government comes clean on the issue.“This is a serious issue and the TMC will not compromise on it. We will not let either House run till this government comes clean on the charges of snooping and surveillance. The government has spent millions to hack into phones at a time when the country is dealing with a pandemic,” TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien said.Also Read | House panel calls Home ministry, MeitY and DoT over Pegasus reportsEarlier in the day, some Opposition leaders in the Rajya Sabha held an informal meeting — the first such effort towards floor coordination — on how to balance between the two key issues: Pegasus controversy and the Covid-19 debate. The leaders decided that the Upper House won’t be allowed to run for anything else except the Covid-19 debate.A highly invasive malware, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy. In some cases, it can be installed without the need to trick a user into initiating a download. In 2019, WhatsApp disclosed that 121 users from India were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities using Pegasus.The investigation is based on a data leak of around 50,000 numbers obtained by Amnesty International and Paris-based Forbidden Stories, a non-profit organisation. Amnesty International subsequently forensically investigated 67 of these phones, and found 23 hacked and 14 showing signs of attempted penetration. The Wire reported that 10 of the phones forensically examined in India showed they had either been hacked or signs of an attempted hacking.Pegasus’s manufacturer, Israel-based NSO group, called the investigation “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories”, and said it sold its software “solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments”.Also Read | ‘International conspiracy to defame India’: Assam CM on Pegasus rowThe consortium – which comprises 17 media organisations, including The Guardian, The Washington Post, Le Monde and Indian news website The Wire – published on Sunday that 38 Indian journalists, including three current Hindustan Times staffers and one from sister publication Mint, were among 180 journalists potentially targeted worldwide, including Financial Times editor Roula Khalaf, and reporters from the Wall Street Journal, CNN, New York Times, and Le Monde.On Monday, it reported that Gandhi, Lavasa, information and technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, jal shakti minister of state Prahlad Singh Patel, public health experts Gagandeep Kang and M Hari Menon, and the woman who accused then chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in 2019, were potentially targeted.The government denied any involvement.“Aap Chronology Samajhiye! [Understand the chronology] This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress,” Union home minister Amit Shah said in a statement on Monday.Vaishnaw told Parliament – hours before his name was revealed in the list -- that the allegations were an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”. “Time tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur,” he said in his first speech as IT minister in the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-halted-rs-disrupted-over-pegasus-snoop-list-101626804156931.html
21-07-2021||India||Stalin aims to make Tamil Nadu USD 1 trillion economy by 2030||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has set an ambitious target for the state to become a USD 1-trillion economy by 2030. “We want Tamil Nadu to be one of the best states in South Asia. Our government’s target is to make Tamil Nadu a USD 1 trillion economy,” Stalin said, speaking at the Investors Conclave organised by the industries department, in Chennai on Tuesday. “A conducive environment to attract investments to Tamil Nadu should be created,” he added.The state industry department’s principal secretary, N Muruganandan, speaking at the function added that the chief minister has set a target to bring in investment of ₹23 lakh crore by 2030.During the event, the total investment committed to 49 projects came to around Rs. 28,508 crores and employment opportunities to 83,482 people. This included the Tamil Nadu government entering into 35 MoUs with a cumulative investment of ₹17,141 crores and employment opportunities for 55,054 people. These are the first series of investments inked by the two-month-old DMK government, officials said.Guidance Tamil Nadu, the state nodal agency for investment promotion, has entered into an MoU with American Tamil Entrepreneurs Association (ATEA) to promote start-ups in the fields of innovation, research and development. The government has sanctioned a grant of ₹five crore to five start-ups selected for this program.An MoU was signed between General Electric Company and TIDCO to establish a Centre of Excellence to enhance the production of aircraft and aeronautical components for industries in the aerospace and defence sector using advanced manufacturing technologies.The investments are in the fields of power plants, electronics, auto components, industrial parks, IT/ITeS services, food processing, footwear, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. The tie-ups are with companies such as JSW Energy to set up 450 MW Wind Power Generation in Tuticorin, Tirunelveli, Dindigul and Tiruppur with a ₹3000-crore investment.Germany-based ZF Wabco is to make auto components in SIPCOT Oragadam Phase 2 in Kancheepuram with an investment worth ₹1,800 crore. Singapore-based Capital Land is to set up a data centre in Chennai for 1,200 crore and Tata Consultancy Services will generate employment for 15,000 people for their Phase III project at Sipcot Siruseri with an investment worth ₹900 crore.Former national president of All India Manufacturers’ Organisation and convener of Consortium of Indian Associations, KE Raghunathan, said that the state’s target of USD one trillion economy is achievable but external factors, such as the pandemic, will have an impact.“Reaching that mark is feasible because Tamil Nadu is a state that is industrial, it has decentralised empowerment, it produces close to 150,000 engineers every year,” he said. In Raghunathan’s view, Tuesday’s developments show that the investments cover an array of various industries unlike in Global Investors’ Meet (GIM) where 90% of the investments were in the renewable energy sector. The investment sites are spread throughout Tamil Nadu and the government had recognised high-value and low-value projects equally, he said.“Tamil Nadu had cornered all the neighbouring states (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala) by positioning industrial estates at the border points but in the last 15-20 years we seem to have lost that advantage,” said Raghunathan.“Normally, industries are wary when a government is in transition. By continuing with projects signed by the previous (AIADMK) regime, Stalin has conveyed a signal that he will not hamper the commitments made to those industries coming into Tamil Nadu.” The next step, he said, is the MSME development in Tamil Nadu.“Where is Stalin going to lead the entrepreneurs who are already doing business in Tamil Nadu? How is he going to save them from the losses they incurred during Covid-19? Any corporate which sets up large units will need to depend on the local entrepreneurs.”Stalin launched a Single Window Portal 2.0 with upgraded digital services such as parallel processing of clearances, virtual meeting with departments, an Artificial Intelligence-based Chatbot and approval for select clearances for existing and new investors.Stalin also laid the foundation stones for nine projects, with a total investment commitment of ₹4,250 crores, including AG&P Pratham’s commissioning of a station at an investment of ₹1,700 crore. He inaugurated five projects with a cumulative investment of Rs. 7,117 crores including UAE’s Integrated Chennai Business Park DP World located in Thiruvallur at an investment of ₹1,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-aims-to-make-tamil-nadu-usd-1-trillion-economy-by-2013-101626801217235.html

However, an official announcement on the visit is awaited.Jaishankar and Blinken have met thrice in the past one year, with the latest coinciding with the Indian foreign minister's visit to the United States in May.During the visit, the two leaders spoke on a wide range of issues, including Covid-19 relief, efforts to strengthen Indo-Pacific cooperation through the Quad initiative, the security situation in Afghanistan and combatting climate change, among others.The Quad, also known as Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is a strategic dialogue between the United States, Japan, Australia and India during which the countries discuss economic and military cooperation.Blinken and Jaishankar may talk on a range of issues in New Delhi, including Covid-19 vaccines, the security crisis in Afghanistan in the aftermath of US troop pullout and China assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.Blinken would be the second top official of the Biden Administration to visit India after US Secretary of Defence Llyod J Austin flew to New Delhi in March.Blinken's visit also assumes in significance ahead of the Quad summit in October when US President Joe Biden would host the leaders of Australia, India and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antony-blinken-may-meet-pm-modi-during-expected-india-visit-next-week-centre-101626796466354.html
21-07-2021||India||Decoding the legality of ‘authorised’ surveillance in India||Use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for alleged phone tapping of prominent personalities, including journalists, politicians and experts in India, has given rise to host of issues pertaining to cyber security threats and state-mandated surveillance that bypass the concept of trusted communications.In a statement in Lok Sabha, IT and Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that “any sort of illegal surveillance” by unauthorised persons is not possible in India where statutes prescribe a well-settled procedure for carrying out lawful interception as per the due process of law.What are the provisions allowing interception of electronic communication in India?Pertinent provisions in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2000 authorise the Union and the state governments to intercept all types of electronic communication, including phone calls, e-mails, WhatsApp messages etc.Under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, agencies at the Centre and states can intercept electronic communication “on the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of the public safety”. The law empowers designated officials to put a device under surveillance on being satisfied that “it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence”. Reasons for ordering interception has to be recorded in writing by the officials concerned.Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules identifies the officers who can order surveillance of messages. It lays down that a secretary to the Government of India in the ministry of home affairs can pass orders of interception in the case of Centre, and a secretary-level officer who is in-charge of the home department can issue such directives in the case of a state government. In unavoidable circumstances, Rule 419A adds, such orders may be made by an officer, not below the rank of a joint secretary to the Government of India, who has been duly authorised by the Union home secretary or the state home secretary.The directions for interception can remain in force for a period not exceeding 60 days from the date of issue and may be renewed upon an approval of the competent authority up to for a total period of 180 days. Records pertaining to interception are to be destroyed every six months unless these are likely to be required for “functional requirements”. The service providers must also destroy records pertaining to directions for interception of message within two months of discontinuance of the interception of such messages.Rule 419A also prescribes for a review committee, separately at the level of the Centre and states. While the Cabinet Secretary heads the review committee at the Centre, the chief secretary of the concerned state is the chairman of the state review committee. All orders on interception are required to be sent to the review committee within seven working days of such directives. Review committees are obligated to ensure that interception orders are reasoned, proper and justified.Similarly, Section 69 of the Information Technology Act 2000, together with the Information Technology (Procedure for Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules 2009, authorises the agencies to issue directions for interception or monitoring or decryption of information through any computer resource, including mobile phones.Section 69 states that interception is permissible “in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above or for investigation of any offence”.How have constitutional courts viewed the power of surveillance with State?The first major judgment by the Supreme Court on the issue surveillance came in 1964. A seven-judge bench, in Kharak Singh Vs The State of Uttar Pradesh, adjudicated whether a police officer was entitled under the UP Police Regulations to visit any individual’s house for a physical “surveillance” and if such “domiciliary visits at night” violated any fundamental right. The Constitution bench held that such a surveillance was violative of Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of individuals since there was no law under which the said regulation could be justified. “An unauthorised intrusion into a person’s home and the disturbance caused to him thereby, is as it were the violation of a common law right of a man- an ultimate essential of ordered liberty, if not of the very concept of civilisation,” held the court.The next case saw a shift from physical surveillance to surveillance through intercepting devices. An important case on interception and the power to do so was instituted in the Supreme Court by NGO People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) in 1991. PUCL had argued that any order for telephone tapping should be sanctioned by judicial authorities at the Centre and in the states to prevent arbitrary and politically motivated decisions to tap telephones of different people. The NGO challenged the constitutional validity of Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act. In the alternative, the petition pleaded that the said provisions be suitably read down to include procedural safeguards to rule out arbitrariness and to prevent the indiscriminate telephone-tapping.The Supreme Court, in its judgment in the PUCL case in 1996, held that right to privacy would certainly include telephonic conversation in the privacy of one’s home or office and, “telephone-tapping would, thus, infract Article 21 of the Constitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law.” It ruled that “public emergency” and “interest of public safety” are the precursors to any phone tapping and all interception must arise out of these concerns. The court further noted that there were no rules in vogue to guide such interception and issued a slew of directions on how and when a phone can be tapped, holding “it is necessary to lay down procedural safeguards for the exercise of power”. The court said that the directions issued by it will remain operational till the time the Centre framed suitable rules under the Act. Subsequently, the Centre codified the guidelines in 2007 by engrafting Rule 419A, borrowing from the directions issued by the apex court. However, considering the fact that there was an absence of any provision in the Telegraph Act permitting judicial oversight of phone tapping orders and also the fact that in a similar law in UK — the Interception of the Communications Act, 1985, interception did not require judicial oversight, the Supreme Court did not issue any direction on judicial oversight of interception orders.Right to privacy Vs SurveillanceStarting from the Kharak Singh case in 1964, the Supreme Court acknowledged the significance of right to privacy whenever the issue of surveillance by a state agency came up. The judgment in Kharak Singh underscored that “nothing is more deleterious to a man’s physical happiness and health than a calculated interference with his privacy”. All the seven judges were unanimous that right to privacy is a part of the right to “protection of life and personal liberty” guaranteed under Article 21.In R Rajgopal alias RR Gopal and another Vs State of Tamil Nadu (1994), the Supreme Court held that the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. The judgment added that it is a “right to be let alone” and every citizen has a right “to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters”.Taking a cue from these declarations, the apex court in the PUCL case, too, said that the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one’s home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as “right to privacy” and there must be a just and fair procedure established by the law to curtail this liberty in the larger public interest.Meanwhile, in 2010, former chairman of the Tata Group and industrialist Ratan Tata filed a writ petition, alleging violation of his right to privacy following the leak of the Niira Radia tapes. Between 2008 and 2009, the income tax department tapped the phone lines of Nira Radia, a political lobbyist, for almost a year. Subsequently, in 2010, some of the recorded tapes were leaked, resulting in the publication of a small portion of the tapes recorded by the department. These tapes included conversations between Radia and a number of public figures, including politicians, journalists, and business houses. One such public figure was Ratan Tata. Tata’s petition emphasised that the government has no right to intercept telephonic conversations if it did not have a mechanism to protect the privacy of citizens. It sought a probe into the leak and a directive to the authorities to retrieve all leaked recordings. Importantly, Tata did not challenge the right of the government to intercept.This case had an effective hearing last in August 2013 when the court framed three issues: Right to privacy vis-a-vis the Government; right to privacy vis-a-vis the Press; and right to know the information. The last time this case got listed was in July 2019 after which it has not come up for a hearing yet.The judicial debate on the status of the right to privacy was, however, settled in August 2017 when a nine-judge bench held that right to privacy is a fundamental right that will be protected by the constitutional courts in the country. This judgment highlighted that the informational traces are also an area which falls within the realm of the right of privacy and such data is as personal as that of the choice of appearance and apparel. “Telephone tappings and internet hacking by State, of personal data is another area which falls within the realm of privacy,” added the court.The privacy judgment lays down a four-fold test that needs to be fulfilled before state intervention in the right to privacy: 1) The state action must be sanctioned by law; 2) In a democratic society, there must be a legitimate aim for action; 3) Action must be proportionate to the need for such interference; and 4) It must be subject to procedural guarantees against abuse of the power to interfere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-the-legality-of-authorised-surveillance-in-india-101626719551709.html
21-07-2021||India||Kharif sowing so far lags last year’s by 11%||A patchy monsoon continues to crimp planting of kharif or summer-sown crops, as the total area sown by farmers till mid-July, a period when sowing peaks, was down 11% from a year ago, official data show. Total acreage of kharif crops stood at 61.1 million hectare, nearly 11% less than the 69.2 million hectare sown during the corresponding period last year.The June-September rain-bearing system, which waters nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area, is deficient by 8% since its onset in June, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The national weather agency officially forecast a normal monsoon, which helps farmers grow plentiful crops. This week’s forecast valid until July 25 has predicted “active monsoon conditions” across the country.While rains were plentiful after their onset, recording 28% surplus up until the third week of June, the monsoon entered a hiatus around June 19 driven by unfavourable weather patterns. It has yet to recover fully. In July, the most critical month during the kharif season because it determines yields and crop health, rainfall so far has been 26% deficient. “When July rains are deficient, it first impacts areas with no irrigation,” said Jeet Singh Sandhu, vice-chancellor of the SKN Agricultural University, Jaipur.On July 18, Union minister of science and technology, Jitendra Singh, visited the IMD’s headquarters in New Delhi to enquire about the monsoon’s progress, urging scientists to “focus on more accurate forecasting”, according to a statement from Singh’s ministry.The monsoon is critical for Asia’s third-largest economy, as half of the population depends on a farm-derived income. The rains also replenish more than 100 nationally important reservoirs, critical for drinking, power supply, and irrigation.A good harvest drives up rural demand for goods and services, helping the economy grow.The monsoon is one of the factors that also influence the Reserve Bank’s inflation forecast and monetary policy, which determines key interest rates.In 2020-21, when India faced a recession due to the pandemic, agriculture was the only sector to post positive growth of about 3.1%. This helped to keep farm incomes steady. This year, robust farm incomes are critical too to cushion the impact of a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections. The share of agriculture in the country’s gross domestic product, a key measure of output, is nearly 17%.Overall, the total area under crops till mid-July, when compared to normal area, was less by 3%, but some crops critical to keeping food prices low showed deficiencies. The normal area is an average of the area cultivated during the past five years.As on July 16, 2021, the area under rice, a key driver of farm incomes, stood at 16 million hectare, which is near normal but 7% down from last year’s levels.The area under pulses, a key driver of food inflation during periodic shortages, was 13% below normal at 7 million hectare. Compared to last year, the area under pulses is lower by 12%. Planting of coarse cereals like sorghum and pearl millet – crops usually grown by the poorest farmers with small landholdings – is down 21% compared to what is considered normal for this time of the year.Last year, driven by robust showers, sowing of kharif crops had risen sharply, exceeding normal levels in June itself.“There could be a major shift in soybean, cotton and maize acreages across the rainfall deficit states if monsoon fails to revive as forecast,” said Hetal Gandhi, an economist with Crisil Ltd, Mumbai, a ratings firm.Farmers have managed to sow oilseeds, such as soybean, in about 12 million hectare, which is close to normal levels but down 14% since a year ago, the official data show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kharif-sowing-so-far-lags-last-year-s-by-11-101626719431341.html
21-07-2021||Today's||Intelligence agencies need greater scrutiny||L’affaire Pegasus has once again focused attention on the unbridled power that intelligence structures in India possess and deploy. They have enormous budgets that are not subject to legislative scrutiny and have minimal executive oversight. These intelligence structures, in the name of operational secrecy, make every attempt to keep the political and bureaucratic executive out of the loop.Unfortunately, misuse of intelligence agencies and the police for political purposes is rampant. It is far too tempting not to do so when untrammelled powers of intrusion into the personal lives of people are available at the click of a button. The dividing line separating national security imperatives from plain snooping on political opponents, inconvenient journalists and civil society actors is a Rubicon that is crossed with impunity on a daily basis.Even before the advent of modern technology there were sleuths who would physically stalk people and surveil their homes. Then came the ubiquitous telephone. The Government of India (GOI) incessantly contested initiatives to put robust authorisation procedures in place to intercept phone conversations. The Supreme Court (SC) finally intervened decisively in PUCL vs Union of India (1997) and put a legal architecture in place that now must be followed before a telephone tête-à-tête can be lawfully intercepted.The political trigger for this judgment sprung from an allegation made by former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar in the spring of 1990. He accused the then VP Singh-led government of illicitly tapping the telephones of 27 politicians, including his own. The allegation led to a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry. The investigation exposed just how omnipresent, routine illegal telephone tapping was.The CBI report opened a Pandora’s Box. It delineated how tardy the legal framework was. It itemised the procedural lapses that made such misuse of power possible. Phone tapping was recurrently carried out without proper sanction. It persevered for far lengthier periods than was legally permissible. It was often based on false premises.The PUCL judgment asserted that telephone tapping transgressed the fundamental right to privacy. It fashioned protections against capriciousness in the exercise of the State’s surveillance practices.Even though the court had constructed PUCL guidelines as a provisional answer, pending remedial action by the central government against the abuse of its surveillance powers, these guidelines attempted to firewall Indian surveillance paradigms. Even in the cyber age, the Information Technology Act and the rules therein governing internet surveillance derive their legal jurisprudence from these PUCL truisms.This judgment, in fact, laid the foundation for Puttuswamy vs Union of India (2017) where a nine-judge SC bench upheld that the right to privacy as a fundamental right, but subject to riders. It paved the way for a holistic debate on a new privacy law for India. Justice Srikrishna suggested a model law to safeguard the privacy of individuals and other organisations.Departing majorly in substance from the Srikrishna committee report, the government brought a personal data protection bill before Parliament that was referred to a parliamentary joint committee on December 11, 2019.During the most virulent phase of Covid-19, a few brave Members of Parliament (including this author) sat at length and the committee wrapped up its deliberations in December 2020. However, for seven long months, neither the chairperson nor the secretariat has circulated the draft report and the proposed amendments to the legislation to the committee for its final adoption. It is obvious that the government is disinclined to bring a data protection law onto the statute books.However, as long as there is no parliamentary oversight at the Centre over the functioning of intelligence agencies, this chronic disease will never be exorcised from India’s governance paradigm. A similar legislative watch is required in the states too. Both from the national security and the civil liberties point of view, it is inappropriate to allow law enforcement and intelligence services to function without a sound and well-defined legal basis. In fact, in an information and litigation age, it has both an inhibiting and even a debilitating impact on the practioners themselves.In evolved democracies, and, surprisingly, even in authoritarian states, intelligence agencies are anchored in law and subject to legislative examination. In the United States, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was created by the National Security Act of 1947 and empowered by the CIA Act of 1949. MI5, the domestic intelligence service of the United Kingdom, draws its legal authority from the Security Services Act, 1989, and its sister organisation, MI6, from the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, thereby subjecting their activities to the scrutiny of the British Parliament’s intelligence and security committee.The Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia draws its legal basis from the Law on Foreign Intelligence Organs, 1996. The German Federal Intelligence Service, Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), draws its legal sustenance from the Federal Intelligence Service Law, 1990. Its activities are supervised by the Parliamentary Control Commission (PKK) for intelligence services which, in turn, is legally embedded in the Parliamentary Control of Intelligence Activities Act, 1978.To provide a legal architecture and parliamentary oversight for Indian intelligence structures such as the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing and National Technical Research Organisation, I moved a private members bill titled, The Intelligence Services (Powers and Regulation Bill), 2011, on August 5, 2011. The bill lapsed when I moved to the government in 2012. I have slotted it again for reintroduction in the Lok Sabha.

21-07-2021||Today's||Caste-blindness: Those from marginalised communities don’t want to return to the ’60s||What makes Karan Thapar’s writing compelling is his ability to put complex things in simple terms. Of course, the most effective communication involves articulating the most complex of issues in lucid language, but one should not lose sight of the underlying complex realities. Thapar’s nostalgic reminiscences about the 1960s in this newspaper on July 11, where he revisited the world as he saw it from the privileged perch of Doon School, where he studied, falls in the latter category. In the world that Thapar inhabited, he did not see any form of discrimination on caste and religion. At the end, all that he wants is to return to those days, or perhaps nostalgically, have those days returned to India. Those who believe in the constitutionally laid down idea of India will agree with Thapar’s denunciation of Hindutva forces or comments on “love jihad”. However, that does not necessarily mean that they want to return to the 1960s. In fact, Thapar’s lament is itself a testament to the fact that his school life was far removed from the real India. It is this disconnect of the elites from the realities that has paved the way for the present phase of intolerance which seems all-pervasive. When Thapar proudly proclaims that he did not witness any discrimination during his school days, the reason is not difficult to fathom. It is indeed very likely that almost all of his fellow classmates at the institution came from a similar socio-cultural milieu, far removed from the drudgery that the not-so-privileged went through in their everyday lives. And one can be certain that those who undertook the menial jobs in the school — the washerman, the toilet cleaner, the gardener, the cook — belonged to the marginalised and deprived sections, who had been doing the same job for generations. The India of the 1960s and 1970s was different. Getting back on its feet post-Independence, all major wings of governance were dominated by the erudite class (read upper caste). While we have certainly come a long way since then, it is still a work in progress. Even today, India is largely an upper caste and upper class preserve. A recent report in this newspaper, on May 21, shows how the representation of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe/Other Backward Class communities in the teaching faculty is less than six per cent in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur. Only 91 of a total of over 700 faculty members are women. Is it any surprise then that in such a closed endogamous institute, a teacher hurled casteist abuse at her students, only because she was certain that she could get away with it? The recent resignation of Vipin P Veetil from IIT Madras, alleging caste-based discrimination, is another pointer to the lack of diversity. And of course, who can forget the words of Rohith Vemula, who wrote in his suicide note, “My birth is my fatal accident”.Even in the media, Dalits and other marginalised communities are missing from leadership positions. A 2019 report states that out of 121 newsroom leadership positions under study, 106 were occupied by upper castes, five by other backward classes and six by people from minority communities. 75% of anchors conducting debates on television belong to upper castes. Not one was Dalit, Adivasi, or OBC. All this proves that despite progress, even today, India’s information ecosystem is skewed in favour of upper castes. Even when they are well-intentioned and compassionate, their understanding of India that lives down the hill is disconnected from reality, just as many political leaders from the rural belt do not seem to understand gender discrimination. It is high time India’s Leftists and liberals understand that caste (not merely class), has been the basis of discrimination since time immemorial.I did not have the privilege of being insulated from reality of caste (and class) discrimination and violence, and for that, I am the better. I can offer Thapar the insight that he missed — a journey to my village in Khagaria, Bihar, where nobody yearns for a return to the 1960s.Chandan Yadav is national secretary, Indian National Congress The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/casteblindness-the-marginalised-don-t-want-to-revisit-the-60s-101626878080490.html
21-07-2021||Today's||Open schools, with a focus on early grades||Even before the pandemic, India faced a severe learning crisis — with nearly 50% of class 5 students in rural India unable to read at even class 2 level. The pandemic and 16 months of school closures have almost certainly made the situation worse. A recent study by the Azim Premji University estimates that 92% of children in classes 2-6 have lost their language skills and that 82% have lost math skills. The costs of these 16 months of school closures are likely to be long-lasting and could potentially scar an entire generation of Indians. For instance, in a recent study on the consequences of the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, economist Jishnu Das and colleagues found that just four months of school closures led to learning losses of nearly two entire grade levels over time. How could four months of school closure lead to two years of learning loss? One possibility is that teachers continued with regular grade-level instruction and children who had fallen behind could no longer keep up. In other words, missing even four months of school not only hurt the level of learning, but may have permanently reduced the rate of learning in school, leading to a much larger cumulative learning losses over time. Another key insight was that learning losses were highly unequal; children with educated mothers were able to make up for school closures but children with uneducated mothers were particularly badly affected. Thus, the trade-off between increased infection risk from opening schools and loss of learning from keeping them closed is likely to vary sharply by socio-economic status. For educated parents with access to technology at home (who dominate the public discourse), it may have made sense to teach their children at home. But, for tens of millions of children with uneducated parents and limited access to technology, the costs of school closures are likely to have been much higher.Thus, the single most important task for the new education minister is to ensure rapid but safe opening of schools. The minister has stated that implementing the new National Education Policy (NEP) is his top goal, and NEP correctly identifies that the highest priority for our education system should be to deliver universal Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN). However, this goal will be stillborn if schools remain closed.Fortunately, we now know enough about Covid-19 to be able to open schools safely. Entities such as Unicef, Unesco, the World Bank, and the India Task Force of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission have all put out detailed recommendations to guide school reopening efforts while minimising infection risk. In reopening schools, we should aim to implement these recommendations and minimise health risks. In addition, I outline six key principles to ensure that school reopening can mitigate learning losses.First, consistent with school education being a state subject, the decision on opening schools and the modalities for doing so should continue to be left to the states. However, the central government should provide guidelines, technical support, and financial resources to make it easier for states to do so.Second, while the instinct of many officials is to first open classes 9-12 because of board exams, the bigger priority should be opening classes 1-5 to ensure universal mastery of foundational skills as prioritised by NEP. A large body of evidence highlights the importance of early years in the formation of human capital and our school opening priorities should reflect this. Further, while older children can still absorb content online, through self-study, and virtual groups, in-person interactions with teachers are much more important at younger ages.Third, it is essential to pay attention not just to opening schools but to modifying pedagogy to account for 16 months of school closures. Simply teaching the textbook may be ineffective if children have fallen far behind grade-level standards. Rather, schools and teachers should be encouraged to focus less on the textbook, and more on basic skills of literacy and numeracy and remediating learning losses.Fourth, we should move from the rigid “scheme-based” model of central government funding to a more flexible model with greater spending autonomy to states and districts. For instance, one innovative idea proposed recently by Rukmini Banerjee of Pratham Education Foundation is that Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) funds be used to pay daily honorariums to 10th and 12th pass youth in villages who provide remedial instruction to help children make up for learning losses. More generally, since we are in uncharted territory, we will need to innovate, iterate, and respond quickly based on varying ground realities across the country.Fifth, school openings should not be treated as an all-or-nothing decision. There are likely to be substantial benefits even from a partial reopening of schools (e.g. where 50% of students in a class attend every alternate day). This will enable social distancing while allowing students to engage with teachers and peers.Finally, since private schools account for nearly 50% of school enrollment in India, they should also be allowed to open under the same guidelines as government schools.Media and policy attention during the pandemic understandably focused on the immediate tasks of saving lives by procuring beds and oxygen. Yet, the greatest long-term cost of the pandemic may be borne by our children. As the second wave of Covid-19 recedes, and we slowly try to restore a semblance of normality, one of our top priorities as a country should be to open schools safely.

21-07-2021||Today's||In Afghanistan, how India missed the bus||As I travelled to Kandahar on October 4, 2011, the day India signed the Agreement on Strategic Partnership (ASP) with Afghanistan, I could feel a sense of optimism and achievement among Afghan officials, politicians, business and women’s groups in the province. There was overwhelming hope that India would be an enduring and reliable friend. ASP was meant to institutionalise the decade long gains India had made through its development assistance policy.From the saga of the hijacking of IC-814 in December 1999 and negotiations in Kandahar for the release of the aircraft to the closure of its mission in Afghanistan during the Taliban regime, India had come a long way in re-establishing its presence in the war-ravaged country after 2001. Two decades later, however, with the closure of its consulate and evacuation of the diplomatic staff from Kandahar on July 10, India is left to salvage whatever little it can from its two-decade-long engagement.As the Taliban captures district after district, the fall of Kabul looks imminent, unless the United States (US) and the international community realise the folly of surrendering the country to the insurgents. There is uncertainty in New Delhi about how to deal with the rapidly changing Afghan scenario. The responses have ranged from support to the Afghan government to support for peace talks to even outreach to the Taliban.The Taliban, it is certain, no longer requires the pretence of a peace process to capture power. That can be achieved in a matter of months by using extreme violence that breaks the morale of the Afghanistan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF). Kabul can only hope to delay the inevitable by garrisoning its forces and retaining control over some of the urban centres, and allowing the insurgents to take over large swathes of the country. Without external assistance that resembles nothing short of the 2001 intervention, Afghanistan is all set to slide into the chaos of the 1990s. The swiftness with which the insurgents have continued vanquishing the ANDSF underlines two disturbing facts. First, two decades of military operations against the insurgents by the US and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces had little impact on the Taliban’s operational capacity. In spite of the reported leadership squabble and factionalism, the Taliban was able to project a unified leadership, and recruit, regroup and arm their foot soldiers from sanctuaries in Pakistan.Second, the billions spent on creating a modern security architecture comprising intelligence, police and army wings have not yielded the desired result in Afghanistan. Moreover, in the absence of airpower support, it will be a Herculean task for the ANDSF to curtail the insurgent onslaught.President Joe Biden is unlikely to halt the pull-out of US forces by linking it to the conditions on the ground, let alone reverse his decision and redeploy the withdrawn forces. With the reported domination over a large chunk per cent of territory, the Taliban does not need to stay engaged in the peace process. Even if it does so, for the sake of paying lip service to the February 2020 agreement with the US, the Afghan government has little leverage left to negotiate from a position of strength. With the ANDSF’s resistance disintegrating, power-brokers and warlords in Afghanistan are possibly the last frontier the Taliban has to breach in order to capture Kabul. Yet, they too are jockeying for power and influence with support from regional proxies.These developments are akin to the unfolding of the worst-case scenario for New Delhi, a return to the mid-1990s. The Taliban domination and civil war situation will effectively impinge on its plan to continue with aid and development assistance. As violence intensifies, the possibility of New Delhi being able to even maintain its diplomatic presence in the country will come under stress. India has already shut three of its four consulates. It could very well be a matter of few months before New Delhi will have to consider evacuating all its embassy and consulate staff.India is in the midst of frantic efforts to avoid such a scenario. Since it is ill-placed to halt the Taliban, it has reportedly reached out to the insurgents to open a line of communication with the probable new rulers. As revealed by a Qatari minister, a round of backchannel negotiations might have taken place between Indian security officials and unnamed Doha-based Taliban leaders. However, it is unlikely that much would result from these delayed efforts to establish contacts with the insurgents.On the other hand, reverting to its traditional friends in the Northern Alliance (NA) is no longer an option for New Delhi. The NA, an erstwhile consolidated and militarily influential entity, is a poor caricature of itself today. The warlords, who comprise the NA, can at best hope to maintain little islands of influence with their militia, as the Taliban takes over most parts of the countryside. New diplomacy has taken external affairs minister S Jaishankar on a whirlwind tour of Qatar, Iran, and Russia. However, just like its reported outreach to the Taliban, these are much-delayed efforts unlikely to salvage the situation. Having pledged aid and development assistance to Afghanistan of more than $3 billion and functioned under the US-led security umbrella, New Delhi is caught on a back foot. Without emphasis on institution-building in the long-term, most of the projects run the danger of reversal. While New Delhi may be trying desperately to end its isolation from the Afghan developments, it remains to be seen whether it will be acceptable to the influential regional players as a key stakeholder. As Afghanistan slides into chaos, New Delhi will be left to rue the missed opportunities. Following the US-led efforts in the security sector and peace process, India made little effort since 2014 (the date announced by President Obama for withdrawal) till the present with regard to long-term institution-building, stabilising the security situation, promoting inclusive peace process, building an intra-Afghan consensus, and preserving its gains. The projects and structures created by India carry very little wherewithal to withstand the Taliban’s advances and takeover. While there is substantial goodwill for India in Afghanistan, not moving in fast to help the Afghans will turn the chessboard to its disadvantage. In strategic terms, India’s loss would be Pakistan and China’s gain. In real terms, it would mean the erosion of goodwill of a friendly neighbour that looked up to India for support in times of need.Shanthie Mariet D’Souza is founding professor, Kautilya School of Public Policy, Hyderabad and founder-president, MantrayaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-afghanistan-how-india-missed-the-bus-101626793295492.html
21-07-2021||Today's||India-US trade relations need a reset. Dispel misperceptions, strike a new deal||The resurgence of tariffs as a critical foreign policy tool for the United States (US) is a departure from one of its long-upheld commitments towards free trade. The United States Trade Representative (USTR)’s June 7 announcement regarding a trade action, following its Section 301 investigation of Digital Services Tax (adopted by India, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), is a step in this direction.However, the tariff escalation will only be effective after 180 days to allow negotiations on the proposed global tax framework. India has tentatively backed the framework, but its final decision will depend on the availability of sustainable tax revenue for developing countries as part of the final deal.An analysis of the 26 products identified by USTR for the 25% tariff hike indicates that these products constituted only 0.2% of merchandise imports by the US from India in 2019. Notwithstanding the low share of these products in the US imports from India, the potential tariff hike could influence India’s price competitiveness across several products where the country holds a significant share in the US market, such as basmati rice, gems and jewellery, marine and wood products.Also Read | US won’t compel journalists to reveal sources: OfficialsSince 2016, the US administration has been increasingly undertaking trade actions against India, including tariff and non-tariff barriers and anti-dumping duties. Earlier, in June 2019, the US announced the termination of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits for India, which impacted nearly 10% of India’s exports to the US that year.Amid these bilateral trade tensions, India’s negotiations to strike a win-win trade deal with the US have been stalled for years. Likewise, negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty have also been unsuccessful due to differences in approaches to investor protection.Currently, India has an untapped merchandise export potential of nearly $25.7 billion in the US market, across a wide array of products, such as jewellery and precious metals (untapped potential worth $6.9 billion), marine products ($354.3 million), processed food ($298.6 million), and furniture ($67.6 million), according to data from the International Trade Centre. Given the significant trade potential and the importance of the US as a strategic partner, there is a need to hold concerted discussions for a trade deal.The change at the helm in the US has brought prospects for a revival of renewed globalisation. There have been some positives, such as the end of the order that suspended entry to the US across several temporary or “non-immigrant” visa categories, including H-1B. The time is ripe for India to follow through on discussions for the mini-trade deal with the US and bolster its position in the US market. India could consider focusing on negotiations for tariff relaxations and partial restoration of GSP benefits, in exchange for specific market access commitments, with due consideration to the impact on sensitive sectors such as agriculture.India also needs to dispel its image of being a country with high trade barriers. Market access issues have been vociferously raised by the US against India several times. During the 7th Trade Policy Review at the World Trade Organization, the US urged India to reduce tariffs and remove non-tariff barriers.However, according to an India Exim Bank study, India’s tariffs on imports are much lower than what they appear to be due to preferential tariffs, and various concessions and rebates under the different schemes. In 2018, India’s weighted average effectively applied tariff was only 4.9%, much lower than the simple average Most Favoured Nation tariff of 13.5%. Data from the Global Trade Alerts database further indicates that India has implemented fewer non-tariff barriers than the US. While the US implemented 1,072 harmful trade interventions affecting India since 2009, India imposed only 381 such measures affecting the US. There is also an urgent need to challenge the narrative for market access concerns raised by the US.Jahanwi Singh and Neha Raman are economists with India Exim Bank The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indiaus-trade-relations-need-a-reset-dispel-misperceptions-strike-a-new-deal-101626781835209.html
21-07-2021||Today's||Scrap sedition. Stop UAPA’s misuse||With a scathing indictment of its relevance and flagrant misuse, the Chief Justice of India has, finally, joined the chorus against the sedition law. The law commission had deliberated on the issue earlier and advised its removal, even as sections of civil society, non-governmental organisations, journalists, and lawyers have consistently highlighted the misuse of this law for political purposes. This has been accompanied by demands for compensation in cases involving long periods of incarceration and acquittal, amid all-round condemnation of the continued use of such allegedly anti-democratic laws.And yet, nothing seems to move. The Government of India (GOI) appears to be in no mood to relent. There are no fresh guidelines on the registration of such cases, nor has the subject has been discussed in the annual director-general of police (DGP) conference. Meanwhile, statistics present a grim picture: 96 persons were arrested under the sedition act in 2019 but only two were convicted. Or take the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA. From 2016 to 2019, there were 5,922 arrests under UAPA, but it resulted in only 132 convictions, a pitiable rate of 2.2%.Also Read | Had great respect for Stan Swamy’s work, says high court at his ‘bail hearing’To understand why these draconian acts persist, it is instructive to explore the role of the main actors involved in the criminal justice system – the police which registers the first information report (FIR) under these sections and investigates; the prosecution, which is independent of the police and prosecutes the cases in court; and the judiciary, which delivers the judgment.The sedition provision or UAPA is misused at the registration stage under three conditions. First, when an investigative officer uses it to enhance the gravity of the crime, to attract the attention of his superiors. Second, when he does so on directions from above. And third, when he does it himself with the confidence that it will have the approval of higher authorities.Why is there no systemic review to check this? A staggering number of supervisory officers choose to ignore it, right from the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), SP, deputy inspector-general (DIG), to IG. As special cases, they are also reflected in several weekly or fortnightly reports going right up the hierarchy. But rarely is there an intervention to divest the FIR of these sections. Even the DGP and home secretary are aware of such reports but choose to remain aloof. And so too the chief secretary, but as the exalted head of the bureaucracy, he perhaps sees himself well above these mundane matters.As far as the political executive is concerned, the home minister (both at the Centre and in states) counters the charges of murder of democracy in the legislature by mounting counter charges, followed by the publicity division director issuing a well-drafted government version on the grave threat emanating from such crimes.Unlike the commonly held view that prosecutors advise the police to put a case on a sound legal footing, the 1973 amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) Act separated the prosecution from the police and made it a separate entity. Every state has a directorate of prosecution in the home ministry. Before 1973, senior officers sought the advice of prosecutors on important cases to ensure that the charge-sheet, when filed in court, had all the necessary ingredients for charges to be framed by the court. In many parts of the world, a prosecution-guided investigation ensures that the case is legally sound, and is squarely based on hard evidence and statements of eyewitnesses.The prosecutors now do not represent the police but the State. But even shorn of the advisory role, if a prosecutor argues for the State, how can he prosecute a man charged wrongly under these acts and why does he not bring this to the court’s attention? This dilemma of the prosecutor needs to be resolved. He is seen pleading on behalf of a State before a judge in a case where he himself is not convinced of its veracity. The role of the prosecutor needs to be deliberated upon by all stakeholders.And finally, the judiciary. The sedition law introduced in 1870 included within it almost every action and word, spoken or written, ostensibly bringing the government into disrepute, thus giving a great opportunity for misuse to overzealous police officers or a prying State. The courts, recognising this shortcoming, defined the scope of the Act in a series of judgments. In the Kedarnath case 1962, the Supreme Court averred, “comments no matter how strongly worded, expressing disapprobation of actions of Government, without exciting those feelings which generate the inclination to cause a public divide by acts of violence…” would not constitute sedition.A copy of the FIR of every such case reaches the magistrate, and the charges are also framed by the learned judge after scrutinising the charge-sheet presented by the police. Why are the charges framed under these sections by the judge, if prima facie case is not established? Liberty is sacrosanct, and hence, in cases where bail has been made so difficult, it is incumbent upon the judges to carefully scrutinise the basis of cases at this stage itself. After all, the Delhi High Court gave bail to two activists arrested under UAPA, stating that prima facie, there was no case. In Stan Swamy’s case, after his arrest, the National Investigative Agency did not even ask for his custody.Who will bell the cat – for the sedition act to go and UAPA to be used strictly on merit? The State will not let go of its powers to use these acts, and the senior leadership of the police and bureaucracy do not seem inclined to stand up. The prosecution is just another weak limb of the home ministry. And thus, hope rests only on the Lordships to redefine the scope of UAPA and strike off the sedition act, both of which are a blot on democracy.Yashovardhan Azad is chairman, Deepstrat, a former central information commissioner, and a retired IPS officer who served as secretary, security and special director, Intelligence Bureau The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/scrap-sedition-stop-uapa-s-misuse-101626779794925.html
21-07-2021||Editorials||Covid-19: The battle ahead||The latest nationwide survey for Covid-19 antibodies suggests that two out of three Indians may have some form of protection from the coronavirus. The government’s senior experts said on Tuesday that the sample size of close to 29,000 people included people who did and did not receive a vaccine. Among the unvaccinated group, the prevalence of antibodies was 62%. Overall, including vaccine recipients, it was 67.6%. In contrast, in the last such study, from the same 70 districts, the prevalence rate was 24.1%. The jump is unsurprising since the earlier study was held prior to the devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections.Such studies, known as seroprevalence surveys, carry several important caveats. First, can the study be extrapolated to estimate the overall spread of the virus in India? Both Balram Bhargava, the head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, and Niti Aayog member VK Paul cautioned that these numbers cannot be taken to fit a particular city or village — the study, they said, gives mostly an overall picture across the country. Second, does simply testing positive for antibodies mean protection? The answer is yes; antibodies do mean protection. Third, the longevity of antibodies, especially among those who were infected, is likely to wane in the next few months.But there is another way of looking at the number. A rough extrapolation of the findings suggests 400 million people are still vulnerable — this number alone is higher than the population of the United States. The government rightly underlined this fact several times on Tuesday to appeal to people to remain careful and avoid any sort of gathering, whether social, religious or political. States that recently went ahead with allowing people to observe some festivities, or those that attempted to but were stopped by the Supreme Court, must pay particular attention. It is also crucial for authorities engaged in surveillance to keep a close watch on any changes in outbreak patterns. At present, many regions of the country are logging numbers last seen in February. That is when India became complacent. It must not make the same mistake again since this time, if it is able to drive up vaccination rates, the country may well be in the home stretch of the war against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid19-the-battle-ahead-101626876941920.html
21-07-2021||Editorials||Climate goals: India’s strides and challenges||India reduced support to the fossil fuel industry by 4% between 2015 and 2019 while countries in the G20 forum are failing to meet their commitments, a new report by BloombergNEF and Bloomberg Philanthropies released on Tuesday said. The G20 provided $636 billion in direct support for fossil fuels in 2019, which is 10% less than that in 2015. The report, however, also noted that India has 66 coal power plants in the pipeline, second only to China’s 247. The report is not a review of India’s official commitment (Nationally Determined Contributions), but what the country needs to do if it has to meet the net-zero target by (2050) and the 1.5 degree criteria under the Paris Climate Agreement. India has not committed to a net-zero target and, therefore, the metric doesn’t apply. But it is on course to meet the NDC pledges.While it is true that India is the world’s third-largest carbon emitter after China and the United States, the country needs cheap and reliable power to meet three development challenges: First, India has to provide clean cooking energy to 800 million people and electricity access to 200 million; second, it has to create jobs and that cannot happen without more and better power; and third, the urban transition will entail huge energy needs. In addition, the energy transition has to be just because of livelihood implications. While it is imperative to build domestic multi-level and multi-actor alliances to facilitate the transition, India needs and is entitled to financial and technological support from the developed world to increase the pace of changeover. Clean energy investments in emerging and developing economies need to be multiplied by more than seven — from less than $150 billion last year to over $1 trillion annually by 2030 to meet climate goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/climate-goals-india-s-strides-and-challenges-101626876880535.html
21-07-2021||Editorials||The increasing threat of lightning strikes||In 2020, India recorded a nearly 23% increase in lightning episodes compared to 2019, says a report by Earth Networks, a private firm specialising in weather intelligence data. The report, released on Monday, shows its network detected 39.55 million lightning pulses in India. Nearly 13.03 million were dangerous “cloud-to-ground” strikes, which make lives and property vulnerable. Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning strikes (usually in the pre-monsoon and monsoon months) are the single largest killers among natural disasters in India, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. Lightning strikes have killed at least 2,000 people every year in India since 2004, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in June. The increasing number of lighting-related episodes is now being linked to the climate crisis. This is because surface temperature and moisture levels have increased significantly in recent years. The increasing moisture level provides favourable condition for the development of thunder clouds and collision of ice particles leads to charging and lightning strikes.It is crucial that states relay the benefits of improved forecasting to the people, and install lightning arresters in rural areas. Odisha has reduced lightning deaths by installing arresters. The early warning messages must be in local languages and all communication mediums must be used. States should undertake lightning micro-zoning for regions, depending on their geography, to handle disaster and death risks better. With temperatures rising due to global warming, India is certain to see a spike in lightning mortalities in the future, and so states must put in place adequate systems and channels that disseminate information effectively to save lives and property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-increasing-threat-of-lightning-strikes-101626791735278.html
21-07-2021||Editorials||The Congress in Punjab||To resolve the impasse in the Punjab Congress, where there was an outright battle between the chief minister (CM), Captain Amarinder Singh, and cricketer-turned-satirist-turned-Bharatiya Janata Party leader-turned-Congress minister-turned rebel, Navjot Singh Sidhu, the Congress high command has implemented a power-sharing formula. Mr Singh will remain the party’s face for the state assembly elections while Mr Sidhu has been appointed the state unit chief. Whether this formula cements party unity, paves the way for a smooth generational transition, and improves electoral prospects, or adds to internal factionalism, erodes its prospects, and even creates conditions for a splinter is the key question — and the answer to that question will determine more than just Punjab politics.The Congress high command is pleased at what it thinks is a reasonable solution and establishes the authority of the Gandhi family, for it is an open secret that Mr Sidhu’s sources of strength were Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The CM is upset at the manner in which he has been treated, and now forced to deal with a state chief he doesn’t particularly like, despite having won the state elections and subsequent local elections over the past five years. Mr Sidhu is happy that he has been able to take on the CM and get away with it, becoming the chief of a party he joined four years age as a step towards his ambition of becoming CM. The rest of the Opposition in the state suddenly sees an opportunity due to the infighting in the ruling party. And the rest of the Congress rank and file is observing closely how the battle between the Delhi leadership and a regional satrap plays out.But while the implications will only become clear over time, the manner in which the Congress has dealt with Punjab, the one state in north India it is in power, may be a lesson on what not do. It has alienated a successful CM, primarily because he was autonomous, though, to be sure, questions were being raised on the CM’s governance. It made a public spectacle of internal differences. It imposed a formula which is laced with risks of infighting ahead of and during next year’s polls — which will be tested in the ticket distribution exercise. The outcome in Punjab may determine the power balance between Delhi leadership and regional units of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-congress-in-punjab-101626791257408.html
