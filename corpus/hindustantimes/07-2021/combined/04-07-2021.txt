Mayor Balkar Sandhu, who visited the area with cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, senior Congress leaders Sunil Kapoor and Inderjit Singh Indi during the drive, said, “The encroachments had choked the seasonal drain, Budhha Nullah, due to which water was entering houses in the area during monsoon.”Sandeep Salwan, a resident of F-Block Rishi Nagar, said, “For people, this is a posh colony but in reality, we were living in a virtual hell. Every year, during monsoon, water enters the houses in the area. The street remains waterlogged. Today, super suction machines were brought in to clean the sewers. We hope the condition improves soon.” Ashu said that close to 15,000 residents of Mandeep Nagar, New Surya Vihar, Mehar Singh Colony, Chand Colony, Radhe Sham Colony, Corporation Colony, Mayur Vihar, Sukhdev Enclave, Amrit Colony, Haibowal Dairy Complex Block B and several others will benefit from the anti-encroachment drive.Earlier, the cabinet minister held a series of meetings with the residents of B Block Rajguru Nagar, Goodwill Park in B Block of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar and assured residents that all their issues would be resolved on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-body-removes-encroachments-near-panj-peer-road-in-ludhiana-101625423345296.html

Swamy was arrested by the NIA on October 15, 2020 from Ranchi and was kept at Taloja jail along with other accused arrested in connection with Elgar Parishad case. After multiple pleas from his family and following a Bombay high court (HC) order on May 28, Swamy, a tribal rights activist, was admitted to Holy Family Hospital, Bandra for general weakness and Parkinson’s disease. He tested positive for Covid on May 30.On Sunday afternoon, he was put on ventilator support in the intensive care unit (ICU). Dr Ian D’Souza, medical director of the hospital, refused to comment on Swamy’s health. But a doctor from the hospital, who did not wish to be identified, said, “His condition is quite critical and he suffers from severe breathing difficulties. It could be related to post-Covid complications and we are examining him for this.” Twitter was abuzz with ardent pleas by users to free Swamy and seeking prayers for him after his condition deteriorated. The commission also sought a report in light of the allegations made in the complaint and the treatment record of Swamy, while he was lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail. The direction comes in continuation of an earlier order of the commission, in which it had advised the state to provide adequate medical care to Swamy. Senior advocate Mihir Desai, who represents Stan Swamy, had on Friday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that his concern was to get his client bail on medical grounds as the condition of the activist is critical. The Jesuit priest will require continued hospitalisation even if he is granted bail, said Desai. “My main concern is to extend the hospital stay. Even if he is granted bail, he will not be getting up and roaming around, as he needs further hospitalisation. We are more concerned about getting him bail as soon as possible,” Desai said. Due to paucity of time, the petition could not be heard and a bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar extended Swamy’s stay at the hospital till Tuesday, when the hearing will be held. Apart from the application for bail on medical grounds, Swamy had filed another petition seeking to set aside a provision under section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), through which investigating agencies could book him under charges of working in the frontal organisation of a banned terrorist outfit. The petition has claimed that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had made it “impossible and an insurmountable hurdle” for him to apply for bail, which is arbitrary and against his personal liberty. In light of this, Swamy’s counsel sought setting aside and quashing of the terminology ‘front organisations’ from the first Schedule of UAPA. Debrati, posted a tweet stating that after learning that his bail application had been posted to Tuesday, Swamy appeared agitated and disoriented on Saturday. Meena Kadasamy, another user, tweeted, “Father #StanSwamy battling on a ventilator. At 84, he’s India’s oldest political prisoner. Share widely (sic).” (Inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-case-stan-swamy-s-condition-worsens-nhrc-issues-notice-to-maharashtra-chief-secretary-101625423344117.html
04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Now, SIT urges MLAs to share info about Kotkapura incident||Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura firing case has invited members of the state legislative assembly to share information about the incident as it may lead to vital revelations. In a letter to Punjab assembly speaker Rana KP Singh last week, the SIT led by additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav has urged him to circulate the message to all MLAs. “I can’t reveal much as it is confidential. But we have put the communication into motion,” said the speaker. The state government reconstituted the SIT in April after the Punjab and Haryana high court rejected the findings of the previous probe team headed by former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who recently joined the Aam Aadmi Party. A number of protestors were injured in police firing at Kotkapura on October 14, 2015, when they were protesting against desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. It may delay probe: Cong legislator MLAs belonging to the ruling party, however, said the move could delay the probe report and further politicise the matter. “This is an unnecessary exercise and could complicate the case and delay the probe report,” said an MLA of the ruling party, adding that he doesn’t have much to share as he comes from a place which is far-off from Kotkapura. Another MLA, who is also a minister in the Capt Amarinder Singh cabinet, said: “What can we share now? The entire incident is in the public domain. There is already a lot of confusion and if MLAs are involved, it would lead to chaos.” Kushaldeep Dhillon, Congress MLA from Faridkot that remained the epicentre of the sacrilege and police firing cases, said: “I have not received any message (from the speaker) so far. There’s nothing I can share now, it’s an old case,” he said. We will seek speedy probe: AAP Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Dirba and leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said: “I don’t have much to speak on the issue. We are seeking an early probe report so the perpetrators of the crime be punished. Already much time has been wasted.” Will politicise the matter: Akali MLA“It is clear that the MLAs will speak as per their political preferences. This, I think, will politicise the matter further. Local MLAs are the best to give information. The desecration was orchestrated to defame the (Sikh) religion and bring a bad name to then SAD-BJP government. It was very unfortunate. Despite all that, our party’s government made best efforts to control things. We tell all this to the new SIT,” said Akali MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala.“The SIT is indulging in a political witch-hunt. It is acting at the behest of the Gandhis and chief minister Cap. Amarinder Singh. State congress chief Sunil Jakhar has already announced that Rahul has understood the case and they will be framing the Badals. The SIT is moving in the same direction,” said former minister and Akali MLA Bikram Singh Majithia, adding that his party will act on SIT’s request to MLAs accordingly. “Information shared by the MLAs would be vital for the probe. We will maintain secrecy,” said a member of the SIT, adding that a WhatsApp number and an email ID has been dedicated for the purpose by the investigating team. SIT to quiz Dhadrianwale today The SIT will question Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, who was leading protest at Kotkapura when the incident took place, in Patiala on Monday. The probe team has already quizzed another Sikh preacher Panthpreet Singh, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, former deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and number of police officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-sit-urges-mlas-to-share-info-about-kotkapura-incident-101625423167829.html

In a statement, Bajwa said that Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSCPL) must be held accountable for being unprepared for the supply of uninterrupted power. “Heads must roll and the government must take action against erring officials. PSPCL’s lack of preparedness will only continue to harm the image of the state,” he said, urging chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to take stringent measures to ensure such a situation does not arise in future. The Rajya Sabha member said a delayed monsoon is not an excuse that Punjabis will believe as there is enough availability of technologies that predict its progress advance. On the “ill-conceived” power purchase agreements (PPAs), Bajwa said the chief minister’s statement that the state government is reviewing them is “extremely delayed but absolutely necessary”. He also said the state government should ensure 300 units of free power to all households. “It is well-known that the state provides ₹6,000 crore as power subsidies to the agriculture sector and ₹4,000 crore to other sectors. Given the large social net covered by the present subsidies, to extend to every household across the state would be overall beneficial to the people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-crisis-bajwa-seeks-action-against-officials-101625422985157.html

The remaining 122 PPAs for 1,314 MWs of expensive power were inexplicably signed.Attacking Amarinder, Sukhbir tweeted: “@capt_amarinder Re your new rant on SAD govt’s power agreements, 4.5 yrs is a long time to scrap any agreement. Who stopped/stops you? Do anything but save Punjabis from long unbearable power cuts & bills. But it seems U want to be remembered for “BIJLEE MEHANGI, BIJLEE GULL.” “Those who plunged Punjab into darkness are blaming power cuts on those who made the state power surplus. As PS (Parkash Singh) Badal took over in 2007, Punjab was used to 16 hrs daily cuts. He took 3 yrs to make it power surplus-exactly the time u have taken to push it back into darkness,” the SAD chief said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-pushed-state-into-darkness-sukhbir-101625422865770.html

04-07-2021||Other||Consumers should get front-row seats in tribunals||New Delhi: The union ministry of consumer affairs should ensure that the first row of seats in every consumer tribunal in the country is reserved for consumers who seek redress before these commissions without the assistance of advocates.It is indeed ironic that the consumer tribunals, whose raison d’etre is protection of consumer rights, do nothing to protect their rights and privileges in the very precincts of the consumer commissions, where the front seats are all occupied by the advocates as a matter of right and consumers are relegated to the back benches and many times forced to give up even those seats.Even though the exclusive consumer justice system came into existence to help consumers resolve their complaints against goods and services without the aid of lawyers and in an atmosphere of informality and simplicity as distinct from regular courts, complainants who appear before these quasi judicial bodies do not get the respect due to them and it begins with the seating arrangements. Yes, consumers do not have the privilege of sitting in the front row in these tribunals , because that is the exclusive domain of the advocates. Unfortunately, even the Consumer Protection (Consumer Commission Procedure ) Regulations, 2020, drawn up by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission last July, fails consumers here. The regulations lay stress on how the tribunals should look and feel different from the courts and accordingly suggest several measures to ensure this.However with regard to seating, it merely says that the commissions “shall give proper respect and courtesy to the parties who appear in person and shall provide separate accommodation in the Hall for the convenience of the parties”.Instead of ‘separate accommodation’ the Regulation should clearly mandate that the first row be reserved for such consumers, because in many consumer tribunals around the country, the ‘separate accommodation’ is a bench stacked against the wall in an obscure corner and they may well be asked to vacate even these seats, if members of the bar do not have a seat! Surely, consumers are not second class citizens in these special tribunals!I must mention here the case of PC Jose Vs Nandakumar (July 26, 1993, Kerala high court), where PC Jose, a litigant who was fighting his case without a counsel, refused to get up for a senior lawyer and was asked to pay a penalty by the court. In response to his appeal , arguing that the constitution guarantees equality (Article 14 ) before law, the Kerala high court quoted the Advocates Act and said in a court room, members of the bar have certain privileges as officers of the court and it was open to the presiding officer to direct members of the public, even if they are litigants, to vacate their seat for the advocates.Well, whatever be the practices and procedures before these courts, they obviously cannot be applied to the consumer commissions because firstly these are not regular courts and secondly, these commissions are meant for consumers to fight the case on their own and thirdly, consumers have the preferential right in these forums meant exclusively for them. In fact on several occasions the government has considered barring advocates from these quasi-judicial bodies altogether. Having said that, I must emphasise that over the years, several factors. including the slow and complicated procedures, repeated adjournments, the high cost of fighting the case (if you hire a lawyer) and the miserly computation of compensation, have all made a mockery of the ‘quick, simple and inexpensive’ justice promised under the consumer protection law. And this is reflected in the dwindling number of consumers approaching these tribunals. The number of those who seek justice without the help of lawyers, has fallen even more sharply.There is thus an urgent need to not only change the way these commissions function, but also give consumers due respect and encourage them to fight their battles without the help of lawyers. ‘Consumer Assistants’ at these tribunals can make a difference, so also the ambience that gives the consumer the confidence to approach these commissions on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/consumers-should-get-front-row-seats-in-tribunals-101625422743953.html

The two arrested men, who were accompanied by another suspect, fled with his bag, which contained 10 cartridges, his uniform and ID card, said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena.Singh told police that around 1am on April 13, he reached Sarai Kale Khan and was waiting for a mode of conveyance to reach Kashmere Gate bus terminal, from where he had to take another bus to Punjab. An autorickshaw with two passengers stopped. The driver offered to take him to Kashmere Gate for ₹50 on sharing basis. Singh sat in the auto. After driving for a kilometre, the driver stopped the vehicle at an isolated place. The driver and the two passengers asked Singh to hand over his belongings. When he resisted, they assaulted him with a stick, snatched his bag, dropped him on the roadside and fled in the auto, said the DCP. “We have recovered nine stolen cartridges and the autorickshaw that was used in the crime. The arrested persons were identified as Rajiv Kumar (28) and Umesh (22).

A senior official of the DDMA said the decision was taken in the light of potential overcrowding in weekly markets, given that district administrations have cracked down on several markets in the city for alleged violation of Covid-19 regulations.A lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19 in the light of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, which left the healthcare system overrun. As cases started declining, the government started unlocking the Capital in a phased manner from May 31. On June 14, the government allowed weekly markets to operate but with the condition that only one such market can operate in one municipal zone in a day. Delhi has 12 municipal zones.“We cannot take any risks. The government is preparing for a potential third wave and every now and then, cases of overcrowding in general markets are surfacing, forcing the district administrations to order for the temporary shutting of shops. Weekly markets cater to a large demography and they often witness large crowds. It would be difficult to manage more than one such market per day in one municipal zone,” said the senior DDMA official.The official further said, “Previous year too, when weekly markets were allowed to function, several of them witnessed large crowds, forcing the district administrations to crack down on them. It is better to take time (in opening markets) than to act in haste. Once markets are allowed to open, implementing a temporary suspension becomes difficult. We shall observe for at least another week and then take a call on weekly markets.”Weekly markets in the city cater to lower-income and middle-income groups, offering products that range from soaps and utensils to toys and garments. Delhi has around 2,700 weekly bazaars and they collectively engage around 400,000 people in different roles – vendors, suppliers, labourers, etc. Under the current rules, only 84 of them – the popular ones in Old Delhi, Geeta Colony, Kashmere Gate and Nangloi which operate from designated areas – are functional.Yusuf Khan, a vendor at a weekly market in northeast Delhi’s Gokalpuri, said, “It is a major relief. Last year, the government had allowed weekly markets to resume functioning after months of lockdown. This time, we have been allowed to resume business in eight weeks. We have so far ensured that all regulations are strictly followed. The government should now consider allowing more such markets to open.”Sanjay Kumar, a vendor and member of town vending committee in charge of a weekly market in the Yamuna embankment area in east Delhi, said, “Vendors have suffered huge losses during the pandemic. The weekly market is their only source of income. They should at least be given an opportunity to operate in adherence to the Covid-19 rules. The government should soon allow more markets to function.”Dhanik Chand, a vendor and a member of the town vending committee in charge of a weekly market in Mandawali locality, said: “In one year, the traders have also learnt what all precautions to take. Today, most of them are aware of Covid-19 protocols, the importance of getting tested, vaccines, etc. Restrictions on weekly bazars should be scaled down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-crowds-surge-no-leeway-yet-for-delhi-s-weekly-markets-101625422564557.html

The report released on July 1 was put together by the Union education ministry. According to the report, only 50% of the schools operated by Delhi’s municipal corporations are following the pupil, teacher ratio (PTR) as mandated by the Right to Education (RTE) Act. Comparatively, 98% Delhi government schools maintain the RTE mandated PTR, Sisodia added. According to the RTE Act, the PTR at primary and upper primary levels should be 30:1 and 35:1, respectively.The report stated that Delhi has 55,486 primary teachers for over 1,811,723 students enrolled across public and private schools -- an overall PTR of a little over 32. “The BJP government at the Centre has corroborated that the party ruled MCDs have made a mess of the municipal schools in Delhi. The mismanagement is so stark that MCD schools are considered the worst in the country. This is tarnishing the image of Delhi...While 98% of the Delhi government schools have maintained the RTE mandated PTR, 58% of East MCD schools, 46% of North MCD schools and 39% of South MCD schools are not following it. This establishes the fact that the BJP-ruled MCDs haven’t been able to provide teachers to their students. This is putting Delhi’s reputation at stake,” Sisodia, who is also deputy chief minister of Delhi, said during a press conference, citing findings of the report. Sisodia said Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi government is building world class infrastructure and providing all the basic facilities in its schools, recruiting teachers and sending them to foreign countries for training, and launching a new-age curriculum for holistic development of students. “However, the BJP hasn’t been able to provide teachers and basic facilities in the MCD schools,” the deputy chief minister said.The BJP blamed the Delhi government for not releasing funds to the civic bodies leading to the shortage of teachers. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the BJP are locked in a war of words over the alleged corruption and financial mismanagement of the municipal corporations. Though the BJP leaders maintains that the Delhi government was deliberately depriving the civic bodies of funds, the AAP has said that it owes nothing to the MCDs. Municipal elections are due in Delhi next year. “BJP leaders need to look beyond the ‘WhatsApp University’ and feel ashamed of the deteriorating conditions of MCD schools due to 20 years of their mismanagement. The Delhi government has left no stones unturned in improving the conditions of its schools which is also reflected in the UDISE report. But BJP leaders keep falsely accusing Arvind Kejriwal rather than focusing on improving the MCD schools,” Sisodia said.Responding to Sisodia’s allegations, BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor cited “financial problems” and “lack of funds” as the main reasons behind the problem. “The central government’s report which Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia has cited to say that MCD Schools have a poor PTR, has many other aspects where MCD schools are performing better than the Delhi government schools. With every passing year, the number of students in MCD schools has been increasing. Compared to this, the number of students in Delhi government schools has been going down every year. This clearly shows which schools are performing better,” Kapoor alleged.“As far as low PTR is concerned, the Delhi government is withholding funds of MCDs as a result of which teacher recruitment is suffering,” he added.The UDISE which was initiated in 2012-13 by the education ministry is one of the largest management information systems on school education, covering more than 1.5 million schools, 8.5 million teachers and 25 million children. The UDISE+ is an updated and improved version of UDISE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-made-a-mess-of-municipal-schools-tarnishing-delhi-s-image-sisodia-101625422563943.html

He said he hoped to transform the state capital among the country’s three best cities. During the inspection, he sat with officials at the construction sites as they briefed him about the likely completion time of the projects. “I want to develop Lucknow among the three best cities of the country and work is on in that regard,” he said. The ongoing projects include the 104-kilometre Outer Ring Road project, initiated in September 2016. It is being completed in phases.“Along with the ongoing projects, I have more in mind for Lucknow, but I will discuss all of that only after the present projects are completed,” he said in the presence of Uttar Pradesh urban development minister Gopal Tandon, law minister Brajesh Pathak, lawmakers and Lucknow Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Mukesh Sharma among others. “Once the Outer Ring Road project is complete, and that is going to happen very soon, it would be immensely helpful in decongesting the state capital,” Rajnath Singh said. He also said five of the nine flyovers sanctioned at high traffic points in the state capital were completed and work on the rest was on. Of these, work on the Bansmandi-Lalkuan, Rajajipuram, Tedhipulia and Kukrail flyovers had been completed and these projects were already open for the public now, officials said.He also inspected the 2.5-kilometre- long two-lane flyover stretch at Imambara, Phoolmandi and Haiderganj tri-section. It was expected to be complete by July-August, Rajnath said. “I keep on interacting with officials to ensure that there is no let- up in development work,” he said. “When ready, this will help decongest Victoria Street and increase tourist footfalls at the Imambara,” officials told the defence minister.He also visited the eight-lane 12 kilometre stretch of the Outer Ring Road project from Bakshi Ka Talab to Gomti river. It is part of the 30-km section which would link Sitapur Road, Hardoi Road, Mohan Road and the Agra Expressway. “A 27-kilometre stretch of the project from Sultanpur Road, Kursi Road is already completed and open for the public,” Rajnath’s Lok Sabha representative Diwaker Tripathi said.Earlier in the day, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, numerous organizations and prominent people from different walks of life met Rajnath Singh at his Dilkusha Colony residence.Intervention soughtMembers of the Lucknow Chikan Handicraft Association met Rajnath Singh to raise the issue of families of such traders registered under GST and who died due to Covid-19 not getting the financial benefit under the Vyapari Durghatna Bima Yojana or the traders’ accident insurance scheme.They urged his intervention in ensuring that the scheme covered financial compensation for those traders who died of Covid-19.Prominent doctors meet RajnathSome prominent doctors of the city, including renowned pulmonologist Dr BP Singh of Midlands Hospital, Dr Sushil Agarwal (cardiologist), Dr Sanjay Niranjan (paediatrician) and Dr Puneet Mehrotra (gastroenterologist) also met Rajnath.

The gang members have sold more than 100 stolen cars in Kashmir since 2015, said police. The two members have been identified as Showket Ahmad Malla from Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir and Mohammad Juber from Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. Police said Malla flew to Delhi and then drove the stolen vehicles to Jammu and Kashmir. Juber worked for Noor Mohammad alias Rinku, a habitual auto-lifter from Loni in Ghaziabad. “Rinku, Juber and their three associates--Zahid, Wasim, and Yakoob--allegedly stole vehicles, changed their registration number plates and delivered the stolen vehicles to Malla and Wasim Sheikh, another recipient of stolen vehicles in the Valley,” said deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh.On July 3, the DCP said, the district anti-auto theft squad (AATS) received information that Malla was coming to Aaram Bagh Colony in Paharganj to receive a stolen car from Juber. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the two were caught with a stolen Baleno car and a pistol with two cartridges.“Their interrogation led to the recovery of three more stolen cars, 100 fake number plates, 120 duplicate keys of cars along with tools used for making duplicate keys, and 10 engine control modules (ECMs) of cars,” said Singh.During interrogation, Malla revealed that he works as a civil contractor for the state government but was not satisfied with his earnings. He wanted to become rich and live lavishly. Malla confessed he was brought into the illegal trade by Waseem and has himself sold more than 10 stolen cars in Kashmir in the last few years, the DCP added. “We are now looking for other members of the gang,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-held-for-stealing-vehicles-in-delhi-selling-them-in-jk-101625422385972.html

Delhi goes to the municipal polls in 2022.“The Aam Aadmi Party has launched a signature campaign against BJP-ruled MCDs. We have received widespread support for the campaign from traders. The BJP-ruled MCDs have exploited traders by increasing taxes even during the Covid-19 pandemic. The signature campaign has started in all the 272 municipal wards from 1st July,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.  “Lakhs of traders are joining this signature campaign against the BJP-ruled MCDs. As we are going ahead with the campaign, we are seeing a lot of anger among traders against the BJP,” said Pathak. Reacting to Pathak’s comments, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “It is an entirely misleading campaign. The AAP leaders know it well that an increase in trade licence fees has come into effect after over 10 years and the BJP leadership in the MCDs is already reviewing the increase,” he said. “We, at the BJP, don’t do lip service for traders but do ground work to benefit them. The latest example is the inclusion of traders as entrepreneurs under the MSME announced by the central government. The AAP should stop its misleading campaign,” said Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-bjp-lock-horns-over-increase-in-trade-licence-fee-101625422384005.html

04-07-2021||Other||‘Arbitrary’: Gauhati HC slams Mizoram govt for restrictions on unvaccinated people||The Gauhati High Court held on Friday that restrictions imposed by the Mizoram government on the movement and work of people who are yet to get vaccinated for Covid-19 are arbitrary and violates the Constitution. A division bench of justices Michael Zothankhuma and Nelson Sailo passed the order while acting on a petition against standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued last week by the state government restricting the movement of unvaccinated persons. “The restrictions placed upon unvaccinated individuals vis-à-vis vaccinated individuals are arbitrary and not in consonance with the provisions of Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution,” the order read. “Allowances available and given to vaccinated persons in the above clauses shall also be made equally applicable to unvaccinated persons,” the order added while directing the state government to issue a corrigendum of the SOPs declared on June 29, at the earliest. The next date of hearing in the case is on July 14. The SOPs issued on June 29 by the Mizoram chief secretary, had included a provision which stated, “only vaccinated individuals of the family members may be detailed for errands within and around localities having significant Covid-19 active cases”. They also stated that only vaccinated persons should be engaged in manning stores, shops or undertaking any works. Store attendants and other employees should be able to produce proof of vaccination. It further added that only those drivers and conductors of commercial passenger vehicles who had been vaccinated should be allowed to operate public transport. “A perusal of the above clauses implies that all persons would require to be vaccinated or else they cannot leave their houses or earn their livelihood. The question that would arise… is whether a person can be vaccinated against his will and whether the non-vaccination of the said individual can debar him from earning his livelihood,” the court observed. “Though the state can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions in the exercise of any of the rights under Article 19, so long as the said restriction is a reasonable restriction… the above-mentioned clauses do not appear to be reasonable,” it added. In his submission before the court, the additional advocate general of Mizoram stated that 519,452 persons (67% of eligible persons) had been administered the first dose of Covishield in the state against the target of 775,106 people. He, however, couldn’t say how long it would take to vaccinate all the targeted eligible persons with the first dose. “There is nothing to show that vaccinated persons (first dose) cannot be infected with Coronavirus or they cannot be spreaders. As the vaccinated and unvaccinated persons would have to follow the Covid proper behaviour protocols as per the SOP, there is no justification for discrimination,” the order read. “The unvaccinated citizens of the state can’t be faulted due to the state’s failure in not completing the vaccination of the targeted population,” it added. Mizoram is witnessing over 200 new Covid-19 cases daily in the past few days and the test positivity rate (TPR) on Saturday was recorded at 6.75%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/arbitrary-gauhati-hc-slams-mizoram-govt-for-restrictions-on-unvaccinated-people-101625421485605.html
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Petition in Bombay HC challenges Information Technology Rules, 2021||Another petition has been filed in the Bombay high court (HC) challenging the recently notified Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 issued under the Information Technology (IT) Act. The petition by a digital news portal states that the IT Rules are arbitrary, illegal and contrary to the fundamental rights under article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India, ultra vires to the IT Act, by unlawfully delegating judicial powers to the executive and attempting to overrule a long line of precedent established by the Supreme Court. The petition claims that IT Rules curtail and unconstitutionally restrict the freedom of press, and hence should be set aside. Journalist Nikhil Wagle has also filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on similar grounds on Friday. Both petitions are expected to come up for hearing in due course. The online news portal which has moved the petition through its company and former journalist Ashish Khetan states, “IT Rules curtail and unconstitutionally restrict the freedom of press in India.” Elaborating the reasons, the petition states that the rules give pervasive powers of control to state over published content, over-regulation and excessive burden on press through onerous obligations that will financially and operationally drain resources and capacity. The petition also alleges that the rules will result in usurpation of judicial powers by executive bodies that violate constitutional norms for exercise of quasi-judicial powers. It further states that the above reasons are compounded by the fact that the rules do not have the sanction of the Parliament. Referring to the large cost of compliance burdens, the petition states that the implementation of IT Rules will cause chilling of the freedom of speech of reporters and journalists working with the petitioners. It added that while a request for a meaningful consultation was requested with stakeholders, since they did not receive a response from the authorities, the petitioners approached the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petition-in-bombay-hc-challenges-information-technology-rules-2021-101625421486088.html

04-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body: Need four to five years to stop pollution of drains||With most of the city’s sewage treatment plants (STPs) being out of compliance with environmental standards and sewer lines currently servicing only 68% of the city’s population, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it would need another “four to five years” to entirely free city’s drains, creeks and coastline of pollution from untreated sewage.This was revealed in a recent audit report prepared by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), pursuant to instructions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). A copy of the audit report is with Hindustan Times). NGT had, in October 2020, rapped the civic body over continued pollution of city’s creeks and water bodies, following which MPCB issued a set of compliances for the latter to adhere to in December 2020.A review of the MPCB report shows that none of the terms have been complied with by BMC. Senior officials in the civic body’s sewage and stormwater drains departments attributed the delay to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and protracted tendering processes for various related infrastructure works.Meanwhile, environmentalists expressed concern over the glaring inadequacies which the report has brought to light. For example, only one out of eight operational sewage treatment plants (STP) — the 37 million litres per day (MLD) one in Colaba — in the city is compliant with the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) latest discharge standards. The remaining STPs in Worli, Bandra, Ghatkopar, Bhandup, Versova, Charkop and Malad, some of which were constructed more than 20 years ago, are currently not fully equipped with the required sequencing batch bioreactor (SBBR) technology and continue to discharge polluting effluents into creeks, showed laboratory analyses by MPCB. “BMC has plans to upgrade their existing STPs, and one new STP will be installed at Dharavi. At present, tendering process for modification and expansion of the existing and new STPs are completed. It will take four to five years for completion of these STPs,” BMC submitted in a written response to MPCB. The tenders were expected to be awarded by April this year. “This has not yet happened due to delays caused by the pandemic,” said Atul Rao, chief engineer, BMC.However, fully-functional STPs are not the only solution to the problem. To prevent dry weather flow of untreated sewage in city’s creeks and rivers and to prevent the flow of waste into rivers, Mumbai also needs a well-connected system of sewer lines. The existing 2,025-km-long network services only 84% of Mumbai’s developed area and 68% of the city’s population, as per BMC.Due to these shortcomings, there are still 93 openings across the city and suburbs which continue to discharge untreated sewage directly into creeks and drains. “Sewerage infrastructure development… to provide 100% sewer connectivity is being implemented under the Mumbai Sewerage Improvement Program (MISP). It will require four to five years’ time for completion,” BMC has noted in recent submissions to MPCB.The civic body has, however, proposed to finish laying around 93 kms of sewer lines in developed parts of the city by 2023-24. Environmentalists say this will not address the sewerage needs of nearly a third of the city’s population that lives in about 250 slums clusters. The sewerage requirement for these areas runs into an estimated 143 kms, which, BMC says, “will be laid as and when slum rehabilitation schemes are effectively implemented in these areas.”Other compliances that BMC has not yet implemented include bio-remediation of city’s rivers and drains to mitigate ecological damage caused by untreated sewage that has already been discharged, in violation of environmental safeguards.MPCB had also directed the civic body to “install nets in stormwater discharge drains to prevent sewage from entering the sea along with solid waste”. Despite being a mechanically simple, inexpensive stop-gap measure, the move has not yet happened.“Installing nets is a simple, cost-effective way to reduce some of the burden on our creeks and coastline. Even if it takes five years to set up an STP or lay sewers, this is a quick solution that can make a huge difference. It is baffling that the corporation has made no steps toward getting it done, six months after they were told to,” said Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, which had petitioned in NGT in 2017 that led to the October 2020 order. In addition, BMC is yet to pay environmental compensation to the tune of at least ₹34 crore to CPCB, as directed by NGT in October last year.In its compliance report, the pollution control board notes that BMC’s reason for the same is a Civil Appeal (No. 293/2021) which they filed before the Supreme Court in March, challenging NGT’s order. This was after a review petition filed before NGT was rejected in January this year.Confirming the details, Rao said, “It is up to the Supreme Court to now decide whether the amount is to be paid. We are doing our best to ensure compliance with all the other terms given by NGT. But as we have also conveyed to the pollution control board, it is bound to take some time.”Other officials, however, disagreed. “The Supreme Court has not stayed NGT’s directions. If the aggrieved party wants to seek legal recourse, they are welcome to, but the order of the court should be complied with,” said an MPCB official requesting anonymity. “The penalty for violation, as directed by NGT, is roughly ₹4 crore per month after December 2020. So now the total amount payable by BMC comes to nearly ₹58 crore up to June 2021. The money is to be used directly for environmental restoration works, and should be duly paid up as per the law. It is surprising that BMC has money and time to expedite projects like the Coastal Road, but not enough to pay for or to fix the pollution it is wittingly causing,” said Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-need-four-to-five-years-to-stop-pollution-of-drains-101625421425030.html
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders police protection to rape survivor for collecting compensation||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the police station concerned to provide protection to a minor rape survivor and her parents after it was informed that the accused was granted bail and hence the survivor and her family were not willing to come to Mumbai to collect compensation under the Manodhairya scheme. The survivor had approached the HC through her father, seeking termination of her 32-week pregnancy under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, but the same was disallowed after the panel of expert doctors suggested against it. The minor delivered the child who, as per HC order, was handed over to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) for adoption. Thereafter, the family went to their hometown. The bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Prithviraj Chavan, while hearing the interim application of the father on Saturday, was informed by advocate Ashley Cusher that as per the June 19 order of the court, the compensation amount under Manodhairya scheme was not disbursed to the survivor as she had not shown up at the district legal service authority (DLSA) office. Cusher said that as the accused was out on bail, the survivor and her parents feared for themselves and hence were not willing to come forward to accept the compensation. The survivor and her family, who lived in a slum at Govandi, had approached the HC in March after it came to light that the minor, a Class 7 student, was 31-weeks pregnant. The father stated that he had the eldest of his three children suffered from epilepsy and was cured by a man. Following which the man started frequenting the house as the family trusted him. But later he started stalking the survivor and raped her on two occasions on finding her alone at home. He also threatened the minor against informing her parents about it. The case came to light when she was found pregnant, and a case was subsequently filed with the police, leading to the arrest of the accused. The father then approached the court seeking termination of the pregnancy. Government pleader informed the court that the DLSA was ready to disburse an interim amount of ₹30,000 to the survivor. After being informed about the potential threat to the family and their apprehension of being harmed if they come to collect the compensation, the court said, “We direct that the survivor and her parents inform the Secretary of Mumbai District Legal Services Authority about the date of their visit and on such date, they should be provided adequate security by the jurisdictional police station, so that interim compensation is disbursed to the victim.” The court also directed for the appointment of a para-legal volunteer to assist the minor and her family and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-police-protection-to-rape-survivor-for-collecting-compensation-101625421423844.html

04-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Cis-Hindon localities account for more deaths during second wave||Ghaziabad: In the second wave of Covid-19, the top five residential segments with the highest death rate were located in the Cis-Hindon area, an analysis by the Ghaziabad health department has found. As per the analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) was below 1% in all the residential segments across the district during the first wave, but it ranged from 1.44% to 2.66% in top five segments during the second wave. The health department compiled the figures for the first wave from March 1 last year to March 31 of this year, while it took into account the death figures for the second wave from April 1 to May 31 this year.The Ghaziabad city has two major areas separated by the Hindon river, namely Trans-Hindon on the west and Cis-Hindon on the east. The Cis-Hindon area includes localities such as Raj Nagar, Sanjay Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Gandhi Nagar and Shastri Nagar, while localities such as Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara come under the Tran-Hindon area. For instance, during the second wave of the pandemic, the Raj Nagar segment reported 1,956 Covid cases and 52 deaths, with a CFR of 2.66 which was the highest death rate in Ghaziabad. The other four segments with high fatality rate were also from the Cis-Hindon area. These include Nehru Nagar/Gandhi Nagar segment with 1.81% CFR; Ghookhna with 1.61%; Vijay Nagar with 1.57% and Carte (Shastri Nagar, Govindpuram and others) with 1.44%. “The death rate analysis of the first and second waves indicates that it was high in Cis-Hindon segments as compared to Trans-Hindon segments of Sahibabad, Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara which were high caseload areas. It could be due to better availability of private hospitals in the trans-Hindon area,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “We are also waiting for the sero survey report. It will help determine the segments where more sero conversion took place after the first wave. We are trying further to make micro-analysis of the available trends with us to know the exact reasons behind the trends of death rate in different segments,” Dr Gupta added. As per the figures, Indirapuram having 2,718 Covid cases reported 32 deaths at 1.18% during the second wave while Vaishali with 1,909 cases reported 18 deaths (0.94%). Similarly, Vasundhara reported 15 deaths out of 1,483 positive cases (1% CFR). Experts are of view that early detection was the key in minimising deaths in the Trans-Hindon area. “It could be a factor that trans-Hindon localities have a number of private health care facilities, and the testing facilities were also easily available to residents. So, the treatment in such areas started early which led to reduced number of deaths. Besides, trans-Hindon is close to Delhi and Noida, so it is also possible that patients might have taken treatment in these cities as well,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). According to the state health bulletin of July 4, the Ghaziabad district has 55,553 total cases, which include 461 deaths and 25 active cases. As per the analysis, the first wave of the pandemic resulted in 102 fatalities while 359 deaths took place during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-cis-hindon-localities-account-for-more-deaths-during-second-wave-101625421363908.html

They are forced to present some points in the House, keeping in mind the party’s interest only,” he wrote.“If that party is in government, it is only a matter of time before some of the Pandit officers decide on the government’s policy. Most of the political parties are running in the same way as a company, with some of the loyal managers of the company owner and clerks running the organization. It is useless to expect democratic behaviour from a political party in which discussion or debate has stopped,” he further wrote.Mahtab did not respond to repeated calls and messages for clarification on whether his opinion piece was directed at the way the BJD was being run, however, political analysts said there is little doubt about that.“It’s no secret that many senior leaders, including Mahtab, have little say over the way the BJD is being run. But it has been happening for the last several years. One has to see why is he voicing his dissent after Soumya Patnaik wrote his dissenting editorial on Covid deaths in the state,” said Rabi Das, a political analyst.On Thursday, BJD’s Patnaik who edits leading Odia daily ‘Sambad’, had written a front-page signed editorial accusing the state government of under-reporting deaths due to Covid-19 and demanded the government issues a white paper on Covid-19 deaths.“The data of Covid deaths was manipulated due to a desperate race to be on the top and an attempt to cling onto past glory. In the present scenario, what the left hand is doing is not known to the right hand of the administration. Whether chief minister Naveen Patnaik is aware of it or not, we do not know for sure,” said Patnaik, arguing that a white paper on the deaths was a necessity. “People of the state will love him (Naveen Patnaik) more if he displays courage by releasing the white paper”.None of the BJD spokespersons was willing to speak about Mahtab’s editorial. BJD leader and transport minister Padmanav Behera said it would not be appropriate for him to make any comment on the matter.However, Congress leader and MLA Suresh Routray said the editorials by Patnaik and Mahtab shows that not everything was fine in the BJD. “There are so many BJD MLAs and MPs who are displeased over the party’s affairs. Naveen Babu is perhaps unaware of all these happenings. If this trend continues, the BJD would collapse in near future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/editorial-piece-by-bjd-mp-triggers-another-political-storm-in-odisha-101625421064348.html

Further, men in this age group accounted for almost 32.8% of the 906 deaths reported till June 2.Of the 906 Covid-19 deaths till July 2, about 619 were men and 287 were women, according to the data.On Sunday, two more deaths were confirmed, which took the death toll to 910, of which 66.1% (599) had co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension and other diseases, while 311 had no co-morbidities.The health department lacked specific data on deaths reported during the second Covid-19 wave, especially in April and May, although it did show that most of the deaths were reported in these two months. As per the data, almost 541 deaths were confirmed between April 1, when the death toll was 365, and July 2.“The death toll may have increased this time, but the fatality rate among different age groups has been similar to 2020, highlighting that people in all age groups were equally impacted by the pandemic,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer for Covid-19.According to the health department data, over 28% of the 906 people who succumbed due to the coronavirus infection in the last 15 months of the pandemic outbreak were aged between 41 and 60 years, while only 10% of the total deaths were of patients aged between 21 and 40 years. There were no deaths reported among patients under 21 years of age.As per the data, in April and May, at the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19, as many as 116,933 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed. Of these cases, about 29,364 people were aged between 41 and 60 years, while 8,575 were in the 61-70 year age bracket and 4,270 in the 71 to 80 year age bracket.Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, the state nodal officer for Covid-19, said, “The district and state-level data clearly show that mortality rate has been almost similar during the first and the second Covid-19. Due to the explosion of coronavirus variant in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), the number of deaths might have increased, but those above 40 years continued to remain most affected.”According to the data, 180,713 people have been detected positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the district so far, with people of all age groups being affected. On Sunday, the district reported eight new cases of coronavirus infection, which took the active case count to 107. Of the active cases, at least 11 people are critically ill and undergoing treatment at private hospitals, while 96 are under home isolation. Cases decrease in JuneAccording to the district health department data, there has been a steady decline in active cases, and subsequently, deaths, from June 15. In the first week of June, as many as 397 new cases were detected and 25 Covid-19 deaths were reported, while in the second week, 172 new cases were confirmed and 21 Covid-19 deaths were reported. As many as 1,200 and 486 patients recovered in the first and second weeks of the month, respectively.However, the number of deaths continued to decline thereafter, with a steady fall in the case positivity rate.As per the data, 78 cases and 13 deaths were reported from June 15 to 21, with the case positivity rate falling to 0.29% from 1.1% and 0.6% recorded in the first and second weeks, respectively, of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-deaths-at-900-men-aged-61-80-worst-affected-101625421005003.html
04-07-2021||Gurugram||Crime teams train lens on robbers targeting senior citizens||After more than 10 cases of robberies in which senior citizens were targeted over the last two months, the police formed four crime teams to identify the gangs, following requests from senior citizens.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that senior citizens living alone are soft targets and it is unlikely they would resist a robbery attempt. “We have formed four crime teams who are scanning CCTV footage of the areas from where cases were reported. We have found some leads and teams will question a few motorbike mechanics in this regard,” he said.Despite several steps taken by the police to curb crimes against senior citizens, at least one incident of robbery is reported in a month. The police also prepared sketches based on the robbery victims’ descriptions. On June 18, two armed men allegedly, on the pretext of renting a room, robbed a 72-year-old woman of cash, jewellery and other valuable items at her residence. The woman, Omwati Yadav, was held captive for over two hours. On July 1, four unidentified men held an elderly couple in Sector 10 captive for over one hour, assaulted them, and robbed them of cash and jewellery worth ₹10 lakh between 2pm and 3pm. Fraudsters are also engaging in cybercrimes by calling senior citizens on the pretext of offering Covid-19 vaccinations and asking for their personal details, posing as officials from medical institutes. The police said they are alerting senior citizens not to fall prey to such callers. “We have alerted them not to share OTP or other sensitive details,” said Rao. “We have taken several initiatives for the safety of senior citizens from time to time. Last year, we had started sending teams from the nearest police stations to meet the elderly people, and also to introduce beat officers concerned for further communications. The police (from the nearest station) also texted and called them regularly to ensure their well-being,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/crime-teams-train-lens-on-robbers-targeting-senior-citizens-101625421003754.html
04-07-2021||Gurugram||Serological survey to include more children, details yet to be finalised||The third round of a statewide serological survey, which has been postponed by the state health department, will now include over 30,000 participants across the state instead of 8,800 people, according to senior health officials. It will cover a large number of individuals aged below 18 years to study the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus among lower age groups (6-17 years). The date for the survey is yet to be finalised.“The sample size for the survey has been increased to almost 30,000, which was earlier 8,800 across the state. Children will be included in large numbers to check the presence of IgG antibodies in their blood. A state-level meeting is scheduled on Monday to finalise the age-wise coverage and final dates for the survey,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, state nodal officer for Covid-19.A serological survey is done to detect the body’s immune response to coronavirus infection. Blood samples collected to check IgG antibodies provide information on the proportion of the population having antibodies even if they did not have symptoms or receive a diagnosis of Covid-19. Earlier, over 3,520 children aged six to 17 years were to be covered in the third round of the serological survey scheduled on June 15 and 16. Across the state, a total of 8,800 participants were to be tested for antibodies, of which, 5280 were to be adults, 2,640 children of 10-17 years and 880 children of six to nine years. Meanwhile, as part of a nationwide serological survey that covered 4,509 participants across the country, Faridabad’s Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute covered 1,059 people in Ballabhgargh. This included 189 individuals younger than 18 years and 870 aged above 18 years.The survey, which was released in June, showed that 61.4% of children younger than 18 years and 58.8% above 18 years had antibodies to fight the infection. Officials said that as per the results of the survey, children and adults will be equally impacted.“The infectivity data of the first and the second wave shows that infection has been prevalent across all age groups. Even the nationwide serosurvey predicts a similar result. The state-level survey will give us further evidence,” said Dr Chaudhary.To prepare for a possible third wave, the district health department has set up a 20-bed paediatric unit at Polyclinic in Sector 31, private hospitals have been directed to strengthen their paediatric intensive care units and neonatal care units, and almost 100 beds have been reserved for children at a makeshift Covid care facility in Sector 67. Hospitals have been given till July 10 to submit details on the beds and medical facilities in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/serological-survey-to-include-more-children-details-yet-to-be-finalised-101625420944445.html
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body preps to give vaccination at doorstep for the ill||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appealed to citizens to submit data of their family members who are bedridden due to health complications for at least six months and require Covid-19 vaccination at their doorstep. According to BMC officials, they will just collect data for door-to-door vaccination for now, and that administration of it will start after a go-ahead from the state government.The Maharashtra government had informed the Bombay high court (HC) last week it would soon commence home administration of vaccines for citizens, who are immobile or bedridden, on an experimental basis, starting from Pune district. Hence, the BMC is preparing itself for the same in the coming days.According to BMC officials, they currently do not have exact data on how many such beneficiaries will have to be given vaccine at their homes. They do have data from the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ drive, wherein they had conducted door-to-door screening. However, health conditions do change from time to time and hence they would want citizens to submit their data, officials said. Citizens can submit the names of such family members to their local health officer in the respective ward offices. The civic body may make available an email address for the same in the coming days. The BMC officials added that there are several challenges involved in door-to-door vaccination and it will require specific guidelines from the state health department. For example, one vial has 10 doses and after vaccinating three people at their doorstep, they need guidelines as to what has to be done with the pending seven doses. Further, BMC officials said there also needs to be guidelines on what has to be done in case of adverse effects post immunisation. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “Currently, we are just collecting data for door-to-door vaccination. We will start it only after a go-ahead from the state government.”The BMC aims to vaccinate three million citizens in July. According to BMC officials, around 550,000 citizens in the 45+ age group took their first dose in April 2021 from civic centres, and assuming all these will turn back to civic centres for their second dose, the BMC will require a considerable amount of doses.A BMC official said, “Apart from maintaining a stockpile of 550,000 vaccine doses, we also need to administer vaccines to the 18 to 44 age group and for those taking the first dose in the 45+ age group. Hence, we will require maximum vaccine doses in July, compared to the past six months.”The BMC received a stock of 688,470 vaccine doses, up from the 523,440 in May. Further, it got 947,950 doses (the highest) in April, 810,950 doses in March, 571,000 in February and 265,000 in January.Kakani added, “In our meetings and communication with the state government and central government, we have been asking for maximum possible doses, considering we have adopted an aggressive vaccination drive. Going by this, we would like to administer 100,000 doses daily.”Meanwhile, the BMC has 285 vaccination centres, where it has vaccinated a record 80,000+ beneficiaries in a single day. Overall, the civic vaccination centres have administered 2,966,432 vaccine doses out of the total 5,654,345 administered cumulatively in the state and private vaccination centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-preps-to-give-vaccination-at-doorstep-for-the-ill-101625420223679.html
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Covid during pregnancy: In rare cases, infants face complications||Several recovered Covid-19 pregnant women in the city have given birth to children with in-built antibodies against the virus, while in some rare cases, doctors have observed that such newborn babies are developing complications including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). However, paediatricians associated with paediatric Covid-task force believe that the presence of seroprevalence is not the reason, rather it is believed that antibodies protect against the virus. Amrita Sundareswaran contracted Covid-19 during her first six weeks of pregnancy along with four of her family members. The 36-year-old recovered completely from the infection without any post-Covid complications. She delivered her first child at Nanavati Max Superspeciality Hospital on April 26. But soon, the child developed a breathing problem that worsened within 24 hours and the newborn was put under a ventilator for artificial breathing support. Her treating doctors however had no answer for the sudden development of pulmonary hypertension in the infant. Dr Tejal Shetty, consultant paediatrician and neonatalogist at the hospital who was one of her treating doctors said that Amrita underwent an emergency caesarean section at night on April 26. Within half an hour of delivery, the newborn started developing breathing problems. Considering, 50-60% of newborns after a caesarean section has such complications, he was put under oxygen. But the next day, his breathing declined further and he was immediately put on Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) support. On the same day, out of curiosity, the doctors performed an antibody test on the infant and to their surprise, they found seroprevalence in his blood. “We did a 2D ECHO test that showed the infant had developed pulmonary hypertension and the pulmonary pressure was high (66mm Hg). He was immediately kept under a ventilator as he wasn’t maintaining his oxygen on his own. After six days, we again did a 2D ECHO which showed that the pulmonary pressure had come down to 35mm Hg. The child was on a ventilator for 21 days,” she said. “It wasn’t proportionate medically and we didn’t have the answer why it was happening. Considering the medical history of the mother with Covid-19 infection, we did the antibody test,” she added. The infant was finally discharged after 33 days on May 30. He is still on medication for the pulmonary pressure but is stable. “The child might have got exposed to the virus in the first trimester of the pregnancy when organogenesis (mass of cells turn into complete organs in the developing embryo) takes place. So, there is a possibility that during the formation, the premature lungs got exposed. This virus is just 17 months old so, maybe two years down the lane, we would have a better answer,” Dr Suruchi Desai, senior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology who treated Amrita. “But we have observed that when mothers who are exposed to the virus at any point of the pregnancy, babies develop some complications including minor ones,” she added. ‘MIS-C cases among new born babies’This is not the only case where such ‘unexplained’ complications have been observed among babies with inbuilt antibodies after birth. Dr Samir Sheikh, consultant neonatologist from Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road was involved in the birth of two babies who developed complications after delivery which pointed towards a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Conventionally, children after 4-6 weeks of recovering from Covid-19 develop this condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. As per doctors, though it can be deadly, most children get better with timely medical care. “It is proven that the antibodies produced in the Covid-19 recovered mothers can be transmitted to the newborn babies. But in some cases, we have seen that it doesn’t work as a protective shield. Rather, it is detrimental for the newborn babies which leads to the development of health complications,” he said. Dr Biraj Thakkar, a neonatologist at Akanksha Hospital and Research Institute (AHRI) in Anand who had witnessed similar cases, stating same said while Covid-19 antibodies protect adults from the virus, they can impair the immune system in newborns. However, Dr Bakul Parekh, past president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and part of the paediatric Covid task force has refuted the claims stating that such presence of antibodies in newborn babies has no role on their health. “Newborns with inbuilt antibodies developing complications after birth happens in the rarest of rare cases. Also, it can’t be attributed to the antibodies present in their bodies. Antibodies help to fight against the pathogens, so, it is assumed that it helps in building the immunity,” he said. Though some medical experts indicate a possibility of vertical transmission where the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, transfers from the infected mother to the foetus in the womb. However, due to a lack of scientific data, doctors aren’t certain if the newborn babies are getting infected and developing the antibodies by themselves. “Several studies are going on but it would take time to get the answer. It took years to know that HIV can be transmitted from mother to the foetus in the womb and through breastfeeding,” said Dr Desai. Now, the hospital has started testing newborn babies with ‘unexplained’ health complications post-delivery if the mother had a history of infection. Also, placentas are being tested to find any abnormalities. In some hospitals like the Wadia Hospital and the government-run JJ hospital, newborn babies after 7-8 days of delivery are being diagnosed with MIS-C. Dr Bela Verma, head of the paediatric department of the hospital and former president of Mumbai Association of Paediatrics said there are two possible ways that the newborn is contracting the infection— through horizontal transmission (post-delivery) or vertical transmission (pre-delivery). “Though there hasn’t been any official confirmation on vertical transmission, development of MIS-C indicates the possibility of infection in the uterus. We have got 2-3 such cases where babies have developed MIS-C within a week of delivery,” she said. A study—‘Single-Cell RNA-seq Identifies Cell Subsets in Human Placenta That highly Expresses Factors Driving Pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2’, published jointly conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) at Parel and Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc), revealed that Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can infect the placenta in pregnant women. However, it was not established if a pregnant woman can pass on the infection to her child. “We need more studies to establish and scientifically prove that the fetus can get infected from the virus through the placenta or any other way in the womb,” added Dr Verma. To understand the epidemiological characteristic of the virus that is continuously mutating, researchers require data in bulk. The phenomenon of infants with Covid-19 antibodies was yet to be studied. HT found out that several civic-run hospitals that receive the most number of pregnant mothers with Covid-19 haven’t started conducting antibody tests among newborns. Dr Sushma Malik, head of paediatric department, BYL Nair hospital where over 1,000 deliveries of Covid-19 infected mothers have been done said, “We haven’t done antibody tests on newborn babies yet.” Similarly, Dr Arun Nayak, head of department, gynaecology from Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, known as Sion Hospital said, “We are contemplating to test babies with mothers who have been immunised to check if the antibodies are passing on the newborn. But, so far, we haven’t tested the newborn of infected mothers.” Case study: ‘Vivaan—full of life’ Amrita Sundareswaran, 36, gave birth to her first child on April 26. But before she could even hold her baby, he was put under a ventilator. For 33 days, the infant fought for his life in the hospital before going home on May 30. For his parents, Vivaan – it means ‘full of life’ – is a warrior. Last September, while the city was under the first wave of the pandemic, Amrita got the happiest news that she was pregnant. But her happiness didn’t last long. Only six weeks into her pregnancy, the Chembur resident along with her family members contracted Covid-19. She lost her father-in-law to the infection. “Those were the scariest days. I was so worried about my child. What calmed me down was being told that the virus doesn’t pass on to the foetus and the infection rate among children was less in the first wave,” she said. Amrita recovered without any complications and delivered Vivaan on April 26. But within 30 minutes, her nightmare came true when her baby was kept on oxygen support and later shifted to ICU. Amrita was unaware that the antibodies developed in her body in reaction to Sars-Cov-2 could be transmitted to her son. “We were shocked when doctors told us that he has antibodies of the virus. We had already gone through a lot, and this broke us. We didn’t even know exactly why antibodies that saved us would harm my son,” she said. For almost three weeks, she saw Vivaan through a glass door. “I couldn’t hold my baby. I would pump my breast milk thrice a day at home, and travel back to the hospital,” recalled Amrita. “Vivaan is completely healthy now. My son is a fighter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-during-pregnancy-in-rare-cases-infants-face-complications-101625420163724.html

04-07-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: MD of company that owned tugboat applies for bail||Rajesh Shahi, the managing director of Glory Ship management private limited, which owns the Varaprada tug boat, which capsized during Cyclone Tauktae and resulted in the death of 11 crew members, of 13 onboard, has applied for anticipatory bail in the sessions court. The police officers said that they have got a notification about anticipatory bail applied by Shahi from the court and will be opposing his bail in the court.The Yellow Gate police had registered a case against Shahi and his company Glory Ship Management on June 24 under the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and common intention, based on the statement given by the complainant, Francis K Simon, a second engineer of the Varaprada tug boat, which sank on May 17. Of the 13 onboard, 11 died, while two, including Simon, were rescued by the Indian Navy.“We have recorded the statement of Shahi and five employees of the Glory Ship Management earlier and further investigation is on,” said an officer.During the investigation, a team went to Kerala and recorded the statement of Simon who alleged that the company did not carry out the required maintenance and repair works, and their irresponsible act resulted in a tragic incident in which 11 people died. Simon, who was the second engineer of the boat and one of its only two survivors, also alleged that the boat was not seaworthy and the owner was well aware of the boat’s defective conditions, said a police officer.According to the police, on the instructions from Afcons Infrastructure Limited on May 14, Varaprada started tugging barge Gal Constructor back to safety from near an oil rig in the south field of Bombay High, around 90 nautical miles from the Mumbai shore.Due to the cyclone, both started drifting on May 17 while they were on the way to the coast in the wee hours and in the afternoon Varaprada sank, leading to the death of 11 crew on board including the captain and two including Simon jumped before it sank and they were later rescued by Navy. The Gal Constructor was carrying 137 people on board drifted over 100 kilometres and ran aground at Palghar. All crew members were rescued by the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard. The police have been conducting an investigation and will soon arrest the people responsible for the incident, added the officer.In another case, the Yellow Gate police on Friday night arrested three persons -Prasad Ganpat Rane, Nitin Dinanath Singh and Akhilesh Tiwari who are key management members of Papaa Shipping Company Pvt Ltd, Vile Parle, in connection with accommodation barge Papaa305 (P305) that had capsized in the Arabian Sea during Cyclone Tauktae on May 17, resulting in the loss of 75 lives.During interrogation in their statement, the three revealed that officials of the companies that had hired the barge were responsible for the sinking as they did not send in a tug boat in time to take the barge (P305) and bring it near Mumbai coast, said police officer part of the investigating team. But Rane, Singh and Tiwari were well aware of the serious warning issued by the authority concerned in the connection with Cyclone Tauktae. They were appointed to get daily progress reports of the employees, said senior inspector Suhas Hemade of the Yellow Gate police station.The trio neither called back their employees as well as other agencies like the Indian Navy and ICG to take the barge to a safe place. There are other responsible people of the company and a detailed investigation is going on to fix responsibility, said Hemade.Initially, a first information report (FIR) in the matter was registered on May 21 against the master of the barge Rakesh Ballav and some others based on the statement of Mistafizur Rahman Hussain Shaikh, who was part of the maintenance crew of the vessel. Shaikh had accused Ballav and others of overlooking the weather alerts and for failing to take appropriate care despite knowing that the lapse could result in the loss of lives.Rane, Singh and Tiwari have been arrested on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, endangering life or personal safety of others and common intention and the trio are in police custody till July 8.

04-07-2021||Jaipur||‘Society can’t decide how individuals live...’: Rajasthan HC grants protection to live-in couple||The Rajasthan High Court has ruled that society cannot dictate terms on couples in live-in relationships by terming such a relation as unsocial. The court was dealing with a protection plea filed by a couple.The court observed that society cannot determine how individuals live their lives, even when such a relationship may be termed as unsocial.The bench of Justice Mahendar Kumar Goyal observed, “The girl being a major is entitled to reside with the person of her choice.”The court was told that the society where the couple was residing was threatening them as it was not happy with their relationship. In view of this, the couple sought police protection.The court was also told that since an FIR was registered against the man, police protection cannot be extended to the couple.Hearing this, the Court observed, “...the society cannot determine how individuals live their lives, especially when they are major, irrespective of the fact that the relation between two major individuals may be termed as unsocial. Thus, life and personal liberty of the individuals has to be protected except according to procedure established by law, as mandated by Article 21 of the Constitution of India.”It added, “Further, as per Section 29 of Rajasthan Police Act, 2007 every police officer is duty-bound to protect the life and liberty of the citizen.”The Court disposed of the petition saying that a copy of the petition should be sent to the SHO of the concerned police station who shall take necessary preventive measures to ensure the safety and security of the couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/society-can-t-decide-how-individuals-live-rajasthan-hc-grants-protection-to-live-in-couple-101625419445618.html
04-07-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh says BJP should send Yogi Adityanath to Uttarakhand to resolve issues||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday took a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying that it should consider sending Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath to Uttarakhand hours after Pushkar Singh Dhami was sworn in as the new chief minister of the state.Akhilesh said that this solution will help Uttarakhand get rid of the ‘daily problem of leadership change’ while democracy in Uttar Pradesh would be relieved of its ‘injuries caused due to Yogi Adityanath’.“In Uttar Pradesh, democracy has been ‘injured’ because of the chief minister (Yogi Adityanath), and in Uttarakhand, democracy has become a ‘victim of instability’. In this situation, it will be better if the BJP transfers the Uttar Pradesh chief minister to Uttarakhand, so that the hill state gets free from the daily problem of change of leadership,” Akhilesh was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.In Uttarakhand, a change in leadership happened as BJP leader Tirath Singh Rawat resigned as the state's chief minister on Friday after holding the post for less than four months. Rawat replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat in March. Pushkar Singh Dhami will now lead the state. He was elected as the leader of the BJP legislature party on Saturday.Akhilesh criticised the BJP-led government in both states saying that both suffered from law and order problems. He said that women feel insecure in both states and political manipulation has affected investments in both the states. “Unemployment, inflation and corruption is on the rise since the BJP came to power in these states,” Yadav further added.Yadav said that healthcare in both states have deteriorated under the regime of the BJP. The SP chief added that women find it difficult to live with honour and injustice is being meted out to farmers in both states.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-says-bjp-should-send-yogi-adityanath-to-uttarakhand-to-resolve-issues-101625418776997.html
04-07-2021||Patna||Chirag’s ‘Ashirvad Yatra’ to start from July 5; LJP leader plans another political trek from October||Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan will, on July 5, begin his Ashirvad Yatra from Hajipur, the Lok Sabha constituency his father late Ram Vikas Paswan nurtured and represented eight times since 1977.The constituency is currently represented by his (Chirag’s) uncle and leader of the rebel LJP faction Pashupati Kumar Paras.The move is significant as this is the first time since the split in the LJP that Chirag, who is fighting a legal battle with his uncle for his claim over the party, will visit the state to test political waters in the face of a hostile atmosphere and without the presence of his father, on the late leader Ram Vilas Paswan’s birth anniversary Monday.Politics in Bihar has already been on the boil ever since RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said that the Nitish government could fall in 2-3 months and growing murmuring from within the NDA.Chirag said, “We have a small programme to observe the birth anniversary in Delhi and after that, I will fly to Patna and go directly to Hajipur from the airport. This Ashirvad Yatra is to seek the blessings of the people. In Hajipur, everyone knows how passionate my father was about Hajipur’s people. I will seek their blessings to kick start the yatra. I will be at my father’s karmbhoomi to embark on a new mission to do whatever I could for my state. I had presented my vision for Bihar even during assembly elections and got good responses despite not getting seats, and I will continue doing so.”The first leg of Ashirvad Yatra will cover 12-13 districts. It will be the beginning of a new politics by Chirag, often accused of operating from Delhi and not spending much time in the state. “After the first phase, there will be a second phase and in the next one and half months, I will cover the entire state and it will culminate as a National Council Meeting in Patna,” he said.From October 8, Chirag said he would undertake another Yatra on foot to crisscross the state to connect directly with the masses and see the ground reality. “Now I will spend more time in Bihar and strive to fulfil the dreams of my father. I have chosen the difficult path for myself, as I have some objectives in mind that certainly do not include the yearning for the chair. I will stick to my plans,” he added.Party leaders said Chirag’s political move was aimed at finding a bigger political space for the LJP in a state where politics has been dominated by the RJD, the BJP and the JD-U and despite late Ram Vilas Paswan’s political stature, his party had to remain content with the fourth player and a vote splitter.During the assembly election, the LJP remained an enigma all through due to its posturing, which seemed to be clearly targeted at Nitish Kumar, which no other leader did in the past.“How he goes about his Yatra will be interesting to watch. He has shown that he can carry himself well in politics, though he does not have the experience and the protective cover of his father anymore. Whatever happened in the LJP after Ram Vilas Paswan’s demise may have given a lifetime lesson to Chirag, which could galvanise him to throw his hat in the largely vacant Dalit politics with greater maturity and energy. The legacy of his father will remain with him and it is for him to take it forward. Sometimes, jolts are good in politics,” said former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies DM Diwakar.Diwakar said that Chirag’s father was acceptable to all parties. “He could get along with all, nobody was ever unhappy with him. Now Chirag will have to show political maturity like his father,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/chirags-ashirvad-yatra-to-start-from-july-5-ljp-leader-plans-another-political-trek-from-october-101625418063600.html

On Sunday, the East Central Railways (ECR) suspended operation of trains on Muzaffarpur-Samastipur section after a gushing stream originating from Burhi Gandak touched the girder of a railway bridge between Sugauli and Majhaulia stations, officials said.ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said operation of trains on Muzaffarpur-Paniyahawa section was snapped owing to safety reasons. “The ECR has cancelled running of Narkatiaganj-Muzaffarpur special train due to floods and diverted route of seven trains to avoid flooded zones. Three express trains are being short terminated,” he said.While water level of all major rivers originating from Himalayan regions in Nepal kept on rising throughout their course, small rivers such as Parmar and Nona are wreaking havoc in Araria districts. A teenage boy was reportedly drowned in a stream of Kamala river near Rajaur village under Madhepur police station area of Madhubani, as per reports on Sunday.According to water resources department (WRD), rivers Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi, Mahananda, Adhwara, Kamla, Khiroi, Parmar were flowing above the danger level (DL) at different places in their courses. “All embankments on major rivers are safe, even as swirling water in the rivers have kept officials on their toes to avert any mishap with support from local volunteers,” said WRD minister Sanjay Jha.Flood threat became more pronounced in Muzaffarpur on Sunday, as Bagmati was flowing around 2.40cm above the DL at Runni Saidpur. The river was flowing on the DL at Benibad in Muzaffarpur and Dheng in Sitamarhi. The Gandak, which had already topped the DL at Dumariaghat in Gopalganj by 1.25m, has jumped the red mark at Rewaghat in Muzaffapur.According to reports, water gushed out of Nona river and has engulfed dozens of villages under Sikti block of Araria, leaving hundreds of families marooned. The flood-hit people have been waiting for relief measures, as there was sever scarcity potable water and essential eatables.Heavy rains in catchment areas of Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati are likely to complicate miseries of people. Incessant rains have already damaged major interdistrict roads in North Bihar areas, which led to disruption of vehicular movement. Officials said they were facing difficulties in rushing relief material due to disruption in vehicular movement.The disaster management department (DMD), however, is yet to issue any press statement to officially declare the impact of floods in the state and relief being provided to the affected people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/floods-take-toll-on-train-movement-in-bihar-101625417164096.html

This is all rubbish,” he said while talking to reporters in the national capital.The minister, who is hogging the limelight after threatening to resign alleging high handedness of officials in his department a few days back, said he was still firm on his decision to tender his papers but would first meet the chief minister to apprise him of the situation. “I have offered to resign because I am miffed with the work culture in the bureaucracy. I will explain everything to the CM and leave it to him to address the issue. I expect the CM to say who is wrong. If I do not get justice, I will make a decision,” the minister said. The minister, who belongs to the JD(U), said his recent outbursts were aimed at highlighting how bureaucrats were calling the shots and not paying much heed to ministers.However, Sahni sounded a bit softened in terms of his relationship with the chief minister, indicating there could be some back-channel talks going on by his party to mollify the CM. “Nitish Kumar is my leader. If I have reached such heights in my career, it is because of him,” he said. A few days back, Sahni had said the chief minister should probe the assets of bureaucrats close to him, which fuelled the speculations that the minister’s relationship with Kumar had strained. “I have always had faith in our chief minister. He listens to all. I am confident he would listen to me and do justice,” the minister added.Meanwhile, JD(U) national president R C P Singh underplayed the belligerent stand taken by the social welfare minister against top officers and the questions he raised on work culture in the state administration. “Our party is like a house where such acts of expression of anger by some members often happen. Sahni Ji must have aired some views out of anger,” he said.Singh also took potshots at the leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for reiterating that the present government led by the NDA would fall soon. “He keeps saying such things to console himself. Our government is stable and will complete its full term. Nobody should be in doubt about it,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/will-meet-bihar-cm-and-seek-justice-says-social-welfare-minister-sahni-101625417103469.html

Among facilities awaiting vaccine supplies are Ruban Patliputra hospital, Kurji Holy Family hospital Netaji Subhash Medical College hospital (NSMCH, Bihta), SS hospital, Mediversal hospital, Mahavir Vatsalya, Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Medipark Healthcare Pvt Ltd, KP Sinha Super Specialty hospital and Shri Murlidhar Nursing Home. Some centres like SS Hospital have placed requirement for only 10 doses of Covishield, as per government data, which is effectively one vial of the vaccine. The NSMCH-Bihta, and Medipark Healthcare have sought 50 doses only. Dr LB Singh, medical superintendent of Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, said the institution had applied for 100 doses of vaccine initially on an experimental basis. “We had initially applied for 3,000 doses earlier, but government authorities asked us to procure vaccines in small quantity. We then decided to take only 100 doses on a trial basis,” said Dr Singh. “We administered 3,529 doses of vaccine between February 1 and April 29, when the government was supplying them free of cost,” he said. Later, the government changed its policy from May 1 and again from June 21, when the Union government decided to purchase vaccines centrally and distribute them free of cost among states and Union Territories and charge private players, while acting as an aggregator. Manoj Kumar, executive director of State Health Society, Bihar, admitted that none of the 76 private institutions empanelled on CoWIN portal with the state government have received vaccines through the government channel after June 21. “The Centre Saturday sent revised guidelines on vaccine procurement wherein the minimum consignment size for state supply has been fixed at 6,000 doses of Covishield and 2,880 doses of Covaxin. For each private facility, the minimum consignment order should be 500 doses of Covishield and 160 doses of Covaxin,” said Kumar. “In light of this, we will talk to some private players that want as low as 10 to 500 doses,” he said. Kumar, however, said he received no communication, either from the Centre or vaccine manufacturers, over the delay in supply to private players. Besides, Ruban Patliputra Hospital applied for 1,250 doses, 1,000 Covishield and 250 Covaxin, and also made advance payment last week, but was in the dark about their availability status. “We have completed all formalities and paid in advance for 1,250 doses of vaccines, but do not know when we will get them,” said Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, managing director, Ruban. “Additionally, we are also trying to get 500 doses of Sputnik V through private channel,” he said. BIG Apollo Spectra hospital, Paras-HMRI and Jai Prabha Medanta are the only three private hospitals in Patna inoculating people after procuring the vaccine through private channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/private-facilities-in-bihar-clueless-on-vaccine-availability-after-making-advance-payment-101625416863401.html

Raxaul Municipal Council became the first city council in the state where everyone was vaccinated.”In Piprakothi block, the first dose was given to as many as 31,591 people above 18 years of age in six panchayats spread over 20 revenue villages of Piprakothi block, which has a total population of 77,089 as per Census 2011, said officials.It took over two months for the vaccinators’ team, comprising UNICEF personnel and local health workers, to achieve the feat. The development came barely few days after Bankatwa, another block in East Champaran, became the first in the state to administer the first dose to all eligibles. East Champaran district magistrate Shirsat Kapil Ashok said, “The number of migrants are relatively high in the block. We are keeping a tab on migrant workers and other non-residents, and efforts are on to ensure that they get vaccinated.” They will be administered the vaccine as and when they come, said the district magistrate. Speaking to HT over phone, Piprakothi block development officer (BDO) Manoj Kumar described the challenges they faced in convincing residents to get the vaccine. Vaccinators faced refusal in over a dozen Mahadalit and minority dominated wards across the block, he said. However, the members of minority groups now believe in the importance of vaccine. Kunti Devi, 60, a resident of Mahadalit Basti at Belajagatiya village in Piprakothi block of East Champaran said she had misconceptions about the vaccine . “Merely the mention of the jab would unnerve me. I dodged over a dozen of attempts to be inoculated,” Devi said. She, however, yielded to persuasion on June 25 after Motihari SDM and other officials reached her doorstep.Similarly, the gravest worry of one Vinod Manjhi, 38 and his wife Malti Devi, 33, residents of ward number 4 of Belatal village in Piprakothi block, was the bleak future for their five children if the vaccine rendered any harm. “With the rumours that spread, I too had disbelieved in vaccination,” said Manjhi, who took the jab during a mega camp.Lalu Manjhi, a member of Mushar Vikas (MVM), said it wasn’t easy for the organisation to convince people to take the jab. “Owing to sheer illiteracy and misconception about the vaccine, it took several meetings and awareness programmes by officials and local representatives to build up a popular opinion among Mahadalit community,” said Manjhi. The minority group have a population of about 3,000 in the block, he said. Officials also administered the vaccines to residents of other villages in a bid to boost confidence further, said Priyaranjan Raju, subdivisional magistrate (SDM), Motihari (sadar). Of those vaccinated in Piprakothi, 18,726 were in the age group of 18-45 years and 12,865 above 45 years of age of the total population of 31,650. “The remaining 59 are pregnant women who will be inoculated later,” said the block development officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-after-bankatwa-entire-18-population-of-raxaul-municipal-council-piprakothi-block-receives-first-dose-of-vaccine-101625416743493.html

It neither has the right policy nor a clear intention. Everything from petrol, diesel, cooking gas to daily-use items has become expensive.Citing the government data on inflation, he said, "It shows how fast the prices of goods have increased in the market."The chief minister said the high inflation clubbed with reduced income due to the coronavirus pandemic is making it difficult for the common man to run his household.Increasing the price of mustard oil to ₹180-190 per litre is like snatching food from the common man, he said.Gehlot claimed the Modi government has increased the price of LPG cylinders by ₹255 in the last 14 months."Gas subsidy has also been completely stopped now," he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/gehlot-blames-centre-for-rising-inflation-says-no-concrete-step-taken-in-last-7-years-101625414723116.html

The already working staff has been asked to pitch in with vaccinations as well, which has led to the relatively slow pace of the inoculation drive. The major burden has fallen on ward nurses, who are already loaded with their routine work. “The hospital has no post for handling the work of Covid-19 vaccination. We require at least two people, working only on vaccination, to meet our daily target. On Saturday, we vaccinated 762 persons against the assigned target of 1,000,” said Rajesh Sharma, president, Employee Welfare Association, at the hospital. Another issue plaguing the vaccination drive is nurses working in the mother-child ward are also put on vaccination duty. This a grave risk for the newborns. Sharma added, “If we are given more staff, we can vaccinate almost twice the number of people we’re vaccinating now.” Before the Covid-19 virus struck, the hospital had been getting people on deputation to tide over staff strength issues. Assistant civil surgeon Amarjeet Singh said, “We’ll resolve the issue by arranging more staff and meet our daily targets. Even with such challenges, we have vaccinated 54% of the city’s population. On Friday, we conducted 45 mega camps in the city and vaccinated around 45,000 people, which was more than the target given to us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amritsar-civil-hospital-without-specialised-staff-for-vaccination-101625415064510.html

He was, now, trying to create another module with three history-sheeters.”“We had information that Dala had made threatening calls and texts to a sweet-shop owner at Talwandi Bhai in Ferozepur district, asking for ₹30 lakh. The three arrested were to collect the money from this businessman. Finally, a joint team nabbed the trio,” the SSP added. The trio have confessed to be acting on the directions of Arsh Dala and were tasked with extorting ₹30 lakh from the sweet-shop owner. The SSP added that Yadvinder Yadi was a close aide of slain gangster, Vicky Gounder. A grey Chevrolet Cruze car (DL3CAE4302), a .32 bore pistol with live cartridges and 20gm heroin have been recovered from their possession. A case has been registered against them under Sections 21/61/85 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the Arms Act at the Smalsar police station.Recently, Moga Police had busted a targeted-killing module with its arrest of Lovepreet Singh, Ram Singh and Kamaljeet Sharma, after it emerged that they had acted on the direction of KTF’s Canada-based chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar. They also arrested gangster Hardeep Singh, alias Suraj Raunta, an accomplice of the KTF operative. “The National Investigation Agency has taken over the probe into targeted killings; thus, we have also shared these inputs with it,” the SSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-ktf-operatives-arrested-in-moga-extortion-plan-foiled-101625414223884.html

Ranjana, 30, a mother of two children aged 10 and seven years, is one such Bijli Sakhi. A resident of Dhokari village in Phulpur development block of the district, she goes off on government business every morning after quickly completing her household chores.Every day, from 10 am, Ranjana visits home after home. She walks long stretches under the scorching sun, reading electricity meters and generating bills using a smart device hanging around her neck. She quickly collects the billed amount and then deposits it at the local power department office.Having completed her BA from a local degree college, this is the first time Ranjana has ever stepped out of her home to work and support her household. Like her, dozens of other women too have been employed as Bijli Sakhis in Prayagraj. They too visit rural homes, take readings of electricity meters and collect the due amounts.“The experience is new but empowering. Till now, the home was my world and looking after the needs of my two children and my husband Shauki Lal, a vegetable seller, was all I have done for the past 11 years now. In 2012, I completed my BA but never worked,” said Ranjana. After taking the job of a Bijli Sakhi, she underwent brief training on reading meters and generating power bills before she started working in August 2020.This move to rely on women to realise power dues from villagers by the state electricity department seems to be paying off. Engaging rural women of self-help groups (SHGs) as Bijli Sakhis as part of a state government initiative under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) has resulted in power bills worth over ₹49 lakh being collected by them from the rural areas of Soraon, Koraon, Phulpur, Meja, Karchana, Mauaima and Pratappur development blocks in Prayagraj district of eastern Uttar Pradesh between February 1 and June 15, 2021, despite the pandemic—a fact testified by officials.These 102 women working in 10 groups have managed to realise this amount from 5,274 consumers, surprising even senior power department officials and earning a total of ₹2.5 lakh as commission for themselves.“Many a time, people distrust while other times they just do not want to pay the power dues. There are also cases where people have not paid up, owing to genuine issues like past payments not getting reflected in the bills. You have to sort out all these issues and only then people pay up. But the fact that we are women, remain calm and patient even under pressure and many a time move in groups, all seem to make even those people pay the power dues who had not done so earlier,” said Sanju Maurya, a housewife and a part-time Bijli Sakhi working in the Soraon area of the district.“This work has also earned me a lot of respect among all villagers,” she added.“These women have ensured that collection of electricity dues from rural areas, even during the peak of the pandemic’s second wave, remained healthy in Prayagraj. We are now planning to encourage more rural women to join this mission aimed at empowering them and also doing a noble national service,” said chief engineer of Prayagraj division, Vinod Kumar Gangwar.NRLM’s district mission manager Amit Shukla, too, expressed happiness over the performance of the rural women, most working for the very first time. “We had trained 115 women to work as Bijli Sakhis in Prayagraj and 102 of them have already started working by reading electricity meters, generating bills and collecting the due amounts. The fact that in less than five months they have earned a commission of ₹2.5 lakh for themselves despite the Covid-19 is pandemic is really worthy of applause,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bijli-sakhis-collect-power-dues-worth-over-rs-49-lakh-from-villagers-in-up-district-101625413923795.html

She also said that the opinions of the party workers will be very important for the assembly elections. She asked party workers to revamp the booths while maintaining active participation on social media.Priyanka highlighted that Congress workers helped migrant workers, arranged oxygen cylinders, concentrators, medical and ration kits for the people who were in need of these during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Congress always derives unseen power from serving humanity during an emergency.

BKU district president Azad Palwan presided over the meeting, in which the farmers passed nine resolutions moved by him.Besides resolving to push for the revocation of farm laws, legal guarantee on the minimum support price, loan waiver for farmer and farm labourers, and cancellation of four labour codes, the mahapanchayat decided to vote against candidates backed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and Jannayak Janata Party coalition in the upcoming panchayat polls in the state. The farmers also sought the cancellation of law that allows recoveries to be made for damages to property from protesters, and demanded ₹50 lakh compensation and government job to the next of kin of those who died during the ongoing agitation. Other resolutions concerned power crisis and crimes against women in Haryana.Azad Palwan said the Union government is hatching a conspiracy to defame farmers in an attempt to break the agitation.“The BJP should know that every section of society has been supporting the farm stir, because everyone has been hit hard by inflation, crime, unemployment and electricity issues, and people are forced to fight for their livelihood at every front.

In its first meeting held on June 27 in Panchavati, the forum invited people to join the movement to save the hills. Several forum members raised their concerns with the project and the serious ramifications, the project may cause if allowed. During the meeting, various citizens’ forums, NGO’s, environmentalists presented the impact of the proposed tunnels on the area and the tekdi. “The tunnel project has serious ramifications. It will have a disproportionate impact on the environment by irreversibly damaging one of the largest urban aquifer complexes - the Vetal tekdi hill range. This will result in growth of tanker lobbies in the areas that presently have no problems of water scarcity,” said Manoj Bhagwat, researcher, ACWADAM (Advanced Centre for Water Resources Development and Management). He further added that the tunnel will permanently impact the capability of the city to sustain development in the future. “It also has a large socio-economic impact especially on the densely inhabited areas of Kothrud and Gokhalenagar. The tunnel project will not solve the traffic congestion problem as is proposed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), instead it will result in serious health risks,” said Pradeep Ghumare, resident and member of the Save Vetal tekdi. The forum representatives also felt that such a project should not be taken up by PMC particularly in the wake of the ongoing pandemic. “With Covid hitting hard on our economy, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should be more judicious with its resources and focus on completion of Metro project that, according to PMC’s own account, will ease traffic congestion problem significantly,” said Sarang Yadwadkar, architect and urban planner. “The tunnel project is unnecessary and wasteful expenditure of public money, particularly when PMC is already facing a massive financial crunch,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/common-platform-formed-for-saving-vetal-tekdi-from-tunnel-construction-101625408762414.html

The power cuts have directly affected professionals with work from home duties, and students having online classes.According to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), the power cuts are a result of damaged lines during road digging. A number of complaints were registered at the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), however, there has been no reprieve from power cuts. “This has become a recurring theme for people who are living in Balewadi and it has become a bane of our life to find ourselves in darkness four to five times in a week,” said Vijay Varasgaonkar, resident who is fed up of the consistent power outages. “We are suffering for the past eight to 10 years as there is no proper planning when it comes to making a proper duct for the repairs to be conducted. Every now and then, the road is dug up and every time it is us who suffer. There should be a proper duct for allowing MSECDL or any other user to make repairs and not dig up the newly laid roads,” he said. Dheeraj Bangad, who lives in Regency Cosmos on Baner road experienced being in the dark for more than eight hours during the week. “The officials have been digging up the road under the name of smart city project and accidently hit / damaged the electrical lines. We have been in the dark for more than eight hours, then the electricity came around for an hour around 2 am, only to be gone again for another six hours. After constant complaining, we got to know that the people working on this project damaged the lines. I find that there is no coordination among the authorities and we are suffering because of them,” said Bangad. According to the residents, who have begun their own way of recording the number of complaints via social media said that cables have been damaged three times but the MSEDCL team is busy in attending the fault one after another. This damage of cables due to indiscriminate digging should stop. The residents have also made it a norm to question the authorities whether power supply will be intermittent whole day before they begin planning their day. “We communicate with the smart city officials daily and inform them to work diligently around the cables even the officers are cooperating and together we also do site inspections but those working at ground level create a problem and sometimes in a day, they are damaged in three to four sites along Baner-Balewadi. We are in fact asking to write to smart city officials about this ongoing,” said MSEDCL executive engineer on the condition of anonymity. “During excavation, there are no markings on the cables and sometimes they are accidently damaged, if it is damaged, we immediately rectify it, nobody does it deliberately and we penalize the contractors,” said a smart city official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/balewadibaner-residents-face-frequent-power-cuts-msedcl-blames-smart-city-project-101625408643458.html
04-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP chief passes diktat on movement of MLAs, raises question||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators from West Bengal cannot travel without informing the state leadership, state present Dilip Ghosh said at a workshop organised for its 75 MLAs on Saturday. This immediately raised questions as no party in Bengal has imposed such a restriction on their leaders in recent history.“Ghosh told us that no MLA is above the party. They are part of an organisation and hence cannot visit any place they like without informing the leadership,” a newly-elected MLA, who attended the workshop in Kolkata, said on condition of anonymity.While Ghosh’s mandate was described by party leader’s as “an effort to enforce discipline” some of them felt it reflected Ghosh’s displeasure over Suvendu Adhikari’s recent visits to Delhi where he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and other top leaders. During his last trip, Adhikari triggered a controversy by visiting the home of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Though Mehta and Adhikari said they did not meet because the former was busy in a meeting, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has demanded the Solicitor General’s removal citing ethics.The ruling party has said that since Adhikari is an accused in the Narada sting operation case and Mehta is representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in court, they cannot meet. Two TMC MPs, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mahua Moitra, will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday to seek Mehta’s removal.On earlier occasions, as well as on Friday when the controversy emerged, Ghosh said he was not aware of why Adhikari was in Delhi and who he met. Ghosh, in fact, stirred up the issue by asking why questions are not being raised about TMC leaders who were seen accepting bribes in the Narada sting videos recorded in 2014. Adhikari, who was a TMC MP, MLA and cabinet minister and joined the BJP in December last year, was among those seen in the videos.Significantly, Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, was not present at the workshop when Ghosh passed his diktat on the movement of MLAs. Adhikari arrived after Ghosh left. Neither of them commented on the issue before the media.In the recent polls, Adhikari defeated Mamata Banerjee and retained the Nandigram seat in the East Midnapore district. Of the 75 BJP legislators, 71 were elected for the first time. The party won 77 seats while the TMC bagged 213 of Bengal’s 294 seats. Two BJP MLAs later resigned to retain their Lok Sabha seats.BJP national joint general secretary Shiv Prakash addressed the MLAs at the workshop. He asked them to focus on their performance as people’s representatives and not to get demoralised by the defeat in the elections in which the party targeted 200 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-chief-passes-diktat-on-movement-of-mlas-raises-question-101625407562961.html

Delhi Police constable finds and returns it||A Delhi Police constable turned out to be a saviour for a labourer who forgot his bag containing ₹1 lakh in cash at the Shivaji Bridge railway station’s platform and left on the train for his home in Uttar Pradesh.Vijay Kumar, a labourer in the city who lives in northwest Delhi’s Shakur Basti, is the only breadwinner of his family. Vijay had withdrawn ₹1 lakh from his bank account in Delhi and brought 55kg worth of ration items. He was returning to UP’s Khurja where he was planning to build a home for his children.Vijay, unfortunately, left his cash bag behind on a bench at the platform and loaded the two bags of ration in the Bareilly-New Delhi intercity express, according to a report by news agency PTI.Constable Narender Kumar who was posted with the New Delhi Railway police station was on duty at Shivaji Bridge station and was making rounds at the platform after the intercity express train left the station. Narender found a carry bag on the bench and enquired if the bag belonged to any passengers on the platform.“I decided to keep the unclaimed bag with me. On checking it, I found two cash bundles amounting to ₹1 lakh with some rotis packed in a foil paper, water bottle, cheque book, bank passbook along with an Aadhar and ration card,” Narender was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Narender immediately informed his seniors about it and tried to contact Vijay Kumar but was unable to reach out to him. He decided to wait until someone came asking for the money.Vijay returned to Shivaji Bridge station around 6.30pm and was safely handed over the bag with ₹1 lakh by the constable after due formalities. “Vijay Kumar left his carry bag at the station. Our constable Narender found the bag unclaimed and returned the belongings to Kumar along with his cash of ₹1 lakh,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra Kumar Singh said.Vijay later recalled the day and said that when the train arrived he boarded it in a hurry and left his ‘thaila’ on the bench. He said it was when he felt thirsty at Anand Vihar station he realised that he misplaced the bag containing the money. He said he was in tears as he had ₹1 lakh in cash and the money was necessary as he was saving it to build a small house for his children.Vijay said that he asked people at the Anand Vihar station to look after his ration for a few hours so that he can go look for his money but no one agreed. “I lost all hopes but Narender babu was a saviour. He handed over my belongings and also got me boarded in the next train safely,” a relieved Vijay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/labourer-loses-rs-1-lakh-delhi-police-constable-finds-and-returns-it-101625401753186.html
04-07-2021||Pune||Freecycling trend catches on in Pune||Not everything in life is transactional. Some of the most uplifting experiences in life are cost-free. This is probably the sentiment fuelling the global movement of freecycling, which seems to have become the new buzzword in Pune.For the uninitiated, freecycling involves giving away things that are of no use or are a surplus at home. These are items that are in a good and usable condition, and can find purpose in another house.Helming the freecycling movement in the city is the husband-wife duo of Anupam Barve and Maitra. Anupam is an independent filmmaker, film educator, and associate professor of film direction at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). Maitra, an alumna of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), is a social worker, counsellor, and writer.Speaking about what led them to start a WhatsApp group for freecycling, Anupam explained that back in 2009, he used to live in the United Kingdom, where he spent about four years. At that time, he was a part of a group dedicated to freecycling. As a student, and later as someone who had just started a teaching stint, there would be financial constraints. He stressed, “At that time, freecycling seemed like a real godsend. It also helped me embrace a more eco-conscious and minimalist way of life. The idea of freecycling is not originally mine; it is, in fact, a worldwide movement.”For Anupam and Maitra, an additional boost to launching a freecycling forum came from the fact that for about six years, Maitra has been running an activity called ‘Jhini.’ Under its aegis, old clothes are collected from people, and are reused or repurposed depending on their useability. “The idea of freecycling is very much in tandem with Jhini’s core philosophy, and this has given us all the more reason to launch the freecycling initiative in Pune,” added the duo.The couple has formed a WhatsApp group, titled Pune Freecycle, to facilitate free transactions of goods. The central idea is to make the fullest use of a manufactured commodity, especially something non-biodegradable or made in plastic before it ends up in landfills. Phone chargers, table lamps, books, extension cords, biking gloves, helmets, utensils, cycles, and old yet functional electronic gadgets, and so on: there’s tremendous room for freecycling.“If you are going on a trek to the Himalayas and need a warm jacket, chances are that you wouldn’t be needing it post the trek. So why buy, when you can freecycle? It’s a more convenient, prudent and sustainable alternative,” suggests Maitra.The operative word of the movement is “free.” It is critical that there is no financial exchange involved in freecycling, and it is a matter of ethics that the items offered are in a clean and usable state. The modus operandi for using ‘Pune Freecycle’ is very simple. People who wish to give something away, as also commodity-seekers, post on the group and inform what they wish to offer or receive. And as informed by Anupam, in most of the cases, their requirements are met in no time.Sharing an anecdote, he added, “There was a really old and non-usable cane sofa that was lying at home. It was partly broken, and in such a bad shape that even the garbage disposal facilities had refused to accept it. I thought of taking a chance and put it up for freecycling in our group. To my surprise, within ten minutes after the post, I’d already found a taker for it. It was a girl living close-by, who was running a venture of handicrafts made from recycled cane.” Evidently, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.We are usually guilty of hoarding a range of things that we don’t use. “Typically, during festivals, or any other festival, people clean and organise their homes, and there are a bunch of workable things, which are not required. Since they’ve not gone bad, people don’t want to throw them away, but at the same time, they also don’t need them. Or sometimes, we get some home appliances as gifts, but the old ones may be perfectly functional. In such scenarios, freecycling is a great choice,” said Maitra.What is freecycling?*Freecycling involves giving away things that are of no use or are a surplus at home.

04-07-2021||Kolkata||50% applications for cyclone Yaas relief in Bengal binned as 'bogus': Report||The West Bengal government has declined almost 50 per cent of the applications, which were filed seeking compensation for the Cyclone Yaas damage, as "bogus", after spot verification, PTI quoted a senior official as saying.The state government last month received 381,774 applications at the camps set up under its Duare Tran (relief at doorstep) programme, the official said, reported PTI.Also read | ‘Waiting for nod from PM’: Mamata on delay in dates for bypolls in Bengal"After due verification of all applications, done between June 18 and 30, at least 1,86,815 were rejected - mainly by block development officers or heads of urban local bodies - as they were found to be fake," PTI quoted him as saying.More than 162,000 applications seeking relief were filed in South 24 Paraganas district, of them over 75,000 were rejected. In Purba Midnapore, 72,878 applications of total 117,654 submissions were rejected."We found out that 12,000 of the 14,000 applications filed from Nandigram-I block were bogus. In Egra II, only 52 of 6,874 submissions were found to be genuine," PTI quoted him as saying.Cyclone Yaas struck Bengal and its neighbouring state Odisha in May and left with massive destruction in the coastal regions.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while rolling out the relief programme in May, had asked those affected by the cyclone to personally apply in writing and not in bulk as she sought to avoid any controversy after the relief distribution at the time of cyclone Amphan.Learning from the past mistakes, the state government thoroughly cross-checked the applications this time, unlike after cyclone Amphan when relief was distributed by treating all the applications as authentic."This time, the administration verified every claim before giving its approval," the officer said, reported PTI. He added that the genuine claimants have started receiving compensation from July 1.The chief minister had earlier claimed that the state incurred a total loss of over ₹20,000 crore due to the natural disaster.The government notified that someone whose agricultural land suffered damaged due to the cyclone would get between ₹1,000 and ₹25,000 and any farmer cultivating betel leaf and a person who lost his cattle will be able to draw a compensation of ₹5,000 and ₹30,000 respectively.Further, ₹5,000 compensation was notified by the state government for partially damaged mudhouses and ₹20,000 for the fully damaged ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/50-applications-for-cyclone-yaas-relief-in-bengal-binned-as-bogus-report-101625399792692.html
04-07-2021||Dehradun||Week after Jammu attack, drones banned in Srinagar||Jammu and Kashmir administration has banned possession and use of drones in the summer capital Srinagar, officials said. The move comes around a week after two blasts, believed to be drone strikes, rocked an Indian Air Force (IAF) station in winter capital Jammu.Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Mohammad Aijaz on Saturday imposed restrictions on the sale, possession, storage, use and transportation of drones and similar unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the district.Aijaz, in an order under section 144 of the criminal penal code, said that the decentralized airspace access has to be regulated in view of the “recent episodes of misuse of drones posing threat to security infrastructure as reported by the media and other reliable sources”.“With a view to secure aerial space near vital installations and highly populated areas, it is imperative to discontinue the use of drones in all social and cultural gatherings to eliminate any risk of injury to life and damage to property,” he said.Drones are being increasingly used in aerial photo and videography by filmmakers, tourism stakeholders, professional landscape photographers and photojournalists. Of late, security forces say that drones are being used by militants from across the line of control to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money into Jammu and Kashmir.On June 27, for the first time, drones were apparently used to target a building of the IAF in Jammu by improvised explosive devices. Two blasts that had taken place within minutes of each other damaged a building and injured two personnel at the technical airport in Jammu in the early hours of June 27.Since then, security forces have reported many sightings of drones in the region.“Keeping in view the security situation apart from concerns of breach of privacy, nuisance and trespass, it is extremely dangerous to let unmanned aerial vehicles wander around in skies within the territorial jurisdiction of district Srinagar,” the Srinagar DC’s order said.Srinagar is home to a number of strategic places and buildings, including Srinagar International Airport whose airstrip is under the control of the IAF, and cantonment area with headquarters of Army’s Chinar Corps besides a number of security installations.Before the ban in Srinagar, district administration Rajouri also imposed a ban on storage, sale, possession, use and transport of any drone or small flying objects on June 30.Those possessing drone cameras or UAVs in Srinagar have been asked to ground the devices in their respective local police stations under proper receipt.“The government departments using drones for mapping, surveys and surveillance in the agricultural, environmental conservation and disaster mitigation sector shall inform the local police station before undertaking any such activity in public interest,” the order said.Drones are governed by aircraft act 1934 and civil aviation rules 2021 already restrict flying the UAVs in prohibited areas like within a distance of 3 kilometres from the perimeter of any civil, private, defence airports, military installations and facilities and state secretariat complex. The prohibition also implies within 2 kilometres from the perimeter of any strategic or vital installation besides around national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/week-after-jammu-attack-drones-banned-in-srinagar-101625399523899.html

04-07-2021||Dehradun||Many veteran BJP leaders upset over being side-lined for Uttarakhand CM post||With the elevation of two-time party MLA Pushkar Singh Dhami to CM designate, BJP had hoped to end the political crisis in Uttarakhand on Saturday. However, it didn’t seem to be the case as hours before his swearing-in on Sunday evening, reports of many party senior leaders expressing their displeasure over the move started making rounds in the city, HT has learnt. Among those who were reportedly not happy with the party leadership’s decision of choosing Dhami as the new CM were state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj and state forest and environment minister Harak Singh Rawat.Both had reached the residence of state higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat in Dehradun along with another senior party leader and minister in ex-CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s cabinet, Bishan Singh Chufal. Among the four mentioned leaders, Dhan Singh and Maharaj were among the frontrunners for the CM post.A party MLA privy to the development, on condition of anonymity, said, “The upset leaders had reached Dhan Singh’s residence on Sunday noon. Among them, Harak Singh and Maharaj who are both senior leaders in the party after defecting from Congress, were the most upset.”“Dhan Singh and Chufal were, however, pacifying them that they should put their part before the state leadership instead of being upset. Later, Dhan Singh and Chufal reached the residence of party state president Madan Kaushik where a high-level meeting was being held in presence of party-state in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam, party state general secretaries Ajay Kumar and Kuldeep Kumar to decide on how to pacify the upset leaders,” said the leader.However, party senior leader Bansidhar Bhagat, who has also been former party state president and parliamentary affairs minister in ex-CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s cabinet, refuted the reports on discontent among party leaders.“All these are rumours. All the leaders are supporting the decision of party leadership as they are the party’s soldiers. Nobody is upset with Dhami being elected to be the next CM. We all are with him to continue the development works and win the next assembly elections to be held in 2022 with a thumping majority like in 2017,” said Bhagat.On the meeting held at party state president Kaushik’s residence, he said, “We are a political party, hence such meetings are nothing unusual. A new development has taken place in the state leadership, hence there are many issues to be discussed on how to take the party forward. The meeting is regarding that only.”Party leader Maharaj too denied reports of him being upset with the leadership change.Speaking to the reporters at his residence in Dehradun, he said, “I am not at all upset and fully support the leadership’s decision. The new CM designate is a young leader and we will fully support him to bring new development to the stage under his leadership.”Opposition Congress and political experts, however, said that the discontent was “bound to come up in BJP after Dhami’s elevation.”Congress state president Pritam Singh, accused the BJP of hurting the public mandate in the 2017 elections. “The public handed it a thumping majority but it had hurt the mandate by working only to bring political instability. After forming the government, they only made tall promises but delivered on none.”“Amid this political instability, they changed two CMs in a matter of four months and appointed a third one who is also not expected to do much for the state considering the small period of tenure before next elections. Now, the factionalism in BJP has also come out in the open which is only rubbing salt on the wounds of the public which gave them the majority in 2017,” said Singh.Political analyst and professor of political science in Garhwal Central University, MM Semwal termed the expression of discontent by senior BJP leaders as inevitable.“The biggest challenge before Dhami would be to work in coordination with the senior leaders of BJP who were overlooked for the CM position,” said Semwal.“By electing Dhami, BJP leadership did a surgical strike on its own senior state leaders which include the likes of Bansidhar Bhagat, Harak Singh Rawat, Satpal Maharaj, Dhan Singh Rawat, Harak Singh Rawat and Yashpal Arya. Dhami would have a tough time working in coordination with them ahead of next year’s assembly elections,” he said.Earlier on Sunday, Dhami met ex-CMs Tirath Singh Rawat, Trivendra Singh Rawat and Maj Gen BC Khanduri (retd) at their residences in an effort to garner support.Later in the day, amid reports of some leaders being unhappy with his election as the new CM, he also went to meet Satpal Maharaj at his residence which was seen as an attempt to pacify him ahead of his swearing-in on Sunday evening at 5 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/many-veteran-bjp-leaders-upset-over-being-side-lined-for-uttarakhand-cm-post-101625397722235.html
04-07-2021||Bangalore||DK Shivakumar challenges Karnataka govt to vaccinate 80% population in 90 days||Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar challenged the state government to vaccinate the state’s 80% adult population with both doses by the end of September in order to save people from the probable third wave of Covid-19.“Experts are predicting that the third wave may hit us by October but if we fully vaccinate at least 80% of the population by the end of September the third wave may not hit us or its impact will be mild. Hence, I want to ask the Karnataka government if they are up for this challenge?” Shivakumar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Shivakumar pointed out that the Karnataka government has been able to only vaccinate 7% of the eligible population with both doses.Shivakumar asked the government to stop talking about the number of doses and focus on administering both doses. He said that both doses are needed for high protection. He said that there are several studies from different cities which show both doses have saved people. Shivakumar also expressed concern that the third wave may affect children, even though the medical experts have said that there is no evidence to support the argument. He said he will also submit a memorandum to the government in this regard.The Karnataka Congress president said that the government will be held accountable for the third wave if it fails to vaccinate 80% of the adults before the end of September. He also said that the target is not an impossible one. He said that if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) do not ‘obsess’ over doing ‘small scams with private vaccination’ the target can be easily achieved. He also accused the BJP of spreading vaccine hesitancy so that it can avoid questions regarding the lack of vaccines.“We are doing our bit in persuading people to get vaccinated and we will do more. The problem is not one of demand but supply. The central government is also supposed to be providing 75% vaccines free of cost to the state. If BJP leaders don't obsess over doing their own small scams with private vaccination, we can easily achieve it,” Shivakumar said.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/dk-shivakumar-challenges-karnataka-govt-to-vaccinate-80-population-in-90-days-101625396674897.html

04-07-2021||Patna||Bihar Police accuses public prosecutor of suspicious conduct in minor rape case||A senior Bihar police officer has written to the state government seeking a probe into conduct of Gaya’s special public prosecutor for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) who allegedly let off a senior suspended police officer accused of raping a minor Dalit girl twice off the hook during court hearings.Suspended deputy senior superintendent of police (DSP) Kamlakant Prasad, accused of raping a 14-year-old Dalit girl in 2017 at his official quarter in Gaya, was let off twice as the court first didn’t issue an arrest warrant against him and later protected him from coercive action due to the public prosecutor’s alleged failure to state relevant facts during argument, CID (weaker section) additional director general (ADG) Anil Kishore Yadav claimed in a letter written to the additional chief secretary of home department Chaitanya Prasad on June 28.An FIR was lodged against Prasad with Women’s police station in Gaya on the direction of Bihar’s Crime Investigation Bureau (CID) on May 27 this year after the accused officer’s wife approached the state police chief disclosing her husband’s alleged involvement in the four year old rape incident, the letter said.ADG Yadav said, on June 14, he asked Patna and Gaya senior superintendent of police (SSPs) to arrest the DSP. However, he could not be arrested as he was then posted as an officer on special duty in the Central Selection Board of Constables. He was finally suspended on June 15 due to the allegations in the rape case, the letter said.Yadav alleged that following the suspension, the investigation officer (IO) of the case sought an arrest warrant against the accused DSP on June 16, which was turned down by the special court (in-charge) of additional district judge Neeraj Kumar, as the special public prosecutor Syed Qaiser Sharfuddin didn’t appear before the court to support the investigation officer.Later on, June 21, the court ordered that no coercive action should be taken against the accused police officer while hearing his anticipatory bail petition. The ADG wrote that this time, the special PP didn’t tell the court that the victim was a Dalit as atrocities on scheduled castes mandate stringent action under the law. Yadav also wrote that the special PP also didn’t mention that in support of the allegations in the FIR, the rape survivor and her brother had already recorded their statements under Section 164 of the CrPC, which is considered a strong piece of evidence in a court of law and could have impacted the court’s decision in the matter.ADG Yadav said he suspected a conspiracy behind the “unsupportive attitude” of the special PP which he alleged to have resulted in failure to obtain even an arrest warrant against the accused DSP. The ADG urged for deputation of a dedicated additional advocate general to argue the prosecution’s case against the bail application of the accused, to be heard in the special Pocso court on July 5.The letter also sought security for accused officer’s wife Anand Tanuja, who filed the rape complaint against her husband and is said to be a key witness in the case. The ADG said Tanuja had sought protection for herself and her children from a senior retired IPS officer, who she said, had sheltered her husband while he was posted as an OSD in Central Selection Board Of Constables.A former member of national SC/ST commission Yogendra Paswan said that this was the first time that a police officer had raised the issues of alleged unprofessional conduct against a public prosecutor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-police-accuses-public-prosecutor-of-pocso-court-in-gaya-of-suspicious-conduct-101625392382919.html

The pollution control body has also been asked to cancel the Extended Producer's Responsibility (EPR) authorisation granted to the producers attached with these violating centres.Also read: Stadiums and sports complexes to reopen without spectators in Delhi from MondayEPR authorisation is one of the primary features of E-waste management rules under which the brand owners and importers are required to receiver the material placed in the market for safe disposal at their cost.

04-07-2021||Lucknow||Congress can fight UP polls without alliance with SP or BSP: Ajay Kumar Lallu||Days after the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party ruled out forging any major alliances for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, Congress' state unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu on Sunday expressed confidence that his party has the capacity to fight the elections without aligning with either of them and form the next government on its own.He also said the Congress would fight the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh next year under Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's "dekh-rekh (supervision)", and that under her leadership, the party would make a comeback in the state after over three decades.In an interview with PTI, Lallu said the Congress has emerged as the main challenger to the "oppressive" UP government and claimed that his party with just five legislators has proven to be a more effective opposition than the Samajwadi Party (SP) which has 49 MLAs in the 403-member assembly.He said "winds of change" were blowing in the state and added, "Badlav ki aandhi hai, jiska naam Priyanka Gandhi hai (There is a storm of change and its name is Priyanka Gandhi)."The UP Congress chief asserted that the Congress organisation has been strengthened at various levels in the state under Priyanka Gandhi's leadership.Asked if Priyanka Gandhi should be made the chief ministerial face by the party for the UP polls, Lallu said it is the party's national leadership that would decide on who should be the chief ministerial face.Pressed on whether Priyanka Gandhi would be the party's face in the run up to the polls, Lallu said she is the state's in-charge and the elections will be fought under her supervision."The people of Uttar Pradesh are looking at the Congress with hope. There is a lot of enthusiasm among the workers and under her (Priyanka Gandhi) leadership, the Congress government will be formed in UP," he said.His remarks come at a time when the party has shifted gears for the assembly elections with the state unit organising zone-wise training camps of block presidents, district presidents and other office bearers to prepare workers for the polls.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi is likely to visit several districts this month with an aim to enthuse the cadre and prepare the party for a pitched electoral battle with the ruling BJP.Whether the party would fight the polls on its own or in alliance with the SP or the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Lallu said the Congress will forge an alliance with issues of the people, farmers, poor, women and the oppressed.The Congress will go to the people with this alliance and is confident they will bless it, he added.Asked if the Congress has the capacity to fight the polls on its own, Lallu said, "Yes, definitely it has the capacity to fight."His remarks assume significance as they come days after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said his party will not enter into any alliance with big parties, while BSP supremo Mayawati later asserted that her outfit will not enter into any alliance for the UP polls.On whether votes could get divided if the SP, the BSP and the Congress contest separately, Lallu said the people had given opportunity to all the other political players in the state but they were not able to stay true to the faith shown by the people and now it was the Congress' turn.About SP and BSP leaders' statements on the polls, he said it reflected frustration and disappointment as people have rejected them and are standing with the Congress.On many political pundits not considering the Congress the main challenger to the BJP in UP and the party's poor showing in the panchayat polls, he alleged that an "oppressive" BJP government is in power and said if any party is raising its voice against the Yogi Adityanath dispensation on the streets, it is the Congress which has emerged as a "strong opposition"."Be it for farmers, youth or poor in rural areas, Congress has raised its voice on issues such as unemployment, law and order situation, saving lives during the Covid pandemic, on deaths due to spurious liquor, jungle raj and other problems," he said."When tribals were killed in Sonbhadra, when injustice was done to Hathras' daughter, when injustice was done to daughters of Unnao and Shahjahanpur, Priyanka Gandhi raised her voice and fought against injustice. When it came to hitting the streets to oppose the farm laws, it was Priyanka Gandhi who did it," Lallu said.Asserting that Congress workers had taken the fight against the state government to the streets, he claimed that over 1 lakh party workers were have been and cases filed against thousands of them at different points in time."I myself have been detained more than 80 times in a year, over 40-50 cases were filed and I went to jail four times," Lallu said.Talking about the Congress' performance in the panchayat elections, Lallu said 271 of the party-backed candidates were elected, 571 came second while 711 were third.The Congress got 50 lakh votes in Lok Sabha polls and in the assembly elections, it got 51 lakh votes, but in zila panchayat polls, it got 1,52,00,000 votes, he said, alleging that the SP only "grabbed headlines" by putting their name on winning candidates despite losing out."There is frustration and disappointment in BJP and SP, the Congress with its determination is going to make a comeback in UP under Priyanka Gandhi's leadership. We have full faith in the people," he said, stressing that Congress was the BJP's main challenger in the polls.Pointing out that the party has been strengthened at various levels under Priyanka Gandhi, Lallu said a capable organisation was in place with the appointment of zila committees, block presidents, and setting up of nyaya panchayats and gram sabha units."We have 840 block presidents, 8,145 nyay panchayat presidents and in 59,000 villages, we have gram sabha units.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party won 67 of the 75 seats in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls on Saturday, after losing the zila panchayat ward members’ poll in April to the Samajwadi Party (SP). The BJP won 21 of these seats unopposed after many of the opposition candidates joined the ruling party and withdrew from the contest.Only the SP and ally RLD could show some resistance. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) boycotted the elections, citing misuse of official machinery while the Congress lost the only seat it contested in the Lok Sabha bastion of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli."Hearty congratulations for thumping victory in Zila Panchayat Chairperson election in UP @myogiadityanath sir," Sania Nehwal tweeted on Saturday.Also read | 'Credit to Yogiji': Modi's praise for CM after local polls amid 'power struggle'Chaudhary tweeted over an hour later with a sharp comment.

The site, 12 kilometres from Madurai, is in Sivaganga district.The discovery of skeletons was reported by Tamil daily Dina Thanthi on Sunday.The excavation work was stalled due to Covid-19-induced lockdown in the state. As the state government relaxed the lockdown in a phased manner, the work resumed at Keezhadi and its surrounding areas like Konthagai, Agaram, and Manalur.More than 10 burial urns were excavated in Konthagai recently in which human skeletal parts were found.Archeologists unearthed a complete human skeleton on Friday. The excavation works continued on the same spot on Saturday as well when five more skeletons were excavated. The archeologists at the site said that the skeletons will be studied further to ascertain their age and gender.The sleepy village of Keezhadi and its surrounding areas in Sivaganga district came to limelight after the ASI began its excavation work in the year 2015. After three phases, the state archeological department took over the next phases in 2017. The seventh phase of excavation, which commenced in February 2017, is in progress at present. Thousands of artifacts, dating back to 580 BCE and some of them with graffiti similar to those of Indus Valley script, were found in these phases of excavation.The findings of the excavation from Keezhadi and surrounding areas are significant since they provide proof of the Sangam period of Tamil literature which is considered the golden era of Tamil civilization. The material evidence found also pushes the age of the Sangam period back to around 600 BCE since the previous estimation was marked between 200 and 400 BCE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-more-human-skeletons-found-at-the-archaeological-site-near-madurai-101625386283109.html

04-07-2021||Delhi||Stadiums, sports complexes to reopen in Delhi from Monday without spectators||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday further scaled down restrictions, imposed since April due to an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, by allowing stadiums and sports complexes in the city to open from Monday morning for general public’s use but without the presence of spectators.“Stadia/sports complexes will be permitted to open without spectators subject to strict compliance [of] SOP... as well as strict adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour (viz. wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, regular hand washing, use of sanitiser etc,.) to contain the spread of Covid-19 virus (disease),” said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.Last month, the DDMA allowed state-level and national level athletes to access stadiums and sports complexes for their training. But, beyond that, they were closed to the general public.While the DDMA also allowed gyms, fitness centres and yoga centres to operate from last week, all swimming pools in the city still remain out of bounds for general people.This week’s order essentially brings no other change. Public transport in the form of buses and metro will continue to operate at 50% passenger capacity; weekly markets are allowed to operate on one market on one day, per municipal zone; restaurants to function with 50% dine-in capacity and banquet halls can organise marriages with maximum 50 guests.Schools, colleges, educational institutes, coaching centres, cinema halls, theatres, multiplexes, spas, amusement parks, entertainment parks, water parks and business-to-business exhibition arenas remain closed. Any kind of gathering and congregation -- which could be religious, cultural, political, social, academic or related to sports -- is prohibited, and auditoriums and assembly halls cannot open.A full lockdown was implemented in Delhi on April 19 in the light of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases which left the city’s health infrastructure overwhelmed. The government eventually started implementing relaxations in a phased manner starting May 31 after the number of infections came down substantially.Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Vellore, said: “The government should be very meticulous about the phased relaxations. Hundred percent mask compliance should be mandatory not just on paper but [should be] enforced efficiently as more public spaces open up. The government should keep a close watch on Covid-19 trends and large gatherings of any kind should not be allowed at this stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stadiums-and-sports-complexes-to-reopen-in-delhi-from-monday-101625385481570.html
04-07-2021||Bangalore||Education in mother tongue: West Bengal on top, Karnataka leads southern states||Karnataka has topped the list of states where students are being given education in their mother tongue in South India, according to the latest survey report by United District Information System For Education (UDISE). West Bengal leads in the country with 89.9% enrolment in Bengali medium, where only 5.3% opted for English medium, Udayavani reported citing the UDISE report.Odisha, which has just 1.20% Bengali speaking population, also has 80% students studying in Bengali medium. The report of UDISE has been submitted to the central government. UDISE is an application created by the education ministry for collecting information from all the recognised and unrecognised schools in the country which are imparting formal education from pre-primary to Class 12.The UDISE report stated that 53.5% of students still prefer Kannada as their medium of instruction despite the increase of 20% students in English medium schools in Karnataka. It also said that in comparison to Karnataka, English medium education has been on the rise in other southern states.For instance, in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there are less than 25% students are studying in Telugu medium, while 73.8% of children are learning in English. In Andhra Pradesh, 35% of children study in Telugu medium schools.Tamil Nadu has also seen a decline in the strength of Tamil medium students. In the last five years, the percentage has come down to 42.6% from 57.6% in 2016, according to the survey’s findings. Even Kerala has registered only 35% students studying in Malayalam medium schools.Many Kannada activists organisations have been fighting with the government for increasing Kannada-language schools in the state besides strengthening Kannada learning facilities in the border areas of Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. There is a substantial Kannada speaking population in the border regions like Kasargod (Kerala), Hindupur (Andhra Pradesh) and Krishnagiri (Tamil Nadu). On account of this, the activists have stressed the need to enhance the education medium in Kannada in these places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/education-in-mother-tongue-west-bengal-on-top-karnataka-leads-southern-states-101625384929862.html

04-07-2021||Delhi||Mic drop for LSR student’s efforts to empower the underprivileged||It’s been five years since Delhiite Devanshi Ranjan has been working for the cause of the underprivileged. “I was in school when I first realised the rampant sexism faced by women, especially from the low-income, marginalised communities. Having heard of and spoken to female helpers at home, I resolved to work for their cause, and since then, there was no looking back,” says Ranjan, a final-year student of Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University. Ranjan, 21, recently received the Diana Award — named after the late Diana, Princess of Wales — a prestigious accolade given to youngsters (aged 9 to 25 years) working for social or humanitarian causes. And, the recognition makes her recall the beginning of the lockdown period, last year: “I studied the increase in the number of dropouts in schools, especially of female students, due to household chores and their underprivileged background. I was aware of my privilege as a student, and understood that not many had access to internet connections. I had worked with Ladli Foundation, a non-profit organisation, for four years, and with them, I arranged study material and stationery for students in the city’s rural areas, and taught over 1,000 youngsters in slums of the Capital, during the Covid-19 crisis. We eventually expanded to 50 districts in 10 different states.” Having also worked to foster a safe space for the marginalised, in different capacities, and drawing on her personal experiences, Ranjan launched an advocacy-based and youth-led initiative, Project MicDrop, with her friends, in July last year. “I always wanted to start something of my own, and work passionately on the topics of gender and sexuality. Today, we are a team of 50 members and have over 150 contributors from different walks of life. Project MicDrop aims to provide a safe platform for people to talk about feminism, politics, gender, sex and sexuality, and empower people through art, campaigning and events. Over the past few months, we have conducted workshops and webinars, such as sessions on gender inclusive parenting and women representation in media,” she explains. The young gun has also served as a teacher volunteer at the NGO, Tamana, which helps those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Ranjan feels grateful for the appreciation that has come her way for all her past efforts, and wants to continue working for those in need. “I do feel that I have a responsibility to work for others. I wish to work in the areas of gender equality, mental health and education, because I believe the social sector is my calling,” she concludes.

04-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC ruling on strays’ rights emboldens feeders; RWAs up for the task||Instances of animal lovers being chastised for feeding strays in residential areas have been far too many. Recently, holding the view that ‘animals have a right under law to be treated with compassion, respect and dignity’, the Delhi High Court said that community dogs have to be fed at designated areas, and that care-givers or feeders have the right to feed them. This has come as a relief to the pawsome individuals who have been uptill now holding fort with strong conviction.Delhi-based animal lovers and rescuers feel that this judgement will help them as they go about taking care of strays. “Every positive change towards animal welfare brings me closer to achieving my dream that no community dog sleeps with an empty stomach. Such orders give me hope that there will surely be a day when all the stray animals are treated with respect and would get the love and care that they deserve. Through this ruling , there will be thousands of dogs who would get food as people would now have the courage, strength and power to stand against those who stop them from feeding the strays. This is a huge achievement for all the animal lovers who are out there working hard each and every day,” says Vibha Tomar, a Delhi-based animal rescuer and veterinary student.Advocates for animal welfare also opine that maintaining peace between dog lovers and other members of the community will be possible if each area has designated feeding spots. “Some people have issues with dogs dirtying the locality, which can be corrected easily. But people have complaints that the dogs bark a lot. What else are dogs supposed to do? Moreover, I’ve been abused and my character has been questioned, only because I fight for the rights of the voiceless in my locality,” says Shruti Kapoor, an animal rescuer in Rohini, adding, “We take care of the dogs in our locality at our own expense, and dogs are extremely loving and understanding. The violence inflicted on dog feeders is appalling, and in that light, demarcating designated spots in each locality, keeping in mind the territory of the animal, will go a long way in maintaining peace.” The Delhi HC’s order also puts onus of vaccination and sterilisation on the RWAs and municipal corporation, and many associations say they are up for the challenge. In Vasant Kunj’s C-9 block, the residents and the RWA have formed a dog care group that tends to the needs of the strays. “We’ve 40 stray dogs, and all of them are vaccinated and sterilised. And we’ve been doing this for years now. Infact, for people who say strays are dirty, surely they haven’t seen the chaos pets create; and we are working to implement rules where every resident will have to pick up after their pet. Of course tussles happen, but we all deliberate on it together. The area belongs to the strays as much as it does to us. We welcome the Delhi HC’s decision and believe RWAs must take charge and create an atmosphere of peace for all their members,” says Mausumi Bhattacharjee, general secretary of the RWA. And this ruling has received an applause from the RWAs in NCR as well. Nazim Khan, RWA secretary, Madhuban Apartments in Noida, says, “There are many residents in our locality who love animals and like to feed them, and care for their well-being. Hence, as a responsible association, we have provided for designated spots where food is regularly provided for them. This ensures that animals don’t turn violent, out of hunger. We do have a few complaints of stray dogs biting domestic helps and kids in the locality, but I believe it can all be amicably resolved, largely without any violence.”  Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-ruling-on-strays-rights-emboldens-feeders-rwas-up-for-the-task-101625345882897.html
04-07-2021||Delhi||Plan for e-carts in Chandni Chowk||Sadia AkhtarThe Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) has proposed to run electric vehicles similar to golf carts with a vintage look on the revamped stretch between the Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, which has been made a no-go zone for motorised vehicles, officials privy to the matter said.SRDC is the nodal agency constituted for the redevelopment of the heritage market.According to the minutes of a June 30 meeting — attended by Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain, who is also the chairman of SRDC, corporation officials, and traffic and transport department officials — a concept note has been prepared for running low-speed electric golf carts with a maximum speed of 25-30 kmph to help the elderly who visit the market. Officials from the transport department are expected to apprise the Delhi high court about the proposal. The cart service will be free.“Commissioner (Transport) suggested that High Court may be apprised about the intent of the government to ply electric golf carts in the restricted area for elders and infirm while simultaneously making detailed deliberations,” according to the minutes, which HT has seen.During the meeting, officials also discussed that for public roads which have been made pedestrian exclusive zones, running non-motorised vehicles can be considered on lines of the restricted zone around Taj Mahal in Agra.Jain suggested that the agency could explore possible tie-ups with various traders’ associations of the market for operating electric vehicles.Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the idea is promising. “We will approach private players for CSR activities who can present innovative designs,” said Bhargava.In addition to initiatives aimed at boosting pedestrianisation, consultations with private hotel chains are underway for plantation drives in the area this month. Jain approved the horticulture initiatives and directed that they be finished by July 25.It was also decided that PWD officials will review arterial roads such as Church Mission Road and Esplanade Road for maintenance and improvement by mid-July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plan-for-e-carts-in-chandni-chowk-101625345317876.html
04-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi gets a break from heat||After four consecutive heatwave days, rain showers that started on Friday evening and continued on Saturday gave residents some respite from the sweltering heat.The national capital witnessed a wet Saturday afternoon as rain, accompanied by strong winds, lashed several parts of the city for the second consecutive day, bringing down the temperature by several degrees on Saturday.The maximum temperature on Saturday was recorded at 38.6°C, nearly three degrees below the previous day’s maximum temperature of 41. 3°C at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the Capital.“Light rain and thunderstorms are likely to continue in some parts of Delhi and NCR on Sunday as well, because of moisture carrying southwest winds. This will keep the temperatures on similar lines as Saturday. But from Monday, temperatures in Delhi will start rising again,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet weather services.He further added that there won’t be any heatwaves “for another 24-48 hours”. “Thereafter, around July 6, the heatwave might return. By July 8-9, the monsoon may start progressing over the remaining parts of northwest India,” said Palawat.An IMD bulletin said “no heat wave conditions are likely over the region during the next five days”. “Maximum temperatures over the plains of northwest India are likely to fall by 3-4 degrees Celsius today (Saturday), and no significant change is likely thereafter,” it said.For four days, the temperature had remained above 40°C, with the IMD classifying them as heatwave days.IMD declares a heatwave in the plains when the maximum temperature crosses 40°C, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5°C. From Tuesday till Friday, the city saw scorching hot days until rain showers brought some relief on Friday evening.Experts, however, warned that this relief was short-lived and temperatures are likely to rise again in the Capital next week, till the monsoon arrives. IMD on Thursday said the monsoon is unlikely to advance in the remaining parts of north-west India, including Delhi, till at least July 7.As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature is expected to hover around 39°C while the minimum will touch 24°C on Sunday. As per the weekly forecast, a thunderstorm with rain is expected in the next few days.Meanwhile, the air quality in the city improved from ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category following rain over Friday and Saturday. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 139 (moderate) on Saturday, an improvement from the AQI of 245 (poor) on Friday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin. Experts attributed the improvement to high-speed winds and rain.On Saturday, Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “Rainfall observed at a few places over Delhi has led to the improvement in air quality through the aerosol wash out process. Surface winds are moderate and southwesterly. Long-range transport of dust from arid western regions and local emissions are expected to continue in the coming days. Moderate to poor AQI is forecast for next the three days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gets-a-break-from-heat-101625344030937.html

04-07-2021||Lucknow||District panchayat chief polls in UP reveal interesting alliances, tactical moves||The zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections in Uttar Pradesh revealed interesting alliances and tactical moves. The results were declared on Saturday, the same day on which the elections were held. These polls were held about eight months before the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections that are due early next year.In Jaunpur, BJP’s ally Apna Dal withdrew from the race in support of independent candidate Srikala Reddy, wife of former MP Dhananjay Singh, and she won the election. In Ghazipur, at one stage, it was reported that two members who had won on the backing of Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), tactically supported the BJP.“AIMIM’s nexus with BJP now lies exposed,” said Congress’s Surendra Rajput. However, AIMIM state chief Shaukat Ali denied such reports. “This is completely untrue,” Ali said. Owaisi’s party is planning to contest 100 seats in 2022 UP assembly polls. In Amethi, the BJP won against the SP even as the Congress failed to even put up a candidate here. In Pratapgarh, former minister and local heavyweight Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya’s candidate Madhuri Patel won as a nominee of the Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik). After the win, Singh said, “Ruling party candidates usually want good law and order. But, today their workers created ruckus.” He thanked Congress veteran Pramod Tiwari and his daughter Aradhana Misra ‘Mona’, a Congress MLA, for the win.Asked if his Jansatta Dal would ally with Congress in 2022, he said in Pratapgarh, “After a long time, our relations have improved and they would stay that way. But that’s on a personal level. As for a formal alliance, wait and watch.” UP minister Rajendra Pratap Singh reportedly had a heated exchange of words with Pappan Singh, husband of BJP candidate Shama Singh, who alleged lack of party support in Pratapgarh.Meanwhile, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, ministers and lawmakers hailed the win. “Say it with heart, BJP once again in 2022,” Maurya said. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh also credited the win to the policies of the Modi government at the Centre and the Yogi government in the state.“I must also congratulate party cadre who worked very hard,” he added. BJP general secretary JPS Rathore was the coordinator for these polls. How BJP fared in each region For organisational purposes, the BJP demarcated the state into six regions. In the paschim or west region with 14 districts, BJP won 13 seats and RLD one. In the Braj region with 12 districts, BJP won 11 seats and the SP bagged Etah. In the Kanpur region with 14 districts, including several SP bastions, the BJP won 12, besides the victory of a BJP-supported candidate while the SP won Etawah. In the Awadh region with 13 districts, the BJP had a clean sweep. In the Kashi region with 12 districts, the BJP won nine along with a party supported candidate. An independent bagged Jaunpur, which BJP and its ally Apna Dal didn’t contest. Former minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya’s Jansatta Dal opened its account in Pratapgarh. In Gorakhpur region with 10 districts, BJP won seven seats while the SP bagged Sant Kabir Nagar, Azamgarh and Ballia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/zila-panchayat-chief-polls-in-up-reveal-interesting-alliances-tactical-moves-101625342759011.html

04-07-2021||Lucknow||SP alleges lathi-charge on party workers during district panchayat chief elections in Uttar Pradesh||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Saturday alleged that its party workers were lathi-charged in most districts of the state while the zila (district) panchayat chairpersons’ polls were in progress. For his part, chief Akhilesh Yadav accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of engaging in malpractices and rigging to win the elections. Party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary claimed that the workers were lathi-charged in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi and several other districts when they were protesting against the favours that the administration had allegedly extended to the ruling party candidates.In a statement, the SP chief said: “By throwing all democratic ethics and norms to the wind and turning the elections into a joke, the BJP converted its defeat in the panchayat elections into the victory in zila panchayat chiefs’ elections. The BJP held the voters (zila panchayat members) hostage, lured and intimidated them. And when SP leaders protested against the malpractices, the administration misbehaved with them.” In Lucknow, the police were seen forcibly removing the SP workers from the collectorate gate while they were protecting the “going on inside in the favour of BJP”, the party alleged. Democracy would be restored once the SP came back to power, Akhilesh Yadav said.He also said that the SP had petitioned the state election commissioner (SEC) several times, but no action was taken by SEC. These elections had exposed the autocratic face of the ruling dispensation, he alleged. It was alleged that in many places across the state, the administration provided “BJP helpers” to zila panchayat members. He said in Aligarh, despite the protest by SP, nine members were provided with helpers and in Shamli eight helpers were deployed to help the voting members. Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said: “SP members were forcefully stopped from voting. They were beaten and threatened. There was brazen misuse of government machinery… The DMs were pressuring the zila panchayat members to vote for the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-alleges-lathi-charge-on-party-workers-during-zp-chief-elections-in-uttar-pradesh-101625341739259.html
04-07-2021||Chandigarh||‘Chandigarh is now self-sufficient in handling third wave’||As the city braces for a third Covid wave, Hindustan Times talks to Dr G Dewan, the former director, health and family welfare, Chandigarh, who was at the forefront in fighting the first wave and helped administration during the second. Having spent 35 years in UT’s health department before his retirement in October 2020, Dr Dewan talks about his experience and challenges that lie ahead for the city’s health infrastructure.Covid testing has always remained a concern. What should be done to increase testing before the third wave hits the city?Testing of super-spreaders and asymptomatic people still remains a challenge, especially when new variants are spreading. The grassroots level health staff should reach every home in UT to test people.What are the lessons for UT administration from first and second wave management?Earlier, we were short on beds and ventilators, but Chandigarh is now self-sufficient in handling the third wave. However, there is always scope for improvement in any system. Efforts should be made to spread awareness among children about containing the spread.How tiring Covid-19 has been for doctors? What should be done to boost their morale?Not only the doctors, but the paramedics are also Covid warriors. Even though fresh manpower was added in hospitals, healthcare workers are now getting tired and fatigued. The staff should work in batches so that they have ample time to replenish their energy before getting into the third wave. This will avoid over-utilisation of manpower and they should also be given short rest to boost their energy levels.What are the challenges before frontline workers, especially doctors, as we gear up for the third wave?We have to be over-alert now in view of the mutation of the virus. The quality and availability of protective tools should be assured by the institutes and be readily available in the market. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms should be sent to mini Covid-care centres so that beds are available for severe patients. Doctors and staff should be trained to use ventilators. Gaps need to be bridged proactively, which have been observed in the past.Chandigarh recorded shortage of medical oxygen, ventilators and crucial drugs during the second wave. What steps need to be taken before the third wave strikes?Chandigarh is well-equipped with oxygen, which is available through multiple modes. It is time to strengthen manpower. The city can be divided into zones where state-of-the-art 24x7 vaccination centres can be set up. Mobile vans can be sent to urban slums and colonies in the evenings and nights to cater to the daily wagers who are not available in day-time. Special education should be imparted to beggars and rag-pickers as they may be asymptotic super-spreaders. People should also cooperate with the administration and follow every guideline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-is-now-self-sufficient-in-handling-third-wave-101625341679015.html

While the land belongs to the Chandigarh administration, its maintenance is the responsibility of the municipal corporation (MC), according to officials.Jaswant Singh, a resident, said, “We have been living here for the past 30 years and this patch of land has never been this dirty. This started around the start of the Covid pandemic and now the whole area stinks due to the garbage being dumped and burnt here.”Another resident, JL Sethi, added, “Many garbage collectors frequently burn the garbage at the plot. It leads to a lot of smoke and foul smell in the area.”Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri, who also lives in Sector 43, confirmed said residents have only recently started complaining about the dumping of garbage here. “Debris and garbage are being increasingly disposed of here. The authorities must act swiftly and take action against anyone found dumping waste here.”Social activist LR Budaniya has also submitted a complaint regarding this to the MC commissioner with over a 100 signatures and contact details of residents facing problems due to the activity. “Since the land belongs to the administration there is some confusion over who will clean it. A similar situation is seen on the cycle tracks of the city with the MC and administration passing the buck on their maintenance,” he said.Residents allege open defecation by nearby villagersBudaniya alleged that the land was being used by some residents of the nearby Attawa village in Sector 42 for open defecation. Notably, Chandigarh has been declared open defecation free plus plus (ODF++) by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs under the Swachh Bharat mission.However, local area councillor Chanderwati Shukla said, “We are unaware about any garbage dumping going at the vacant plot, but we will get it checked and cleared. Recently, residents approached us about weeds growing tall here, and we got them removed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dumpyard-on-empty-plot-raises-a-stink-in-chandigarh-s-sector-43-101625341619363.html

In the last 15 days, however, UT recorded 276 cases and 4 deaths.From June 21, PGIMER had started providing physical consultations at its OPDs, but the facility was made available for only severely-ill patients with prior appointment booked through the hospital’s tele-consultation portal.On an average, only 1,200 to 1,500 patients are being called for physical consultations by the doctors, per day but the hospital holds the capacity to physically examine at least 10,000 patients daily, like in pre-Covid times. Many patients are complaining that despite requests, the doctors at tele-consultations are not booking their appointments for physical examination. Director of PGIMER Dr Jagat Ram said, “On an average, 4,000 people are consulting at PGIMER’s OPD daily and of them, 1200-1500 are being physically examined while the rest are being given consultation through telephones. We are waiting for Covid-19 cases to drop further and then we will gradually increase the per day physical consultation capacity. We cannot open a walk-in OPD at present as the crowd could lead to spreading of infection.”Dr Ram added that he has asked hospital authorities to provide treatment to emergency patients, even if they are visiting the OPD without any prior appointment. “Some patients, especially from poor classes, do not know how to book an appointment and visit the hospital directly. We take appropriate Covid measures but are providing them the treatment.”Meanwhile in GMCH-32, patients are still awaiting physical consultations.Director-principal of GMCH-32 Dr Jasbinder Kaur said, “From July 5, we will start calling patients for physical consultation but only after they book appointments through tele-medicine. We have decided to conduct Covid-19 tests for patients arriving at OPDs, but there are no plans yet to start walk-in OPDs.”On the other hand, walk-in OPD has already started at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16, and over 1,000 patients are visiting the hospital daily.‘PGIMER should vaccinate people arriving at OPDs’Former PGIMER director Dr KK Talwar, who is heading Punjab government’s expert group on Covid, said that PGIMER should now start physical consultation in OPDs in a phased manner. “Even if Covid patients are being treated at the hospital, PGIMER can call more than 1,500 patients daily for physical consultation. The hospital should open OPDs till late evening so that crowd management can be done and social distancing can be implemented. The number of physical consultations will double if timings are increased,” said Dr Talwar.He added, “Also, PGI can vaccinate people coming to the OPDs who have not taken the jabs so far. This will help avert the third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-cases-dip-but-govt-hospitals-in-chandigarh-yet-to-start-walk-in-opds-101625341559205.html

This was underscored by the rescue of a timid little bird running around in a Jalandhar garage. It turned out that the rescued bird, the yellow-legged buttonquail, was a historical rarity for Punjab. It had not been spotted in the region for over a century.None of us would have been the wiser of this bird’s contemporary presence in Punjab had the buttonquail not got herself into an awkward spot, of all the myriad places in sprawling Jalandhar, in a house whose neighbour, Sanjiv Khanna, happens to be not only a seasoned birder but also one proficient in the rescue of distressed birds.The buttonquail’s secretive voyages to Punjab around the monsoons for breeding in fresh grasslands have been noted by 19th century British ornithologists but records have been rather sparse over the centuries. This is partly because this diminutive bird, which is the size of a house sparrow, blends amazingly into scrubland or grass and prefers to migrate at night.In other words, a proverbial undercover agent having mastered the art of hiding in plain sight! Neither is this bird much sought after or tracked down by the roving lenses of the ever-increasing tribe of Punjab bird photographers, otherwise its presence would have been recorded more frequently. Glaring city lights tend to disorient its nocturnal navigation and some befuddled buttonquails end up as fugitives in houses across India leading to astonishment (like a paratrooper landing in the proverbial lap of the householder sipping his morning tea!) and feverish updates to the buttonquail’s distribution maps.“Some modern field guides on the sub-continent’s birds had all but written off the buttonquail’s presence in Punjab as no sighting had been reported for around a century. Before Khanna’s rescue, the last authentic record (with reference to the area encompassed by present-day Punjab) had come from Hugh Whistler, the policeman-ornithologist, who shot a male buttonquail near Ludhiana way back on July 11, 1917! Whistler had noted that the buttonquail shot by him was the only record from Punjab till then! All said and done, the chance rescue from Jalandhar proves that British ornithologists rightly included Punjab in the summer distribution range of this buttonquail,” said Mohali-based professor Gurpartap Singh, a birder, who has a hawk’s eye for avian identification and backs it with a zealous devotion to historical detail and tireless thumbing of ornithological literature.Enjoying a quaint zoological nomenclature, Turnix tanki tanki, the buttonquail is not an endangered species. As Khanna’s discovery indicates, it may not be so rare in terms of numbers. But it has certainly been very smart in eluding the Punjabi eye for over 100 years! Let me get Khanna to narrate the delightful tale of his discovery.“I received an early morning call on June 23 from Satwinder Multani, who lives next door. She called to say that the common myna chick, which she had asked me to replace in its nest two days ago, had fallen again and had taken refuge inside her car garage. She wanted me to restore the chick to its nest again. For all her noble intentions, the pugnacious mama and papa mynas had in the first instance relentlessly pecked at the good Satwinder’s head! I rushed to the spot with the objective to again reinstate the chick in its nest. However, I found that the so-called myna chick was actually a very small bird running in the garage and trying to hide. My birder’s eye seized upon it as a quail-like bird. Its small size had probably led Satwinder to mistake it as the same myna chick, which we had restored to the nest two days back. It was hard to catch the quail and she had a small injury on her head. I brought the bird to my rescue shelter, Aashray. After applying medicine to the injury, I fed her grains and water. After taking feed, the bird was eager for freedom. I released the bird and much to my surprise it took a high flight and disappeared. As a rescuer of an estimated 1,300 birds since 1994, I was very happy to have saved and recorded a very rarely seen species of the Punjab,” Khanna, an engineer by profession, told this writer.The rescued buttonquail was a female, distinguished by a gorgeous orange-rufous buff collar. The female is the prettier in this species, reversing the differences of plumage in birds where males tend to be the preening queens and more justified in seeking self-gratification from the proverbial mirror on the wall. There is a very good reason for this reversal of beauty as it is the female buttonquail who philanders and wows suitors with her dazzling orange, rust and rufous colours so that she can “sow her wild oats” in a string of seduced males. This inverse version of the Don Juan legend is also slightly larger than the male. The female’s advertising call includes a series of low-pitched hoots, gradually increasing in volume and sounding in the end notes virtually like human moans.“The female is polyandrous, evidently not promiscuous but practising successive polyandry. She battles with rival hens for the possession of a cock and does the courting. After the eggs are laid, she loses interest and goes in search of a new mate. The cock settles down to incubate them (12-16 days) and later rears the chicks all by himself,” is how legendary birdman, Salim Ali, described the buttonquail’s breeding practises.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-chance-of-the-century-101625341498918.html

It was also revealed that an SLR rifle recovered from their possession, along with other weapons, had been snatched from the police in 2016. The gunfight had broken out after a team of the police, 44 Rashtriya Rifles and the CRPF launched a joint cordon-and-search operation in Pulwama’s Rajpora area on Thursday night, following a tip-off. The operation soon turned into an encounter when the militants opened fire on the security personnel, killing one soldier and injuring another, an official had revealed. The militants neutralised in the operation have been identified as Nishaz Hussain Lone alias Khitab, the district commander of LeT, Danish Manzoor Shiekh of Sathergund Kakapora, Amir Wagay of Hanjan Payeen, Mehran Manzoor of Jamalatoo, Srinagar, and Abu Rehan alias Tawheed of Pakistan. Lone is believed to have been active since 2018. “All five killed in Friday’s encounter were linked with the proscribed terror outfit LeT. As per police records, they were part of the groups involved in many terror crime cases and civilian atrocities,” a J&K police spokesperson said. He said arms, ammunition and other incriminating materials were recovered from the site of the encounter, including an SLR rifle belonging to Jammu and Kashmir Police that was snatched by militants in 2016 from a guard. “All recovered materials have been taken into case records for further investigation and to probe their complicity in other terror crimes.” Army pays tribute to slain soldier The Army on Saturday paid tributes to Havildar Kashiray Bammanalli, who was killed in the operation. In a ceremony at BB Cantt, Chinar Corps Commander Lieutenant General DP Pandey paid homage to the gallant soldier. “At around 00:25 am, during search and cordon operation in the village, the militants fired indiscriminately on the search party. Late Havildar Kashiray Bammanalli showed highest level of courage and valour by returning effective fire, in which he sustained a gunshot wound in the chest and was grievously injured. His bleeding was controlled with combat first aid, and he was immediately evacuated to 92 Base Hospital for treatment where he succumbed to his injuries,” an army spokesperson said, adding that the soldier, aged 37, had joined the Army in 2006. “He belonged to Ukkal village of B Bagewadi Tehsil, Vijayapura district in Karnataka, and is survived by his wife, daughter and a son.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pulwama-encounter-police-identify-4-slain-militants-as-locals-fifth-a-pak-national-101625341439374.html
04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: India can learn a lot from the West||In the pre-Covid days, ministers and bureaucrats would go on foreign jaunts for study tours or conferences. However, it seems little has been learnt from these trips as hardly anything has been done to make our system of working more public friendly.The inadequacies of the systems in place in India were recently thrown into sharp relief when we bought a property in a scenic Canadian town, around 300km away from our house in Vancouver. After looking at a few properties that were on sale through a local realtor, we shortlisted the most suitable ones. After returning to Vancouver, we made an offer on a property that sat on the foothills of snow-covered mountains, next to a lake. This was done online. Our realtor and lawyer confirmed the title of the property, inspections, last date for closing the deal and tendered the advance deposit through e-mails.Meanwhile, we arranged our mortgage, made the final payment through our lawyer, which included different taxes. On the closing day, the property was transferred in our name electronically in the records of local municipality (City). Once the ownership changed, we contacted the existing tenants, and signed a new tenancy agreement online. It goes without saying that the same transaction would have been extremely cumbersome in India.I noticed a similar efficiency when we bought a car. We selected a car and went to the dealership at an appointed time. An insurance company broker was also present. The payment was made through a bank draft. The insurance company representative entered all the details of the vehicle in his records, which are also made available to government agencies. He insured our vehicle on the spot and issued a new license plate, which we fitted on our car before driving home. The whole process was over in around two hours. No applications had to be filled, nor did we attach notarised copies of our Aadhaar Card, PAN Card or photographs. We only showed our driving licence, which has our address too. We did not have to visit the Regional Licensing Authority office or schedule multiple visits to get the new registration certificate, or for a high-security number plate.When my local driving licence expired, I booked an appointment for renewal. On the given date and time, I visited the licensing office where a friendly employee asked me two questions — “Have you any medical conditions ? Is there any change of address ? ” Then I was told to look into the web camera for the photograph. In no time, I was issued a printout of a temporary driving licence and told that the regular driving licence will be mailed to me within four weeks, but I got it in post within two weeks. Efficiency par excellence!Unfortunately, the same was not seen when I had to renew my passport. I could not plan a trip to India due to Covid restrictions and in the meantime my passport expired. I applied for renewal at the Indian Consulate and their outsourced agency demanded a long list of documents — an online application, a recent photo, notarised copies of my Aadhaar, PAN, Permanent Residency Card and my landing document.The last demand was absurd as the landing document is carried by a new immigrant on his first visit to Canada. On the basis of which, Canadian authorities replace it with a PR Card promptly. I haven’t needed the landing document since 2000, I wonder why the Indian Government was interested in my landing document to renew my Indian Passport, especially when I possess a PR card. After three weeks, I received an email saying that my police inquiry had been forwarded to the police station nearest to my Chandigarh home. It also said that if nothing is heard within a few weeks, I should get in touch with the local police station. Can anyone explain the rationale of this email? There is a lot to emulate from advanced countries, should bureaucrats want to make changes for the better. Meanwhile, the public keeps suffering due to primitive and cumbersome practices forcing them to engage corrupt middlemen.wcdpsbajwa@gmail.com(The writer is a Canada-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-india-can-learn-a-lot-from-the-west-101625341258230.html

04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Wimbledon’s magic continues to thrill||Of all the occasions to look forward to every summer, Wimbledon has pride of place in many a heart. The sheer thrill of a lightning quick serve followed by an adeptly placed volley, the sight of impeccably manicured grass, the resplendent whites and the ‘pucca’ British decorum- all make for a fortnight that becalms the senses and delights the mind.There’s more – the graceful yet boisterous audience, the courtesies and bows before the royal box, the post-match interviews, replete with candour and wittiness, the highs, the lows, the sighs and the blows. The sheer pageantry, fanfare and style of Wimbledon hold us in thrall. The meticulous eye for detail, the clockwork precision and timing — on the court and off it — the ubiquitous strawberries and cream, as well as the smart officials and blazer-clad organisers, all add to the aura, the magic, the splendour of the big W.Yet, and inevitably so, the sheer artistry, skill and stamina of the players, women and men, over the decades, has been the abiding memory of Wimbledon’s stature as the ultimate test of a tennis player’s mastery over his or her art. Legendary figures like Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Pete Sampras, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, often had us gaping and gasping, as we watched their exploits on television. The Centre Court at Wimbledon was their performing arena, the real Mecca of their careers.Roger Federer, who turns forty in August, continues to defy age and injury. At the time of going to press, he is still in the battle, a champion whose dazzling best years are behind him, but who, on grass at least, is still a wizard whose pure class is like a chocolate dessert worth savouring and mooning over, later.Novak Djokovic the defending champion, and Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Andy Murray, all former champions, have turned up to showcase their skills yet again, though with contrasting results. The heartbreak of a champ’s early exit from the Oscar of all tennis tournaments is clearly as much a part of its drama as are success, victory and triumph.And for a world which has been battered and bruised by the maniacal pandemic, the very fact that Wimbledon, the Euro Cup and Test Cricket are being staged before adoring fans, provides a sense of resurgence and rejuvenation like no other. Sports is the panacea for many ills of this world, as has been pointed out by this columnist earlier too. Nations which focus their energies on sports and the arts, in order to raise the levels of consciousness of their citizens, will find harmony and happiness relatively easier to attain, than those which keep squabbling internally. Many a young girl, for instance, can be empowered much more through sport and music than she can through the arduous and exacting route of laboured studies. India’s focus in particular, needs to shift partly towards creating a culture of sports in the society, which western countries have successfully adopted for decades.Thus, when an all-Indian mixed doubles match took place at SW19, London, during this year’s edition, it was a joy to behold. Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna, Ram Ramanathan and Ankita Raina displayed skills, athleticism and finesse on the court, which made one proud to be Indian. Many a young lady can match up to the likes of Mirza and Raina, given the right conditions and encouragement by the establishment, the system and society at large. The masterclass that the likes of Federer, Djokovic and Angelique Kerber are dishing out before our eyes as we reach the midpoint of the Wimbledon fortnight has been matched by amazing spectacles like Richard Gasquet’s astonishing backhand winner in the face of a Federer smash.But even more endearing have been the instances of Federer humbly admitting that his English is not above par, when asked about absence, making the heart grow fonder. And Venus trying to high five her mixed doubles partner, Nick Kyrgios, only to be inadvertently ignored!For millions, the thralldom of Wimbledon’s epic drama endures. There will be champions once more, but humanity at large will have won the real battle.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-wimbledon-s-magic-continues-to-thrill-101625341199600.html

04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Lore of Good Man Di Laaltain, other catchy colloquialisms||Those born in the decade following the end of British colonisation would be familiar with a peculiar phraseology, which was a hybrid of English and Punjabi. We found these sayings quite funny, even though we did not quite know or understand their meaning or intent. I remember a rather vicious rhyme starting with the first three letters of the English alphabet, which my brother and I would rattle out with glee: ‘ABC, kithe gayi si? Headmaster mar gaya/ pittan gayi si!’ (ABC, where did you flee? The headmaster died/ I went to mourn him). After ignoring it a couple of times, our mother scolded us for uttering such impolite verses, which were in utter bad taste. That was the end to our favourite nonsense verse, which mocked at the English alphabet and the educational system that we had inherited from the British masters.But there were other such sayings that were uttered with glee even by our respectable elders who would often say: ‘Natha Singh and Prem Singh one and the same thing.’ It meant that while the names were different yet the two were alike in their way of looking or thinking. This originated perhaps from some Brit officer in reference to the Sikh soldiers in the platoon and went onto become a part of the humour repertoire aimed at the Sikhs. Recently, I came across an interesting variation of this Anglo-desi saying in a piece of short fiction by the master storyteller Gurdev Singh Rupana titled: Nathu Ram and Prem Singh One And The Same Thing.Heart of the matterThe author, who received the national Sahitya Akademi Award this year, subverted the saying to take its context beyond one religion to point out that Hindus and Sikhs nurtured similar religious prejudices. The story made for the most hilarious account of two village elders, who were best friends, being mistakenly taken to heaven by the Yamadoot (messenger of death). When the Yamaraj (God of death) realised that theirs was a case of mistaken identity, they are returned to Earth. On their return, they relate accounts of their journey by night. However, curiously, Nathuram only saw Hindu gods, saints and freedom fighters and Prem Singh only Sikh saints, scholars, warriors and freedom fighters. Thus, making their view of life based on the religion they belonged to. When coaxed by the narrator to tell whether they saw any person of the other faith, both shook their heads in dismissal adding “I never saw them but maybe they were there in some back row!”The mysterious lantern And now to ‘Good Man Di Laaltain’, which has weathered the test of time and remains a popular axiom till date. Some years ago, celebrated lyricist-poet Gulzar, who has a penchant for unusual phrases, including Ibn Batuta bagal mein juta, penned a song on this mysterious lantern for the film ‘Soorma’ featuring Diljit Dosanjh and Taapsee Pannu in the lead, and didn’t they rock! Towards the end of militancy in Punjab, an enterprising theatre artiste mounted a comedy called ‘Good Man Di Laaltain’ and it caught the fancy of the top cop of those times KPS Gill. Thus, the government sponsored the play and it was staged in villages and towns and all over Punjab. Those were times when the state wanted the people to laugh and banish the tears. What could have been better than this magical laughing lantern which we Indians call ‘laaltain’!There are a number of theories on the origin of the saying. Those acquainted with western literature feel that it is based on a fable, in which a blind man would carry a lantern, while traversing hills and forests in the night. This seemed strange because the light could not guide him as he had no sight. When asked about the reason for holding the lantern in his hand as he walked, he replied: “This lantern is for the benefit of others so that they do not get lost!” Thus, it was assumed that he was a good man with a lantern in hand but this is not true of this desi adage. The “Good Man” comes from a company in Scotland called Goodmans, which sold solid quality lanterns that were regularly supplied to the Indian Railways in the days of the Raj. A delightful WhatsApp post is doing the rounds with a delightful picture of what the lanterns looked like.Rhymes and reasonInterestingly, this saying also found its way into the British Indian Army. Lt Gen Vijay Oberoi in a comprehensive article, ‘From Good Man Di Laaltain To Yes Man’ on the rise of sycophancy in the Indian Army and qualifies, “In undivided Punjab, a common phrase, “Good Man the Laaltain” was heard. It was obviously a hybrid phrase like many that Punjabis had formulated! It was a phrase that conveyed one’s appreciation in an informal or friendly way. The phrase was soon picked up by Army officers and often used as a pat on the back for junior officers, while the Hindustani word ‘Shabash’ (good show) was used for junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and jawans”. Come the struggle for independence from the British Raj and the phrase became a cry for freedom: “Good Man Di Laaltain, Bad Man Da Diva, 1 2 3, India is free!”. This was the retort to centuries of oppression: away with your lantern and we will be fine with our earthen lamp and hard-won freedom!nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-lore-of-good-man-di-laaltain-other-catchy-colloquialisms-101625341082843.html
04-07-2021||Other||Despite increased testing, J&K’s Covid positivity rate saw massive dip in June||There was a drastic decrease in Jammu and Kashmir’s test positivity rate (TPR) for Covid-19 in June. The month saw a TPR of 1.8% as against 8.7% in May when the second wave of the virus was raging through the country. What is TPR TPR is the percentage of tests that turn out to be positive out of the total tests conducted during the period. It helps indicate the extent of infection in the community. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a positivity rate of less than 5% indicates that the pandemic is in control in the community. Ebbing wave Jammu and Kashmir’s TPR in the second week of May stood at 10.7 %. By the last week of May, it had dipped to 5.9%, while in the second week of June, it had further gone down 2% and then reached 0.79% in the last week of June. “We are almost at the lowest end of the ebbing second wave but we shouldn’t be complacent the way we were with the first wave,” said Dr Mohammad Saleem Khan, professor and head, community medicine and nodal officer of Covid-19 at Government Medical College, Srinagar. He said the second wave came quickly and didn’t last long. “It was not expected. It saw a sharp rise, peaked for a small duration and then there was a sharp decline. Maybe Covid-appropriate behavior, SOPs and vaccination helped us,” he said. Restrictions were imposed for several weeks, starting April 29. Most of these curbs have been lifted to a large extent in eight districts and partially in the rest of the 12 districts of the UT. Number of tests went up in June Besides, the average daily tests in the month of June went up to 46,450 as against 42,000 in the month of May, again indicative of the reduction in the extent of infection when collated with the positivity rate. From a total of 1, 14,382 infections in the month of May, the number reduced to 25,197 infections in June – a drop of 78%. Similarly, the fatalities declined by 74% in June when 416 deaths were recorded against 1,625 deaths in the month of May. Dr Khan said that in previous pandemics, the world did not have vaccines. “In past pandemics, we never had vaccinations, and this is why third wave used to be severe but this time, we can alter the course of the pandemic by getting vaccinated and showing Covid-appropriate behavior,” he said. “If we are able to follow the same precautions, we may be able to thwart the impact of the anticipated third wave,” he said. However, what was intriguing in June was a slower decline in the fatalities. While for every 70 positive cases, one death was reported in May, there was one death for 60 infections in June. “Many of them were those who had been hospitalised for many days. Positivity is current but the deaths are results of previous weeks. For example, if somebody is positive today, he can get severe after a few weeks which can lead to his death. That is why the corresponding decline in death this month is less,” said Khan. The active cases in the UT had shot up to a record number of 52,848 on May 13 which fell to 4,600 by the end of June. Overall, the UT has recorded 3, 16,291 cases and 4,333 deaths up to July 2 since the pandemic began in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-increased-testing-j-k-s-covid-positivity-rate-saw-massive-dip-in-june-101625341018902.html

Congress leader Ajay Rai said that Rajesh Sonkar, a resident of Aurangabad area in Varanasi, went missing from his house over 20 days ago. Rajesh’s father died over three years ago. Rajesh is mute since childhood. He lives with his mother Mita Sonkar. Rai said that Mita Sonkar was very sad and appealed to the people to help find her son. A local person video recorded her appeal and put the same on social media. The clip went viral and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi saw it. She asked her party workers to make efforts to search for the youth. Rajesh’s name was tattooed on his hand. Rai said that Rajesh was found roaming in Bundi of Rajasthan. When Priyanka was informed about it, she immediately instructed the Rajasthan government to provide proper care to Rajesh Sonkar. The party general secretary asked the Rajasthan government to make arrangements to send the boy to his home in Varanasi. She also instructed Congress’ migrant support team In-charge Charmesh Sharma to look after the boy. Rai said that Sharma called Sonkar’s mother Mita Sonkar to Rajasthan where she met her son and became emotional. Thereafter, Sharma, at the expense of the party, along with Rajesh and his mother arrived in Kashi today and dropped the duo at their home in Aurangabad in the presence of former minister Rai and other party workers.

At least one charging station would be made available within every 1km x 1km grid in major cities and towns, and at least one slow-charging station (on each side) will be created every 25km on state highways. At least one fast-charging point (on each side) every 50kms on busy national highways will also be deployed.He said the policy aims to make three cities-Shimla, Baddi, and Dharamshala- model cities for EV readiness and adoption. Besides, it also envisages the electrification of Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) buses and cabs.“The government aims to create employment opportunities related to the development of the EV ecosystem in the state,” he said.Funding and implementationKashyap said an umbrella state EV fund will be created using a ‘feebate structure’, where fees are applied to ICE vehicles to raise funds that are returned as rebates in the form of incentives.The state EV fund will be capitalised from sources such as additional road tax and/or registration fees charged to ICE vehicles, green tax on ICE vehicles registered in the state, pollution cess on petrol and diesel vehicles sold in the state.Apart from it, the funds will be generated from air-quality parking surcharge applicable to ICE vehicles and penalties levied on vehicles entering or idling in low/zero-emission zones during time periods decided by urban development agencies.The policy also proposes to constitute a state EV secretariat to ensure the effective funding and implementation of the policy under the oversight of the high-power committee.He said the government will also hold regular consultations with industry and other stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation of the policy and its provisions.In addition, an awareness drive will be launched to promote EVs and their benefits.Tax and non-tax exemptionsUnder the policy, all electric vehicles have been exempted from payment of road tax under the Himachal Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act. Commercial EVs have also been exempted from requiring permits.The director said that at least one low/zero-emission zone in each of the three model cities will be created where only EVs, walking, and cycling will be permitted. Tourist spots, eco-sensitive areas, and reserve forests will be identified by the urban development agency and timings and regulations will be notified accordingly.Also, a reserve percentage of parking slots for EVs (with charging infrastructure) in high-volume parking spaces will be provided.He said the strategy is to promote demand creation for EVs through the provision of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, the creation of dedicated infrastructure for charging of EVs through the provision of capital subsidies and mandatory the use of EVs at the institutional level, starting with public transport and government entities.The state has more than 18 lakh registered vehicles (both private and transport) of which 233 are battery operated.HRTC is currently operating 50 electric and 75 electric buses. Fifty buses run in Shimla and 25 are on the Manali to Rohtang Pass route.The state has been sanctioned 100 e-buses under FAME II.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hps-new-electric-vehicle-policy-aims-at-sustainable-eco-friendly-mobility-solutions-101625340358905.html
04-07-2021||Other||In a first, Himachal rears trout in warm water||The department of fisheries in Himachal Pradesh has successfully reared high-value “trout” in warm water in Gobind Sagar reservoir and Kol dam reservoir of Bilaspur district.For the first time, about 500 fingerlings of Rainbow trout, a coldwater fish from the Dhamwari trout farm in Rohru subdivision of Shimla district, were stocked in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) nets at Gobind Sagar reservoir in 2019 on experimental basis.The results were highly encouraging and worth emulation in other parts, said Virender Kanwar, minister for animal husbandry and fisheries.After much research and development, experts also installed 24 fish cages for Rainbow trout in Kol dam reservoir at Kasol on pilot-basis under CSS-Blue Revolution in 2020. Showed accelerated growth in warm waterAround 30,000 fingerlings of the average weight of 10-12 grams of Rainbow trout were stocked in September and October 2020 in Kol dam. The results of this experiment were encouraging as the fish gained a body weight of almost 1kg in just eight months, which usually takes two years or more in coldwater regions, thus showing accelerated growth.The successful experiment has paved a way for culturing the trout fish in warm districts also when the water temperature is congenial, the minister said.Trout available for discounted rates Kanwar said the department produced around eight metric tonnes of trout fish from Kol dam with average weight of 300grams while the maximum weight of 1kg was recorded. Out of the total fish produced, around 490 fishes, weighing around 224kg, have been sold in the market so far. The department has a stock of around 26,794 fish, weighing around 8,000kg, at its Kol dam reservoir, ready for sale in the market.The department has offered one-time relaxation for sale of trout fish at discounted price of around ₹350/per kg instead of the market price of around ₹550/per kg to boost the trout fish sale in the state and metropolitan cities, he said. Livelihood generation Approximately 850 metric tonne trout will be harvested in the state both in private and government sector, out of which 100 metric tonne will be harvested in newly created race ways in coming years. There are around 12,347 registered fishermen operating with 3,000 fishing boats whereas 5,574 households are directly dependent on fisheries as the main source of income.One ice plant and three landing centres have been constructed under blue revolution in the state for fish growers and more post-harvest facilities will be developed under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampda Yojna in the state in coming years. Earlier, the trout was being reared in 600 kms riverine length at higher altitude of cold-water streams in snow-fed rivers of Beas, Sutlej and Ravi.The state has recorded 688.05 metric tonnes trout fish production valuing ₹3,096.22 lakh during the year 2020-2021 while a target has been set to harvest 849.70 metric during the year 2021-22.In order to develop basic infrastructure for fish cultivation, 29 hatcheries, 13 feed mills, three retail outlets, smoked trout canning units, trout cage culture are being developed in the reservoirs Blue Revolution scheme.There are eight departmental trout farms where quality seed is being produced and supplied at subsidised rates to trout growers. Trout feed is also provided from departmental farm Patlikuhal district kullu, said Kanwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-a-first-himachal-rears-trout-in-warm-water-101625340179128.html

A total of 38 accused, including four African nationals, have been arrested so far in the case.The police have seized cash and property worth ₹1.52 crore from the gang, besides recovering ₹27 lakh hawala money and freezing ₹39.80 lakh lying in the bank accounts of the accused. Apart from this, 516 grams of gold worth over ₹17 lakh, 12 laptops, 26 mobile phones and two cars have been recovered.Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said joint teams of the cyber cell and CIA-1 conducted raids at Mohali and Delhi, leading to the arrest of 11 more accused, including the kingpins of the module. Out of them, 9 were apprehended from a rented apartment in Kharar, SAS Nagar. They belong to Gujarat and include kingpins — Pratik, Peenak, Dhruv Mehta and Jigar.The accused provided fake bank accounts, hawala channels, contacts of US, UK and Canada citizens and training to the Ludhiana-based module.Agrawal added that a similar modus operandi was being used at the Mohali-based fake call centre, where the accused, posing as tax, insurance authorities, used to call unsuspecting citizens in UK, US and Canada and commit financial frauds. The victims were asked to transfer money to local bank accounts which would be rerouted to India through hawala channels or using cryptocurrency like Bitcoins. Bitcoin wallets of the accused are also being confiscated and frozen.In another raid conducted in Chattarpur area of Delhi, accused Vaibhav Gupta was apprehended. He was the technical backbone of the module and provided software, servers for VoIP calling, call dialers, calling minutes, troubleshooting support to the Ludhiana-based module.“Accused Vaibhav used to receive regular monthly payments for his services.

The court also said it does not want a jail bharo andolan to start. Sidhana, who was earlier granted protection till July 3, has been directed to join the probe.On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.

His counsel asserted that he has no role to play in the incident.Public Prosecutor Pankaj Bhatia, representing the police, told the court that Sidhana had invited the protesters to the Red Fort and is one of the main conspirators in the case.The prosecutor said he stayed outside the fort area when the violence took place, to which the judge said, “If his presence is not there, then we cannot do anything about it. Interim protection extended till July 20.” Sidhana had earlier denied involvement in the Republic Day violence.

04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir alleges illegal mining in Mukerian||Three days after conducting a raid on the Beas riverbed in Amritsar district, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal along with senior party leader Bikram Singh Majithia and supporters made a surprise visit to sand mining sites at Mukerian in Hoshiarpur district on Saturday.The SAD chief alleged that illegal sand mining was being carried out in the vicinity of Dhamia, Sandwal and Kulian Lubana villages in Hajipur and Talwara blocks. Alleging that illegal mining was taking place under the patronage of Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and certain other Congress leaders, he dared the mining department officials to register a case against him as they had done earlier following his raid in Beas.Sukhbir said that brazen excavation of sand had ravaged nearly 10 villages in the area, adding that the land mafia had dug trenches to stop his convoy from reaching the illegal mining sites. He alleged that the local police informed the mafia about his visit to enable them escape in time. He said that where mining was permitted up to 10 feet, the said mafia had done excavation till 200 feet.“Operators have complained that goonda tax to the tune of ₹10,000 per truck was being collected from them,” he alleged. “When I exposed illegal mining in Beas, the government justified the activity. Will it also justify what is going on in Mukerian and Talwara? questioned Sukhbir, asserting that he would not be intimidated by false cases against him.Meanwhile, ridiculing the raids by the SAD president, activist Dharminder Singh, who has been fighting against illegal mining for years under the aegis of Khanan Roko Zameen Bachao Samgharsh Committee, asked why Sukhbir did not act when his party was in power.Sarkaria trashes SAD chief’s allegations CHANDIGARH: Punjab mining minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria on Saturday lashed out at SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal saying he was making desperate attempts to gain lost political ground in the state. In a statement, the minister said the mining sites visited by Sukhbir in Hoshiarpur district were auctioned during the Akali regime. He said the SAD chief was trying to mislead the people as no illegal mining was taking place at these sites. The mining department has already initiated actions against illegal sites in the area, he added. Hoshiarpur mining officer said the quarries shown by Sukhbir were allotted before 2016 and the department had taken action against these sites. He said that these sites were auctioned by the Punjab government between 2008 and 2011. The department had served the recovery notices of ₹14,54,400 in Jiwanwal village, ₹40,43,400 in village Bariana, ₹2,30,010 in Dhamian and ₹2,23,050 in Sandhwal, he said, adding ₹1,11,990 has been recovered from Bariana, ₹1,92,000 from Sandhwal and ₹3,03,407 from Jiwanwal, he said, adding that a recovery notice of ₹1,56,35,760 has been issued at Baringali village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-alleges-illegal-mining-in-mukerian-101625339759041.html

04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Two back-to-back blazes break out in Ludhiana||Two back-to-back fires broke out in the city on Saturday morning, ravaging a tyre manufacturing unit on RK road near Mohan Dai Oswal Hospital, and a hosiery unit in Kirpal Nagar near Tibba Road. While there were no workers at the tyre manufacturing unit, Hindustan Tyres and Tubes, owing to the two-day off imposed by the state government to deal with the power crisis, around 12 workers narrowly escaped the flames at Shivani Oswal Hosiery. No casualties were reported at either site. The fire department promptly responded to the back-to-back calls. It took around 30 firefighters and 16 fire tenders to bring the simultaneous flames under control at both the units. Fire station officer Jaswinder Singh said 13 fire tenders were deputed at the tyre manufacturing unit and three were sent to Kirpal Nagar. It took six hours to control the flames at the tyre factory, while the fire at the hosiery unit was contained in two-and-a half hours. The blaze in the tyre factory was reported around 4am. The flames rapidly spread to other parts of the unit due to strong winds. Thick smoke could be seen billowing from the unit from afar. Security guards raised the alarm and the fire brigade was informed around 4.20am. A shed of the factory had collapsed and goods and machinery worh crores had perished by the time the flames could be doused. Short circuit to blame Officials said a short circuit in the main electric panel of the unit was responsible for the fire. Chief security officer of the unit Madan Lal said four security guards had been deputed at the unit. “Soon after the fire broke out, the guards tried to douse the flames using the fire extinguishers, but to no avail as the fire kept spreading due to the strong winds,” said Lal. Sub-fire officer Navrang Singh said the firefighters faced trouble dousing the flames as parts of the iron and steel shed were collapsing during the operation.A second fire was reported soon after around 5.30am at the hosiery unit. The blaze broke out when a short circuit took place when power supply in the area was resumed in the morning. The owner of the unit, Sanjeev Kumar, said the unit falls under the small scale category and had been operational when the fire broke out. The workers were able to exit the building safely. We have not ascertained the losses as yet. No fire safety arrangementsOfficials said fire safety was lacking in both the units. “Only a few fire extinguishers were installed at the units, which were not sufficient. As there were no fire hydrants or even a water tank at a tyre manufacturing unit, we had to arrange water from a nearby hospital to save time. If not for the hospital, the fire brigade would have had to fill the tenders from a nearby municipal corporation tubewell,” a fire official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-back-to-back-blazes-break-out-in-ludhiana-101625339341979.html

The AAP workers were protesting against the frequent power cuts in Punjab. The clash escalated following which police used a water cannon to disperse the AAP workers who were trying to gherao the house of the chief minister.The police booked 23 AAP leaders for violating Covid-19 protocol. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann and MLAs Harpal Singh Cheema, Meet Hayer, Manjit Singh Bilaspur, Kulwant Singh Pandori and Baldev Singh were booked under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and the Disaster Management Act. These lawmakers were also briefly detained by the police.The police booked 200 unidentified persons also for violation of Covid-19 preventative measures. The AAP workers led by Mann protested against the Congress government over the power shortage. Police already set up barricades that were put up on the road which led to the chief minister's farmhouse. The protesters broke the first layer of security but were met with water cannons before they approached the second layer.The protests come at the backdrop of severe power shortage in urban and rural areas which has led to long hours of load shedding amid scorching heat.Punjab government in order to tackle the power shortage ordered reduction in timings of state government offices. It has also reduced power supply to industries which consume high energy. The government also faced criticism from the opposition as they claimed that the government has also failed to provide sufficient power supply to paddy growers.The AAP lawmakers said that at ₹10 per unit, rates of electricity were highest in the country. AAP MP Mann said that the chief minister was sleeping while citizens were being forced to sit on a dharna in the scorching heat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-protesting-aap-workers-in-punjab-101625337347038.html
04-07-2021||Other||Power woes in Punjab: Multiple circulars creating confusion, coordination problems, say industrialists||Fresh power curbs for continuous process industries announced on Saturday, multiple circulars and extension of orders that the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has issued for general industry has led to confusion and despair among industrialists. In a virtual meeting with PSPCL managing director A Venu Prasad on Saturday evening, industry representatives suggested that the government should make one announcement and impose 50% curbs, than shutting down different categories on different days in a week.In the first circular dated July 1, industries located in the Central Zone (Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh, Khanna, Amloh and Sirhind) and North Zone (Jalandhar, Phagwara and Hoshiarpur) of the state were asked to close their units compulsorily for 48 hours from 2 pm on that day, and resume operations only after 2 pm on Saturday. Industrial units in these areas constitute 90% of the state’s units. In these initial orders, continuous process industries were exempted.In fresh orders issued on July 2 evening, Category 4 (continuous process consumer) industry of all zones was directed to close their units from July 5-8. In another set of orders, already existing curbs on Central and North zone were extended by a day with an additional weekly off day announced for these.Avon Cycles chairman and managing director Onkar Singh Pahwa said repeated orders only exposed the state government’s mismanagement. “As Avon cycles falls under Category 4, we will be shutting down the unit from Monday to Wednesday. Already facing tough times due to Covid restrictions, our production will again take a hit. The labour will also be free for three days and will lose their earnings. We can only pray that the dry spell gets over soon,” he said.Badish Jindal, president, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association (FOSPIA) said, PSPCL’s repeated circulars were uncalled for. “First, they do not have enough power and were unprepared for the crisis. For the general industry, the weekly-offs were extended from two to three days. Continuous process industries have also asked to shut down now. How will units coordinate for smooth functioning, with different offs announced for different set of industries?” he said.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) vice-chairman Amit Thapar said, “In the crisis before Punjab, we stand with the PSPCL and efforts it is making to save our farming sector. We would highlight some confusion caused by multiple circulars, with little time given to industry to understand and interpret those circulars. It is better to allow Category 2, 3, 4, all general industry, to operate at 50% total sanctioned contract demand. This will help us in running our factories partially, and keep labour engaged.”He added, “If this is not done, the labour will roam around on these three days and mix in heterogenous groups, giving an easy invite to Covid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-woes-in-punjab-multiple-circulars-creating-confusion-coordination-problems-say-industrialists-101625338320644.html
04-07-2021||Other||At 5.14 lakh jabs on Saturday, Punjab creates daily record||Chandigarh Punjab administered a record 5.14 lakh jabs of Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, creating a new daily record. To date, 78 lakh doses of vaccine have been administered to people over 18 years of age, besides the priority groups. For the next couple of days, however, the state is left with only 75,000-odd doses as there is no word from the Centre about providing more vaccines. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “On July 1, we received around 6.85 lakh doses of Covishield and 61,100 doses of Covaxin in one instalment. This was the first time the Centre supplied such quantities to Punjab.” “From June 27 to July 2, the vaccination coverage of the state fell to an average of 17,000. After getting supply, we quickly moved to 5 lakh vaccinations, and that too in a day,” he added. Sidhu added Ludhiana, Patiala, Hoshiarpur, Muktsar, Gurdaspur, Mohali, Kapurthala and Pathankot districts exceeded their targets and if the supply was sufficient, the government planned to launch a ‘Mega Vaccination Drive’ to cover a minimum of 5 lakh persons in a day. Ludhiana administered over 82,000 vaccines; Hoshiarpur (around 78,000) and Jalandhar (over 62,000). “Punjab has received lower number of doses than Haryana and Rajasthan,” Sidhu claimed, adding that Punjab received around 80,000 doses on June 24; around 80,000 on June 25, with the figure dropping to 31,580 doses of Covaxin on June 29. The stock of Covishield remained almost nil from June 27 to July 1, which slow down the vaccination drive. Principal secretary, health, Hussan Lal said, “The spread of the Delta Plus virus strain is a concern. Studies show that a person administered with the two doses of vaccine experiences fewer effects, whereas a person without even a single dose suffers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-5-14-lakh-jabs-on-saturday-punjab-creates-daily-record-101625338018914.html
04-07-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal reviews measures to augment power supply in Capital||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday convened a review meeting with officials of the electricity department and power distribution companies and directed them to identify areas that need new transformers to augment electricity supply, the CM’s office said in a statement.“Had a review meeting with the officials of the electricity department and power distribution companies today. Discussed in detail the current status of power supply in Delhi amidst the peak demand for electricity in the capital,” Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.Power minister Satyendar Jain, additional chief secretary Satya Gopal, CEOs of all power distribution companies, and officials of the power department were present in the meeting.The national capital recorded a peak power demand of 7,323 mega watts (MW) – the highest in two years -- on Friday, with officials saying that they managed to meet the demand “without any constraints”. The highest peak power demand ever in the Capital was 7,409 MW, recorded on July 2, 2019.A government spokesperson said that the CM also asked department officials to insulate or make high-tension wires underground for the safety of people. In the next year, the Delhi government is preparing to meet peak power demand of over 8,500 MW, he added.“Every year, Delhi goes through an average 4-5% rise in demand for electricity due to increase in consumption because of new customers and increased prosperity. We have successfully been able to meet the growing demand until now and are supplying 24x7 power to all the residents of Delhi,” Kejriwal said.“The discoms that are facing issues in fixing transformers in certain areas due to lack of space shall intimate the government about the locations. The government shall assist them in fixing transformers in those areas. The overhead cables shall be either made underground or insulated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-reviews-measures-to-augment-power-supply-in-capital-101625336697981.html
04-07-2021||Delhi||As Delhi govt cracks down, Covid-19 challans nearly double||Daily prosecutions for violating Covid-appropriate behaviour in Delhi have nearly doubled as compared to a month ago, though most districts in the city have been unable to meet the target of issuing 1,000 challans per day, government data seen by HT showed. Intensifying its crackdown, the government on Saturday ordered the closure of two markets in Punjabi Basti and Nangloi till Tuesday over violations.The seven-day average of challans issued in the first week of June was 3,476, which increased to 6,449 prosecutions in the last seven days till July 2.Delhi prosecuted the most number of people -- 6,775 -- on June 29 for offences including not wearing masks, lack of social distancing and spitting in public. This was followed by July 2 when 6,731 challans were issued.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOf the 11 districts in the Capital, only southeast Delhi managed to meet the daily challan target, recording 1,125 challans on June 29 and 1,055 challans on June 30.While there is no official order setting target for issuing challans, the districts have set an “unofficial target” of issuing 1,000 challans per day in order to better ensure adherence to Covid protocols in the Capital.“We are intensifying the crackdown on violators and are also spreading awareness again about proper mask wearing and vaccination. Special focus is being given to markets and transit hubs such as railway stations and inter-state bus terminals,” said a senior revenue official.After reports of violations came from various markets, the authorities have deployed more teams in markets and crowded places. “Over 149 teams have been deployed across all the districts now,” said a senior official.On Saturday evening, the SDM of Punjabi Bagh ordered complete closure of the entire Punjabi Basti market and Janta market in Nangloi after shopkeepers and visitors were found not following the necessary protocols. The order, seen by HT, stated that all shops in these two markets will remain completely shut from Sunday to Tuesday.On June 29, the Delhi government ordered the closure of markets in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar and adjoining areas until July 5, over alleged violation of Covid-19 protocols. However, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed reopening of the Laxmi Nagar market and surrounding markets from Saturday, provided Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed. The order to re-open was issued on Friday, following a meeting between DDMA (East), Delhi Police, the MCD and the market association.Apart from the district administrations, the Delhi Police is the key enforcement agency to check adherence to Covid-19 protocols.According to the data shared by the force, Delhi Police is issuing at least 1,500 challans a day.On Friday, 1,520 challans were issued, of which 1,369 were for mask violations and 151 were for not following social distancing, while two were for consumption of liquor, pan or gutka in public.Since the lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19, the Delhi Police has issued 162,562 challans, of which 137,872 are for not wearing masks, the Delhi Police spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-delhi-govt-cracks-down-covid-challans-double-101625336639090.html
04-07-2021||Delhi||Police begin public hearings, discuss security for I-Day||Assistant commissioners of police across the city held the first ‘Jan Sunwai’ -- the public meeting initiative announced by the new Delhi Police commissioner Balaji Srivastava -- on Saturday, drawing people from all walks of life who discussed their grievances with the senior police officers.Besides public safety issues and filing new complaints, the participants sought status of their complaints, senior police officers asking not to be named said. The meetings were held between 4pm-6pm.Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “It will be a regular practice now. The police commissioner has directed all officers that members of the public who come to the Jan Sunwai must be attended to and properly heard for appropriate action on their complaints. All ACPs of the sub divisions must be available during the notified public hearing time.”Most of the meetings were held in the open lawns of police stations to ensure Covid protocols were followed.Assistant commissioner of police, Ram Sunder, who is in charge of Sangam Vihar and other police stations, said, “We held the public hearing today. In between meeting residents and listening to their suggestions, we also mediated in some long-running disputes over petty issues and helped residents resolve them.”Sangam Vihar is one of largest unauthorised colonies of Delhi.Guptesh A, a resident of Sarita Vihar, B-block, said he was passing by Apollo hospital when police officers told him about the public hearing. “I was curious and went there just to see what was happening. I was asked by a senior officer, if I wished to express my problem or grievance. I did not have any problem as such but asked them to increase night patrolling in the area.”Covid measures, I-Day security discussedSrivastava also met senior officers on Saturday to discuss arrangements and enforcement of protocols to curb the spread of Covid-19 and the security preparations for the Independence Day next month.“In view of a probable third wave of Covid-19, the commissioner told all district deputy commissioners of police (DCP) to not let their guard down and ensure that steps are taken to implement Covid-appropriate behaviour in all public places. Against the backdrop of reports of crowding in some prominent markets, he directed the DCPs to seek proactive involvement of the stakeholders such as markets and residents’ welfare associations to implement the DDMA guidelines,” Biswal said.During the meeting, the preparations for the Independence Day celebrations were also discussed. “All district DCPs have been directed to focus on anti-terror measures such as checking of hotels and guest houses, verification of tenants and domestic helps, car-dealers and cyber cafes, and reactivating the ‘eyes and ears’ scheme for information gathering and vigil over suspicious and nefarious activities,” Biswal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-begin-public-hearings-101625336637955.html
04-07-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Panels to investigate plaints of hefty bills||With the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi abating, district administrations have started investigating complaints of overcharging by hospitals during the pandemic and will take action as per law against establishments found guilty of charging more than the capped rates, said senior government officials on Saturday.Government records seen by HT show so far, there have been at least 76 complaints of hospitals overcharging patients for Covid-19 treatment. Only about eight of these complaints have been disposed of till now. Explaining the slow rate of case disposal, district magistrate of central Delhi Akriti Sagar said each complaint is being investigated by a dedicated district-level committee, which is meeting at least once a week and conducting hearings. “All matters are currently under consideration, so we cannot comment on any case as such,” she said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to data seen by HT, maximum complaints (18) came from the northwest district, followed by the southeast district (11) and the south district (10).Dr. Nutan Mundeja, director general of health services (Delhi), through an order dated June 15, directed that district-level committees be constituted to check overcharging by hospitals administering Covid-19 treatment. The order stated that each such committee will have an additional district magistrate or sub-divisional magistrate as its chairperson. Among the four other members will be a specialist (medicine) from a Delhi government office, a medical officer and a pharmacist from the CDMO’s office, and an accounts functionary.Ankita Chakravarty, DM (south), said in case a hospital is found overcharging after investigation, the DMs, after approval, have to initiate action as per the provisions of Clause 18 of the Delhi Epidemic Diseases, Covid-19 regulations, Section 188 of the IPC and other applicable laws.On June 20 last year, the Delhi government had reduced Covid-19 treatment charges by 60-67%.Malini Aisola, co-convener of All India Drug Action Network, an outfit that has helped several patients file such complaints in Delhi, said, “Overcharging was the norm rather than the exception. The government order states that the capped rates must be applicable to 60% of the beds reserved for Covid-19, but if you actually see, a minuscule percentage of the people, probably 5%, must have been charged the government rates. The government dashboard did not give any breakup of the number of beds available as per the capped prices and otherwise. Most people were also unaware that there was a price capping in place,” she said.Dr Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India), said, “The order initially issued by the government was not clear on who will enforce it. We want representatives from bodies like IMA to be a part of the committee. Also, as per initial discussions, the capping wasn’t supposed to be applicable on insured patients. The pre-negotiated payments coming in from insurance companies were to cross-subsidise the other cases, but the insurance providers were only paying the government rates and hospitals had to charge the difference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-govt-launches-probe-into-overcharging-by-delhi-hospitals-101625336517989.html
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Providing free shelter, food will increase population of homeless: Bombay HC||Providing free shelter and meals to the homeless, beggars and pavement dwellers will only increase such persons if they are not asked to work in return for the country, the Bombay high court (HC) observed on Saturday and disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL) after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed the HC that it had undertaken various measures to provide food packets, potable water and sanitary pads to homeless girls with the help of various NGOs.The observation came while the court was hearing a PIL filed by Brijesh Arya, founder president of NGO Pehchan which works for the homeless, through advocate Kranti LC, seeking directions to the state and civic authorities to complete construction of shelter homes for the homeless and provide cooked meal thrice a day, clean public toilets and bathrooms for use by homeless and urban poor for free, potable water, soaps and sanitary napkins for women during the pandemic.While making oral observations, the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni said, “The homeless should also work for the country if they are provided with shelter. There is employment or livelihood provided for them under government schemes. Everything cannot be provided by the government; otherwise it will increase their numbers. You are just encouraging increase of such a population.”On Saturday, the counsel for BMC submitted a document by the assistant commissioner (planning) which disclosed the number of food packets being distributed by the civic authority, Ness Wadia Foundation, Ramkrishna Mission and others to the homeless in the city and distribution of napkins to 1,300 homeless women. The civic authority also submitted that a project aimed at resolving the concerns of homeless persons and reliefs sought by the petitioner would be provided through it.The court, while appreciating the initiatives by the authorities, also asked the state and civic authority to decide on making use of public toilets free as some homeless and beggars cannot afford to pay the amount.Additional government pleader for the state informed the bench that various steps had been taken during the pandemic to provide free meals to the homeless through Shiv Bhojanalay initiative where free food was being distributed.After hearing the submissions, the bench pulled up the petitioner for not providing sufficient data with regards to the homeless in the city and state. The court then expressed satisfaction at the initiatives taken by the state and BMC and said, “We are of the considered opinion that the state and the corporation are taking steps in the right directions for food, water, napkins etc for homeless within the limits of their capacity and no direction is required at this stage from this court for augmenting the distribution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/providing-free-shelter-food-will-increase-population-of-homeless-bombay-hc-101625334059164.html
04-07-2021||Mumbai||Close relatives can adopt a child under provisions of JJ Act: Bombay HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has held that adoption under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 cannot be restricted to abandoned, orphaned or surrendered children, and added that a person can adopt the child of a close relative under the Act.A single judge bench of justice Manish Pitale on Wednesday struck down an order passed by District Judge-1, Yavatmal, rejecting an application filed by a local couple to adopt the daughter of the man’s sister. The district judge rejected the application saying the minor girl was neither a child in conflict with the law or one needing care and protection, and therefore the proposed adoption cannot be allowed under provisions of the JJ Act.The adoptive parents then moved the HC. Their counsel advocate Ira Khisti pointed out that the district judge erred in taking an extremely strict view and submitted that a proper appreciation of the provisions of the JJ Act and Adoption Regulations, 2017 would show that the legislature has consciously made provisions for adoption of a child by relatives.Amicus curiae KT Mirza supported her by pointing out that certain additional provisions are made in the JJ Act which provide for adoption by a relative and also brought to the notice of the court the schedule to the regulations, laying down specific formats for consent etc. in cases of adoption by relatives — maternal or paternal uncles or aunts or grand-parents.Justice Pitale accepted their contentions and said, “A perusal of the provisions of JJ Act shows that an elaborate procedure is laid down and contemplated for adoption of a child by relatives, who are also specified under the said enactment.”“If adoption under the JJ Act, 2015 was to be restrictively applicable only to children in conflict with law or those in need of care and protection, such elaborate provisions governing the procedure for adoption by relatives or step-parents would not have been provided for,” the court added.Justice Pitale said that under the scheme of the JJ Act and Adoption Regulations, “adoption cannot be restricted only to children in conflict with law or those in need of care and protection or only those children who are orphaned, abandoned or surrendered,” and therefore, the application filed by the applicant couple could not have been rejected.HC said, in the present case, the child is sought to be adopted by the maternal uncle and aunt of the child and they are clearly covered by the definition of “relative” as appearing in section 2(52) of the JJ Act, 2015 and directed the district judge to decide the application jointly filed by the couple seeking to adopt the child as well as the biological parents for adoption the girl child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/close-relatives-can-adopt-a-child-under-provisions-of-jj-act-bombay-hc-101625334057802.html
04-07-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Pune’ Spruce Up tech to do the dirty work||Spruce Up believes it is a disrupter; not just in terms of the technological landscape of Indian manufacturing, but also in the socio-development milieu where the millennial Indian startup likes to be positioned.Cleantech, hardware, technology, manufacturing, are all the cue words that Spruce Up founder, Abhishek Shelar has banked on to make the Forbes Asia 30- under-30 (Asia Entrepreneurs) list.Shelar, an IIT Bombay alumnus, Shelar hails from Aurangabad city and first came to Pune in 2008, to study at Fergusson College.He then went on to IIT Bombay in 2010, where he was awarded an Undergraduate Research Award for his work in finding a low-cost method for manufacturing titanium dental implants.He set up his first company in 2013, Siddheya Precision Works in Shendra MIDC, Aurangabad.Shelar than got accepted at Harvard for a Master’s programme in Technology, Innovation and Education. At Harvard, Shelar incubated as a consultant for the start-up U-Doodle.org at the Harvard Innovation Lab under the Venture Incubation Programme (VIP).His course ended and he decided to come back to India to start a new venture.In the beginningAfter coming to India, Shelar set-up Spruce Up Industries, a company to provide value innovation solutions to key societal problems.Says Shelar, “I don’t come from any industry or manufacturing business background. My dad is an orthopaedic surgeon and we have a hospital in Aurangabad. I wanted to do something better for the country and I feel connected to nature and the environment a lot. In 2015, the Indian start-up ecosystem was very thriving. Along with Startup India scheme, the Swacch Bharat programme was also going on. I had seen tourist places where there is always trash, litter and I always thought why there isn’t a big vacuum cleaner. The monumental Swacch Bharat Mission is being run by a “jhadu” (broom). There was a technology mismatch and so I thought this space requires mechanisation.”Jatayu – Scavenger of nature With these goals, within nine months of his homecoming, Shelar successfully invented patented technologies and developed a prototype of the first machine. This machine was robust, stronger, and suitable for harsh Indian circumstances, capable of handling wet and dry garbage of varied types. It was developed at less than half the cost of machines available worldwide.As a tribute to vultures - scavengers of nature- he named his machine Jatayu, after a mythological king of vultures.Surviving cancer On a separate note, amidst everything that was going on with the company, Shelar was detected with cancer in 2016, and had to undergo chemotherapy for four months. Those four months he would take chemo every alternate weekend and would have to work extra. Bearing all its side effects, he kept working to make the machine efficient and best suited for India. Today he is cancer-free.Bootstrapping Spruce Up Spruce Up was financed from Shelar’s father’s retirement funds and life savings, and further, putting the family house on mortgage. Shelar recalls, “I was operating out of a small room in Pune. After a year, I had two more people join me. The team grew systematically over time. There were a lot of challenges and a lot of learning went into doing this.”B-to-G: Business to GovernmentSays Shelar: “We are operating in one of the toughest spaces because we are operating in Business to Government (B2G) domain. The waste sector, heavy machinery and hardware sector is also hard to do. We have to visit government offices several times to sell the product. Also, this is not a very fundable space. Investors like to invest in explosive ideas. This is by no means an explosive idea from an investor’s point of view. So, we had to invest and become very sharp and shrewd about bootstrapping. Doing this kind of a complex endeavour on a bootstrapped budget was big challenge for us. That forced us to focus on fundamentals. Over the five years, our product quality and conduct became very sharp and we were successfully able to deploy 100 machines from Nagaland to Jamnagar and Uttar Kashi to Chennai. One machine was sold in New Zealand also,” he said.Product design learnings The first machine – Jatayu HD – was, by Shelar’s own admission, the most compact, modular and powerful machine. The prototype was made in six months, but minimum viable product took two years.Setting up of production, distribution and vendor network took time. The actual production started in 2017 and the first sale happened in 2018.“After deploying 40 machines which ran for 15,000 hours we understood a lot of small things. We realised that India needs a truly fully contactless machine. There is a lot of garbage and worker hygiene is a very big concern. Hence, we launched a new model called Jatayu Super,” said Shelar, adding, “Wherever possible we use top Indian brand products of international repute. Second preference is international products, but made in factories within India. Last preference is fully import for materials where there is no substitute. So, we try to reduce the import and have kept it at only 10 per cent of the product. Another problem is that the acid content in solid waste builds up over time and it corrodes the vehicles. So, we had to make our machine body out of aluminium, while other parts are made out of stainless steel,” he added.An OEM Explaining the structure of the Spruce Up team, Shelar says, “We are an OEM (original equipment manufacturer). We develop and maintain the technology. We have all the protection rights, trademarks, copyrights, licences. We ensure the machines are regulated. We set all prices, we give service. We have a research and development team, vendor development team, sales and marketing and after sales. We have production partners who do our production.”The Indian challenge Says Shelar, “With any air machine, filtration is required. India, as compared to US or Europe, is a very dusty country. The fine dust chokes all filters and reduces the machine performance. The filtration technology is very difficult because there is very severe dust loading. Many competitors use this cartridge filters to clean, but they are not so effective. European companies use a water sprinkler (fine mist which captures the dust). In India, we get hard water supply and don’t have enough water supply. We have managed to overcome these challenges using very Indian condition-specific modifications in our design. We have looked at some technologies from military and defence applications and used such technologies.”Politically correctSanitisation workers are a political constituency in Indian politics. Explaining that the contactless machine does not replace humans or employees, Shelar says, “There are three million workers in the waste collection sector, and still 30 per cent of garbage doesn’t get collected. Waste pickers are not willing to put their hands in rotten garbage. They are requesting for contactless machines to do their job in a safe way. Especially in the post-Covid scenario, garbage has become even more dangerous from the health point of view. We believe that the more garbage is being lifted, more lives are being saved and more skills are being upgraded. A ‘jhadu’ equipped worker gets upskilled as a machine operator. Besides, all the garbage is being tracked and hence, there is accountability in the workspace. The workers are given more dignified work. New technology is a force of nature. It will come, it will find its balance. That is how we see it.”“Civic bodies, at present, are using our machines only for uncollected garbage. Also, cleaning is just one part. Post cleaning, there is maintenance, washing and beautification. So, the sanitisation workforce can be utilised for this hygienic work. I believe humans are not replaced, but they are uplifted and upskilled due to contactless machines like Jatayu,” Shelar added.Future plans Shelar said, “We will have three variants of four models – a product suite which can handle various kinds of requirements. We are also launching an electric litter picker-cum-disinfection system-cum-corner sweeping machine-cum-air blowing machine. We are bringing our super powerful vacuum in the small form factor which many universities, SEZs, corporates can use and keep their premises clean. It’s a multi-utility machine which lot of entities can use. It’s more accessible. Especially during Covid-times, many people want mechanisation, more cleanliness, there is more focus on that.”Clean city campaign While Shelar refuses to name the city, he revealed a data-based clean city campaign which will be launched soon with the help of the Jatayu machies. “We have a partner company specialised in cleaning cities. The project includes geotagging garbage points and reporting the frequency of garbage generation, tonnage expected at a given location. The control room at the civic body office will be able to come up with a systematic plan of eradicating garbage.”Customer feedback“Jatayu has made cleaning highways very easy for us. We can now clear dumpsites near cities and toll nakas safely and hygienically and monitor the work remotely to ensure maximum productivity. These machines have powerful suction pumps which have the capacity of removing garbage in substantial quantities in one go,” said Vijay Oswal, director, Markolines. Markolines, a Mumbai-based company involved in corridor management and maintenance services, is using the Jatayu machine for road cleaning and maintenance in Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-pune-spruce-up-tech-to-do-the-dirty-work-101625321221244.html
04-07-2021||Pune||Your Space: Crackdown on Covid violators must||Covid-19 is showing us many shades of humanity – while we all are fighting against the deadly virus by following protocol-appropriate behaviour, there are some who are “break the rules” and leading us to a blunder. Politicians, irrespective of any party, is in the race of breaking rules. We have been told that a leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way. However, by breaking rules framed by their party members itself, which way (path) are they showing to the people? A path that leads to disaster? I believe that leadership is the action and not the position. Politicians love to take the name of Mahatma Gandhi, but no one follows his principles - Remember he called off the non-cooperation movement due to violence which was against his principles. Do our politicians have the guts to call off their protest if it’s breaking the rules made by themselves? It might be politicians or individuals, laws should be equal for all and the government should take action against anyone who breaks the law. Government should know that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. People will always support the right because truth never damages a cause that is just. Apurv Londhe Popular figures should set ideal examples While the Parliament is not in session because of the pandemic, the political leaders are not expected to gather crowds and conduct rallies. They have many responsibilities to fulfil during the Covid times. But the biggest responsibility of all is to spread the right information and encourage people to follow safety norms and maintain social distancing. The right precedent must be set by the political leaders, political parties, the election commission and the honourable courts by punishing those who flaunt Covid related norms. Political leaders are known as public figures, people imitate their actions. They have to be very cautious about their conduct during the pandemic. If leaders don’t comply with the norms then the people will not feel any accountability. India has witnessed unprecedented numbers of deaths during the pandemic. Anyone who doesn’t take Covid related norms seriously, should be punished and a right message must be given to society. Any negligence will amount to many deaths. Many celebrities and influential figures across the world are urging people to follow Covid norms strictly. What celebrities and political leaders say or do have a great impact on society that is why they need to walk the talk. All the important leaders of all political parties fundamentally promote wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. While saying that, the political leaders also have to completely avoid public gatherings. All the respected authorities should make virtual gatherings and virtual meetings compulsory. That will certainly solve the major issue of public gatherings. Santosh Bhagat Covid exposed partisan politics, judiciary Maharashtra and Gujarat along with the Capital were put to ablaze into the second wave of corona; for east of India Bengal witnessed a bitter battle between two strong leaders. In the dance of democracy - so called election; followers, members of party and leaders thrashed Covid-19 related guidelines. Showing utter disrespect and not paying any heed to the public health. While I paid a Rs500 fine for accidentally not covering my face with a mask for a few minutes. Then, I thought it was okay as it was my mistake and I got punished but what are authorities doing when there was blatant violation of rules? Why are they being punished for their selfish deed? Rule of law is sine qua non for democracy. Article 14 puts everyone equal before the law, but why is this case of “some people are mere equal“ kind of? Does the judicial system of India have the courage to punish people sitting at upper places? Police authorities behaved as mute spectators of the event. What stopped them from taking action?. Its courage, both mental and physical, in the words of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw that lacks and held them back from taking action. Sympathisers of them and their top brass may try to defend them in the name of lack of training, equipment, low salary and political interference. But none of it should come in the way of an individual to perform his/her duty; that’s the show of ‘leadership’. Instead, some of them are busy writing on Twitter or writing columns in newspapers. But what they should actually do is come down to the street - boost moral force, uphold rules of law without fear of consequences. Then only the “Ram Rajya” will be established. And they themselves need not to encounter for clarity of society. Kedar Telang Self-awareness must during the Covid times In May 2021, WHO report says that there were several factors contributing to the increase in Covid-19 cases in India. Two of these reasons are that a large number of people came together for political and religious events. Public rules were not adequately followed. When there are rules, it is for all the citizens and public representatives. Yet, since 2020, we have seen many examples of political rallies, protests who violated the rules of Covid 19. Farmers’ protests in Delhi, Bengal election rallies, MPSC student protests in Pune, are such examples where people came on the street and violated rules. The purpose of the protest is used to find the answer to the problem or to force the government to change or make decisions. But do we really find success from that protest all the time? Maybe not! Maybe yes! It is also seen that many parties are working to ignite the agitation and fulfil their hidden political agendas. The number of corona cases increased dramatically after the agitation or campaign. In April 2021, the Madras high court held that only the EC was responsible for the second Covid wave in India. But in my opinion, mutual coordination between political parties, political leaders, government officials and citizens are needed rather than holding each other accountable. If there will be an increase of self-awareness, there will be no need to take strict penal action against anyone. In the worst case, governmnet of India (GOI) also should update the Epidemic Diseases Act,1897. The sanitation workers in Pune showed that the protest can be carried out by following all the rules and regulations of Covid. On the day of protest, only 50 workers were there for the protest as per rules. They followed social distancing by keeping distance from each other. No one removed masks during the protest. If this happens all over India, there will be no need for penal action. But for that, self-awareness should be awakened in everyone. Aishwarya Swati Balkrishna Take steps to avoid public mass protests Public representatives take public opinion to the forefront. Both sides of coin are fair with their respective reasons to protests. Covid norms are like daily routines and many of us have crossed these norms already. One basic theory is there, if the masses are protesting, rules or laws not only get violated but get vanished also. One important point to be noted - almost negligible corona positive cases resulted because of these protests. All leaders have supported corona-fighting solutions and continued with it. So, instead of penal actions, the basic causes of these protests should get resolved. Vidya Desai Leaders must set an example Even when there is an apocalyptic life-threatening pandemic all around us, elected persons, politicos and their supporters miss no opportunity to draw attention to their own selves by holding public rallies, campaigns, meetings and gatherings all this while throwing social norms to the winds. If the public think that politicians have concern for our health and well-being, then we need to do a re-think. Their only thought is to gain political mileage by using us, the voters until the next elections. What is of greater concern and most disheartening is that the enforcement agency in most cases is a pliant bystander. If penal action as per the government’s orders, can be taken against members of the general public, why not ‘netas’ ? Everyone must remember that in India we drool over politicians, cricketers and film stars and follow them blindly. So, if the public sees these people flouting norms and no action being taken against them, then it is left to the discerning reader to decide what happens next. And why we have the uncontrolled increase in Covid cases without reason.

It was filed on the basis of the statement of Mistafizur Rahman Hussain Shaikh, who was part of the maintenance crew of the barge.Shaikh accused Ballav of overlooking the weather alerts and of failing to take appropriate care despite knowing that the lapse could result in the loss of lives.As per the police complaint in the case, the barge was anchored near an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields. At about 11.00 pm on May 16, wind speed started increasing. An hour later, the wind speed almost doubled. At about 2 am, two of the eight anchor cables of the barge gave way and the captain send a distress message to a tugboat, which was supposed to be in the vicinity. The boat was about 16 nautical miles away and could not move in the stormy weather.Police have recorded statements of over 100 survivors rescued by the Navy and the Coast Guard from the barge.Afcons Infrastructure, which lead the consortium that had chartered the barge along with its marine crew, has said that the master of P305 chose to stay in the sea, near the platform where it was working, despite receiving instructions for returning to Mumbai harbour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/three-held-in-connection-with-barge-tragedy-during-cyclone-tauktae-101625311737649.html

It said the deal will be singed in a ceremony in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia on Wednesday.The vessel would be also freed Wednesday, it said.The head of Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority, Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, said last month the parties had agreed on a compensation amount. But he said it would not be made public as they had signed a non-disclosure agreement until the signing of the final contract.The vessel had run aground in the single-lane stretch of the canal on March 23 before it was extracted six days later after a massive salvage effort by a flotilla of tugboats.Since it was freed, the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel, which carries cargo between Asia and Europe, has been ordered by authorities to remain in a holding lake mid-canal, along with most of its crew, as the two sides negotiated a settlement.The disagreement had centered on the compensation amount the Suez Canal Authority is claiming for the salvage of the vessel.The money would cover the salvage operation, costs of stalled canal traffic, and lost transit fees for the week the Ever Given blocked the canal.At first, the Suez Canal Authority demanded $916 million in compensation, which was later lowered to $550 million.The two sides have traded blame for the vessel’s grounding, with bad weather, poor decisions on the part of canal authorities, and human and technical error all being thrown out as possible factors.The six-day blockage disrupted global shipping. Hundreds of ships waited in place for the canal to be unblocked, while some ships were forced to take the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip, requiring additional fuel and other costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-says-deal-reached-to-free-seized-ever-given-vessel-101625419835750.html

In an opinion piece, Kelly Alkhouli, a political consultant for The Jerusalem Post, said it is ironic that Pakistan, which has been repeatedly undermining US strategy in the region, has long been viewed as a key ally in resolving the decades-long intra-Afghanistan conflict.“Pakistan’s support of jihadi groups stems partly from cynical realism, in order to expand its sphere of influence in Afghanistan and support the Islamist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir,” wrote Alkhouli, director of international relations at the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs.Pakistan has long been blamed for providing support to the Taliban and recently, Prime Minister Imran Khan ruled out the possibility of hosting American bases on their soil for military action inside Afghanistan. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Khan argued that Pakistan cannot host American bases as they have “already paid too heavy a price.”“If Pakistan were to agree to host US bases, from which to bomb Afghanistan, and an Afghan civil war ensued, Pakistan would be targeted for revenge by terrorists again," said Khan.Also Read | Taliban capture key Kandahar district, Afghan forces flee to Tajikistan: ReportBut Pakistan’s reluctance to blame the Taliban for rising violence is being seen as tacit support to the insurgents. Pakistan foreign minister Mahmood Qureshi said last month that blaming the Taliban for the rise in violence would be an “exaggeration”, suggesting that the Afghan government and the Islamic State should be held responsible for it.Alkhouli opined that the Taliban is an “independent terrorist organization with fickle allegiances” and Pakistan’s reduced leverage over the Islamist group with the latter’s potential victory in Afghanistan has made Islamabad “increasingly wary”. She warned that the continued violence in Afghanistan will spill over into Pakistan with a mass influx of refugees. She said that the Taliban’s victory would embolden other Islamist groups in Pakistan and Imran Khan’s lack of control over security apparatus could lead to a coup.“Ultimately, Pakistan’s dangerous gamble has left it in a perilous state, with fewer allies and greater mistrust,” Alkhouli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-dangerous-gamble-in-afghanistan-has-left-it-in-perilous-state-warns-analyst-101625413448204.html

A total of 232 astronauts, mostly American and Russian, have made spacewalks.Shenzhou XII, China’s seventh manned space mission, is part of the Tiangong station programme, which aims to complete a three-component station in a low-Earth orbit about 390km above the ground before the end of 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-astronauts-conduct-spacewalk-101625408043174.html

The date marks the annual celebration of nationhood in the United States. This year marks the 245th anniversary of the freedom of the thirteen American colonies from British colonial rule.All you need to know about the Fourth of July:The day commemorates the passage of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress in 1776, according to Britannica.Also read| US Independence Day: What do fireworks symbolise on the Fourth of July? All you need to knowThe Congress had approved independence from Great Britain on July 2 but the process of revising the Declaration of Independence was completed two days later. The declaration was originally drafted by Thomas Jefferson in consultation with fellow committee members John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and William Livingston, as per the Britannica.The first days of independence during the summer of 1776 in many towns took the form of a mock funeral for King George III, whose "death" symbolized the rebirth of liberty, and the end of monarchy and tyranny, in contrast to the pre-revolutionary years when annual celebrations were held for his birthday.Philadelphia commemorated the first annual independence day on July 4, 1777, while Congress was still busy with the ongoing war, as per The History.In the initial years, Independence Day was celebrated with parades, oratory, and toasting in ceremonies that marked the existence of a new nation. These celebrations played an important role in the development of the federal political system and this provided the informal political parties a venue to tie local and national contests to independence, as per the Britannica report authored by David L. Waldstreicher, History Professor at New York University.The two nascent political parties were holding separate partisan Independence Dat festivals in most larger towns by the mid-1970s. However, with the growth and diversification of American society, according to the report, the commemoration of the day became a patriotic tradition, which many groups not limited to political parties started to claim.Also read: Ahead of US Independence Day, Trump holds 'Save America' rally in FloridaBy the late 19th century, the Fourth of July emerged as a major midsummer holiday involving heavy drinking and an immense display of fireworks.

The group captured the Panjwai district in the southern province of Kandahar just two days after the US-allied forces withdrew from Bagram Air Base near Kabul.Panjwai district has been the Taliban’s target for a long time, given its proximity to Kandahar city. The fall of the Panjwai district reportedly sent scores of families fleeing from the area as the extremist group aims to impose a harsh version of Islamic sharia law, which it calls “genuine Islamic system”."The Taliban have captured the district police headquarters and governor's office building," Panjwai district governor Hasti Mohammad said Afghan forces told news agency AFP.Also Read | Women can't leave home alone, men have to grow beard: Taliban rules in captured Afghan districtsThe Taliban insurgents have made massive strides throughout the country after US troops began to pull out following President Joe Biden’s announcement in April.

04-07-2021||World||'Marriage without strings': Saudi confronts rise of 'misyar'||The Muslim no-strings-attached "misyar" marriage often done in secret is fast pervading Saudi society -- a boon for cash-strapped men unable to afford expensive traditional weddings, but deplored by critics for legitimising promiscuity.The practice, usually a temporary alliance in which the wife waives some conventional marriage rights such as cohabitation and financial support, has been legally permitted in the conservative Muslim kingdom for decades.More than a dozen interviews with matchmakers and misyar couples -- including grooms juggling other conventional marriages -- offer a window into a phenomenon still shrouded in secrecy and shame, despite its proliferation.The testimonies highlight how misyar is seen as a hybrid between marriage and singlehood, benefiting polygamists without the stress of maintaining a second household.Despite its potential for abuse, it also appeals to some women keen to shun patriarchal expectations of traditional marriages, as well as unmarried couples seeking religious cover for sexual relationships, forbidden by Islam outside wedlock."Misyar offers comfort, freedom and companionship that is halal (permitted in Islam)," said a Saudi government employee in his 40s, who has been in such a relationship with a Saudi widow in her 30s for more than two years.He told AFP he had three children from a separate, conventional marriage, and visits his misyar wife in her Riyadh home "whenever" he wants. He did not say what she gained from the secret alliance."My (Saudi) friend has had 11 secret misyar wives. He divorces and marries another, divorces and marries another...," he added, trailing off.- 'No dowry' -Saudis, as well as the kingdom's expat workers, can be seen hunting on dating apps and matrimonial websites for such partners."Misyar is cheaper. There is no dowry, no obligation," a 40-year-old Egyptian pharmacist in Riyadh told AFP.He began searching after sending his wife and five-year-old son back to Cairo at the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year, mainly due to rising living costs and an expat levy introduced by Saudi Arabia in recent years."Being away from my wife is hard," he said, adding he had been searching for misyar through "khatba" matchmakers on Instagram who charge as much as 5,000 riyals ($1,333)."I gave them my preference: weight, size, skin colour... but no match so far."Such marriages are often short-lived, with most ending in divorce from anywhere between 14 and 60 days, the kingdom's Al-Watan newspaper reported in 2018, citing justice ministry sources.It is touted by some women as a fleeting escape from spinsterhood or a chance for a fresh beginning for divorcees and widows, who otherwise struggle to remarry.A close associate of a divorced Syrian woman in Riyadh told AFP she was in a secret misyar relationship because she feared her ex-husband, a Saudi, would legally seek custody of her two children if he discovered that she had remarried.It is impossible to estimate the number of such marriages, many of which are undocumented.Saudi clerics say the practice has proliferated since 1996, when the then grand mufti, the kingdom's highest religious authority, legitimised it with an Islamic edict.But many question the validity of a furtive practice at odds with the main tenets of Islamic marriage, which requires a public declaration.- 'Take him to court' -A prominent Riyadh cleric attributed its proliferation to men unwilling to shoulder the full responsibilities of polygamous marriage, which is permitted in Islam as long as all wives are treated equally.In a 2019 column in the Saudi Gazette daily, columnist Tariq Al-Maeena described misyar as a "license to have multiple partners without much responsibility or expense"."Reports in the Saudi press have spoken of growing concerns over the number of children fathered by Saudi males in their trips abroad, and abandoned for all practical purposes," he wrote.Some women are forced to pursue court cases against Saudi men refusing to accept children born into misyar relationships."A woman contacted me and said: 'I am a misyar wife and my husband does not recognise my child'," the Riyadh cleric told AFP."He says 'the child is not my problem'. I advised her to take him to court and fight for her rights."Still, women are encouraged socially to turn a blind eye to their husband's misyar adventures.Fahad Almuais, a matchmaker who says his clients are mostly "polygamists", spoke of one Saudi government worker who kept his misyar relationship hidden from his first wife.When he began routinely disappearing every weekend, her female neighbour advised the suspicious wife to "stay quiet"."He married misyar so he wouldn't make (your life) a living hell," Almuais told online news portal Thmanyah, quoting the neighbour."Be patient and let him go for the weekend, and the rest of the days he's yours."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/marriage-without-strings-saudi-confronts-rise-of-misyar-101625398199523.html

When asked if he would stop wearing a mask if permitted, Johnson responded in the affirmative, insisting that a lot of people would prefer to do away with the mask order if possible."I will (not wear a mask). I don't particularly want to wear a mask, I don't think a lot of people enjoy doing it, we will be moving into a phase though where these will be matters of personal choice," Johnson told Reuters.As the UK is all set to open up its economy after July 19, pandemic essentials like face masks will be left to the citizens' judgement, and the country will “move away” from restrictions that have been difficult for its citizens, said housing secretary Robert Jenrick.“It will be a different period where we as private citizens make these judgements rather than the government telling you what to do,” Jenrick said."It does seem as if we can now move forward and move to a much more permissive regime where we move away from many of those restrictions that have been so difficult for us," he added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on June 28 that most coronavirus restrictions in the UK will come to an end on July 19. Jenrick reiterated Johnson’s words stating that the data that is all set to decide if final lockdown restrictions in the UK can be lifted on July 19 is looking "very positive", thanks to the success of the vaccination programme. Many in the UK have started to dub July 19 as “Freedom Day”"The data that we're seeing that the Prime Minister is reviewing at the moment ahead of his decision point on the roadmap looks very positive," Reuters said quoting Jenrick.The British Medical Association (BMA) however suggested that some coronavirus measures like wearing masks and ensuring proper ventilation should be carried on even after July 19. BMA’s words of caution comes amidst a spike in the daily tally of cases in the UK, which reported 27,125 cases on Friday."This data coupled with some increases in hospitalisation suggests that it would be quite wrong from a public health interest to on July 19 remove all restrictions ... or to give the public the expectation that we will have a pre-Covid society where no one has to take any measures to prevent spread," Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said on Saturday.Johnson had plans to lift restrictions in June but a raging Delta variant caused him to relent. He told reporters last week that vaccination has severed the link between infections and death but cautioned that some restrictions might continue even after July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-masks-to-become-matter-of-personal-choice-in-uk-101625397754244.html

They are also often deployed to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.The Hercules that crashed Sunday has the same tail number as one acquired from the United States and delivered to the Philippines earlier this year.Senator Richard Gordon said it was the fourth military aircraft accident this year with "mass casualties"."Are we buying defective crafts... (with) the people's money?" he tweeted.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque described the accident as "very unfortunate", and the US embassy Charge d'Affaires John Law offered "sincerest condolences" to the families of the victims.Sunday's accident comes after a Black Hawk helicopter crashed last month during a night-time training flight, killing all six on board. The accident prompted the grounding of the Philippines' entire Black Hawk fleet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-philippines-troop-plane-crash-rises-to-29-101625395113093.html

Facebook confirmed the test after social media users posted screenshots of such alerts on Twitter."Are you concerned that someone you know is becoming an extremist?" reads the screenshot of a pop-up notice from Facebook. Another alert warning the users said, "you may have been exposed to harmful extremist content recently." Both alerts included links to “Get Support”.Facebook is now signposting help if you think a friend is becoming an extremist 😳h/t @disclosetv pic.twitter.com/7L5B0UORzjFacebook spokesperson Andy Stone said in a Twitter exchange that the alerts were a part of the company's Redirect Initiative to combat violent extremism by redirecting hate and violence-related search terms towards resources, education, and outreach groups that can help. The social media giant said that the company is running a small test in the United States as a pilot for a global approach to prevent radicalisation."This test is part of our larger work to assess ways to provide resources and support to people on Facebook who may have engaged with or were exposed to extremist content, or may know someone who is at risk," news agency Reuters quoted a Facebook spokesperson as saying. "We are partnering with NGOs and academic experts in this space and hope to have more to share in the future," the spokesperson added.Also Read | Ravi Shankar Prasad praises Google, Facebook and Instagram.

04-07-2021||World||After year of pandemic cancellations, Americans celebrate July 4th with a bang||Americans mark their nation’s 245th birthday on Sunday with fireworks that may look brighter, hotdogs that may taste juicier and marching bands that may sound jauntier after the pandemic forced the cancellation of nearly all celebrations last year.As always, fireworks displays are the highlight of the July Fourth holiday. Two of the biggest pyrotechnic shows in the country will blast off over the National Mall in Washington, and over a mile stretch of New York City's East River, separating Manhattan from the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.Some classic July Fourth events such as Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in Brooklyn's Coney Island remain scaled back to allow for social distancing in recognition of the continued threat of the Covid-19 coronavirus, which has killed more than 600,000 Americans. The more aggressive Delta variant has raised alarms about the potential for another surge among the unvaccinated.Even so, this holiday is a time for Americans to show their patriotism and to celebrate a fresh sense of freedom in a personal sense by mingling with friends once again and enjoying summer's simple pleasures.But this year's July Fourth is not entirely carefree. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned state and local police last week of a heightened threat of violence by domestic extremist groups amid relaxed Covid-19 restrictions and the approaching July Fourth holiday.This weekend is expected to be the busiest July Fourth road travel holiday on record - with an estimated 43.6 million Americans behind the wheel, or 5 percent more than a previous record set in 2019, the American Automobile Association said.Aleksandra Magidoff, a 12-year-old from Brooklyn, is headed to a New Jersey suburb to reconnect with a lifelong friend and her family. They were among the more than 3.5 million people who have moved out of New York, once the U.S. epicenter of Covid-19, since the pandemic started in the spring of 2020."I'm so excited - I can talk to them and celebrate with them and just socialize!" said Magidoff, who was fully vaccinated under the enormous blue whale model at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The girls plan to gorge on "a bunch of hamburgers and hotdogs" before taking in the fireworks show at a New Jersey fairgrounds, she said.Last July Fourth she watched fireworks from her apartment building's rooftop while under pandemic lockdown, allowed to celebrate with only her immediate family.In Washington, President Joe Biden plans a 1,000 person July Fourth celebration on the White House lawn with essential workers and military families.The president hosts the event three days after his visit to Surfside, Florida, to console families whose loved ones were in a condo tower that collapsed on June 24. Several Florida communities have cancelled their July Fourth fireworks out of respect for those impacted by the tragedy, city officials said.Elsewhere in Washington on Sunday, marching bands will return for a traditional parade on Capitol Hill's Barracks Row. As darkness falls, the National Mall is expected to draw big crowds to a 17-minute fireworks display set off from both sides of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool.On New York's East River, 50 pyrotechnicians have spent days loading more than 65,000 shells on five barges to wow audiences watching the spectacular show either in person or on television. The display is presented by Macy's department store.Lighting up the night's sky not only delights crowds but also promises to restore a lifeline this year for the businesses that supply the 16,000 July Fourth fireworks displays that typically occur in cities and towns. Last year, only a "scant few" went on with the show, said Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association."Approximately 70 percent are scheduled to return, and many will be bigger and better than pre-pandemic levels," Heckman said.But for some July Fourth will be somber.In addition to the pall cast over the country by the pandemic and the Florida building collapse, the U.S. West faces a heightened risk of wildfires after a scorching heatwave and extremely dry conditions. And nationwide supply chain glitches tied to the pandemic have jacked up prices of everything from household items to fireworks."Approximately 30 percent of the consumer fireworks needed for this Independence Day either didn't make it out of China, are sitting on ocean vessels in the Pacific Ocean waiting to berth at the ports, or they've been sitting at West Coast ports waiting to be put on the rail," Heckman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-year-of-pandemic-cancellations-americans-celebrate-july-4th-with-a-bang-101625393672432.html

Citing the data, Jenrick told Sky News that the country can move away from many of the restrictions which are underway in order to contain the virus."The data that we're seeing that the Prime Minister is reviewing at the moment ahead of his decision point on the roadmap looks very positive," Jenrick said. "It does seem as if we can now move forward and move to a much more permissive regime where we move away from many of those restrictions that have been so difficult for us,” he added.The United Kingdom is witnessing another surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant first detected in India. The surge had earlier prompted the government to extend the lockdown easing by four weeks when the country was reporting around 7000 new coronavirus disease cases per day.Also Read | Delta variant spreads to 98 nations, Europe struggles to ramp up vaccinationWhile there has not been a spike in virus-related deaths, Britain is currently reporting around 25,000 new confirmed Covid-19 cases daily. The UK, however, is counting on its vaccination coverage, which is among one of the highest in the world, to ease almost all restrictions from July 19. Almost half of the British population has been fully vaccinated, and about 66% of the population has been administered at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.The UK housing secretary indicated that the country is ready to move into a phase where there won’t be legal restrictions but individuals would “want to exercise a degree of personal responsibility and judgment.” “The prime minister will set out more detail on the national policy on some of those restrictions in the coming days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-data-looks-very-positive-for-lifting-lockdown-says-uk-minister-amid-delta-surge-101625389841844.html

It has now come to light that the aircraft, which is now part of the Philippines' worst military air disaster in nearly 30 years, was actually granted by the US government for heavy airlifting purposes.A government website announcement in January, reviewed by news agency Reuters, confirmed that the Lockheed Martin C-130H Hercules transport plane was one of the two aircraft granted by the US government through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The model, a workhorse for armed forces around the world, had first flown in 1988, according to the C-130.net website.Also Read | At least 17 feared dead after military plane crashes in Philippines: ReportThe Lockheed C-130 aircraft, of registration 5125, had only arrived in the Philippines recently. The website even quoted an air force spokesperson as saying the aircraft would provide enhanced capability for heavy airlift missions.This is not the first time that the Philippines armed forces have come under scrutiny for having a patchy record on air safety. A Black Hawk helicopter crashed only last month during a training mission, killing six people.Another C-130 aircraft of the Philippines Air Force had crashed back in 1993, killing 30 people. A 2008 crash by the civilian variant of the Lockheed plane flown by the Philippines Air Force killed 11 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network.However, the worst plane crash in the country's records took place in 2000, when the infamous Boeing 737 -- an aircraft that has come to the news recently for being part of several recent air disasters -- crashed, killing 131 people.The Sunday incident took place shortly before noon at the Bangkal village in the mountainous town of Patikul in the country's Sulu province, military officials said. As many as 40 people have been pulled out from underneath the burning wreckage, the government has said, confirming that the rescue operation is currently ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-plane-involved-in-worst-military-air-disaster-in-30-years-was-given-by-us-report-101625385920199.html

There is a fear that land disasters could occur even when the rain stops," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told ministers at an emergency meeting.NHK said on Sunday that at least seven other landslides had been reported across Japan."Landslides can occur again and again at the same place even if the rain stops. Residents and rescuers should remain on alert," Takeo Moriwaki, professor of geotechnical engineering at Hiroshima Institute of Technology, told AFP.Town disaster spokesman Hara said 387 residents had been evacuated, with survivors in face masks seen reading newspapers with images of the disaster on the front page.Residents in many other cities in Shizuoka have also been ordered to evacuate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rescuers-search-for-survivors-in-landslide-hit-japan-town-101625385153490.html
04-07-2021||World||US celebrates Fourth of July: 5 things that set America apart||The United States, a superpower and the most developed country in the world, will celebrate its 245th Independence Day on July 4. It commemorates the Declaration of Independence of the US in 1776. The Continental Congress had declared that year the 13 colonial colonies were free from British rule.Fourth of July is marked with several public and private events which celebrate the country’s history and traditions. Fireworks, carnivals, fairs are some of the common sights which are seen in every state and city. However, due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic which has killed 621,255 people and infected 34,588,176 till now, the celebrations are expected to be low-key.Here are some things which make the US unique:1. Pioneer of software and technologyThe United States has been a pioneer in the fields of technology and software innovation since the late 19th century. It is home to some of the biggest corporations such as Microsoft, Apple, IBM, AT&T, Google etc. Social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all brainchildren of the United States.2. The love for pizzaAmericans are known for consuming large quantities of fast food anywhere else in the world. However, a report by bestlifeonline.com said that Americans eat about 100 acres of pizza every day.3. The land of musical geniusesThe US has also produced some of the finest musical artists including the likes of the ‘King of Pop’ Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Eminem, Linkin Park, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey among others. Michael Jackson’s album Thriller, which was released in 1982, is one of the best selling albums of all time.4. SpaceThe United States is the only country in the world that has successfully sent astronauts to the moon. The Project Apollo, which was the country’s third spaceflight program conducted by Nasa from 1969-1972, saw six crewed landings. The first crew which landed on the moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.5. Cinema and entertainmentThe US is a global leader when it comes to movies, TV shows and other forms of entertainment.

04-07-2021||World||At least 17 feared dead after C-130 military plane crashes in Philippines: Report||A Philippine C-130 military plane carrying troops on board has crashed in the country's southern region, news agencies reported on Sunday morning, citing military officials familiar with the development. According to the New York Times, the officials said at least 17 people are feared dead in the crash.The aircraft, transporting armed forces from the southern Cagayan de Oro city, crashed after it missed a runway while attempting a landing on the island of Jolo, said the airforce in a statement.Referring to statements issued by Philippine military chief of staff General Cirilito Sobejana, news agencies reported that the crash-landing occurred shortly before noon in Bangkal village in the mountainous town of Patikul in the Sulu province.“It’s very unfortunate,” Sobejana told reporters. “The plane missed the runway and it was trying to regain power but failed and crashed.”As many as 40 people have been pulled out from underneath the burning wreckage, he said, confirming that the rescue operation is currently ongoing.However, there is no clarity yet on the exact number of passengers in the aircraft. The AFP news agency said the plane had been carrying 85 people, citing the army chief. But a Reuters report, quoting the country's defence minister Delfin Lorenzana, indicated that as many as 92 people -- including three pilots and five other crew members -- may have been on the military plane.A picture published by ABS-CBN News on Twitter showed smoke and flames pouring from the broken fuselage. The post credited Pondohan TV on Facebook for acquiring the photo from witnesses present at the site of the crash.Notably, the central Philippines region had been experiencing heavy rainfall over the week, but it was not immediately clear if the weather in the Sulu region was affected or if the erratic weather was the reason behind the crash.The airport in Sulu’s main town of Jolo is located a few kilometers from a mountainous area where government forces have been battling the Abu Sayyaf militants in the predominantly Muslim province for decades. Some militants were also said to have aligned themselves with the Islamic State group. The United States and the Philippines have separately blacklisted Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organisation for bombings, ransom kidnappings, and beheadings. It has been considerably weakened by years of government offensives but still remains a threat, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/military-plane-with-over-80-onboard-crashes-in-philippines-rescue-ops-on-101625376847787.html
04-07-2021||World||Canada eases entry restrictions from July 5||Canada will commence easing restrictions on those entering the country on Monday but those will only be applicable to certain categories of travellers like citizens and permanent residents. The requirement of isolating at a government-approved hotel for three days while results of a Covid-19 test on arrival are delivered, will be dropped for fully vaccinated individuals but only for the jabs approved by Health Canada.The new criteria will come into effect at 12.01am (Canada time) on Monday.“Fully vaccinated travellers allowed to enter Canada may be exempted from federal quarantine and day 8 testing starting July 5. Only vaccines approved by the Government of Canada will be accepted,” Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada tweeted on Saturday.“These changes are only applicable to fully vaccinated travellers who are currently eligible to enter Canada,” the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) said.As direct flights from India remain prohibited till July 21, those taking a connecting flight will have to provide the negative result of a valid test taken at the final point of departure to Canada.Health Canada has so far approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Astra Zeneca/Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. While Covishield, the AZ version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India is accepted, neither Covaxin from Bharat Biotech or Sputnik V from the Russian Gamaleya Center are, according to the latest update from Global Affairs Canada’s Travel section.While the Pennsylvania-based American firm Ocugen has partnered with Bharat Biotech to make Covaxin available in North America, and has entered into discussions with Health Canada for regulatory approval, that vaccine is yet to receive emergency use authorisation.The categories of travellers who will benefit from the new relaxations in rules include citizens, permanent residents, their immediate and extended family members, international students with a valid study permit at a designated learning institution with a Covid-19 readiness plan approved by its province or territory, and some temporary workers with a valid work permit, according to the CBSA.Restrictions will remain in place for those not fully vaccinated or vaccinated with a jab not authorised in Canada. Such travellers will have to complete the three-day quarantine at a hotel while awaiting results of their tests, submit to a second test on day eight of their arrival and complete the full 14-day period of self-isolation. Vaccination status will have to uploaded on the Canadian government’s ArriveCan app before reaching Canada. The app will be updated with the latest version on July 5 as the reduced public health measures come into effect.Travellers arriving in Canada will still have to provide a negative molecular test result taken within 72 hours prior to departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-eases-entry-restrictions-from-july-5-101625375281258.html

This comes as part of Beijing's plan to expand its extraterrestrial ambitions.Three spacemen blasted off in June, docking at the Tiangong station where they are to remain for three months in China's longest crewed mission to date. On Sunday morning, two of them exited the core cabin, said state broadcaster CCTV.One of the astronauts - Liu Boming, was transported via mechanical arm to a work site and the other - Tang Hongbo was moved by climbing on the outside of the cabin. Their mission involves elevating the panoramic camera outside the Tianhe core module, as well as verifying the robotic arm's transfer capability.Television footage showed the astronauts preparing for the spacewalk by donning gear and conducting health checks while exercising in the cabin. The astronauts were later shown opening the cabin door and exiting the module, in the first of two spacewalks planned for the mission, both expected to last six or seven hours. The crew underwent more than 6,000 hours of training for preparation.The launch of China's first crewed mission in nearly five years is a matter of huge prestige for the country, as Beijing marks the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party this month.The Chinese space agency is planning a total of 11 launches by the end of next year, including three more manned missions that will deliver two lab modules to expand the 70-tonne station, along with supplies and crew members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronauts-at-china-s-new-space-station-conduct-first-spacewalk-101625372998858.html

Here's how others are doing||Several countries in Asia, including India, have been struggling with mounting cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) even as the threat of the Delta variant is looming large over the continent as well as the entire world. The first case of infection from Delta was identified in India and now the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus is ringing alarm bells across Asia. The pace of Covid-19 vaccination, which experts say is one of the measures to tackle the pandemic, has been slow in the whole of Asia. Along with this, the risk of Delta variant is rising in the entire continent including India.World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that the world is witnessing a very “dangerous period” compounded by the rapid transmission of the Delta variant. The WHO chief said on Friday that the Delta variant has been detected in at least 98 countries and is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many of them. “Compounded by more transmissible variants, like Delta, which is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many countries, we are in a very dangerous period of this pandemic,” Ghebreyesus said during a press conference.Here are seven Asian countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic:1. India: In terms of Covid-19 cases, India has the most number of infections in Asia and the second-most in the world. So far, a total of 30.5 million people have contracted Covid-19 and more than 400,000 have died. There are currently 485,350 active cases of Covid-19 in the country and 29.6 million people have recovered. The recovery rate in the country has increased to 96.97%. The weekly positivity rate remains below 5 per cent. In terms of vaccination against Covid-19, so far more than 350 million doses have been administered in the country.The first case of the Delta Plus was found in India on June 11 and more than 50 cases of the variant have been reported in the country so far.2. Turkey: Turkey is the second-most affected country after India in Asia. So far, more than 543 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the country and 49,829 people have died. At present, there are 80,146 active cases and 530 million people have recovered from Covid-19. So far, 51.2 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been given in Turkey. Turkey banned flights and all direct travel from Bangladesh, Brazil, South Africa, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka recently in view of the danger of the Delta variant.Also read | Delta variant spreads to 98 nations, Europe struggles to ramp up vaccination3. Iran: Iran is battling the deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus in the region and has warned it could be hit by yet another wave of infections. "It is feared that we are on the way to a fifth wave throughout the country," President Hassan Rouhani told a meeting of Iran's anti-virus taskforce. He also warned people to be careful as "the Delta variant has spread" in southern provinces.The country has reported more than 3.2 million cases of Covid-19 and 84,516 people have died. There are currently 246,000 active cases of Covid-19 and more than 2.9 million people have recovered. So far 5.72 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in Iran.Also read | Who are 'highly protected' against Delta variant of Covid? ICMR study reveals4. Indonesia: The Delta variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly in Indonesia and the government has imposed a lockdown in many parts of the country till July 20. Indonesia is the fourth country in the continent of Asia, where corona cases have been found the most. Indonesia's tally to date stands at 2.25 million cases and 60,027 deaths -- making it one of Asia's worst-hit nations. Only about five per cent of the country's people have been fully vaccinated with two jabs so far.5. The Philippines: The Philippines government has said that so far no case of the Delta variant has been reported in the country. There are 142 million people who have contracted Covid-19 in the Philippines and 24,973 have died. There are more than 55,000 active cases in the country and 134.4 million people have been cured. So far, 10.7 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the country. The government has extended travel restrictions till July 15 for all people coming from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Also read | China urges nations to construct a ‘great wall' against Covid-196. Iraq: A slow pace of vaccination against Covid-19 has compounded the problems of the country, which has reported 1,340,000 people have been infected and of these, 17,256 have died since the start of its outbreak. There are currently 87,377 active cases in Iraq and 1,255,203 people have been cured so far. Only 805,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered in Iraq, which is is less than 2.5% of the 40 million of its population. Cases of the Delta variant are rising in Iraq.7. Pakistan: Pakistan is at number 7 in terms of Covid-19 cases in Asia and 961,085 people have been infected and 22,379 have died. There are currently 32,319 active cases in the country and 906,000 people have recovered from Covid-19. Pakistan has administered 16.3 million vaccine doses. Pakistan has also warned its citizens about the possibility of a fourth wave in view of the Delta variant. The first case of the delta variant was reported in Pakistan on May 28 and in the next week, the country saw more infections in travelers coming from the UAE. Recently, this variant was also found in people who have returned from other Gulf countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-asia-fears-of-third-wave-over-india-here-s-how-others-are-doing-101625373449167.html
04-07-2021||World||Strained ties with India, other nations lead to dip in China's weapon export: Report||China's rise as a super power has always been under global scrutiny. Many countries in the West, as well as smaller countries, have raised concerns about China's handling of issues. It is involved in a stalemate with the United States, particularly over the origin of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands across the globe.The cautious approach is what has led to various countries going slow with importing the weapons made by China, especially the fighter jets.According to a report in Foreign Policy, and quoted by news agency ANI, after last month's confrontation with the Philippines, where Chinese naval vessels entered Philippine waters without authorisation, few want to partner up with Beijing.China is involved in a border standoff with India in Ladakh, leading to deterioration of bilateral ties, said Foreign Policy. Though it has imported weapons from other countries, India won't consider China for the same, the magazine said. Ditto for Vietnam, with its worsening maritime dispute with China. Malaysia and Indonesia are also too wary of Beijing's ambitions to ever consider acquiring a Chinese fighter, reported Foreign Policy.A report released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) earlier this year said that India is increasingly becoming self-reliant under its Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, which is showing results.India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20, the Sipri report said. In the same period, China's exports fell 7.8%.The Foreign Policy article said that snazzy weapons mean a lot less if you don't have friends and this is why the world doesn't want Beijing's fighter jets, according to ANI.China has made great strides in improving its state-owned aerospace technology base, particularly in the military realm. It has made aircraft like J-10, J-10C and FC-31.But between 2000 and 2020, China exported just USD 7.2 billion worth of military aircraft, according to Sipri arms transfers database.The United States stayed safely on top, exporting USD 99.6 billion, and Russia stayed in the second slot at USD 61.5 billion. Even France's aircraft exports doubled China's, at USD 14.7 billion.The only country which is relying on China for weapons is Pakistan. Beijing accounted for 74% of Islamabad’s military imports during the last five years, up from 61% in 2011-15.The best explanation for this failure is China's foreign policy. The Philippines is a perfect illustration of why China's fighter export ambitions have stalled, the article in the magazine said.According to Foreign Policy, this pattern of failure speaks to more than just a problem with sharp elbows. First, it shows a lack of commercial soft power. Fighter sales often involve a trade relationship, since they tend to include commercial offsets - or economic sweeteners such as market access or technology transfer that are designed to mitigate some of the expense of a weapons package, the Foreign Policy article said.But China's relatively closed economic system means that potential customers with export-oriented economies have little to gain, since China wants to be a globally dominant export manufacturer and certainly doesn't want to increase its intake of imported manufactured goods.It has little interest in preserving the status quo in Asia, few qualms about territorial expansion, and next to no record of supporting allies in times of crisis, said Foreign Policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strained-ties-with-india-other-nations-see-dip-in-china-s-weapon-export-report-101625373178248.html

The World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Saturday the world is currently in a very dangerous period of the pandemic and the delta variant is continuing to evolve and mutate.The WHO, meanwhile, in its Weekly Epidemiological Update published on June 29 said that the recent surge in infections and hospitalisations in countries can be attributed to the delta variant. It (delta variant) is “expected to rapidly outcompete other variants and become the dominant variant over the coming months,” the WHO report added.In Europe, Portugal, Russia and the United Kingdom (UK) are witnessing a massive spike in daily cases due to the delta variant. The entire continent at present, is struggling to accelerate the vaccination drive and outpace the spread of the variant.While in the United States, the delta variant accounts for over one-fourth of the total active Covid-19 cases in the country. Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on July 1 the variant has the capability of spreading much more efficiently from person to person.Here are the latest updates:> Delta variant is increasing rapidly in Thailand’s capital Bangkok and accounts for 70 per cent of the new cases, a study by Chulalongkorn University’s Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology stated.> Portugal is seeing an extremely high increase in delta variant, which accounted for 4 per cent of cases in May but nearly 56 per cent last month, according to news agency AP. Daily cases jumped by 2,605 on Saturday, the highest single-day spike since mid February. The government is aiming to vaccinate 1.7 more million citizens as new cases are being reported more among the unvaccinated.> Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Saturday that the country will be hit by a fifth wave of the pandemic linked to the outbreak of the delta variant. Rouhani urged citizens to be careful as the variant has entered Iran from south and southeast.> The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said on Saturday the risk of infection from the delta variant is high to very high for those who are partially vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. By the end of August, the variant will account for 90 per cent of infections in 27 nations of the European Union, the ECDC added.> The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in its study that neutralising antibodies against the delta variant were not found in 58.1 per cent of the serum samples from those administered the first dose of the Covishield vaccine, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday. While after taking both the doses, the antibodies could not be found in 16.1 per cent of the samples(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-spreads-to-98-nations-europe-struggles-to-ramp-up-vaccination-101625369820127.html

Independence Day -- known colloquially as the Fourth of July -- is celebrated in the United States on July 4 annually. It marks the date in 1776 when the Second Continental Congress finally approved the US Declaration of Independence, marking the freedom of the thirteen American colonies from British colonial rule. The day is usually marked with a splendid display of fireworks, as citizens gather across several states to observe a pyrokinetic show in the night sky.Also Read | Fourth of July: With fireworks and parades, US celebrates Independence Day todayTo date, the largest of such displays has taken place in New York City, where more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics were held in the East River in 2009.At first glance, a grand display of fireworks may just seem like just another form of outdoor celebration, but the tradition holds a particular significance in the day's history. It was on July 3, 1776, that John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of the Nation, wrote to his wife Abigail that July 4 must be celebrated “with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forevermore.” Adams had set the tone for the Fourth of July celebrations a day before the US Declaration of Independence was even signed.It wasn't until a year later, however, that the first formal display of fireworks was set off. On July 4, 1777, the night sky in Philadelphia was illuminated with a brilliant display of pyrotechnics, in the spirit of John Adams' words. That same year, fireworks also lit up the sky in Boston. A 13-gunshot salute was held in Bristol, Rhode Island, once in the morning and then again in the evening, setting the tradition for years since.Today, firework displays are held on July 4 in many states during the evening after dark at places such as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares. However, several states have also either banned fireworks or limited the display size out of safety concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-independence-day-what-do-fireworks-symbolise-on-the-fourth-of-july-all-you-need-to-know-101625368233969.html

He criticised New York prosecutors for indicting his company, the Trump Organization, and his longtime financial adviser, Allen Weisselberg, in what he called "prosecutorial misconduct". The event will also feature a grand fireworks display to mark the occasion of the US Independence Day on July 4, news agencies reported.Also Read | Fourth of July: With fireworks and parades, US gears up for Independence Day"They've mobilized every power of government to come after me, my family, my wonderful employees, and my company solely because of politics," Trump told the crowd gathered at the rally.Notably, this is the former president's second "Save America" rally, the earlier being held in Ohio near the end of last month. There, Trump had dissed US president Joe Biden's performance as a "catastrophe" and criticised the current administration for the crime wave in major cities throughout the United States, the migrant crisis at the southern border with Mexico, and a dismal economic situation marred with high inflation.With the July 3 event, Trump repeated his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, Reuters reported. He urged his supporters to back his allies in their midterm campaigns as Republicans fight to take back control of Congress from the Democratic Party next year.Donald Trump reportedly plans to appeal to the anti-immigration sentiments running high in Republican party supporters in Florida, who flocked to the rally en masse even before noon on Saturday to hear the ex-president speak. "My father is a border patrol agent," said Phillippe Cruz, a Sarasota resident who turned up at the event, "He has lost many of his co-workers in the fight against the opioid epidemic on our borders." Cruz told a Sputnik correspondent that he fully supports Trump's policies on trying to stop illegal immigrants from "coming in and destroying our country with drugs, and illegal weapons".The correspondent reports that the crowd in Sarasota is, however, diverse and includes people of all ages and nationalities, including a lot of Latin American supporters of Donald Trump. The programme is an all-day event in support of the former president's signature "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) agenda and will celebrate the stated achievements of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-us-independence-day-trump-holds-save-america-rally-in-florida-101625365682616.html

This is the second consecutive time that Africa's most industrialised nation has registered record-breaking tally in the third wave of Covid-19.The surge in infection has stretched South Africa's health services to breaking point, with hospitals out of beds and medics to man them, and forced the government to impose partial lockdown restrictions.The number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in South Africa has surpassed two million-mark, and 61,500 people have died, the national Department of Health said. The government data also showed that 3.3 million people - about 5% of the population - has been vaccinated.More than 1.7 million people have recovered from Covid-19 in South Africa since the start of the outbreak.The low vaccination rate has resulted from a mixture of bad luck and bureaucratic failures. The government had to destroy 2 million contaminated Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses earlier this year, while efforts to replace them have run up against global supply bottlenecks.President Cyril Ramaphosa has criticised what he called global "vaccine apartheid," with rich countries with plentiful vaccine supplies hoarding them while poorer countries wait.To tackle this problem, South Africa on Saturday approved China's Sinovac vaccine against Covid-19, as growing evidence emerges of its effectiveness.The surge in infection in South Africa is driven by the delta variant of the coronavirus. This was indicated by the country's acting health minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane last week.The current resurgence could be worse than the second wave, the minister had said.The South African government is expecting that the peak of the third wave would surpass that of the second wave in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-registers-record-26-000-fresh-covid-19-cases-101625363846926.html

The Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining the decision of the thirteen colonies of Great Britain to declare themselves independent from colonial rule, was approved by the US Congress on July 4, 1776. However, the actual resolution of independence was passed two days earlier on July 2, when the thirteen colonies were legally separated from Great Britain's rule.Why is July 4 celebrated in the United States?The Fourth of July has been traditionally celebrated in the United States of America as 'Independence Day' since the same date in 1776 -- when the Second Continental Congress finally approved the US Declaration of Independence.The US Founding Fathers -- John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington -- were a group of seven key leaders who led the US war for independence and played a major role in the founding of the nation, uniting the thirteen colonies, on this day. They also built the structural framework of the new government based on classical liberal policies.Also Read | Fourth of July and the historical significance of a fireworks displayJuly 4, the day when the Declaration of Independence was approved, is now marked in the United States as 'Independence Day' with displays of patriotic fervour.

04-07-2021||World||On child soldier report, Turkey accused US of hypocrisy; Pak says 'factual error'||Turkey has accused the United State of "double standards and hypocrisy" after a report released by the state department highlighted Ankara was among 15 countries which use child soldiers. In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry completely rejected the claims.The report from the US state department was released on Friday and Turkey's rejection came later on the same day.Among the other nations mentioned on the list was Pakistan, which has also rejected the reacted strongly to the development. The foreign office said that the inclusion depicted a "factual error and understanding", and urged Washington to review the "baseless assertions" made against the country.Turkey, the first NATO ally to be placed in the list, pointed to American support for Syrian Kurdish militants. It cited a United Nations report that documented child recruitment and exploitation under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Turkey says Syrian Kurdish militants that provided the backbone of the SDF fighting the Islamic State group were linked to Kurdish fighters who have been waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than three decades and are designated as terrorists. American support for them has been a major irritant in US-Turkish relations.The US move could lead to sanctions on military assistance to countries mentioned in the list. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA) list has been coming out since 2010, and had highlighted six governments for the first time. The number has increased to 15 this year - the highest so far.Once a country is placed on the list, it is prohibited in the following US government programmes: International military education and training, foreign military financing, excess defence articles and peacekeeping operations. The CSPA also prohibits the issuance of licences for direct commercial sales of military equipment to such governments.Islamabad has said that no institution was consulted by the US prior to the publication of the report. Local media, carrying the statement of the Pakistan foreign office, reported that no details were provided of the basis on which the conclusion was reached.The foreign office statement emphasised that Pakistan neither supported any non-state armed group nor any entity recruiting or using child soldiers, saying "Pakistan's efforts in fighting non-state armed groups including terrorist entities are well-recognised."It maintained that Pakistan was committed to fighting "this scourge - both at the national and international levels".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-child-soldier-report-turkey-accused-us-of-hypocrisy-pak-says-factual-error-101625356766728.html

He said he asked US intelligence officials for a “deep dive” on what happened.“We’re not sure it’s the Russians,” Biden said. “I got a brief on the plane. The initial thinking was, it was not Russian government, but we’re not sure yet.”The timing of the attack is sensitive, just weeks after Biden implored Russian President Vladimir Putin to curb cyber crime.“I directed the intelligence community to give me a deep dive on what’s happened, and I’ll know better tomorrow, and if it is either knowledge of and/or consequences of Russia, I told Putin we will respond,” Biden said, adding that he hasn’t called the Russian president about the latest case.REvil, a Russia-linked group blamed for the May 30 ransomware attack of meatpacking giant JBS SA, is believed to be behind the hacks on at least 20 managed-service providers, which provide IT services to small- and medium-sized businesses.More than 1,000 businesses are affected and the number is expected to increase, according to the cybersecurity firm Huntress Labs Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-not-sure-if-russia-is-behind-latest-cyberattack-101625343602334.html

Kumar,38, is lodged alone in a cell inside jail number two because of a perceived threat to his life. Last month, Delhi police and central intelligence agencies informed prison authorities about the threat to Kumar’s life from a city gangster. Prisoners, who have a threat to their life or are a threat to others, are lodged alone in a cell, while others share space. Prisoners are also lodged in barracks.This is Kumar’s second request to jail officers since June 3, the day he was brought to the prison complex on judicial custody. Kumar has been arrested for the murder of fellow wrestler Sagar Dhankad inside Chhatrasal stadium. Last month, he wrote to the prison administration to provide him special food, exercise bands and diet supplements as he was a professional wrestler and was preparing for future events. Later, he moved a city court with the same request. This request was denied by jail officers and also the city court, which noted that the special food and supplements were “just wishes” and not essential items inside the prison.Commenting on Kumar’s latest request, a prison officer who asked not to be named said, “About 4-5 few days ago, he wrote a letter to the jail superintendent asking for a TV set. He said he wanted to keep himself updated about what was happening in the wrestling world. He said in his letter that he also wanted to watch news and monitor the developments in his case. He said that since he is lodged alone in the cell, a television set would also help him pass time inside.”The prison’s director general, Sandeep Goel, confirmed Kumar had made the request. “We are looking into it,” he said.To be sure, a television set is not a prohibited item inside prison. There are television sets inside cells for individual prisoners and inside barracks, where one television set is shared by many prisoners.Kumar’s counsel, advocate Pradeep Rana, said, “What is wrong with requesting a television? It is a legitimate request. Even petty criminals and big gangsters have a TV inside their cell. The courts have in the past allowed prisoners access to television. It is not a security threat and cannot be misused in any way. My client wants to know what is happening in the world and wants to keep himself updated. The jail authorities say they are considering the request but the truth is they are not.” Prisoners have in the past made demands that have surprised jail officers. In May 2019, Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the scrapped AgustaWestland helicopter deal, had complained about the quality of food he was getting in Tihar jail, blamed it for his weight loss and demanded “western food”. Michel reasoned that “western food” had less onion and spices. Delhi gangster Neeraj Bawana has in the past demanded home cooked food, an iPod and a radio.A second prison officer, who asked not to be named, said, “Sometimes prisoners come up with weird demands. A top Delhi industrialist who was arrested for fraud wrote to us last year requesting that a particular brand of spring water be allotted to him. He was not comfortable with the bottled mineral water available in the jail’s canteen, which prisoners can buy. There was a builder, jailed for fraud, who wanted perfumes for himself. He was very particular about the perfume. It was denied. He had to make do with perfume from the jail’s in-house perfume unit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murder-accused-olympian-sushil-kumar-asks-for-tv-in-jail-101625421543864.html

By an “Indian doctor”, I mean the entire medical community — all doctors, nurses and paramedics should be given the award, collectively,” CM Kejriwal said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.He added that this was the best way to pay homage to all the people who lost their lives while serving the nation while on Covid-19 duty.According to an estimate by the Indian Medical Association till late June, nearly 1,500 doctors in the country succumbed to the viral illness apart from a large number of other health care professionals. The Bharat Ratna award is conferred every year in recognition of exceptional service/performance without distinction of race, occupation, position, or gender in arts, literature, science, public services or any field of human endeavour.“What can be a better token of gratitude for them? If the current rules do not allow Bharat Ratna to be awarded to a community, then I urge you to tweak the rules. The entire country is grateful to doctors. If they are awarded Bharat Ratna, the whole nation will be pleased,” said Kejriwal in his letter, a copy of which HT has seen.A Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. IMA data shows that deaths of 798 doctors — over 53% out of the total 1,492 deaths so far — were recorded during the second wave. The highest number of fatalities among doctors was reported from Delhi (128), followed by Bihar (115) and Uttar Pradesh (79).The Kejriwal government has been providing ex-gratia compensation of ₹1 crore each to the families of front-line workers and doctors who lost their lives on Covid-19 duty. A Delhi government official said on condition of anonymity that 17 such grants have been made so far.On July 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation to mark the National Doctors’ Day and said hundreds of thousands of lives in the country were saved during the devastating pandemic due to the efforts of doctors and health care workers.

She was shocked and alarmed to learn about the recent security lapse by the noticee, making my client’s data open to exploitation,” the notice, sent through advocate Ashwini Kumar Dubey, read. Stating that the breach violated Handoo’s right to privacy, it added that this is guaranteed as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court.On May 21, Air India said its passenger service provider system, SITA, faced a “sophisticated” cyber-attack in February, resulting in the personal details of 45 lakh passengers being leaked. “The breach involved personal data registered between August 26, 2011, and February 20, 2021, with details that included name, date of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance and Air India frequent flyer data (but no passwords data were affected) as well as credit cards data,” the airline said in an email to its flyers.The breach was also acknowledged by SITA, which is based out of Geneva in Switzerland. “SITA confirms it was a victim of a cyber-attack leading to a data security incident involving certain passenger data that was stored on our Passenger Service System (US) Inc servers,” it said in a statement dated March 4, according to media reports.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-data-hack-delhi-journalist-seeks-rs-30-lakh-compensation-from-airline-101625418858898.html

The mangoes are a memento of the friendship between the two countries, Anupam Chakma, deputy commissioner of the Benapole customs house, told the Bangladeshi media.Mohammed Samiul Quader, the first secretary at Bangladesh’s deputy high commission in Kolkata, received the mangoes, which will be despatched to the prime minister in New Delhi and the chief minister.After the completion of customs and port formalities, the Bangladeshi truck carrying 260 cartons of mangoes crossed the border on Sunday afternoon. Several senior Bangladeshi officials, including the mayor of Benapole municipality, Ashraful Alam Liton, were present at the border.Reports in the Bangladeshi media said Hasina plans to send mangoes to the chief ministers of the northeastern states of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura, all of which share borders with Bangladesh. Last year, Bangladesh had given its traders special permission to export nearly 1,500 tonnes of Hilsa fish, a favourite with people on both sides of the border, to India on the occasion of Durga Puja. Mango diplomacy is part of the politics of the subcontinent but has been more common between India and Pakistan. Former dictators Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf and former interior minister Rehman Malik are among the Pakistani leaders who sent mangoes as gifts to the Indian leadership.The gift from Hasina comes at a time when there is growing disquiet on the Bangladeshi side over the halting of vaccine exports from India since late March. Under a commercial agreement signed with the Serum Institute of India, Bangladesh was to receive five million doses of Covishield each month during the first half of this year. About 1.5 million Bangladeshi nationals who have received the first dose of Covishield are still waiting for the second jab, and Dhaka has been forced to turn to Russian and Chinese firms for vaccines. Bangladesh is seen by India as a key part of the country’s “neighbourhood first” policy and in March this year, Dhaka was the destination for Modi’s first and only foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-pm-sends-2-600-kg-of-mangoes-for-pm-modi-bengal-cm-101625419085200.html

Though Yediyurappa made a fresh bid to resolve the issue, Tamil Nadu’s new chief minister urged him not to pursue the project.In his letter, Stalin said that the proposed Mekedatu project “would definitely jeopardize the availability of water to Tamil Nadu.” He contended that Karnataka’s view that the implementation of the project would not affect the interests of Tamil Nadu’s farming community cannot be agreed to. He said that the project would impound and divert the first component of uncontrolled flows coming in river Cauvery that is due to Tamil Nadu.Stalin noted that in the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, which has been modified by the Supreme Court of India, the three components contributing to the annual quantum of water to be delivered by Karnataka at the inter-State contact point have been clearly identified.Stalin said that Karnataka constructing “such a major reservoir”, which is too far away from Bengaluru “does not sound valid” by citing the reason of the top court allowing water to be drawn from the Cauvery river as drinking water for the capital city. He added that Karnataka already has adequate infrastructure to draw and meet the drinking water demand of Bengaluru, therefore, “the justification of the need for a reservoir with a storage capacity of 67.16 TMC to utilize 4.75 TMC as drinking water is not at all acceptable. This would definitely jeopardize the availability of water to Tamil Nadu.”Yediyurappa, in his letter on July 3, said that the project was in the interest of both states and urged Stalin not to oppose it. He also proposed a meeting to iron out differences. “In order to address issues, if any, it is suggested that a bilateral meeting could also be held in the presence of officials concerned to clear all apprehensions,” said Yediyurappa.“Karnataka will only take its share of water from the project and nothing more,” he had said. Stalin’s response didn’t address the proposed meeting but hoped for good cooperation and relationship to prevail between them.Stalin objected to Yediyurappa comparing the Mekedatu project with two hydropower projects undertaken by Tamil Nadu in the Cauvery basin -at Kundaha and Sillahalla- for which the latter said no consent was taken from them. “Let me clarify,” Stalin said, adding, “...there is no consumption of water in these two hydropower projects, with the available water being just re-circulated by pumping to meet peak power demand. Since there is no additional usage created, both the projects do not affect the availability of water for irrigation or drinking usage in Tamil Nadu. Hence, I wish to again emphasise that the comparison of such qualitatively different projects is not appropriate.”The 9000-crore project has been a non-starter and has been mired in litigation. Stalin said that the Supreme Court’s allotment of Tamil Nadu’s share of water hinges only on efficient water use but an increase in water use efficiency requires modernisation. “But unfortunately, the efficiency of irrigation in the Cauvery system in Tamil Nadu could not be improved much since litigation was on for long,” Stalin said. “Unless these works are carried out, it would be impossible for us to meet the water demand at the rate of supply stipulated in the order of the Hon’ble Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-pursue-mekedatu-project-stalin-tells-yediyurappa-101625416924314.html

Congress alleged that national security is not the government’s priority, unlike previous governments.Addressing a press conference, Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera said, “Every successive government has always prioritised and taken pride in our National Security Policy. Although the Modi government makes loud song and dance about national security, on the other hand, it does everything under the sun to undermine India’s security interests when it comes to filling the coffers of its corporate friends.”“Today, after more than 24 hours of the decision by France to investigate corruption”, “influence peddling”, “money laundering”, “favouritism”, there is one question every responsible Indian, every concerned citizen asks - Why is the Government of India still silent?” he added.Khera sought to know that now that the French Public Prosecution Services (PNF) has initiated a probe into the corruption allegations against the previous president of France, who was one of the parties to the deal, why is there no enquiry on the role of the key functionaries of the Indian government.“It is downright insulting to the people of India that this government and its ministers have stayed tight-lipped about this entire scandal. Why is the Minister of Defence silent on accountability and scrutiny?” he asked.He presented certain documents and said the amount decided for the deal by Indian negotiators was massively spiked and also alleged that the corruption clause mysteriously disappeared.Khera categorically claimed that India and Indians have been on the losing end of the Rafael deal. “This is not a loss to France, it is a loss to India. It is not France that has been cheated or robbed, rather it is every single Indian taxpayer who has been cheated and robbed off. This inter-governmental deal is not funded by the private funds of anyone, it is paid for by public money,” he said.Stressing on the importance of truth, the Congress spokesperson reiterated the party’s demand for a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the deal.The press conference came a day after the French national financial prosecutor announced an investigation into the Rafale deal. “A judicial probe into suspected corruption has been opened in France over the 7.8-billion-euro sale to India in 2016 of 36 Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft,” Mediapart, a French investigative website, reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-questions-govt-s-silence-after-french-authorities-order-probe-into-rafale-deal-101625415485496.html

There is no "ifs and buts" in politics and any decision regarding a patch-up between the two former allies will be taken depending on the situation, Fadnavis said, news agency PTI reported. "There are no ifs and buts in politics. Decisions are taken as per prevailing situations," Fadnavis said when he was asked about his recent meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah and whether the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance is coming back."Our friend contested the 2019 Assembly elections with us. But after polls, they joined hands with the very people (NCP and Congress) against whom we contested the polls," Fadnavis said.Fadnavis' comment comes on the same day Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the more such rumours of BJP and Sena leaders meeting secretly spread, the stronger the Maha Vikas Aghadi government becomes. Sanjat Raut was asked whether he met BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Saturday. "The more such rumours spread, the stronger the MVA alliance will become. We may have political and ideological differences, but if we come face-to-face at public functions, we will cordially greet each other. I have had coffee with Shelar openly," Raut said.The Congress -- a partner of the Sena, Congress, NCP alliance government-- has recently said that it will contest the future polls in the state alone, which has triggered speculations that the MVA alliance is going through uncertainty, though the state Congress leadership clarified that their support to Uddhav Thackeray government will not waver until the term comes to an end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-friend-shiv-sena-fadnavis-amid-speculations-of-crack-in-maha-vikash-aghadi-101625413894863.html

04-07-2021||India||‘Anyone who says Muslims should not live in India is not Hindu’: Mohan Bhagwat||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said there is a need to guard against fear-mongering that the Sangh is against minorities or that Islam is in danger in India.Speaking at a book launch event organised by the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, the Muslim wing of the RSS, Bhagwat said the Sangh has always believed that the DNA of the people of India is the same and that both Hindus and Muslims are one entity.“When people speak about the need for Hindu-Muslim unity, we say we are already one, we are not separate,” he said speaking at the launch of a book ‘The Meeting of Minds’ by Khwaja Ifteqar Ahmed in Ghaziabad.The RSS is the ideological fount of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has oftebeen accused by its opponents of fostering majoritarianism. Bhagwat, for his part, defended the Sangh’s work as that of uniting people of different faiths. He said such work cannot be left to political parties.He went on to say that political parties cannot act as tools to either help unite people or deepen the divide but can influence it. Allaying fears that a majoritarian sentiment is gaining ground in India, he said when atrocities take place against the minorities, voices in protest come from the majority itself. “If anyone says that Muslims should not stay in India then he is not a Hindu,” Bhagwat said.In the backdrop of instances of violence against minorities by alleged cow vigilantes, Bhagwat said that though cows are revered in India, violence in the name of cow protection cannot be condoned.“Law should take its course. They should investigate without partiality and punish the guilty. But anyone who is involved in lynching is not a Hindu,” he said.The RSS chief also sought to iron out the differences over the use of the word Hindu for members of other communities. In the past, Sikhs and Muslims have objected to him referring to all Indians as Hindus. “If you don’t want to call yourself Hindu, you can say Indian instead but we should all work for the country,” he said.Bhagwat also distanced the Sangh from electoral politics and said his presence at the launch of a book, that the author describes as a bridging initiative, should not be construed as an image makeover or an attempt to woo Muslims ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.“This is not an image makeover. The Sangh never cared for its image. We only work to unite all. Our resolve is to work for all and not against anyone. No matter what others think, we continue doing our work,” he said.He went on to add that his presence is not an attempt to get votes for the next elections. “We are not interested in party politics. We have a view but we are not in anyone’s favour but in the country’s favour. We support those who speak for the country. This is not a political exercise or vote bank politics. We can do this ( politics), but we won’t. There are some things that political parties cannot do,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-who-says-muslims-should-not-live-in-india-is-not-hindu-mohan-bhagwat-101625412723564.html

04-07-2021||India||Amid Kitex pull out threat, CM says Kerala is best||Amid the threat of textile major Kitex Group to pull out of the ₹3,500 crore project in Kerala, alleging witch-hunt by the state government agencies, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said Kerala is one of the most investor-friendly states and it is committed to sustainable and innovative enterprises.After Kitex Group’s announcement last week, many neighbouring states rolled out the red carpet to it and offered many SOPs. Though the state government started the firefighting, the firm said there is no going back on its decision as of now. After the controversy, many economists have pointed out that the state’s “so-called aversion to big industries” is one of the reasons for its growing unemployment and subsequent export of human resources. Later Harsh Goenka, chairman of the RPG Enterprises, praised the state saying it is one of the largest employers in Kerala and it got enough support from the state government. “We are the largest employers of Kerala. We find the local government very supportive,” he tweeted. The CM re-tweeted the industrialist profusely, thanking him. “Thank you for allaying apprehensions over the ease of doing business in Kerala. Your honesty is much appreciated. Kerala has been one of the most investor-friendly states and continues to be so. The LDF government ensures that sustainable and innovative industries grow here,” the CM tweeted. Later well-known business tycoon from the state MA Youseff Ali has also urged the Kitex Group to reconsider its decision. “The exit of the group will send bad signals. I requested both, Kitex and the government, to amicably all settle issues,” he said in Dubai. State industry minister P Rajeev reiterated that the government will look into all complaints of the firm and requested its chairman Sabu M Jacob not to take any hasty decision, which he said, will tarnish the state’s image. Kerala is ranked eighth in the country in ease of doing business. The announcement has rattled the government which is having uneasy ties with the firm after it ventured into politics in 2015 by floating a political party called ‘Twenty20.’ Kitex Group chairman Sabu M Jacob said there is no going back on his decision. “Almost everyday officials of the government department descend on the premises of the company and make inquiries as if we committed a big fraud. I am fed up with continuous harassment. The government treats us like bourgeoises, exploiter capitalists and land encroachers. Enough is enough,” he said, adding that he was firm on his decision. He said at least three dozen charges were slapped on him and his firm was in the state for the last three decades.Besides calling off the project which was signed in the 2020 investor meet in Kochi, he said he will also be shifting some of the existing units to other states if the situation continued like this. He said the plan was to open three apparel parks in Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad as part of the industrial corridor intended to give jobs to at least 35,000 people.

Reports have claimed that Finland and Latvia too have approved Covishield.Estonia has approved both Covishield and Covaxin.What was the controversy?The European Union has introduced the green pass, a concept of travel pass among the EU countries from July 1. It mentioned that people vaccinated with either of the four vaccines Comirnaty of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Vaxzervria by AstraZeneca-Oxford and, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen -- will be allowed to travel in EU countries. Since the name of Covishield was not mentioned on the list, while its equivalent Vaxzervria was mentioned, a row erupted apprehending that Indians vaccinated with Covishield and Covaxin will not be able to travel to European countries.Here are the facts> Indians, as of now, can't travel to many European countries as there is a travel ban.> The European Union clarified that the green pass is not for outside travellers.> Vaccine is not yet mandatory for international travel. Negative RT-PCR test report, followed by quarantine according to local rules, remain the standard of allowing outside travellers.> Serum Institute of India has said it has applied for EMA approval which is supposed to take about a month.> India has urged EU member nations to individually recognise Covishield and Covaxin and treat vaccinated Indians on par with those vaccinated in EU countries. This request comes with a diplomatic push that if Covishield and Covaxin are not recognised in EU countries, then people with EU vaccines will also not get quarantine exemption in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-and-covaxin-list-of-european-countries-which-recognise-these-covid-19-vaccines-101625408131295.html

Jitendra Singh, minister of state for DONER chaired the meeting of senior officials of all eight NE states including Sikkim and noted that the second Covid wave took a huge toll in the region before showing an overall declining trend since early June even as some pockets continue to cause concern. Assam, the most populous state in the region, saw a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in April soon after the assembly polls ended. Around 3,500-4,000 new cases and around 80-90 deaths were recorded daily in May on an average. The TPR also hovered between 8% and 9%. However, containment measures such as curfew and ban on inter-district movement since mid-May helped in bringing down the numbers. On Saturday, the state recorded 2,375 new cases and 28 deaths with the TPR at 1.77%. Assam still has over 23,000 active cases and the situation in districts such as Biswanath and Goalpara, which are under total lockdown, is still not completely under control. The state government is expected to announce new restrictions this week to tackle the situation. Till Sunday morning, 7.6 million Assam residents, including the 6.3 million who received the first dose and 1.3 million who received both the doses, were vaccinated. The plan to inoculate 300,000 persons daily and cover 9 million beneficiaries a month was hit by irregular supply of vaccines, said officials. On Saturday, Tripura extended curfew for a week in nine different places including the capital city in view of a spike in Covid-19 cases. On Saturday, 409 fresh cases and two deaths were recorded in the state. In June, the state saw over 13,000 new infections and 153 deaths with the TPR oscillating between 2.66% and 5.84% in the period. Till Saturday, 2.596 million vaccine doses were administered among eligible beneficiaries in the state. In Manipur, despite improvement in Covid 19 situation, the TPR remains high at 11.40%, much lower than 15.54% recorded a fortnight earlier on June 21.Director (health services) Dr K Rajo Singh said unlike the past, Manipur was well prepared in terms of ICU beds, hospitals beds and Covid care centres besides oxygen supply. ”At present, three oxygen plants including one at JNIMS hospital in Imphal and two at Thoubal and Churachandpur district hospitals are functioning while nine others are in the process of development,” said Dr Rajo. According to the Manipur health department, 330 people died due to Covid 19 in June which also saw active cases decline from 9,613 to 5,642 while 21,020 recoveries outpaced 18,544 new cases in June. While Nagaland has begun the unlock process this week with a gradual decline in Covid-19 cases that shot up in the early part of May, the weekly positivity rate of 7% continues to be above the 5% benchmark, set for easing lockdown restrictions, that were first clamped in the state on May 14.The improvement is evidenced in the 3,558 positive cases reported in June compared to the 7,704 recorded in May, as per the weekly Covid-19 bulletin. Majority of the cases in the state during the second wave were from urban and densely populated towns, particularly Dimapur, capital Kohima and Mokokchung. On July 2, Nagaland reported presence of 93 Delta variant cases among positive samples collected in April and May. “As all are aware that the Delta variant is more infectious, the public are advised to continue to strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccinate,” said Dr Neikhrielie Khimiao, principal director of the state health department. With 69 positive cases reported on Saturday, the state’s total caseload now stands at 25,451 including 1,253 active cases and 485 deaths recorded till date. As of Saturday, the state has administered 529,849 vaccine doses to residents, including 67,090 who have taken both the doses. In Arunachal Pradesh, 365 new cases were detected on Saturday, but thankfully no fresh deaths took place. The TPR for the state stood at 7.27% and there were 3,057 active cases at present. Till Saturday, 624,912 vaccine doses had been administered to residents including the 89,786, who had got both doses. Meghalaya was registering over 500 new cases in the past few days and the daily TPR was hovering around 12% -13%. In all, there were 14,187 new cases during the month of June as compared to 18,883 in May. East Khasi Hills district continues to the worst affected among the 12 districts with 4,948 positive cases registered last month, while East Jaiñtia Hills district is at the bottom of the table with only 372 positive cases. The vaccination drive has picked up pace in the state since mid-June after hesitancy in the initial months. Till Sunday morning, the state had administered over 733,000 doses. Though Mizoram has administered over 600,000 vaccine doses (nearly half the state’s population of 1.1 million), the state is witnessing over 200 new cases daily in the past few days and the TPR on Saturday was recorded at 6.75%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cases-in-northeast-declining-but-pockets-of-concern-remain-says-centre-101625398442455.html

Among the top tourist hotspots, Lahaul is attracting the maximum number of visitors due to the Atal Tunnel, which has made commuting to the scenic district easier. Kufri, Shimla, Narkanda, Dalhousie and Manali are also receiving large numbers of tourists from nearby states to escape the scorching heat.On Sunday, according to the local data, a record number of 6400 vehicles crossed the tunnel. "This was the highest single-day and highest till date arrivals," saidManav Verma, the superintendent of police of Lahaul-Spiti, PTI reported. Verma also said that 2001 vehicles crossed the tunnel on Friday.Occupancy in the hotels has also increased in the past few weeks. Shimla hotel and restaurant association president Sanjay Sood said the withdrawal of the condition of negative RTPCR report and e-Covid pass to enter Himachal Pradesh recently has given a boost to the tourism industry of the state, as per PTI report.However, it is yet to reach its peak of the pre-Covid era. "The occupancy in the hotels remains between 60 and 90 per cent during weekends, while on other days it remains around 40-45 per cent," Mohinder Seth, president of Tourism Industry Stakeholder Association, was quoted as saying by PTI.Budhi Prakash Thakur, a state convener of the forum of hotel and restaurant association, said, "The occupancy in hotels is dismal and figures hang around less than 25 per cent,” PTI reported.In Manali, Chamba and Dalhousie as well, the situation is similar but hoteliers are relieved that at least the number is picking up gradually after the massive slump in April and May. They are hoping that as a few months are still left until the summer season, the number of visitors may rise further. If the condition continues to be the same, the tourist influx would further increase, said Manoj Chadha of the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Dalhousie.The state is in the middle of the reopening process after almost two months of Covid-19 lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases. Earlier in June, it opened the state for travellers outside the state, since then endless rows of cars are being seen, bringing traffic to a standstill as people from the nearby states thronged Himachal.It also one of the few states where one does not require to have an RT-PCR negative report to cross the border, making it easier for people to travel.

A day before the Independence Day of 2015, the BJP leader had posted a map of India, which at that time might have escaped attention, but now as that BJP leader is going to be at the helms of affairs in Uttarakhand, Twitter users have started pointing out that the map has several things wrong.Here is the tweet, the screenshot of which is being shared on social media platforms now.pic.twitter.com/RJYPiaHBQGMany social media users have been quick to point out that the map is not a correct representation of India and it has no regard for international borders as well. The map of 'Akhand Bharat' tweeted by Dhami includes neighbouring countries while India's map is not correct as it does not show Ladakh and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, Twitter users said. The saffron map with a caption of "Akhand Bharat -- the dream of every Rshtrabhakt," has the image of Bharat Mata at its centre.Some social media users, on the other hand, came to defend the map and the tweet of Dhami claiming that Akhand Bharat is more of a cultural concept than a territorial one.Shouldn’t BJP be making this man Foreign Minister of India rather than CM of a tiny state like Uttarakhand?

Then, we can all move to 3rd World War."In the recent past, the government pulled up Twitter for carrying the wrong map of the country. Not only Twitter, but several international organisations had also drawn the ire of the government for misrepresenting India's borders.Pushkar Singh Dhami will be the third chief minister of the hill state since March as in quick succession the state saw the chair being shifted from Trivendra Singh Rawat to Tirath Singh Rawat and now to Pushkar Singh Dhami, who has never been a Cabinet minister but has been associated with the party, the RSS, ABVP for over three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-uttarakhand-chief-minister-pushkar-singh-dhami-s-2015-tweet-going-viral-now-101625389833148.html

04-07-2021||India||Monsoon not arriving in Delhi till July 7-8, predicts IMD||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday said although the national capital witnessed rain, the temperature will once again rise, adding that monsoon is not arriving till July 7-8."Though Delhi witnessed a brief spell of rain, the temperature will once again go up. Western disturbances have moved away and monsoon is not coming till July 7-8. Break or weak monsoon will continue in parts of country till July 8," said RK Jenamani senior scientist, IMD, reported news agency ANI.The IMD said last week that monsoon had weakened due to impact mid-latitude westerly winds that didn’t allow easterly winds to progress. It further said that there was the impact of unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) and absence of formation of low pressure system over North Bay of Bengal which helps monsoon progress and brings rain in its path.“Model forecasts show that easterly winds from Bay of Bengal in lower tropospheric levels are not likely to be established over north-western plains of India before July 7. Accordingly, further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab is not likely till July 7,” the statement added.“As predicted, monsoon enters into the break phase with little rains over the country and no signs of revival till July 7. Heavy rains could trigger floods over N-E and states like Bihar. Due to dry weather, temperature go up over NW India including Delhi with temperature higher than 40 Celsius,” tweeted M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-not-arriving-in-delhi-till-july-7-8-predicts-imd-101625386131336.html
04-07-2021||India||Karnataka-TN water dispute: A Ramadoss seeks action over Markandeya River dam||Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader Anbumani Ramadoss urged the Centre to take action against the Karnataka government for building a dam across the Markandeya River. A stir among the Tamil Nadu polity is brewing in this matter as many leaders have expressed the same demand, a Tamil language newspaper reported on Sunday.The former Union minister said in a statement that it is shocking to learn that Karnataka has constructed the dam across the Markandeya, the tributary of the Thenpennai which is the source of irrigation for five districts of Tamil Nadu, according to the Dina Thanthi. Karnataka has arbitrarily constructed the structure even when the dispute over the Thenpennai river is pending with the tribunal, he pointed out.Among its tributaries, the Markandeya River is the major water source of Thenpennai which originates in Karnataka but empties in the Bay of Bengal traversing through Tamil Nadu.Ramadoss said that though it originates in Karnataka, the distance the river traverses in that state is only 30 kilometres. The 165 feet tall dam constructed in the tributary will store up to 2 TMC water, he quoted experts. So, it is doubtful if the water from the tributary will ever reach the Thenpennai and thousands of hectares of agriculture in districts namely Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Cuddalore will be affected, he said.Anbumani also pointed out that the riparian rights of the Thenpennai River are under the agreement entered between the then Madras Presidency and the State of Mysore in 1892. Karnataka should get the approval of Tamil Nadu, the tail end-user of the river, before executing any major project over it. The arbitrary act of Karnataka constructing the river without Tamil Nadu’s approval is contempt of the tribunal, Anbumani contended. He urged the Tamil Nadu government to take up the issue with the Centre and demand action against Karnataka.In another article published in the Dina Thanthi on Sunday, the Communist Party of India’s state secretary Mutharasan also reiterated that Tamil Nadu should take up a legal battle against the Karnataka government for constructing the dam across the Markandeya river. Meanwhile, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s general secretary Vaiko has slammed the previous AIADMK government’s lackadaisical approach towards the issue which paved way for the construction of the dam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakatn-water-dispute-a-ramadoss-seeks-action-over-markandeya-river-dam-101625385181483.html

04-07-2021||India||2, including Kerala man, arrested at Chennai airport for visiting Yemen: Report||Two men, including one from Kerala's Malappuram district, have been arrested at Chennai airport after they returned from Yemen, one of the countries Indian citizens cannot travel to, a Tamil language newspaper reported on Sunday. Dinamalar reported that the arrested men were identified as 38-year-old Sameer from Malappuram and 33-year-old Feroz Khan from Pudukottai district of Tamil Nadu. The men told the officials that they travelled from Yemen to return to India after their Saudi Arabian visas expired, according to the newspaper.Sameer and Khan, who left for Saudi Arabia five years ago, worked as drivers in that country. They were staying illegally in Saudi Arabia after their work visas expired two years ago. When they realised they could land in trouble if they are caught by the country’s officials since the punishment for illegal stay in Saudi Arabia is very severe, they fled to Yemen, Dinamalar reported.They decided to come back to India from Yemen and approached the Indian embassy. They filed a complaint saying that they have lost their passports and with the help of local agents, they obtained the emergency certificate from the Indian embassy. Using the emergency certificate, they traveled from the Yemeni city of Sanaa to Sharjah from where they boarded a flight to India, Dinamalar reported.As immigration officials screened their documents, they realised the men traveled through Yemen to come back to India. The men were later handed over to the airport police for further investigation.India has banned citizens from going to Yemen since 2016. The travel advisory issued by the ministry of external affairs on April 1, 2016, warned that the security situation is very fragile in Yemen. The advisory came after an Indian nun was killed and a priest was abducted by extremists in Yemen. The government later imposed a stricter warning saying any Indian citizen who ignores the travel ban and travels to Yemen shall be accountable for the action under Section 12 of the Passports Act, 1967.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-including-kerala-man-arrested-at-chennai-airport-for-visiting-yemen-report-101625384393192.html

04-07-2021||India||‘National security only a slogan for them’: Cong slams Centre over Rafale deal||The Congress party, which has been the strongest critic of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government over the deal with French manufacturer Dassault Aviation to purchase Rafale jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF), said on Sunday that national security is only a slogan for the Centre.Addressing a press conference, Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera said, “Post-Independence, all central governments have regarded national security as a serious issue and have refrained from politicising it. The Modi government has too said that national security is paramount and there should be no compromise. However, when it comes to filling the pockets of their industrialist friends, their (Modi government’s) priority for the past seven years is crony capitalism. When it comes to filling their (industrialist friends) pockets, national security becomes a form of sloganeering for them (Centre).”Noting that France launched an investigation into the Rafale deal to find out if there was corruption, Khera said why the Indian government was still silent "even after 24 hours have passed".“There has been no response from the Centre till now. What was Rafale? It was an inter-governmental deal. France has launched an investigation. On the other hand, forget about investigation, the Indian government has not even given one comment. And this is the government which is only known for talking. The Prime Minister, defence minister and other members of the Cabinet are silent,” the Congress leader further said, adding the echo of this silence is being heard across the world.Khera also pointed out that France, who received the money and benefited from the deal, has launched an inquiry but the Indian government, which paid the money and suffered loss, has not done anything yet.He presented certain documents and said the amount decided for the deal by Indian negotiators massively spiked and also alleged the corruption clause mysteriously disappeared.Khera’s comments on Sunday came just a day after the Congress party demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the deal on Saturday. It said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should order the probe and also come clean on the deal.The French national financial prosecutor on Saturday announced that a judge has been appointed to investigate suspicions of corruption in the Rafale, according to French investigative website Mediapart.“A judicial probe into suspected corruption has been opened in France over the 7.8-billion-euro sale to India in 2016 of 36 Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft,” Mediapart said, adding the probe has been initiated by the national financial prosecutors’ office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-security-only-a-slogan-for-them-cong-slams-centre-over-rafale-deal-101625381160725.html
04-07-2021||India||Vaccinating adults will be key to prevent Covid-19 infection in schools: Study||A study has said that people living with more adults in their households are at increased risk of contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Scottish study further said that living with children was not a risk factor.Vaccinating adults, parents and school staff will thus be key to prevent coronavirus infections in children and schools, news agency PTI reported quoting the study.There has been research earlier which said that Covid-19 is less severe in children and adolescents and most have mild infections or are asymptomatic.The new study said that given the increased risk in children with underlying health issues, there may be benefits to vaccinating these children over 12. But as increasing age is the biggest risk factor for severe disease, vaccinating older people should remain the priority.Are Covid-19 vaccines safe for kids?The study further said that common side-effects seen in a clinical trial of the Pfizer vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds included injection site pain (up to 86 per cent of participants), fatigue (up to 66 per cent) and headache (up to 65 per cent). These were mild to moderate in severity and short-lived.However, two more serious, related conditions - myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining) - have been identified in safety surveillance in the United States, Canada and Israel following mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna).The highest rates are in men under 25 after the second dose. Based on US data up to June 11, for boys aged 12-17, the rate was 66.7 cases per million second doses.Outbreaks in schoolsThe extreme effect on children and adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic has been the impact of school closures on learning, socialisation and emotional development, especially in children with special needs or mental health issues, said the study.The US and Canada are vaccinating adolescents partly to build confidence for returning to school, it added.Do we need to vaccinate children and teenagers to control Covid-19?The study says vaccinating large numbers of adults will prevent deaths and serious illness and therefore reduce the burden on health systems. But many countries are also aiming to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinating-adults-will-be-key-to-prevent-covid-19-infection-in-schools-study-101625380355491.html
04-07-2021||India||Petrol and diesel rates hiked on Sunday, over 10% jump in 2 months||Auto fuel rates rallied on Sunday as state-run oil companies raised petrol prices by 35 paise and diesel by 18 paise a litre in the 34th hike in two months, making the two fuels costlier by over 10% since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared. Retail rates of auto fuels moved almost in tandem with international oil prices since May 4 resulting in 10.07% ( ₹9.11 per litre) jump in petrol and 10.68% ( ₹8.63 a litre) in diesel prices, while benchmark Brent crude surged 10.58% in the two-month period at $76.17 a barrel on Friday close. With the latest hike, petrol rates in Delhi and Kolkata have inched closer to the ₹100 a litre mark at ₹99.51 and ₹99.45 per litre respectively. New rates of diesel in Delhi and Kolkata are ₹89.36 per litre and ₹92.27 respectively. While fuel rates of state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Petrol has, however, crossed the ₹100 mark in three metros -- Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. The financial capital on Sunday priced petrol at ₹105.58 per litre and diesel at ₹96.91. The highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar where pumps are selling petrol at ₹110.77 per litre and diesel at ₹102.60 a litre. Petrol rates have crossed ₹100/litre mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and UTs of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali and Darjeeling. Surging international oil rates and the domestic taxes are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps. Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with respective international benchmarks of the previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. International oil prices rally continued on Friday after producers’ cartel – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) – on Thursday decided to restore less than expected supply even as global oil demand is growing. Brent crude surged 1.6% at $75.84 a barrel on Thursday and further gained 0.44% in the next trading session to close at $76.17 on Friday, the highest since October 2018. Domestic taxes are the other reason for high prices of auto fuels in the country. In Delhi, central levies account for 33.29% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.07%, according to an official data of July 1. On diesel, central taxes are over 35.66% while state taxes are about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic. According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers such as Indian Oil Company (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-and-diesel-rates-hiked-on-sunday-over-10-jump-in-2-months-101625381762083.html

He said this would be the true tribute to those doctors who lost their lives."This year "Indian doctor" should get Bharat Ratna. And by “Indian Doctor” I mean all doctors, nurses and paramedics. This will be a true tribute to the martyred doctors. And an honour for those who serve without worrying about their life and family. The whole country will be happy with this," Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet posted in Hindi on Sunday.इस वर्ष “भारतीय डॉक्टर” को भारत रत्न मिलना चाहिए। “भारतीय डॉक्टर” मतलब सभी डॉक्टर, नर्स और पैरामेडिकशहीद हुए डाक्टर्ज़ को ये सच्ची श्रद्धांजली होगी। अपनी जान और परिवार की चिंता किए बिना सेवा करने वालों का ये सम्मान होगा।पूरा देश इस से खुश होगाPrime Minister Narendra Modi too had hailed the contribution of doctors in saving people's lives from Covid-19. "Losing the life of even one person is very saddening but India has also saved the lives of lakhs of its people from coronavirus. A big credit for it goes to our hard working doctors, healthcare workers and front line workers," he had said while addressing an event of the Indian Medical Association event (IMA) on National Doctors' Day on July 1.Noting that coronavirus is new and is mutating, the Prime Minister said India's doctors, with their knowledge and experience, are fighting the challenges posed by the virus.According to the IMA, nearly 800 doctors died during the second wave of Covid-19 across the country, out of which 128 - the highest - lost their lives in Delhi, followed by Bihar at 115.States like Maharashtra and Kerala where the prevalence of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 is on a rise also reported deaths of doctors in double digits. Maharashtra reported 23 doctor deaths and Kerala reported 24 deaths, according to IMA data.Puducherry has so far reported the lowest fatality count of doctors by logging one death only, the IMA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/real-tribute-kejriwal-demands-bharat-ratna-for-doctors-who-fought-covid19-101625379864857.html

The administration rejected the request by Hibi Eden and TN Prathapan for an entry permit, stating that their visit might "disturb" the peaceful atmosphere. The administration also said that the visit might cause a surge in Covid-19 cases."The proposed visit of MPs from Kerala to Lakshadweep is likely to cause unrest in the islands as the political parties and leaders from the mainland have been making attempts to instigate local people, political parties/activists, social workers and people from different walks of life to oppose all administrative actions and to agitate against the Administration," said Lakshadweep additional district magistrate S Asker Ali in the order.Eden and Prathapan have said they want to visit the Union territory to "understand problems faced by islanders due to new policies of the administration."Earlier, the administration also denied entry for left MPs on the ground of the Covid situation.Lakshadweep witnessed protests after its administrator Praful Khoda Patel gave a slew of orders changing certain laws in the Union territory, sparking outrage within the islanders. The critics say that the orders are against the interest of the islanders and fear that the measures will dilute the unique culture of the Lakshadweep.People are also protesting against the draft legislation like Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act), which they think is not required for the Lakshadweep considering it has the lowest crime rate in the country. They are also against the Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, and Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 among others. The Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF) said that the protests will continue until the administration withdraws the measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-denies-entry-to-congress-mps-says-visit-may-cause-unrest-101625379807175.html
04-07-2021||India||UP assembly polls: Yogi Adityanath accepts Owaisi's 'challenge', says BJP will win over 300 seats||Referring to All India Majlis-e-Ittahadul Muslimeen's stake to contest the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accepts AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi's "challenge". Putting his own two cents on the matter, CM Yogi said that there is "no doubt" that the BJP will form government in the state after winning "more than 300 seats" in the assembly polls next year."Asaduddin Owaisi is a big leader of our nation. If he has challenged BJP for the 2022 Assembly elections, then BJP's worker accepts his Asaduddin Owaisi challenge," Yogi told news agency ANI in an interview. "There is no doubt that BJP will form government in Uttar Pradesh in 2022."For context, the road to election campaigning has picked up in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the assembly polls next year. AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi had said last month that his party will field candidates on as many as 100 seats in the state for the 2022 assembly elections. Owaisi's party is set to contest the elections along with the Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and other smaller parties, under the alliance banner of Sankalp Morcha.Notably, BJP won 67 out of the 75 district panchayat chairperson seats in the recently conducted Uttar Pradesh Zila Panchayat elections. The party's win has strengthened the confidence of its members ahead of the state assembly elections. Yogi Adityanath on Saturday thanked all the BJP party workers in the state and vowed to win the 2022 assembly polls in a similar fashion. "We will win more than 300 seats," the UP CM was quoted as saying.Shortly after the UP zila panchayat elections were out, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the party's state unit for the victory and recognised Yogi Adityanath as the key figure behind the party's spectacular performance. He also said that the results were a blessing given by the people for development, public service, and rule of law.Acknowledging the Prime Minister's comments, UP CM Yogi Adityanath said on Saturday that the BJP's "fruitful results" in the UP zila panchayat polls were a result of the guidance of PM Modi, BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah. "BJP won the 2014 General elections, 2017 Assembly elections, 2019 Lok Sabha elections and will claim victory in the 2022 Assembly elections," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-assembly-polls-cm-yogi-accepts-owaisi-s-challenge-says-bjp-will-form-govt-101625374052159.html
04-07-2021||India||Swami Vivekananda death anniversary: Tributes pour in for one of India’s finest minds||Every year, July 4 is observed as the death anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, who is regarded as a one of the finest spiritual leaders and intellects India has produced. Vivekananda played an important role in introducing the philosophies of yoga and Vedanta to the West. He is best known for his speech at the World Parliament of Religion in Chicago in 1893 which started with the opening remarks, “My brothers and sisters of America.”Vivekananda has been credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to a global platform in the 19th century. He is also known for his deep knowledge in science and religion. His teachings to the Western world demonstrated how the two could co-exist in harmony.He was born on January 12, 1863 in a Bengali family and was originally named Narendranath Datta. His father was Vishwanath Datta, an attorney at the Calcutta high court while his mother, Bhubaneswari Devi was a housewife. From a very young age, Vivekananda was interested in spirituality and would meditate in front of the images of Hindu Gods and Goddesses.Here are some of the memorable quotes of Swami Vivekananda which are relevant even in today’s world:> “You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul.”> “In a day, when you don’t come across any problems - you can be sure that you are travelling in a wrong path.”> “Arise, awake, stop not till the goal is reached.”> “Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced.”> “The fire that warms us can also consume us; it is not the fault of the fire.”On Sunday, tributes started pouring in for Swami Vivekananda from public and political spheres. Using #SwamiVivekananda on social media handles, people spoke about his teachings, his life and his ideals.The life, ideals and teachings of #SwamiVivekananda fascinated me right from my young days. I feel everyone should read about him to have peace and bring positive change in life. Paying homage to the great son of Bharat Mata on his punnyatithi. @vkendra pic.twitter.com/J1xyYv8mpaAssam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted that everyone should read about Vivekananda to have peace and bring positive change in life. “The life, ideals and teachings of #SwamiVivekananda fascinated me right from my young days. I feel everyone should read about him to have peace and bring positive change in life. Paying homage to the great son of Bharat Mata on his punyatithi,” Sarma wrote on Twitter.On this day in 1902, Swami Vivekananda attained Mahasamadhi.We shall forever remain indebted to him for his teachings on individual freedom, social equality and justice into the Indian ethos.

04-07-2021||India||Complaint filed against Twitter India, MD Manish Maheshwari for 'spreading communal hatred'||Microblogging website Twitter, which is already facing problems in India over various issues, is now in fresh trouble. A complaint has been filed with the Delhi Police's cyber cell against Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari for allegedly spreading communal hatred.A non-profit organisation has also been named in the complaint, news agency ANI reported. It has been filed by an advocate Aditya Singh Deshwal, according to ANI.The complainant has flagged a picture of Goddess Kali shared by the handle Atheist Republic and said that content posted by the Twitter users was not only abusive but has been posted for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred and ill will in society."It would also be not out of place to mention here that these posts have been put by the said user deliberately, to outrage the religious feelings of Hindus to insult our religious beliefs," the advocate said.He has asked registration of an FIR against Twitter Communications India Prviate Ltd, Manish Maheshwari, MD, Twitter India, Shagufta Kamran, Public Policy manager of Twitter India as well as Armin Navabi and Susanna Macintrye, the founder and CEO respectively of Republic Atheist.Deshwal accused Twitter of showing blasphemous content from July 2011, in connivance with Armin Navab and Atheist Republic. He further said that the profile of Atheist Republic is full of such blasphemous content about Hindu Religion and other religions."Twitter on the other hand, as a Significant Social Media Intermediary (SSMN) has taken no steps to remove such content but in a blatant violation of Indian laws has been acting as an accomplice to the crime and showing such blasphemous and insulting content," the advocate's complaint said.He accused Twitter of violating the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 in the light of section 79 of Information Technology Act, 2000. Deshwal said that Maheshwari and and Kamran deliberately did not take any action to remove such objectionable content from the microblogging website.Twitter is involved in a legal tussle with the Indian government, which has accused the US company of not following the new IT rules enacted by the Centre in May this year. The accounts of Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, and Union ministers and ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders faced trouble, leading to escalation of the standoff.While the accounts of all these leaders are now functioning normally, the government has said that Twitter is not complying with the provisions of the new Indian act.

The sessions will be conducted in every district of Uttar Pradesh till July 10 and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi will address the local leaders virtually, the above leader added.From today, a two-day training camp is being held for block presidents of Agra and Kanpur divisions. Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid will be inaugurating the camps, former MLA Pradeep Mathur told news agency PTI, adding people from Chhattisgarh have been roped in to train the block presidents of Agra and Kanpur.It is being observed that these camps are crucial for the Congress, which in recent years, has seen the exit of many prominent leaders, the latest one being Jitin Prasada, who jumped ship to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on June 9 this year ahead of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.On July 2, Priyanka Gandhi was addressing training camps at Sultanpur and Allahabad districts through video conferencing, where she urged party leaders to start preparing for the assembly elections and said their views with regard to strengthening the Congress will be taken into account while preparing the manifesto. Gandhi also said that apart from strengthening the booth-level organisation, remaining active on social media was also important.“The manner in which Congressmen worked during the coronavirus pandemic for delivering oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, medical kits, ration kits, among others, from village to village, to migrant workers and others, shows the party’s concern for the public,” Gandhi said during the training programs, according to PTI.She also told the local leaders that they will have to stand with the citizens and share their problems related to inflation, unemployment and steep price rise of petroleum products.(With ANI, PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-poll-prep-cong-to-hold-training-camps-for-block-presidents-in-agra-kanpur-101625362041830.html
04-07-2021||India||How dangerous will 3rd wave of Covid-19 be? Scientist on govt panel explains||A scientist, who is part of a government panel, has said that a possible third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can hit its peak between October-November if Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed. The panel is tasked with modelling of Covid-19 cases.The scientist, Professor Manindra Agarwal, who is working with the Sutra Model, the mathematical projection of the Covid-19 trajectory, said that the third wave may see half the daily cases recorded during the second surge.He, however, warned that if a new virulent strain emerges, the infection can spread faster during the third wave."We have created three scenarios. One is optimistic one. In this, we assume that life goes back to normal by August, and there is no new mutant. Second is intermediate one. In this we assume that vaccination is 20% less effective in addition to optimistic scenario assumptions," Professor Agarwal said in one of the tweets he posted on the issue."Third is pessimistic one. This has one assumption different from intermediate one: a new, 25% more infectious mutant spreads in August (it is not delta+, which is not more infectious than delta)," he added in the series of tweets.Here are plots for the three scenarios. Blue curve is actual data. Orange one is model prediction until May. Dotted curves are three scenarios plotted from June. pic.twitter.com/yDeLnp2rQfProfessor Agarwal then posted the bottom line: "If there is no significantly faster spreading mutant, third wave will be a ripple. And if there is such a mutant, third wave will be comparable to first one. However, if there is an immunity-escape mutant, all the above scenarios will be invalid!"The government panel, of which Professor Agarwal is a part, was formed by the Department of Science and Technology last year to forecast the surge of coronavirus cases using mathematical models. M Vidyasagar, another scientist with IIT-Hyderabad, and Lt. Gen Madhuri Kanitkar, Deputy Chief (Medical) of Integrated Defence Staff, are the other members of the panel.It was in the eye of the storm for not predicting the ferocity of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country, which wreaked havoc in the months of March and April. On May 7, India had recorded 4,14,188 Covid-19 cases, the highest during the second wave.Professor Agarwal, who works with IIT-Kanpur, said while replying to a Twitter user that India is in a better position than the United Kingdom because the second wave was caused by delta. "So a lot of people are now immune against delta unlike UK," he said in the reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-dangerous-third-wave-of-covid-19-will-be-scientist-on-govt-panel-explains-101625361039842.html

Horticulturists make it possible in UP||An experiment by the horticulturists has given a mango tree in Uttar Pradesh the ability to grow different varieties of the fruit. In fact, the popular tree in Saharanpur has 121 varieties of the fruit growing on it.The 15-year-old tree has become an attraction in the area and produces Dussehri, Langra, Chaunsa, Ramkela, Amrapali, Saharanpur Arun, Saharanpur Varun, Saharanpur Saurabh, Saharanpur Gaurav, and the local Saharanpur Rajiv.The horticulturists have been conducting experiments for the past five years. They wanted to develop new varieties of mangoes and experiment with their taste."The purpose of the experiment was to research new varieties of mangoes. Saharanpur is already a leading name in mango production. Mango horticulture is done extensively in the fruit belt of the district. Due to which research has also been done on new varieties of mango here," Bhanu Prakash Ram, Joint Director, Horticulture and Training Centre, Saharanpur, told news agency ANI.He said that the unique experiment was carried out in the Company Bagh area five years ago."We are working on new species so that better varieties of mangoes can be produced. People can also use this technique," Ram was further quoted as saying by ANI.Explaining the experiment, Ram said that branches of different types of mangoes were planted on the branches of the native mango tree. The department appointed a separate nursery in-charge to look after the tree, according to Ram.Apart from the above mentioned varieties, Lucknow Safeda, Pusa Surya, Rataul, Kalmi Maldah Mango, Bombay, Smith, Mangifera Jalonia, Gola Bulandshahr, Laranku, LR Special, Alampur Benisha and Asojia Deoband are also growing on the tree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/121-mango-varieties-on-a-single-tree-horticulturists-make-it-possible-in-up-101625359296791.html

He told reporters on Saturday that the meeting will involve 150 Muslim intellectuals."During last 1 month, I met both fractions of All Assam Minority Students' Union and everybody has said that population is a problem and we need to resolve it. In Assam, there is no controversy," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."They (outside people) don't understand seriousness of situation and create controversy merely because BJP CM has said this.

Farooq Abdullah may take a call today||The Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (NC) -- a member of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) -- may on Sunday take a call on the party's participation in the proceedings of the Delimitation Commission, tasked to carve out new constituencies in the Union territory. News agency PTI reported, citing an unnamed NC leader, that the final decision regarding this rests with party president Farooq Abdullah, who will soon be conveying the official party line.“The NC president will take the final call on the issue most likely tomorrow as he has been authorised by the party. He may then announce the decision himself,” the leader told the news agency a day ago.The Delimitation Commission will be visiting the Union territory next week, for which it has invited leaders of all national, regional, and registered political parties of J&K for separate meetings. The commission, which has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise of carving out new constituencies, will also reserve separate constituencies for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the first time in J&K.Also Read | Delimitation Commission to visit J&K, meet partiesThe National Conference held an internal meeting on Saturday over the question of participating in the Delimitation Commission proceedings, the party leader said. “The meetings took place today where the issue of the participation in the exercise was discussed," PTI quoted the NC leader, without naming him. "The party leaders gave their inputs and those inputs will be shared with the party high command.”The two meetings over participation in commission proceedings were held at the National Conference headquarters in Srinagar, under the chairmanship of Ali Mohammad Sagar, the party's general secretary, and Nasir Aslam Wani, the provincial party president of Kashmir. Suggestions regarding the matter were taken from all the party leaders and later conveyed to NC president Farooq Abdullah, the leader said.Also Read | Political parties in a quandary over meeting delimitation panelThe Delimitation Commission, which was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of J&K, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland, is headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai.

04-07-2021||India||Delta variant: No antibodies in 16% after second dose of Covishield, says study||Neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant (B1.617.2) were not observed in 58.1% of serum samples from those given one shot of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India as Covishield, according to a yet-to-be peer reviewed study by researchers from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).After two doses, the neutralising antibodies could not be detected in 16.1% of the samples, the study found. Additionally, the researchers saw that a prior infection along with vaccination produced much higher titres of neutralising antibodies.“Not observed is not equivalent to not present. The levels of neutralising antibodies could be significantly low that it did not get detected, but it may still be there and protect the person against infection and severe disease. Also, there would be some cell mediated protective immunity as well that can protect against infection and severe disease,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of microbiology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe titres of the neutralising antibodies – that specifically target the Sars-CoV-2 virus and kill it or prevent it from entering human cells – were also lower against the Delta variant as compared to the B1 variant that led to the first wave of infections in India. As compared to B1, the neutralising antibody titres against the Delta variant were 78% less in those who received one shot, 69% in those who received two shots, 66% in those who had the infection and received one shot, and 38% in those who had the infection and received both shots.What the study means for India’s vaccination drive is that some might require an additional booster shot of Covishield while those who have had the infection may require just one.“Assuming that the serum used for the study was from healthy individuals, the proportion of individuals with unobserved levels of neutralising antibodies will be higher among those who are old, comorbid, have chronic diseases as their immune response is lower. What this means is that men (women produce higher levels of antibodies) over the age of 65 years, those with diabetes, hypertension, chronic heart, lung, kidney diseases, or who are undergoing treatment for cancer should be given a third dose,” said Dr Jacob John.He added, “On the other hand, one dose is more than enough for an immune response in those who have had the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-variant-no-antibodies-in-16-even-after-second-dose-of-covishield-101625349161190.html
04-07-2021||India||Rafale row resurfaces as Congress demands JPC probe||The Congress on Saturday claimed it has been vindicated after French online journal Mediapart reported that a judge in France will probe into suspected “corruption and favouritism” in the ₹59,000 crore Rafale deal with India for 36 fighter jets.The BJP, however, played down the appointment of the judge in France to lead a judicial investigation, saying the development was outcome of a complaint by an NGO and should not be seen as a matter of corruption.Randeep Surjewala, the Congress’s chief spokesperson, cited the latest development and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi must “submit” its government to a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). Congress has made this demand earlier as well.Surjewala described the development as “a scandalous expose of Rafale scam” that has led to “loss to public exchequer”. “The French have ordered an investigation into the Rafale deal for corruption and influence peddling. The sweetheart deal is now exposed. It calls for a thorough JPC probe. Will the PM (Prime Minister) answer to the nation and when will the government submit to a JPC probe?” he asked.But BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the French development was akin to a competent authority in India writing down in a file that “please act accordingly” when a matter is brought before him; he accused the Congress of spreading lies and misconceptions over the issue.Surjewala maintained that it is not a Congress versus Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issue, but a matter related to national security.Mediapart reported the “highly sensitive probe into the inter-governmental deal signed in 2016 was formally opened on June 14”. It said the development was confirmed by the Financial Crimes Branch of the French Public Prosecution Services on Friday. The French website carried a series of reports on alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal in April.The criminal investigation, Mediapart said, will “examine questions surrounding the actions” of former French president François Hollande, who was in office when the Rafale deal was inked, his successor, Emmanuel Macron, the then economy and finance minister, and foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who held the defence portfolio then.India ordered Rafale jets in September 2016 as an emergency purchase through a government-to-government deal that soon became controversial.The Opposition, led by the Congress, has claimed the price at which India was buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was trying to buy the aircraft.The BJP’s Patra also alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is acting as an agent of rival defence companies and being used as a “pawn”. “Probably, he is acting as an agent or some member of Gandhi family has been for a competing company,” Patra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-row-resurfaces-as-congress-demands-jpc-probe-101625348542842.html

Although the final date of the meeting is not decided yet,” a close aide of Amarinder Singh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier this week, Navjot Singh Sidhu met Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi and presented his side. Other senior leaders of the Punjab Congress had also held marathon meetings with Rahul Gandhi for four days in Delhi.Ahead of assembly elections in Punjab next year, tensions between Singh and Sidhu, which have been simmering since 2019, have added to the problems facing the Congress. Their bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book. A three-member panel, formed to resolve the crisis, submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on June 10.According to people familiar with the development, current PCC Chief Sunil Jakhar is all set to be replaced. Captain openly played his cards through the lunch diplomacy after which it was said that a Hindu leader should be given the chance to lead the party in the state. It is assumed that this is being done to counter Sidhu for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-may-meet-congress-leadership-in-delhi-amid-punjab-infighting-101625347622543.html

This causes administrative inconvenience to the Ministry/Department. Accordingly, Members are requested to address their notices of questions appropriately to one Ministry/Department only,” it said.In the last two sessions, the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha opted for staggered shifts in adherence to Covid-19 norms. The Upper House sat every morning, while the Lower House began its proceedings only in the afternoon, two hours after the Rajya Sabha finished the day’s business.The normal schedule for the upcoming session will entail MPs sitting in their respective seats, according to people aware of the details. The staggered seating arrangement also meant that the lawmakers could not cast votes on bills or debates through the electronic system and had to resort to paper slips.At least 40 bills and five ordinances are currently awaiting Parliament’s approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-traditional-routines-set-to-return-101625343343925.html

He was produced before a local court in Delhi on Friday, which granted the ED seven days’ custody, the agency said in a statement.The agency said its probe has revealed that 62-year-old Sharma “leaked confidential and sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers, in exchange for remuneration, thereby compromising the security and national interests of India”.“It was further revealed that cash for remuneration of Sharma and other unknown persons was being generated through a ‘hawala’ by Mahipalpur-based (an area in Delhi) shell companies that were run by Chinese nationals... along with a Nepalese national,” it alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-delhi-journo-linked-to-spying-case-101625341166541.html
04-07-2021||India||Pakistan’s Kabul focus stalls backchannel with India||Backchannel contacts between India and Pakistan have stalled in recent months, largely because of the Pakistani side’s growing focus on the situation in Afghanistan and pressing domestic issues, according to people familiar with developments.There haven’t been any substantial contacts between the two sides since they agreed to revive the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control from February 25 and the two sides also haven’t been able to reach common ground on the next steps that could facilitate the expansion of the backchannel contacts, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Also Read: Drone spotted near Indian High Commission in Pakistan; India strongly objectsThe revival of the LoC ceasefire was followed by a proposal piloted by the Pakistani military establishment in March to resume limited trade relations with India, but this fell through because of strong opposition from several leaders in the civilian government, including foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.“There was a feeling on the Pakistani side that things should be allowed to cool down for some time. There was also internal criticism within Pakistan because of a feeling in some quarters that Pakistan had agreed to recommit itself to the LoC ceasefire without any concessions from India,” said one of the people cited above.“A lot of the Pakistan government’s bandwidth has also been consumed by the fast-changing situation in Afghanistan and a second wave of Covid-19 infections and urgent domestic issues, such as economic problems,” the person added.The difficulty in selling the limited trade resumption package, which received the green light from Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, too, was a factor in stalling of backchannel contacts, the people said.On the Indian side, there are concerns on whether Bajwa’s successor would continue efforts to work towards a normalisation of relations, and whether there is adequate buy-in from Prime Minister Imran Khan’s civilian government.Following an extension in service granted by the Pakistan government in January 2020, Bajwa’s term as army chief is set to end in about 17 months in November 2022.Also Read | India to Pak: Speed up release of civilian prisoners, missing defence personnel“It’s the classic problem of dealing with Pakistan’s military – we don’t know if the current army chief’s successor will continue this process.

04-07-2021||India||Pak’s Kabul focus stalls backchannel with India||New Delhi: Backchannel contacts between India and Pakistan have stalled in recent months, largely because of the Pakistani side’s growing focus on the situation in Afghanistan and pressing domestic issues, according to people familiar with developments.There haven’t been any substantial contacts between the two sides since they agreed to revive the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control from February 25 and the two sides also haven’t been able to reach common ground on the next steps that could facilitate the expansion of the backchannel contacts, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The revival of the LoC ceasefire was followed by a proposal piloted by the Pakistani military establishment in March to resume limited trade relations with India, but this fell through because of strong opposition from several leaders in the civilian government, including foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.“There was a feeling on the Pakistani side that things should be allowed to cool down for some time. There was also internal criticism within Pakistan because of a feeling in some quarters that Pakistan had agreed to recommit itself to the LoC ceasefire without any concessions from India,” said one of the people cited above.“A lot of the Pakistan government’s bandwidth has also been consumed by the fast-changing situation in Afghanistan and a second wave of Covid-19 infections and urgent domestic issues, such as economic problems,” the person added.The difficulty in selling the limited trade resumption package, which had received the green light from Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, too was a factor in the stalling of the backchannel contacts, the people said.On the Indian side, there are concerns on whether Bajwa’s successor would continue efforts to work towards a normalisation of relations between the two countries, and whether there is adequate buy-in from Prime Minister Imran Khan’s civilian government, given the recent opposition to the resumption of even limited trade contacts.Following an extension in service granted by the Pakistan government in January 2020, Bajwa’s term as army chief is set to end in about 17 months in November 2022.“It’s the classic problem of dealing with Pakistan’s military – we don’t know if the current army chief’s successor will continue this process. Gen Bajwa may be keen about this process but there is no guarantee the next general will stick to it,” said a second person.The two sides have also been unable to find common ground on the next steps that can help them take forward the backchannel contacts, including the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the people said. Reports have suggested the Pakistani side had suggested during the backchannel contacts that India should take steps to restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir and put in place measures to maintain the current demography of the state and to protect the rights and employment opportunities of Kashmiris.Pakistan’s civilian leadership, including Prime Minister Khan, has linked any talks with India to the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, which was scrapped by the Indian government in August 2019.

On the other hand, India has said it is in touch with “various stakeholders” in Afghanistan to protect its legitimate security interests.The India-Pakistan backchannel contacts gained urgency last year, the people said. Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed has had two meetings with Indian interlocutors – one with a senior security official and another with his Indian counterpart in the United Arab Emirates in January that led to the revival of the LoC ceasefire, they said.Contrary to earlier reports, Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf is now playing a larger role in ties with the US, given his extensive American contacts from his stint in the Washington-based think tank United States Institute of Peace, the people added.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash, who closely tracks developments in the region, said perpetual hostility between India and Pakistan “cannot and should not go on”.“We are neighbours, we may not like it but we must find a modus vivendi. The point really is how we find it. You have to keep all options open and try the dialogue route and the front and back channels, while we also have the necessary defences and counter-offensive capabilities,” he said.“Basically, we have to be prepared for all eventualities and the end objective is that we coexist without acrimony and are not at each other’s throat even if we are not cooperating. It takes two to tango, and Pakistan has to make up its mind. We are very clear that whenever they are ready, so are we. The ball is in the Pakistani court and they have to decide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paks-kabul-focus-stalls-backchannel-with-india-101625337417998.html
04-07-2021||India||Rawat’s short tenure marred by controversies||The short tenure of Tirath Singh Rawat, who resigned as the chief minister of Uttarakhand, making way for Pushkar Singh Dhami as his successor was marred by controversial remarks a poor handling of the Covid-19 situation during the Mahakumbh festival, according to political experts.Rawat triggered controversies with his critical views on women’s clothing and by saying that the waters of the Ganga could prevent Covid-19 infections. He also initially spoke about allowing Mahakumbh in Haridwar without any restrictions.About 9.1 million people took the holy dip – at least six million of them in April, coinciding with the peak of the second wave – and officials in many other north Indian states traced local infection surges to Kumbh returnees. The Uttarakhand high court sharply criticised the government for green-lighting the event.SMA Kazmi, a Dehradun-based political analyst, said Rawat was targeted on the management of the Mahakumbh – he initially said that people could attend the event without any Covid-19 test. “The Mahakumbh Covid-19 testing scam has been a big embarrassment for the government,” he said. The various controversial statements he made also created trouble, he added.Allegations of fake testing surfaced in Haridwar after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests.Rawat has said the irregularities occurred before his tenure, prompting a sharp denial from Trivendra Rawat. Tirath Singh Rawat and his predecessor were engaged in a war of words, with Trivendra Singh Rawat demanding a judicial probe into the fake testing scam.Since the creation of Uttarakhand in 2000, only one chief minister, the Congress’s ND Tiwari, has completed their full tenure in the state.“The opposition Congress will again get an opportunity to hit the government and it will try to portray the developments as growing political instability of the government and a betrayal of the people,” Kazmi said.Suryakant Dhasmana, Congress state vice-president, said the BJP has made a mockery of politics in the state by bringing in three CMs. “People feel betrayed and they can clearly see there is no political stability in the state. With such instability and infighting, can they provide any relief or succor to people here? They are themselves in crisis,” he said.Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson however said in BJP, they believe in working collectively and facing all challenges collectively. “Tirath Singh Rawat was brought as CM and he did what party wanted him to do according to our vision document. The new CM will also work as per the party’s vision”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawats-short-tenure-marred-by-controversies-101625337357990.html
04-07-2021||India||Tradition routines set to return in Parliament||New Delhi: Parliament’s upcoming monsoon session will return to its traditional routine in terms of working hours and seating after more than a year of makeshift arrangements to ensure Covid-19 guidelines, including social distancing, with public galleries being used to accommodate MPs and the two houses working in shifts over the last two sessions.A bulletin issued by the Lok Sabha secretariat on Saturday said that the House will meet daily from 11am to 6pm with an hour of lunch break.The bulletin also urged the MPs to ask questions pertaining to the specific ministry to the respective minister. “It has been observed that sometimes Members raise two or more different and unrelated subjects, involving more than one Ministry/Department in one notice of question. This causes administrative inconvenience to the Ministry/Department. Accordingly, Members are requested to address their notices of questions appropriately to one Ministry/Department only,” said the bulletin.In the last two sessions, the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha opted for staggered shifts in a bid to give maximum protection to MPs and to adhere to Covid-19 norms. The Upper House sat every morning, while the Lower House began its proceedings only in the afternoon, two hours after the Rajya Sabha finished the day’s business.The normal schedule for the upcoming session will entail MPs sitting in their respective seats in the session, according to people aware of the details. The staggered seating arrangement also meant that the lawmakers could not caste votes on bills or debates through the electronic system and had to resort to paper slips.At least 40 bills and five ordinances are awaiting Parliament’s approval and the upcoming session can give the government enough room to push some of its key bills, while the Opposition, too, can demand discussion on issues such as the economic situation, the vaccination policy or spiralling fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tradition-routines-set-to-return-in-parliament-101625337238087.html

He has, however, mostly lived in the Khatima area of US Nagar after his parents moved there.A postgraduate from Lucknow University, Dhami began his political career with student politics in the early 1990s.

04-07-2021||India||‘Conversion’ case: ED conducts raids in 6 Delhi, UP locations||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday carried out raids at six locations in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in connection with allegedly forced conversions of differently abled children to Islam, agency officials said.ED’s money laundering probe is based on an Uttar Pradesh police investigation, which began with the arrest last month of the alleged mastermind of the racket Mohammad Umar Gautam and a preacher Mufti Qazi Jahangir Qasim, both residents of Jamia Nagar in Delhi.In Delhi, ED teams raided three places, including the office of the Islamic Dawah Centre and residences of Gautam and Qasim. In Uttar Pradesh, ED searched offices of the Al Hassan Education & Welfare Foundation and the Guidance Education & Welfare Society in Lucknow.These organisations, ED said, were run by Gautam and have been playing an instrumental role in carrying out forced conversions. The central agency said it recovered several “incriminating documents” on Saturday, “which reveal large-scale conversion carried out by accused Umar Gautam and his organisations all over India”.“The documents also reveal several crores of foreign funding received by the accused organisations for the purpose of illegal conversions,” said an officer, who did not wish to be named.The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh arrested Gautam and Qasim from Delhi and claimed that they were running a “mass conversion racket” across India. Another person Salahuddin Sheikh was arrested in the case by ATS from Gujarat on Wednesday.Police have said the accused persons allegedly received funding from international organisations and targeted differently abled children and other vulnerable groups for conversion to Islam. They were allegedly involved in the conversion of over 1,000 people over the past 18 months from different states, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, police said at a press conference last month.According to ATS officials, Gautam and Qasim also lured girls from poor backgrounds to give up their religion and accept Islam, promising them jobs, and eventually got them married to Muslim men. The investigators have said that Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-services Intelligence funded the racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conversion-case-ed-conducts-raids-in-6-delhi-up-locations-101625337177991.html
04-07-2021||India||BJP wins panchayat chief elections in UP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday swept the zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections after candidates backed by the party attained victory in 67 of 75 seats.Of the 67, the BJP won 21 seats unopposed after several candidates from opposition parties joined the ruling party overnight and withdrew from the contest.Attributing the victory to policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Yogi Adityanath tweeted: “The BJP’s historic sweep in these elections is due to pro-people policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he tweeted.“It is also a reflection of the good governance model of UP,” he added while congratulating the people of the state on the party’s win.Modi also extended his wishes to the chief minister and party workers for the win.“The victory of BJP in the zila panchayat elections for development, public service and to maintain law and order is a blessing from the public. The credit goes to chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s policies and the efforts put in by party workers. Hearty congratulations to the UP government and BJP party,” he tweeted.Zila panchayat chiefs are elected from among the elected members of zila panchayats. The four-phase panchayat polls concluded in the state last month.The victory in these elections is crucial for the ruling party which lost the zila panchayat ward members’ polls to the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) in April.While the Congress lost the only seat it contested in Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha bastion of party interim chief Sonia Gandhi, the Bahujan Samaj Party boycotted the polls, citing misuse of official machinery.The opposition Samajwadi Party also alleged misuse of state power. “The BJP demolished all democratic norms to manufacture a win. Such muzzling of democracy and such brute use of official machinery was never seen before,” party chief Akhilesh Yadav said.While the BJP secured a win in Unnao, the SP expelled its official candidate for siding with the former.In Amethi, the BJP won against the SP while the Congress failed to put up a candidate. The Congress had lost the region to the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.In Jaunpur, BJP’s ally Apna Dal withdrew from the race in support of independent candidate Srikala Reddy, wife of former MP Dhananjay Singh, who eventually won the polls.In Ghazipur, two members who won on the backing of Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), extended their support to the BJP. Owaisi’s party plans to contest from 100 seats in the assembly elections next year.“AIMIM’s nexus with BJP now lies exposed,” Congress leader Surendra Rajput said.AIMIM’s UP chief Shaukat Ali, however, denied allegations of his party candidates backing the ruling party.While the SP won its stronghold Etawah unopposed, it registered a one-sided victory in Azamgarh, Yadav’s Lok Sabha constituency.The party also took the BJP by surprise in Etah, Sant Kabir Nagar and Ballia but faced a setback in bastions like Mainpuri, Rampur, Kannauj and Ferozabad. It also lost Farrukhabad where the ruling party fielded Monica Yadav, former wife of top SP leader Dharmendra Yadav, for the polls.The RLD won the Baghpat seat where the joint candidate of the two parties, Mamta Kishore, initially went “missing” and was later believed to have withdrawn her papers before an official protest by the parties ensured a contest.“The public built moral pressure and didn’t let desperate tactics (by the ruling party) succeed,” RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said.Several videos accusing both ruling and opposition parties of foul play surfaced during the day. The SP, in a video, alleged that a senior district administration official in Auraiya was caught preventing voters allegedly belonging to the opposition party from casting their ballot.In Chandauli, another video that went viral showed former SP MP Ram Kishan Yadav touching the feet of zila panchayat ward members to secure the party’s win.“He is known for dramatics,” local SP leader Chandrashekhar Yadav said, accusing former Ram Kishan of conspiring against the party.“There is no direct co-relation to suggest that these polls will have a bearing on the 2022 UP polls. However, the manner in which the party’s top leadership has responded to the clean sweep in these rural polls does suggest that the BJP would surely market it as an achievement, especially after not performing well in the zila panchayat ward members’ poll. Politics is as much about perception as it is about performance and BJP would surely play up the win in an election year,” veteran journalist and political observer Irshad Ilmi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wins-panchayat-chief-elections-in-up-101625337118107.html
04-07-2021||India||Pushkar Singh Dhami to take oath as new Uttarakhand CM today||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday chose the next chief minister of Uttarakhand, two-time legislator Pushkar Singh Dhami, for the state’s top post, after days of frenetic meetings and discussions that culminated in the resignation of CM Tirath Singh Rawat late on Friday night.Dhami, the legislator from Khatima constituency of US Nagar district, will be the third chief minister to lead the state in less than four months, triggering criticism from the Opposition and concerns among BJP leaders about political instability months before Uttarakhand goes to the polls. Assembly elections in the state are to be held in early 2022.The state unit of the BJP elected Dhami as the legislative party leader, paving the way for his official appointment as chief minister at the swearing-in ceremony in Dehradun on Sunday at 6pm.“My party has appointed a common worker, the son of an ex-serviceman, who was born in the border district of Pithoragarh to serve the people,” Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who attended the meeting in the town as a central observer, told reporters.Tomar added that former CM Tirath Singh Rawat and state BJP chief Madan Kaushik proposed the name of Dhami, and other senior leaders — including ex-chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat — backed the move.“We’ll work on people’s issues with the cooperation of all. I will carry forward the work done by my predecessors,” Dhami told reporters shortly after the meeting at the party headquarters. The CM-designate later visited governor Baby Rani Maurya’s residence to stake claim to the government.The 45-year-old, set to be the state’s 10th chief minister, is also the youngest leader to be appointed to the position in Uttarakhand. It wasn’t known until now that Dhami — who has never held a ministerial position before this, but has links with the RSS and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad — was being considered for the role.Outgoing chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, whose short term was marred by controversies that included allowing the Mahakumbh to convene with mammoth gatherings despite a raging pandemic, and a Covid-19 testing scam, congratulated Dhami and appeared to present a unified front . “All the 56 members of legislature party elected him unanimously. We are sure that Uttarakhand will attain new heights of development in the coming period under his leadership,” he said.Tirath Singh Rawat resigned as the CM on Friday night, days after the BJP leadership summoned him to Delhi, where he met Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda.He suggested he resigned on Friday because the Election Commission (EC) was unlikely to hold by-elections — which were necessary for him to continue in the post — due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rawat was a member of Parliament when he was named the chief minister. He needed to be elected to the state assembly within six months of assuming the post to continue as the CM.Although it is atypical for EC to hold bypolls to an assembly whose remaining tenure is less year, an official of the body indicated to HT on Friday that no request was made by the party.The BJP has 56 lawmakers in the 70-member house.In March this year, Tirath Singh Rawat was appointed as the ninth chief minister of the state after his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned due to infighting in the state unit.Political analysts say the change of guard this year and the controversies over the state government’s handling of the pandemic during the second wave of infections is likely to hit the BJP’s chances of returning to power in the state next year.“By stirring this political episode just a few months before the election, BJP has made the road to victory difficult for itself. The people of Uttarakhand will now think that the BJP is taking them as its laboratory for its political experiments. Secondly, the morale of its workers would also take a dent after this,” said MM Semwal, professor of political science at Garhwal Central University.On Saturday, the Opposition Congress also hit out at the BJP for what it termed was “political instability” and “lust for power”. “Instead of serving the people of Uttarakhand, they tried to distribute power, and PM Modi and JP Nadda are responsible for this,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged.Dhami, however, adopted a defiant tone on concerns over the BJP’s electoral performance, and said that he was ready to take the “challenge” and turn it into an “opportunity”.State leaders said on Saturday that several factors worked in favour of Dhami, who was a relatively lesser known figure than some of the other BJP legislators. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj and education minister Dhan Singh Rawat were tipped to be elevated to the key position.“Dhami ticked several boxes. He is a member of the Thakur community, which helped as state party president Madan Kaushik is a Brahmin, the BJP couldn’t appoint two members of the same community,” an Uttarakhand minister said on the condition of anonymity. It also helped that Dhami has his roots in Kumaon, and will be seen as a representative of the people from the region as Kaushik is from Garhwal, the minister added.Another party MLA said Dhami is believed to be close to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and former Uttarakhand chief minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is currently the Maharashtra governor.However, state Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni believes that the BJP has only chosen Dhami instead of a big name to keep a “scapegoat” ready as the ruling party knows it is “going to lose”.BJP leaders disagree. “Dhami is a young leader with a significant support base among the youth,” said Ajay Bhatt, a BJP MP from Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pushkar-singh-dhami-to-take-oath-as-new-uttarakhand-cm-today-101625335492195.html

04-07-2021||India||'Will pick officer, timeline not binding': Twitter to HC||Social media company Twitter has informed the Delhi high court that it is in the final stages of appointing officers for grievance redress but said the three-month timeline fixed by the Centre to appoint such officers under the new IT Rules is not binding.Under the new digital rules, social media companies such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter have been asked to put in place a three-tier grievance redress system and appoint a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer by May 25.“In any event, it is submitted that the three-month time period is directory and not mandatory and is further subject to just exceptions including Covid-19. It is submitted that the petitioner’s grievance that on May 25 the requirements were to be complied is incorrect and for this reason alone, the writ petition deserves dismissal,” Twitter said in an affidavit to the court.“When the timelines mentioned in intermediary guidelines themselves are not mandatory and are subject to just exceptions, the question of a stay does not arise.”The new guidelines also require these companies to identify within 36 hours the originator of a flagged message as well as to regulate their content, appoint grievance officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt measures such as tracing of individual messages and voluntary user verification.The Centre and Twitter have been locking horns over compliance with the new IT rules. Twitter recently said it was committed to India as a vital market, but criticised the new rules that it said “inhibit free, open public conversation”.Responding to Twitter’s comments, the Centre had said the messaging platform was levelling baseless and false allegations to defame India and was dictating terms to the world’s largest democracy. The Centre has said that only WhatsApp and Facebook have complied with the guidelines on appointing three separate officers for grievance redress.The government has asserted that the social media firm has failed to comply with the guidelines, which can result in it losing safe harbour protection granted to intermediaries under the IT Act.Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several instances of confrontation between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by BJP leaders as manipulated media.In its affidavit filed in response to a plea alleging that the microblogging site has not complied with the new information technology rules despite the three-month window given by the Centre from Feb 25 having lapsed, Twitter has said that it is in the “final stages” of appointment of a resident grievance officer and a chief compliance officer.The company said it appointed an interim resident grievance officer on May 29; however, even before steps could be taken to completely formalise this arrangement, the officer withdrew his candidature on June 21.Twitter’s grievance officer Dharmendra Chatur had stepped down, prompting the firm to hire a new official.The response came on a plea by advocate Amit Acharya, who through his counsel Akash Vajpai, contended that the rules came into effect from February 25 and the Centre had given three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply with them.The matter will be heard next on July 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-pick-officer-timeline-not-binding-twitter-to-hc-101625336638503.html
04-07-2021||India||French judge to investigate Rafale deal||A French judge has been tasked with investigating suspicions of “corruption” in the ₹59,000 crore (7.8 billion euro) deal with India for 36 Rafale jets, the French national financial prosecutor’s office has said.The Parquet National Financier (PNF) or national financial prosecutor refused to investigate the deal in 2019, when the agency’s then head Eliane Houlette dismissed a complaint filed by French anti-corruption NGO Sherpa.Following a fresh complaint from Sherpa on the basis of a series of reports on the Rafale deal by news website Mediapart, PNF appointed a judge to lead a judicial investigation into suspected “corruption” and “favouritism”, Mediapart reported. The investigation was formally launched on June 14.PNF was also cited by AFP news agency as confirming the appointment of a judge to investigate the deal that was inked in September 2016, following the scrapping of the Indian government’s earlier plans to acquire 126 jets.There was no immediate response to the development from Indian officials, while the Opposition Congress party on Saturday demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary panel.In its latest complaint, Sherpa cited “corruption”, “influence peddling”, “money laundering”, “favouritism” and undue tax waiver related to the Rafale deal. Mediapart reported PNF, the financial crimes branch of the French public prosecution services, had confirmed the new investigation will focus on all four allegations.In April this year, Mediapart carried a series of reports on alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal. In one of those reports, Mediapart said former PNF head Éliane Houlette shelved an investigation into alleged evidence of corruption in the Rafale deal despite the objection of colleagues. It added that Houlette justified her decision by saying it was meant to preserve “the interests of France”.“Now, her successor as head of the PNF, Jean-François Bohnert, has decided to support the opening of a probe, after the complaint was updated with details from Mediapart’s recent series of investigations,” the website reported.The new criminal investigation, Mediapart reported, will “examine questions surrounding the actions” of former French president François Hollande, who was in office when the Rafale deal was inked, current French President Emmanuel Macron, who at the time was Hollande’s finance minister, and foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who held the defence portfolio in 2016.Mediapart claimed in April that “millions of euros of hidden commissions” were given to a go-between who helped French aircraft manufacturer Dassault, the manufacturer of the Rafale jet, conclude the deal.Dassault has said the group’s audits had not flagged any wrongdoing. The firm said in April that it “acts in strict compliance with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and national laws”.According to an official French website, PNF’s jurisdiction is limited to France and it examines three categories of offences – breaches of probity (such as corruption, influence peddling and favouritism), breaches of public finances (such as aggravated tax fraud or VAT fraud), and damage to proper functioning of financial markets (such as insider trading or price manipulation). Under certain conditions, PNF can investigate crimes committed abroad.In its latest report, Mediapart cited confidential reports and said Dassault had “no interest in forming a partnership with Reliance other than for political reasons”. The two firms had created a joint venture called Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) in 2017.Mediapart also cited the documents to report that the two firms agreed on a total investment of 169 million euros in DRAL, and that Dassault, which held a 49% stake in the joint venture, pledged to provide up to 159 million euros, while Reliance would provide 10 million euros.The website further cited the documents to report that Dassault and Reliance had signed their first memorandum of understanding setting out the “broad outlines of an agreement” on March 26, 2015, or 15 days before the Indian government announced that it was scrapping the earlier plan of buying 126 Rafale jets in favour of a deal for only 36 jets.The Congress party said its allegations had been vindicated by the reports that a French judge will probe suspected “corruption” in the Rafale deal. The Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told media that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must “submit” the government to a probe by a joint parliamentary panel, reiterating an earlier demand.He described the developments as “a scandalous expose of the Rafale scam” that caused a “loss to public exchequer”. Surjewala said: “The French have ordered investigation into the Rafale deal for corruption and influence peddling. The sweetheart deal is now exposed. It calls for a thorough JPC probe. Will the PM answer to the nation and when will the government submit to a JPC probe?”Surjewala maintained it is not a Congress versus BJP issue, but a matter related to national security.The Bharatiya Janata Party alleged on Saturday that Rahul Gandhi was acting as an agent of rival defence companies and being used as a “pawn”, and also said he and the Congress keep raking up allegations of corruption in the Rafale deal in an attempt to “weaken” India. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra played down the appointment of a judge in France to lead the judicial investigation, saying the development was the outcome of a complaint by an NGO and should not be seen as a matter of corruption.While the Congress had focused on the cost of the jets, the French probe will focus more on alleged corruption, favouritism and influence peddling. The Rafale deal became controversial when the Opposition, led by the Congress, claimed that the price for each Rafale jet was ₹1,670 crore, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by Dassault when the previous UPA government was trying to buy the aircraft.The NDA government has said it cannot disclose details of the price of the jets on two counts: a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies. However, the NDA said the current deal includes customised weaponry.The NDA’s decision to enter the government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 warplanes was announced in April 2015, and an agreement was signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous UPA regime’s decision to buy 126 jets, 108 of which were to be made by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with transfer of technology.In early 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the government’s auditor, said there was nothing untoward in the deal, although, in late 2020, it pulled up Dassault for not meeting the terms of an offset clause. The Centre said later that it would henceforth scrap the offset clause for all government-to-government deals. The Supreme Court, in 2018 and later in 2019, rejected all petitions and said there were no irregularities related to the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-judge-to-investigate-rafale-deal-101625336397984.html
