Eknath Khadse, former revenue minister, was questioned by the enforcement directorate (ED) for nine hours in the alleged money laundering case on Thursday.Khadse joined the NCP in October last year and has been facing investigation by the central agency since December 2020, two months after leaving the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On Wednesday, his son-in-law Girish Choudhary was arrested by ED in the same case. “In my view all this started after I joined NCP by leaving BJP… The case is politically motivated. Efforts are made to frame me in it by any means. For the last eight days, a message has been going viral on social media in Jalgaon (district) that something related to me is about to happen. The way (BJP) activists are aware of the ED action in advance indicates that it is a conspiracy but I’m ready to face it,” Khadse told reporters outside ED office on Thursday morning.He said that Maharashtra and the entire country is watching what is going on. The case has been probed five times by different agencies. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has given him a clean chit by submitting a C-summary report. “The land I bought is privately owned and not of MIDC. The corporation has not completed the process of acquisition. They have neither paid the compensation nor taken its possession,” Khadse stressed.“Khadse’s induction in NCP has irritated the BJP which is using central agencies to frame him in a case. He is innocent and we are sure he will come out clean,” said Jayant Patil, state NCP chief. Patil said that a commission formed by the erstwhile the BJP-led government has also given him a clean chit. Khadse is under scrutiny for allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal in Bhosari near Pune. The plot was bought by his wife Mandakini and son-in-law in 2016 for ₹3.75 crore against the prevalent market rate of ₹30 crore. According to the ED officials, Khadse and his family fraudulently purchased the said land, despite having knowledge that it was reserved for Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), so that they could claim the compensation of more than double the market rate when the MIDC acquired it.He would be the third NCP leader who would be going behind the bars on corruption charges, if arrested. Before him, senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal and Gularao Deokar have faced arrest over corruption charges. Bhujbal is currently out on bail and is holding food and civil supplies portfolio in the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government in the state.Besides, one more NCP leader and former home minister Anil Deshmukh is also facing an investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED over charges of extortion made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh has moved the Supreme Court seeking protection from coercive action in a money laundering case.In 2016, Bhujbal, also former deputy chief minister, was also arrested in a money laundering case and was in jail for two years before he got bail on health grounds in May 2018. He was arrested by ED for allegedly receiving kickbacks worth crores for awarding various government contracts, including the Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi. Before him, Deokar, former minister and a NCP leader from Jalgaon district, was arrested in May 2012. He spent around three years behind bars before getting bail. He was found involved in a 1997 housing scam related to the construction of 11,000 low-cost houses in Jalgaon in north Maharashtra and was convicted by a sessions court in 2019, along with 47 others. Deokar was a member of the Jalgaon Municipal Council from 1995 to 2000 when the scam took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-probe-against-him-politically-motivated-says-ncp-s-eknath-khadse-101625768965890.html
08-07-2021||Noida||Birder spots little bittern at Okhla Bird Sanctuary||A birder reported spotting a little bittern at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS), a “rare and unusual sighting” for the National Capital Region (NCR), according to experts.Wing commander (retd) N S Khaira said he spotted three birds of the species in late June and managed to take a few photographs.A small heron with a dark back and cap, a white neck and patches on the wings, Little Bitterns breed in the Kashmir region and migrate to South India or Africa. A shy and crepuscular species that often lives low in reed beds near lakes or rivers, there are no records of the bird being spotted at OBS and, according to www.ebird.org (an online database of bird distribution), there is no record of it having been spotted in Delhi either, apart from some birders’ accounts of 1968.“I spotted two males and one female, flying low over the dense reeds. One male was chasing the other. They flew twice in circles, briefly, like in a chase depicting territorial behaviour. What caught my eye was the distinct pale panel on each upper wing of the birds. Rest of the wings were black. The cap and tail were also black, which made the pale panels stand out and eye-catching,” said Khaira. “Since I was on the tower and the birds were flying low, the upper side plumage was clearly visible. Had I been standing on the ground I may have missed noticing the distinctive pale panels and confused the birds with Yellow Bitterns. Size and shape of the Yellow and the Little bitterns are quite similar – both types flew low and would vanish quickly into the reeds.”Examining the pictures, which were slightly blurry as the birds were in flight, a number of experts confirmed it to be the Little Bittern.“The bird seems vagrant, which means it’s not in its normal habitat. This is indeed a good spot for Delhi. The bird has been spotted in Gujarat and Ranthambore,” said ornithologist and conservationist Bikram Grewal.“It’s a rare sighting for the NCR and it seems that the bird must be in passage, after breeding in Kashmir from April to June, and flying from the North, down to the South or to Africa. As far as I recall, one sighting was made at Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Jhajjar over 11 years ago,” said birder Kanwar B Singh.“This is something very rare. There are five Bitterns in India of which Yellow Bitterns, Black Bitterns and Cinnamon Bitterns are common, while Great Bitterns and Little Bitterns are rare,” said Anand Arya, another bird enthusiast.According to the forest department, there are “no clear records” of the bird in OBS. “This is great information for our sanctuary. There are no records of when this bird was last spotted here, though we are certain that there had been no spotting of Little Bittern over the past ten years at least,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/birder-spots-little-bittern-at-okhla-bird-sanctuary-101625768906469.html

In the meantime, a man went into the trial room. I asked the staff why they had let him do so. By then he came out and went away without trying anything,” said Saluja in his police complaint. “When I checked my clothes, my cards and ₹80,000 cash were missing. We immediately rushed out and tried to look for him but he was gone. We then informed the staff and the local police as well,” he said.The family has filed an e-FIR in the case, police said.“We have spoken to the complainant and have started a probe from our end. We have requested the necessary CCTV footage that will come from the showroom headquarters in Bengaluru. Due action will be taken,” said Munish Chauhan, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-80-000-cash-bank-cards-stolen-from-trial-room-of-garment-showroom-101625768905936.html
08-07-2021||Noida||GB Nagar aims to inoculate nearly 50K expectant mothers||Gautam Budh Nagar is moving to get around 50,000 pregnant women in the district vaccinated against Covid-19. The district will mobilise accredited social health activist (Asha) workers and auxillary nurse midwives (ANMs) to coordinate with families and spread awareness, and create special walk-in booths to encourage them to get vaccinated.Last week, the Centre had included pregnant women under the vaccination programme. GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said, “In any case, the vaccine is the best armour against fighting Covid-19. There is no known risk to the foetus as the studies have shown that pregnant women could even pass on their antibodies to the child. The health department officials have been asked to create awareness among the pregnant women about the efficacy of the vaccines. They have been asked to co-ordinate with the ANMs, Anganwadi and Asha workers to mobilise them for inoculation,” he said. Chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said, “Out of the 50,000 pregnant women in the district, over 36,400 are pregnant for the first time. We’ve also planned special arrangements like walk-in vaccination and exclusive inoculation booths for them.” Doctors said it is important for pregnant women, especially those with comorbidities and those who go out for work, to get vaccinated. Dr Anjana Singh, head of obstetrics and gynaecology department in Fortis Hospital Noida, said that according to the ministry of health and family welfare and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), there is no study that mentions that pregnant women should not be vaccinated. “As per the government’s fact sheet, the Covid-19 vaccines are safe. Vaccination should be taken during the second trimester because by then the baby’s organs have also developed and it is the safe time to get vaccinated. However, it should be done after consultations with gynaecologists,” she said. According to the Co-WIN portal, till Thursday as many as 1,304,427 doses of vaccines have been administered in GB Nagar district, in which 1,122,680 people have taken their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-aims-to-inoculate-nearly-50k-expectant-mothers-101625768846360.html

Get discounts at eateries, gyms in Noida||Noida: Hit hard by the partial corona curfew, many in the hospitality and fitness sectors in Gautam Budh Nagar are offering discounts on bills at their establishments to those who are vaccinated against Covid-19, in a bid to drive up sales as well as to encourage more and more people to get their shots. The partial corona curfew was imposed from the night of April 30 in the district in view of rising Covid cases. While restaurants and eateries reopened on June 21, gyms reopened on July 5 after relaxations announced by the state government. At the Gardens Galleria mall in Sector 38A, pubs Time Machine and Duty Free Courtyard are offering a 50% discount to customers who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.“Most of the people coming to the pub are already vaccinated so when we released the offer a week ago, almost all of our customers were able to avail of the discount. All our staff is vaccinated as well which helps us ensure a safe environment for all,” said Sahil Joshi, general manager at Time Machine.Varun Puri, founder and director at Duty Free Courtyard, said the response after releasing the offer has boosted footfall. “We have been overwhelmed with the response from customers after releasing the offer. We had posted information on our social media page and saw that people tagged their friends online and asked them to get vaccinated so that they can get a discount. Footfall to the pub has also increased, as a result,” said Puri who is offering the same discount at his restaurant Imly located at DLF Mall of India, Sector 18.Restaurants like Punjab Grill in Sector 104, Soho Kitchen & Co in Sector 37 and 3Bros Kitchen in Sector 63 are also offering similar discounts. “We launched the offer from July 1 and people were excited to come to the restaurant. We hope this helps with business as well,” said Prayag Chaudhary, owner at SOHO Kitchen & Co.Ashish Tripathi from 3Bros Kitchen said the discounts have also led to conversations regarding vaccinations. “Since we started the offers, many people came up to us asking whether it is safe to get vaccinated and asked about the process as well. We are happy that the initiative is helping motivate people to get jabs,” he said.Varun Khera, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (Noida chapter), said such offers will help revive the hospitality industry.“With the scare of a third wave, vaccination seems like the only key to help revive the hospitality industry in Gautam Budh Nagar. Whether it is vaccination of 100% staff at restaurants or giving incentives to customers who have got their shots, all efforts are being made to ensure a safe environment as well as return things to normal,” said Khera, who is also offering discounts for vaccinated customers at two of his restaurants – Desi Vibes and Kaffiaa – in Sector 18.Meanwhile, at gyms too, discounts are being offered for vaccinated clients who are renewing their old memberships or getting new ones. “At least 50 gyms in Gautam Budh Nagar are offering a 10-15% discount for those who are vaccinated with at least the first dose and a 15-20% discount for those who have got their second dose,” said Chirag Sethi, general secretary of Uttar Pradesh Fitness Centres and Gyms, who also runs at Anytime Fitness branches in Sector 48 and 108, which are also offering discounts. Dr NK Sharma, president of the Indian Medical Association, Noida chapter, lauded the initiative which he said will not only motivate people to get the shots but will also ensure better business for the hospitality sector.“Giving incentives to those who are vaccinated is a step in the right direction that will also ensure a safe environment for all. I suggest more and more establishments follow this model,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccinated-get-discounts-at-eateries-gyms-in-noida-101625768845793.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Why did Pune Police not approach special judge, Bombay HC asks state||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state as to why the Pune Police approached additional sessions judge KD Vadane instead of special judges for cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case filed against Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bhardwaj. This comes after Bhardwaj’s lawyers moved the court against the 90-day extension order passed by judge Vadane for her detention and filing of charge sheet. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), however, refuted Bhardwaj’s claims and held the process legal and proper. Additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh argued that sessions judge Vadane was competent as special judges under the prescribed act were no different from sessions judges. He further said that as speedy disposal was required in sensitive matters pertaining to national security, the judge was competent to adjudicate on the Pune Police application. The HC, after verifying the Right to Information (RTI) papers submitted by Bharadwaj, asked the state government to explain as to why the Pune Police approached the said judge rather than the designated special judges who were available to decide scheduled offences under the UAPA and posted further hearing to July 15. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the default bail application of Bharadwaj, confirmed that the information provided in the application regarding incompetence of the judge who passed the extension order matched with the records in the HC registry. In an earlier hearing, advocate Yug Choudhry for Bharadwaj had submitted that judge Vadane, who had signed the orders of extension and authorised the charge sheet in 2018 and 2019, had wrongly claimed to be a special judge though he was not. Choudhry had relied upon the information provided by the HC registry on the appointment of sessions judges wherein it was stated that Vadane was not a special judge. Choudhry had argued that as per the provisions of the NIA Act, only special judges could preside and hear cases under the NIA and UAPA, and hence the orders passed by Vadane were not valid, making the detention of Bharadwaj and eight others illegal. On Thursday, Choudhry further submitted that though there were other NIA judges at the sessions court in Pune, the Pune Police had placed the matter before judge Vadane. He added that since Bharadwaj and others had been charged under the UAPA, a sessions judge could have taken cognisance of the case only if there were specific instructions from the principal district judge (PDJ). The bench then sought to know from chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai, for the state, to show if there existed such an order. “Show us any document through which PDJ gave powers to Vadane to hear the matter,” the bench said. The bench said there were documents to show that while the Pune Police took the case and the charge sheet before Judge Vadane, designated special judges were officiating in special courts in Pune at the time. The bench also asked ASG Singh, for NIA, to respond to Chaudhry’s claims. Pai then sought time and said she would respond after taking instructions from relevant authorities. ASG Singh, however, refuted the submissions of Chaudhry that only a special judge could have taken cognisance of the case and said that offences under UAPA were serious and hence, there was focus on early disposal. “The purpose for this Act (UAPA) is to punish the offender. There has to be expeditious and early disposal of cases. Nothing is above national security,” said Singh. He added that special judges were not different from sessions judges as they were only appointed as a special judge. So, the claim that judge Vadane was not competent was not valid. The HC adjourned further hearing on the plea to July 15. It will also be hearing similar pleas filed by other co-accused in Elgar Parishad case Arun Ferreira, Anand Teltumbde and Sudhir Dhawale, which has been filed through advocate R Sathyanarayan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-why-did-pune-police-not-approach-special-judge-bombay-hc-asks-state-101625768726469.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||No late fee for UG entrance exam aspirants: Maharashtra CET cell||Considering complaints of network connectivity issues and travel restrictions in certain districts of the state, the Maharashtra common entrance test (CET) cell has dropped late fee charges for those who are yet to complete registration for the upcoming entrance exams. Students seeking admission in undergraduate (UG) professional courses including engineering/technology, pharmacy and agricultural education had time till Thursday to complete the registration process, which has now been extended till July 15.“The registration window was supposed to be open till July 15, but starting tomorrow (July 9), there would have been a late fee charged for every application. Since some students mentioned they have not managed to get the necessary documents attested either due to strict lockdown in their districts or other problems, we are waiving the late fee till July 15,” said a senior official from the state CET cell. He clarified that there will be no further extension given on this deadline.Many students had approached the state CET cell in the past one week seeking an extension of the registration deadline. “Since the CET cell has not yet clarified eligibility for the entrance exam, more students are opting for registrations, causing the website to the crash regularly. We have been facing network trouble in our locality, so we needed an extension,” said Karan Rahane, a Palghar resident.While the state education department only recently gave clarity on Class 12 results, CET cell started registrations for entrance exams on June 8.“Maharashtra CET entrance exams for admission to professional courses including engineering/technology, pharmacy and agricultural education for the 2021-22 academic year will be held across various centres in Mumbai and across Maharashtra,” stated the circular signed by CET cell commissioner CD Joshi. “The online registration schedule and information brochure for the examination has been made available on the official website, https://mhtcet2021.mahacet.org. Payment for the exams will only be accepted in the online mode,” the circular added.Last month, both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced their decision to scrap their respective Class 12 exams keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic and instead promote students based on a 30:30:40 formula, giving 30% weightage each to Class 10 and 11 results and 40% weightage to students’ performance in Class 12. This same formula has now been implemented by the Maharashtra state board and the results are expected by month-end.“We are yet to finalise the dates for various exams and the work is on. For the time being, registrations have commenced to give ample time to applicants to complete the first step of the admissions process,” said an official from the state CET cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-late-fee-for-ug-entrance-exam-aspirants-maharashtra-cet-cell-101625768725846.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Monsoon to intensify over weekend in Mumbai||After a prolonged dry spell, the city received 17mm rain over nine hours on Thursday, the highest in the past 10 days. With the southwest monsoon growing stronger over the Arabian Sea and with a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal expected to form around July 11, enhanced rainfall activity is likely over both the west and east coasts in the next five days, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall” is expected till at least July 12 over the Konkan coast, indicating that more than 75% of monitoring stations are expected to receive some measure of rain with high changes of thundershowers and occasional intense spells of heavy rain in isolated locations. Westerly winds of speeds between 10 and 15 knots, gusting to 20 knots, have been forecast.“The synoptic situation is once again favourable for rains, and we will see a revival of monsoon over the next week. Mumbai has been placed under a yellow category storm warning alert on Friday, Sunday and Monday. There may be waterlogging in some areas. Till Tuesday, Mumbai may get up to 300mm of rain,” said a spokesperson with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. An independent forecaster predicted that Mumbai may get between 250mm to 400mm of rain by Tuesday, with 250mm being a “conservative estimate”.Normal to above normal rainfall is expected till around July 18, after at least a week of “large deficient” rains, as per rainfall data available on IMD’s website. From July 1 to July 7, Mumbai received only 25.7mm of rain, which marks a negative 88% departure from the seasonal normal of 221.8mm.Rainfall will be accompanied by a dip in temperature. While daytime maximum temperature stood at 31.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday, a consistent decline is predicted touching 29 degrees Celsius on July 14.

08-07-2021||Mumbai||Cabinet reshuffle: MVA allies close ranks; Shiv Sena vs BJP to intensify||The uncertainty in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition seems to be over at least for now, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) giving a clear signal to the Shiv Sena, with the elevation of former chief minister Narayan Rane as a Union minister. Rane, a bitter critic of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is expected to play a crucial role as the BJP launches an offensive against the Sena, which, according to the BJP, betrayed the mandate to form a government with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. In fact, the induction of four ministers from Maharashtra in the union cabinet is expected to have several effects on state politics. The selection of ministers has shown that former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis continues to call the shots in Maharashtra BJP, although there have been murmurs of protests against “outsiders” being preferred for ministerial berths at the central government instead of party loyalists – three of the four new ministers from Maharashtra joined the BJP from the Congress or NCP in the past few years. The development will help the ruling MVA partners keep their internal differences aside. For several weeks, speculations were rife that the BJP and Sena would bury the hatchet and reunite to form a government in the state. It began on June 8 when Thackeray called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking the Centre’s intervention to restore the reservation given to Marathas. After the formal meeting, Modi had a one-on-one informal meeting with Thackeray. With both the BJP and Sena keeping quiet on what was discussed in the Thackeray-Modi meeting, there were speculations that the BJP had given an offer to the Sena chief to return to the NDA and form the government with the BJP in the state. Following the June 8 meeting, the Sena softened its criticism of the BJP-led government at the Centre. BJP’s hardest critic Sanjay Raut even had a closed-door meeting with BJP leader Ashish Shelar. The developments assumed significance as they took place in the background of the Congress-Shiv Sena tussle as the latter launched a campaign to improve its organisational strength. There were also speculations that the makeover of union cabinet was delayed as the BJP wanted to accommodate the Sena in the cabinet reshuffle. However, Rane’s selection as a cabinet minister has cleared the air. Sena’s ruling alliance partners are now convinced there is unlikely to be a BJP-Sena reunion in the near future. In fact, a day before Rane was inducted in the union cabinet, Thackeray while speaking to the media ruled out a BJP-Sena reunion. “The BJP was trying to lure Sena back in the NDA as the party wants its government in a crucial state like Maharashtra. Rane’s induction is a signal that the BJP will go hammer and tongs against the Sena,” said a senior Congress minister. The first step would obviously be the elections to most of the civic bodies, including Mumbai and district councils, to be held in six to eight months. “We would not be fighting these polls, which are considered mini assembly elections, together, but there would be a mutual understanding with the aim of gaining an edge over the common enemy, the BJP. It will help us in fight against the BJP rather than fighting among ourselves. The BJP’s aggressive stand against the Sena will compel all three allies to ensure that the MVA remains at the top in local bodies,” said a Shiv Sena minister who is part of the team that is drawing Sena strategy for the elections. “The bonhomie between the Sena and Congress-NCP, which was seen initially but was missing for the past few months, is now visible again. The three parties closed the ranks and ensured that they dominate the two-day monsoon session that was held last week. The allies were on the same page when it was decided to suspend 12 BJP MLAs for misbehaviour with the presiding officer of the assembly. It not only took the BJP by surprise, but has also affected its floor strength significantly,” he added. Meanwhile, Thackeray charged up party leaders at district level by directing them to reach out to the people in a bid to prepare for the forthcoming local body elections. He also advised them to increase the party’s base across the state. On Thursday, Shiv Sena sought to downplay Rane’s induction. Raut has said that Rane’s induction cannot be linked with his rivalry with the Sena. “The ministers are not inducted in the cabinet to target any political rival, they are meant to serve the nation,” he said. Raut also taunted Rane that the latter got a “micro” (read insignificant) portfolio though he is former chief minister of Maharashtra. Narayan Rane, who assumed charge as the MSME minister on Thursday, took a dig at Thackeray and said the latter is not big hearted to congratulate him. He also said that NCP chief Sharad Pawar congratulated him for the success in his ministry. Devendra Fadnavis said on Thursday, “Rane has been inducted into the cabinet on the basis of his calibre and nothing else.” Referring to induction of Rane, Kapil Patil and Bharati Pawar all of whom crossed over to the BJP from Congress or NCP in past few years, Raut remarked: “Modi should thank us (three ruling parties in Maharashtra) for providing union cabinet ‘human resource’.” A BJP leader said, “Leaders are feeling left out. At the same time, leadership has opened the doors for leaders from other parties ahead of the crucial local body elections. The top leadership is more concerned about strengthening its base across the state.” Political analyst Pratap Asbe said there could be resentment within the BJP, but nobody will dare to speak against the leadership. “The BJP’s internal set-up is such that no leader can dare to speak against the leadership as they are aware of the repercussions.” “Fadnavis had inducted Bharati Pawar in the party and had recommended Karad for Rajya Sabha. Though he was not very keen on Rane’s induction in the party three years ago, he realised that the Konkan leader can be useful in tackling the Sena. Fadnavis was instrumental in Rane’s elevation as a union minister. There is no doubt that Fadnavis’s is the last word in the party, although it has led to resentment among senior leaders,” said a BJP functionary. According to leaders, prominent OBC face Pankaja Munde is unhappy over selection of Bhagwat Karad as a minister instead of her sister and BJP MP from Beed, Pritam Munde. Munde does not share cordial relations with Fadnavis. A group of party workers supporting her gathered outside her Mumbai residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cabinet-reshuffle-mva-allies-close-ranks-shiv-sena-vs-bjp-to-intensify-101625768666493.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Police file FIR, send notice to GitHub after Muslim women ‘put up for sale’ on app||The Delhi Police on Thursday said it has registered a first information report (FIR) against unidentified persons, four days after pictures of several Muslim women were uploaded without their consent on an app called “Sulli Deals” to imply that these women were “up for sale”. ‘Sulli’ or ‘Sulla’ is a derogatory slang used to refer to Muslims.The police have also sent a notice to source code depository platform GitHub, using which these images were uploaded, asking it to share “relevant details”. Police are awaiting a reply from Github to ascertain the exact number of women who were subjected to the sexual harassment, which came to fore only after a few of the targeted women took to social media with screenshots to highlight the harassment. Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said a case of sexual harassment under Indian Penal Code’s Section 354-A was registered on Wednesday following a complaint received on National Cybercrime Reporting Portal regarding “Sulli Deals Mobile Application”. “The case has been registered by the cyber crime unit (CyPAD) and investigation has been taken up. We have also sent notices to GitHub for sharing relevant details,” Biswal said. Police said the images were uploaded on the app on July 4 and included those of several known journalists and activists in India and abroad. The app was hosted by GitHub, a provider of Internet hosting. The app was taken down following widespread criticism on social media and after a few women, whose images were uploaded, sought police action. One of them used Twitter to update that she has filed a case in this regard in Noida. When contacted for a statement, a GitHub spokesperson said, “GitHub has longstanding policies against content and conduct involving harassment, discrimination, and inciting violence. We suspended user accounts following the investigation of reports of such activity, all of which violate our policies.” A senior CyPAD officer, who asked not to be named, said they have sought details from GitHub to know who created the mobile app and used the platform to upload the objectionable content. “We also want to know from where that app was developed and who all were involved in its creation.Our investigation will proceed further, once we get the details from GitHub,” the officer said. On Wednesday, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) issued a notice to the Delhi Police, seeking an action taken report in the matter by July 12. “Many women had to leave social media platforms after their images got circulated. This is a very serious matter constituting cyber crime. We have asked the cyber crime cell of the Delhi Police to provide us with relevant information about the same,” DCW chief Swati Maliwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-file-fir-send-notice-to-github-after-muslim-women-put-up-for-sale-on-app-101625768546445.html

Residents of the area caught the taxi driver at the spot and handed him to the police, who arrested and booked him for rash and negligent driving causing death and injuries.A medical examination confirmed that the driver was not drunk when the incident took place, the officer added.The dead man was identified as Kallu, a resident of Seemapuri in northeast Delhi, and the injured man as 68-year-old Kanta Bhai, who lives with his family in Jahangirpuri. Both sold vegetables on the pavement outside the Daryaganj vegetable market for several years, a police officer aware of the matter said.The two men were arranging vegetables along the footpath around 3.45am on Thursday when the vehicle, which came from the Delhi Gate side, hit them.“The driver, Sachin, (25) told us that he was looking at the map on his mobile phone which was on his lap while he drove. He said that because he was distracted, he did not see the men and hit them with his vehicle. Three passengers were seated in the cab when the incident took place,” said the police officer, who asked not to be named.Kallu was taken to the nearby Lok Nayak hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Kanta Bhai was referred to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for better treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taxi-runs-into-vegetable-vendors-at-daryaganj-one-dead-101625768485882.html
08-07-2021||Other||Delhi’s driving test tracks set for slew of reforms||The Delhi state transport department is rolling out a plan aimed at improving services at its automated driving test tracks by introducing an electronic queue management system, increasing operation timings, allowing people to take driving tests on all days of the week, and reducing human intervention in the testing process.The department floated a tender on Thursday to outsource the operation and maintenance of all ADTTs in the city, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. “The idea is to offer a comfortable experience to applicants who visit our regional transport offices (RTOs) to give driving tests for a permanent driving licence (DL),” said Gahlot. “To give an example, the experience will be similar to what one witnesses during visa application for countries like the UK or Japan. Currently, the entire driving test system is manned by our own government officials, which leads to a lag in service delivery as the demand is high and the manpower scarce. So, outsourcing the job will help address all these issues, while simultaneously ensuring that the quality of the service offered to customers is premium,” said the state transport minister.Three years after the Delhi government introduced the city’s first ADTT in 2018, such tracks are operational in 10 locations.The tender document, a copy of which was seen by HT, states that the operation hours during which driving tests will have to be conducted will be from 8am to 8pm -- a 12-hour window against the seven-hour window, from 9am-4pm, currently in place for an applicant to take the driving test. It also says that driving tests will be conducted on all days of the week, instead of six days. The system is likely to be put in place in three months, once the tender process is complete, officials said. Ashish Kundra, Delhi’s transport commissioner, said that some of the operational tracks conduct tests for two-wheelers and four-wheelers sequentially. He said that, under the new system, the number of tests conducted in a single day will also increase as multiple applicants will be assessed parallelly on different tracks in a single centre. “Our automated test tracks have already reduced human intervention and the subsequent requirement of manpower. The test results are now given immediately without any scope of manipulation. But the existing operational hours and days limit the number of people who can take the test in a day. The idea is to further remove manual intervention and create a system where the transport department only has to play a supervisory role. Once appointed, the company will have to supply trained manpower for managing the driving licence test services and maintenance of hardware and equipment at the sites,” said Kundra. He said special focus will also be given to ensure people do not have to wait long at the centre for the test. “The applicants of DL skill tests will file online applications. The facilitation/DL test executives (two at each centre), will receive the applicants and will verify the documents as per the Department’s instructions; The applicants... will be taken to the test site in batches on their turn. They will be escorted to the test site by the site manager. The applicants will be entertained using the EQMS system and no candidate will need to stand in a queue. The DL test engineer (one at each site) will ensure that the tests are taken by automated software and he will be responsible to hand over the computerised results to the MLO/MVI. He will also ensure the compliance of other provisions of CMVR i.e. seat belt, rear view mirror etc,” said the tender document.The project will first be rolled out from ADTTs at Loni road, Rohini, Shakur Basti, Janakpuri, Sarai Kale Khan and Raja Garden. For other sites, the 12-hour shift will be decided by the transport department based on the volume of applications.Reshma Juneja (24), a consultant, said her recent experience of giving the driving test at the automated track in Mayur Vihar Phase 1 was good. “But I failed the test. I think practice is important because now in Delhi driving test is not like old times when the government official would pass your test even if you’ve performed miserably. It’s all sensor based now. I had to wait quite a bit for my turn to come, I hope with the new system that you’re taking about, this improves,” she said. Ravindra Kumar, senior principal scientist, transportation planning and environment division, CRRI said the government should also bring in other driver’s learning infrastructure to become holistic in its approach. “Simulators are important. The government should also bring in simulators in some of its centres to prep the applicants. It should also empanel a set of authorised driving schools and create a set of guidelines which need to be followed by such institutions as then it will help ensure all driving and traffic rules are imparted correctly and inculcated in all the learner’s,” he said. Delhi currently has 11 ADTTs, and another track being constructed in Hari Nagar will be ready by next January. The transport department is in talks with Maruti, which owns two automated tracks, and Ashok Leyland, which owns one, to use their centres for driving licence tests. The first automated driving test track was built at Sarai Kale Khan in February 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-driving-test-tracks-set-for-slew-of-reforms-101625768426497.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||DERC left with only one member as chief retires on July 4||The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) is left with only a single member with its chairperson justice (retd.) SS Chauhan retiring on July 4, who, before demitting office, wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal urging him to extend the tenure of the DERC chief till he/she attains the age of 67 years or for a term of five years, whichever comes earlier. The DERC, which is a three-member commission comprising chairperson and two members, is currently left with lone member, AK Ambasht. The second member, AK Singhal, retired in January this year. The commission being left with a single member assumes significance as the power regulator is yet to announce the annual power tariff for 2021-22. “A meeting of the selection committee to appoint a new DERC chief was held on June 28, but there has been no progress since then,” said a senior government official on condition of anonymity. As reported by Hindustan Times on on June 23, the schedule for the annual revision of electricity tariff in Delhi has been delayed by nearly three months. Similarly, the process of selecting a new chairperson for the DERC has also been delayed. Chauhan had joined the commission on July 5, 2018. Under the Electricity Act, 2003, chairman and members of the commission shall hold office for a term of five years or till the age of 65 years, “whichever is earlier”. He turned 65 on July 4. One June 29, Chauhan wrote to the L-G seeking an extension of his tenure till he attains the age of 67. He mentioned several court orders in his letter to back the demand. Chauhan said on Thursday he received no response from the L-G and, hence, had to retire from his position. “I joined this commission on July 5, 2018, and I have completed only three years and there cannot be any difference between a commission and a tribunal where the high court judge is appointed after his retirement. The only question is whether the age of retirement of the high court judge and chairman of the commission should be 67 years as ruled by the Supreme Court in the Madras bar association case… The commission is headed by me and would be without a chairman on July 4, 2021, when I demit office. In order to balance the public interest of the office and taking into consideration the welfare of electricity consumers, it would be proper for your honour to consider the extension of my appointment in the same terms as held by the Supreme Court in the case of Madras bar association (supra). It is therefore prayed that my appointment may also be extended to the age of 67 years or till the new incumbent joins. I will be 65 years of age on 4 July, 2021,” read Chauhan’s letter to Baijal. The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dercleft-with-only-one-member-as-chief-retires-on-july-4-101625768425880.html

Explaining its monsoon plan, a spokesperson of Reliance Infrastructure led-BSES discoms said, “We have geared up to ensure reliable power supply to our 4.5 million consumers while taking all safety measures required during the rainy season. Consumers can play a very important role in ensuring an incident-free monsoon by following simple safety guidelines.”To ensure that over 4.5 million consumers and 1.8 crore residents get uninterrupted power supply, Reliance Infrastructure led BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) are undertaking active measures to minimise moisture accumulation in the grids and panels.“The height of the foundation (base) of transformers in low-lying areas has been increased to safe levels. Proper fencing around all plinth and pole mounted transformers has been done. Due to water-logging, chances of electricity related mishaps are high during monsoon. Simple precautions will help the consumers stay safe. People, especially children, should stay away from electrical installations like electricity poles, sub-stations, transformers, streetlights etc,” said the spokesperson. He added the main switch should be turned off in case of water logging and earth leakage circuit breaker should be installed. Consumers should keep a ‘tester’ at their homes to check leakage in case of wet power switches, said the spokesperson adding people should also prune twigs and plants close to electricity lines.Helpline numbers 19123, 399 99 707 ( south & west Delhi) and 19122, 399 99 808 (east & central Delhi) areas have been set up for consumers to report broken cables, poles or exposed wiring, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bses-issues-advisory-ahead-of-monsoon-onset-101625768367676.html

Given strict instructions to officials to maintain pre-determined water levels at each such reservoir so that water supply is regular and uninterrupted,” tweeted Chadha. Over the last two weeks, several parts of the national capital have been facing acute water shortage with daytime temperatures remaining above the 40 degrees mark, and monsoon being delayed inordinately. Since June 20, parts of Rohini, Dwarka, Mayur Vihar phase-one and two, Patel Nagar, Prem Nagar, Baljit Nagar, Kalkaji, Govindpuri, South Extension and Greater Kailash, have either faced irregular water supply or received less than the prescribed amount because of high pollution in the raw water, and low water levels at the water treatment plants.The Delhi Jal Board supplies 935 MGD (million gallons per day) water to the city as against a total demand of around 1,200 MGD during summer. Last week too, Chadha chaired a high-level meeting with senior DJB officials to chalk out a plan for the equitable distribution of water, tackle issues of supply shortage and water contamination and set up an emergency response team to minimise water-related complaints. The senior Aam Aadmi Party leader also instructed officials to do a constituency-wise analysis of the amount of water received by DJB installations, at regular intervals to ascertain the gap between demand and supply. Many residents and resident welfare associations (RWA) complained about irregular and contaminated water supply being supplied by the DJB. Manoj Singh, a resident of Aya Nagar, said his locality has been receiving water supply only once a day--that too for 30 minutes for the last 15 days. “We used to get water supply from the DJB in the morning and in the evening. These days, they have reduced it to only once a day and that too for only half-an-hour, compared to the one-hour supply earlier. We are a family of six, how do they expect us to make do with limited quantity of water and that too in this weather?,” asked Singh. Arun Kumar, a resident of Badarpur, said despite repeated complaints to local DJB officials, the water supply in his street has not been regularised. “We have not got water for the last one week, and now we are surviving on drinking water cans. The local DJB staff has also stopped answering our calls,” Kumar alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/djb-vice-chief-raghav-chadha-inspects-reservoirs-amid-water-supply-complaints-101625768367082.html

Students who sought admission under the SC/ST and OBC quota submitted an online copy of their reservation certificate on DU’s admission portal. The university announced that it will perform a “forensic verification” of documents once students join the campus and submit the original copies with their respective colleges. However, due to the pandemic, in-person classes are yet to begin. Last year, around 70,000 students applied for seats under the OBC quota, 42,000 in SC quota, 8,600 in the ST category, and 10,173 sought admission under the EWS category. According to the reservation policy of India, 50% of the total seats are reserved for OBCs (27%), SCs (15%), and STs (7.5%) in government educational institutions and government jobs. Besides, the Centre has introduced a quota for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) this year as well.DU colleges forensically check certificates submitted by students at the time of admission, and any forgery leads to cancellation of admission. Hansraj Suman, the chairperson of the forum of academics for social justice and a former academic council member, said, “We have raised the demand of verification of reservation certificates with the university vice-chancellor and Dean of Colleges because in the past we have seen admissions based on fake caste certificates. In the last several years, fake caste certificates of SC, ST, and OBC quotas were found in colleges. What if the same has happened this year as well?”Explaining the process in the previous years, Suman said, “At the time of admission college first verifies the certificates on its own with the help of experts. It then sends the certificates to the authorities who had issued the certificates to verify them. After that, they confirm the admission of students. Nothing like that happened last year due to the pandemic. This can lead to chaos later.”DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani confirmed that the verification has not been done so far. “Even the government offices that could have verified the certificates remained closed for a long time due to Covid-19,” he said.Principals of several colleges said that they will have to cancel the admission of students, if their documents are found to be fake at any point in time. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “We have accepted the self-attested copies of documents of students. In case, they are found to be fake at any point of time, we will have no option but to cancel the admission of such students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-yet-to-verify-caste-certificates-submitted-by-aspirants-in-2020-101625768305788.html

They were booked for murder after a case was registered at the Kapashera police station, deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said.DCP Singh said around 5pm on Wednesday, an e-rickshaw driver, Nawab Ansari, spotted a teenager’s body on a debris heap near the farmhouse in Samalkha near Kapashera and informed the police. A police team reached there and saw that there were laceration wounds on the teenager’s back and a cut mark on the lateral side of the hand. They were also dog bite marks on his body, the DCP said.“Through local inquiry, we identified the boy and met his family members who live in another farmhouse in Samalkha itself. A case of murder was registered and investigation was taken up,” he said.During the investigation, the police said it was learnt that around 11am on Wednesday, the teenager and his two others entered the farmhouse owned by Sandhu. The guard of the farmhouse thought that they had entered to commit a theft. He raised the alarm and caught the teenager, while his friends escaped. Sandhu was also present at the spot.“We learnt that Sandhu and the father-son duo assaulted the boy with sticks. The boy suffered injuries to his head as well. When he tried to flee, some dogs chased and bit him. He finally collapsed on the debris heap, around 60 metres from Sandhu’s farmhouse, and died,” said DCP Singh.Police said the alleged attackers fled the scene after the crime. The investigating team conducted searches and caught Sandhu and the other two attackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmhouse-owner-two-others-held-for-beating-teenager-to-death-on-suspicion-of-theft-101625768248471.html

They hoisted a religious flag and that of the farmers’ union on its domes and injured scores of policemen.According to police, Boota attacked police personnel and ransacked the Red Fort. Maninder brandished two swords on the ramparts of the monument and attacked policemen on duty. Granting relief, the judge said Maninder’s face is not clear in the photographs and videos relied upon by the prosecution in the case. In Boota’s case, the court said the videos and photographs only show his presence at Red Fort and that there is no material on record to show that the accused was involved in any kind of violence or was attacking the police. Lau also observed that the investigating officer is not sure as to whether the act of carrying a ‘talwar’ (sword) or ‘pharsa’ (battleaxe) by Sikhs and Nihangs is prohibited or that the presence of the accused at the Red Fort is a grave offence.The judge also relied upon the observations in the bail order passed by the Delhi High Court in the UAPA case filed against student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, and Asif Iqbal Tanha.“Delhi High Court observed that at a time when the society is polarized and fractured across various lines and ideology reaching a vanishing point, the Court will do all within its mandate to prevent the misuse of the law and alleviate the anxiety which has come to surround these individuals,” the judge noted.Additional public prosecutor Pankaj Bhatia, representing the police, told the court that the case is very sensitive in nature and that the accused should not be granted bail. Advocates Jaspreet Singh Rai and Jagdeep S Dhillon, representing the accused, told the court their clients were being falsely implicated in the case and had no role in the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rday-violence-2-accused-of-attacking-policemen-get-bail-101625768246442.html

The in-situ redevelopment of slum clusters is part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), a flagship mission of the Union government implemented by the ministry of housing and urban affairs that ensures a pucca house to all eligible urban households by 2022. A senior DDA official said, “We have received the bids for five projects so far. We might have to re-tender for one of the projects. A decision will be taken in this regard soon. We are technicallly evaluating these bids, after which work will be awarded to the contractors.”The six projects have been planned in Rohini, Pitampura, Shalimar Bagh, Dilshad Garden, Pooth Kalan and Haiderpur, where 10 JJ clusters will be redeveloped. There are four clusters with over 4,000 households in Rohini’s Sectors 18,19 and 20. Similarly, flats will be constructed for 1,991 households in Haiderpur and 2,645 families in Dishad Garden respectively. Of the 675 slum clusters in Delhi, 499 are on central government land. Under the PMAY, DDA has to carry out in-situ redevelopment of 376 clusters which have come up on its land.The housing agency has completed surveying households, which started in 2019, in 23 slum clusters.Currently, the DDA has three in-situ redevelopment projects in west Delhi’s Katputhli Colony, Jailorwala Bagh in north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar and Kalkaji extension where a total of 5,990 flats are under construction. The official quoted above said the land owning agency plans to take up redevelopment of 16 slum clusters on a public private partnership (PPP) basis by the end of this year, just like the Katputhli Colony project---the first in-situ redevelopment project to be implemented on PPP mode. “Close to 30,000 flats will be constructed as part of these in-situ redevelopment projects. For the first time, DDA has taken up slum rehabilitation projects on such a large scale,” said the official.He added the Katputhli Colony redevelopment work, which was conceived in 2009 but the work started in March 2018, is likely to be completed by early next year. “The work got delayed due to the lockdown that was imposed following the outbreak of Covid-19,” said the official. DDA plans to hire private developers for the in-situ slum development projects, who will construct a multi-storey housing facility for slum dwellers (or beneficiaries identified through the survey), along with commercial spaces on the land where the slum exists. The commercial component will be used by the developer to recover the total cost of the project. The land will be leased to the developer, the period of which will be decided by the DDA.Earlier this year, the DDA had eased the redevelopment norms to allow developers to recover the cost of the project. “The in-situ projects have to be financially viable. For this, some norms were changed. The detailed project report of 10 projects is being finalised and we plan to float tenders for these projects as well,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-dda-finalising-tenders-for-in-situ-houses-for-10-000-families-living-in-slums-101625768247147.html

The Class 10 board exams were cancelled on April 15 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The board announced an assessment scheme for the students on May 1. However, several teachers and students called the policies flawed, saying that they were unfair to meritorious high scorers whose marks will likely be standardised downwards based on the average performance of their school. An NGO, Justice For All, challenged the assessment in the high court. According to its petition, the moderation policy will be “an injustice to the students as the performance of school [is] not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student”.In its affidavit, the board said that in no manner any school will be able to take undue benefit from the policy. It said that if schools ignore the need to ensure that the average marks in each subject are within 2 marks of the subject-wise average reference year marks, according to the petitioner, it will damage the credibility and image of the CBSE across the globe resulting in disadvantage to the students in future.On May 1, the CBSE released a special marking scheme for Class 10 students stating that their results will be tabulated based on their performance in unit tests, half-yearly examination, and pre-board examination conducted by schools.The board, however, said each school should keep a check on inflation of marks and award marks in consonance with its best performance in Class 10 in the last three academic years--2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.The selected year will be the reference year for the schools, and subject-wise marks allotted by the schools for 2021 will be within a range of + or - 2 marks obtained by the school in the subject in the reference year. The board has also said that the overall average marks of the schools for 2021 should not exceed the overall average marks obtained by it in the reference year.However, a plea by an NGO Justice for All through advocates Khagesh Jha and Shikha Sharma Bagga challenged the policy saying that the moderating of the average marks assessed by the school, based on the historical performance of the previous average result of the school, in terms of the best overall performance would be injustice to the students as the performance of school is not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student.”It has also said that moderating the marks in consonance with the overall average score of the district, national and state average “was absolutely unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students of a school which would appear in the board exams for the first time”, with no previous data of performance. The NGO has alleged that it can also lead to the manipulation of marks and exploitation, extortion of the students and parents.Defending its scheme through an affidavit, CBSE has said that the policy has been prepared by a team of experts from the schools, CBSE and it has been kept in mind that no school should be able to do injustice with the students and marks be awarded based on the learning of the student.“Also, the result should not be more than the best result of the past three results. Accordingly, while allowing moderation to the result committee, limits have been fixed. Responsibility has been given to the Result Committee for ensure just, fair and reliable result. Similar policy with extended liberty has been extended in Class-XII policy which has already been approved by the Supreme Court,” the CBSE said.It said that the petitioner had failed to show “any ex-facie perversity or illegality in the process adopted in the evaluation policy”.“…there is neither any illegality in the Evaluation Policy for Class X nor there is any arbitrariness in the Wednesbury sense or unreasonableness or illegality,” the board said.It also said that school management has no role to play in evaluation of students which has to be done by the Result Committee having external members as well adding that there are various checks in the Evaluation Policy for Class X in the form of verification of records by CBSE.It contended that the record would be sealed under the signature o f all members of the Result Committee, kept in the safe custody of the principal.“Further, the said Evaluation Policy provides that in cases where the school deliberately indulges in practices that are not consistent with fair, unbiased and objective practices of assessment, the answering respondent will take serious actions against such schools including action of disaffiliating the said school and/or imposing penalty against the school,” the reply read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tweaking-assessment-policy-for-class-10-will-have-disastrous-consequences-says-cbse-101625768245858.html

But now, we are independent and will be able to identify variants on time, take the right actions and strategise for any of the next waves (of Covid-19), if they break out.”“The facility will help sequence data of the Sars-CoV-2 virus to identify and screen new strains and variants with clinical significance, circulating in and around Delhi NCR [National Capital Region]. This facility can sequence nearly all 30,000 molecules of the coronavirus, in fact, the whole length of the virus. By doing this we can find out any mutations in any part of the virus, not merely the spike protein area.”Dr SK Sarin, ILBS director, said, “After the sequencing, we will be able to identify through the results whether the variant is new or an existing one. It’s not that every variant is extremely dangerous, but we need to be well informed about the new cases logged in Delhi and their variants.”“We already have more than 100,000 samples from previous months and upon the requests of the health minister or the chief minister, we can sequence a portion of them as well. We can sequence more than 300 samples in a week and their results can be made available within five to seven days,” said Sarin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-inaugurates-delhi-s-second-genome-sequencing-lab-at-ilbs-vasant-kunj-101625768125839.html

Many walk till the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway to fill up drinking water in cans from a PMC tap there.It is a single tap near the subway where large queues form to get drinking water.“Water has been one of the major problem in Sus village, and putting pipelines and connecting it from the Baner central line is the proposal. It has been already sent to PMC, but will still take time. For now, we have told PMC, to provide water tanks in every home and to provide water tankers,” said Baburao Chandere, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), corporator from Balewadi. Chandere has been given additional charge by the NCP as “guardian” of Sus and Mahalunge villages.Sus village has a population of 11,000 according to the 2011 census. The village is accessible via Pashan, and many IT professionals opts to stay here.“The population of Sus, can be divided into three different sections - villagers, tenants and service class. Open lands are also always in demand. Developed societies manage to rent water tankers, but villagers are the ones facing a lot of trouble,” says Chandere.Bharat Barde, a tenant in the area said, “We buy water, but our landlord and his son queue up at the PMC tap (on the highway) to get drinking water.”Another resident, Vikas Phadtare said, “During the second partial lockdown, water cans were not easily available.

A joint team of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), police and district administration initiated the process, while residents were asked to evacuate the village at the earliest ahead of the Supreme Court-ordered demolition drive.Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad, said that they have cleared the portions that were demolished in previous drives so that residents do not reconstruct their houses using the construction and demolition (C&D) debris. “We are set to start the drive and have given the last chance for residents to remove their valuables and belongings from their houses, as, once the drive starts, they might lose their valuables. We will not be responsible for any loss,” Yadav said. Four excavation-cum-loader machines, earthmovers and trucks, to ferry debris, were parked outside the village, while the police barricaded the entry and exit points. Visitors were not allowed to enter the village. The trucks made around 100 trips to shift the debris and clear the route, said officials. The drive started around 7.30am on Thursday, when most residents were at Jantar Mantar in Delhi to participate in a demonstration. On June 7, the Supreme Court had directed the MCF to “take all essential measures to remove encroachments on the subject forest land without any exception, not later than six weeks” from the date of the order. Since then, residents of Khori village have been protesting against the order, seeking rehabilitation.Yadav said that they will now start demolishing all unauthorised houses. “We have assigned the responsibilities to four duty magistrates, who, along with police, will carry out the drive. Also, we have constituted 10 teams, that will have officials from civic agencies and police,” he said. Yadav chaired a meeting on Thursday with the district administration officials, police and MCF to review the preparations for the drive. Residents said that despite pressure from the police and the administration, many do not have alternative places to go to.Fifty-two-year-old Kamla Devi, a resident, said, “We are ready to move to the rehabilitation site but where is it? Where will we take our children if we move out? Despite having so many resources, they (authorities) are unable to find a solution and are expecting us to fend for ourselves.” Some residents, however, insist that they will not leave their homes until they are accommodated elsewhere. “Heavy police deployment is seen every day. They come to us and threaten us to leave at the earliest. This has been happening for the past week. We are being treated as criminals, who are not allowed to move in or out, and are also being deprived of basic amenities,” said Hari Singh, a resident.Faridabad Police said their personnel are equipped with anti-riot equipment to handle any escalation of the law and order situation. Senior officials said they are expecting resistance and stone-pelting when the drive starts.OP Singh, the commissioner of police, Faridabad, said that the police personnel were not threatening residents and were only requesting them to vacate the village. “We are only following the apex court’s order and helping the civic agencies with the demolition drive. The teams are deployed for their safety and security, and are even helping them shift out,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decks-cleared-for-demolition-of-houses-in-khori-village-101625764232281.html

No one can force us to leave the house. If anyone tries to force us, we will commit suicide. We are ready for the worst,” he said. On Thursday morning, residents gathered outside their residences around 9.30am in a protest against the demolition drive, even as structures at the village entrance were being razed to pave the way for the upcoming drive. Residents alleged that they have been facing hardships as the supply of drinking water has been stopped for almost a month. Six-year-old Mohit Kumar, who was born in Khori village and lives with his parents, said he has not had any water to drink in two days. “I requested the police uncle to give me one bottle of water but he scolded me,” he said. Residents of Khori were dependent on water tankers and water cans, but the supplies have been cut off. A few residents said they are smuggling water bottles through longer routes to evade the police.Seventy-year-old Shakunta Devi, who recently lost her husband and has two ailing sons, said that she could not take them for treatment as they would not be allowed back into the village. “The small shops in the area also do not have water bottles and the shopkeepers have been directed not to get drinking water so that we are forced leave the village,” she said. Twenty-five-year-old Priya Sharma, who is pregnant, said, “Officials should at least make some arrangements for pregnant women who are in dire need of medical care, food, and water.”Another resident said her two-year-old daughter has been sitting under a tree to protect herself from the heat. “We have no place to go to or money to buy food. We will sit inside our house even when they raze the houses,” said 35-year-old Shabnam Khatun, a single parent who has been living here for the past 15 years. Around 10,000 houses are built illegally on the Aravalli forest land in Khori village. The Supreme Court, on June 7, ordered the demolition of slums encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, holding that there cannot be a “compromise or concession on forest land.” The police refuted the allegations and said residents were allowed to move freely, and that there is a regular water supply through tankers. “We have deployed our teams and checkpoints have been set up at all entry points of the village, but only to ensure that outsiders do not spread violence or misinformation in the village,” said OP Singh, the commissioner of police. Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad, said that water tankers are sent thrice a day and stationed outside the village for residents to get their fill. “Our aim is to get the village vacated and not to harass anyone. We are helping them in every possible way and also providing food to those who are in need. If anyone is facing any kind of water or ration issue, they can approach the district administration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khori-residents-we-are-ready-for-the-worst-will-die-here-101625764231224.html

The project will be taken up in phases from Pachgaon Chowk to Pataudi Chowk and to begin the process, officials have prepared the area around Pachgaon Chowk for plantation of trees, shrubs and flowers. Apart from this year-long project, the two authorities will also work on the greening of central verges and sidewalks of all sector-dividing roads in the city. As per an agreement with Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), which owns the KMP Expressway, the GMDA will plant flowering shrubs on the slopes of the expressway, while trees would be planted on the right of way, wherever it is available and not being utilized by the irrigation department, and orbital rail corridors. The 10-kilometre stretch between Pachgaon Chowk and Pataudi Chowk will be lined with colourful but hardy shrubs and native trees on roadsides, said officials. Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, who also holds the additional charge of additional CEO, GMDA, said that they have been working on a plan to increase tree cover in the district. “There is a long stretch of land available on both sides of KMP (expressway), which can be turned into thick green belts and the work on the plantation would be started as soon as the monsoon hits the city. The stretch from Pachgaon Chowk to Pataudi exit will be taken up in phases and both sides of the expressway, and central verge, would be turned into green belts,” said Yadav.Officials said that the project would later be extended to Dwarka Expressway, Southern Peripheral Road and city roads where there is a scope for the same.“The objective is to reduce the excess heat caused by the creation of heat islands. It has been observed that there is less pollution and heat along roads and areas where there is a high green cover. This work would be carried out in phases and GMDA would be responsible for the upkeep of this plantation,” Yadav said. Subash Yadav, the in-charge of the environment cell of GMDA, said that roundabouts on this stretch will have flowers, green shrubs and trees with a light footprint, wherever there is infrastructure underground. “We will plant native trees along the roadside on the external side and smaller trees on the inside. Slopes will have shrubs and flowers to support the road. The idea is to develop a model plantation that can be replicated along the entire KMP Expressway,” he said. He said that the same process would be undertaken for the internal sector roads of the city. “Pollution will be reduced and the area along the roads would be cooler,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/kmp-expressway-to-have-green-belts-on-sides-flowers-on-central-verge-101625764228999.html

Ahuja issued the directions after finding absenteeism during a surprise check on Wednesday, officials said on Thursday.On Wednesday afternoon, Ahuja visited the planning branch, engineering branch, accounts branch, audit branch, IT branch, tax branch, GIS Lab, establishment branch and the sanitation branch at the MCG’s Sector 34 office.He directed the officers concerned to check the close circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in the MCG’s offices in sectors 34, 42 and Civil Lines offices and ensure they are operational and linked for his perusal.“There had been complaints of officials not being present at their seats, coming late to office, or being absent without any official reason. Hence, to curb such negligence and laxity, I have directed the IT wing to ensure all cameras are functioning and link them to my office and home,” said Ahuja. Ahuja said that he will also check if Covid-appropriate behaviours, such as social distancing and mask discipline, are followed.According to MCG officials, there are around a dozen cameras each at all three office premises.“The CCTV cameras in Sector 34 office were installed just before it became the MCG’s main office. A lot of workers have forgotten about their presence, while most new staff members are unaware of its existence. Hence, it is being firstly checked to verify if they are functional,” a senior MCG official said.The official cited above said that the process is expected to be completed by mid-August.Absenteeism among officials has been a major topic of discussion. After senior MCG officials missed the MCG’s finance and contract committee (F&CC) meetings, mayor Madhu Azad announced in September last year that show-cause notices will be issued to officials who don’t attend the F&CC meetings in the future.In April last year, 30 officials were served show-cause notices after it was found that officials of the establishment branch had stopped coming to the office since a nationwide lockdown was announced in March. Municipal workers were among those exempted from the lockdown.In September last year, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) also installed 15 CCTV cameras at its Sector 14 office to keep a check on the functioning of officials, daily visitors and suspected middlemen, who were allegedly misguiding plot allottees. A senior HSVP official said that all cameras are functional and extensively being used to ensure adherence to Covid-19 norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-officials-to-be-under-constant-vigilance-of-commissioner-101625764227811.html
08-07-2021||Gurugram||Traffic snarl continues at Sirhaul border over RFID payments||For a second consecutive day, traffic flow on the Gurugram to Delhi carriageway of the expressway remained slow as Delhi agencies strictly implemented toll collection through radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and refused to let commercial vehicle drivers pay cash.Officials of the concessionaire appointed by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said that a traffic jam was witnessed from 9.30am to around 1pm, on the second day of digital toll collection, implemented on the orders of the Supreme Court.A senior official of Sahakar Global Venture JV, concessionaire of the SDMC, said that they are trying to streamline toll collection through FASTags but there were some problems on the first two days. “We are issuing RFID tags on the spot and also asking vehicle operators to maintain [minimum] balance. Due to lockdown and lack of business, the truck owners are reluctant. We are also working with Gurugram and Delhi traffic police to ensure there are no jams,” the official said. Ravinder Tomar, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gurugram, said that they have asked the concessionaire to collect the toll in lanes dedicated for the SDMC so that traffic is not affected on the main carriageway. “We have also asked them to install signage at different spots so that commercial and other traffic gets segregated. A meeting will be held again on Friday to discuss the matter. The issue of congestion will be resolved in the next couple of days,” said Tomar.The RFID tags issued by SDMC are meant to collect environmental cess and toll from commercial vehicles entering Delhi. These tags are different from the ones issued by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), said officials.An order issued by Hemant Kumar Fauzdar, additional deputy commissioner (toll tax), SDMC, on July 1, stated that the Supreme Court and Commission for Air Quality Monitoring have directed a cashless collection of environment compensation cess (ECC) and toll for specified commercial vehicles entering Delhi. “It has also been directed that commercial vehicles without RFID tags and sufficient recharge be not permitted to enter Delhi from July 1,” the order stated. Commuters, meanwhile, said that the traffic situation worsened after 11am as trucks and container vehicles started lining up. “Vehicles were stuck from Sirhaul border up to Shankar Chowk, and even beyond,” said Parvesh Kumar, a commuter. Another commuter, requesting anonymity, said that many people bound for the airport suffered due to the delay as many vehicles either did not have the RFID cards or did not have sufficient balance. “The jam spills over to the main carriageway and this causes problems to all commuters,” the commuter said.Bhushan Yadav, a truck driver who was stuck on the service lane, said that he makes only two trips across the border per month, due to which balance is not maintained. “The environment cess, when the truck is empty, is exempted, but despite that, it is being deducted in full through RFID and returned later. We don’t want the money to get stuck in the system as it is easier to pay cash. Also, at some entry points, the payment is manual,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/traffic-snarl-continues-at-sirhaul-border-over-rfid-payments-101625764226263.html

The ETPB was established to look after the Evacuee Trust Properties/land left over by Sikh/Hindus who migrated to India during partition in 1947-48. The provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), formerly known as the North West Frontier Province, took the decision to hand over the gurdwara to the ETPB on July 7 (Wednesday). A source in the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) claimed that this will be the first gurdwara in the north of Pakistan, where the Sikh diaspora will now have an opportunity to visit. An architectural masterpiece, the Kashmir Road multi-storey gurdwara built in 1905, still retains its original architecture. “On July 7, a meeting was held in the Peshawar civil secretariat; from the ETPB, Imran Gondal, additional secretary, shrines, attended it. After thorough deliberation, special secretary, local government, KPK showed willingness to give possession back to the ETPB. The possession has been given back after 20 years,” an ETPB spokesperson claimed, adding that presently, a library is being run in the gurdwara.A group of people wanted to destroy the gurdwara during the Partition, but failed due to the resistance of influential landlord Khan Ayub Khan. Khan believed that after the departure of Sikhs/Hindus from the region, this and other architectural places abandoned by them should be preserved as great assets of the newly-formed country. A story published in English daily Dawn quoted Mohammad Tariq, an assistant at the library, as saying, “Sikh saint Sardar Gopal Singh Saithi of Hazro had laid the foundation stone of gurdwara in 1905.” Tariq is also quoted as saying, “This building remained under the control of several government departments for years, while a school was established here after the Partition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/historic-gurdwara-handed-over-to-etpb-first-in-north-pakistan-101625762846358.html

My protest will continue till the police lodge an FIR and hand me a copy of the FIR,” she added.Former MLA and advocate Harish Rai Dhandha, who reached the office of the police commissioner in support of the woman, said cops were reluctant to take action against the MLA at the behest of a Congress minister. Without naming the minister, Dhanda said, “Police are helpless puppets in the hands of the man who lives in Model Gram area and is stopping the police from taking action against Bains.” Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said police will lodge an FIR after recording the statement of the woman.

Awareness programmes will also be conducted to educate people about the harm which rearing of Thai mangur can cause. Moreover, fish breeders will be encouraged for cultivation of local breed of fishes,” said district fisheries officer SR Yadav.Handia police on Monday intercepted a truck carrying around 30 quintals of Thai mangur that was being transported to Haryana from West Bengal for sale and consumption. The estimated cost of the fish was around ₹10 lakh. The consignment was disposed of by the fisheries department. Three persons who were accompanying the consignment were booked under relevant sections. Police officials said that fishes were kept in a large polythene sheet that was shaped into a pond inside the truck.“Thai mangur or African catfish is banned by NGT some years back. It is a highly aggressive breed of fish. The carnivorous fish survives and breeds rapidly in any type of water and environment. As it can also survive in contaminated waters it poses serious threat to people’s health,” said Yadav.As Thai mangur grows upto 3 kilograms within few months, fish breeders often rear it for more profits. A kilogram of fish could be sold for upto ₹100 in fish markets. As it was profitable and easy to breed, Thai mangur farming still goes on illegally despite being banned by NGT and the government, he added.Many awareness programmes have been launched in the past to stop farming of Thai mangur in the district as it is harmful for ecological balance and human health, Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fisheries-dept-in-prayagraj-to-keep-strict-vigil-on-rearing-sale-of-thai-mangur-101625761768073.html

The building, with a plot size of seven kanal was lying abandoned now, but had served as a police station till recently. Nanakshahi bricks are being used in the restoration. These are decorative bricks that were used for structural walls during the Mughal era. The building, located near the Tehsil Chowk in Tarn Taran city, is among eight buildings constructed by the British government in Amritsar and Lahore in the 1900s. Amritsar railway station and the city’s post office are two more instances. Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale inspected the progress of the work on the building on Thursday. Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta had sanctioned ₹2 crore for restoration; of which ₹35 lakh has been received. Nimbale, who had earlier initiated a drive to clean the historic Patti Fort, said, “British government notes show that the building is 110 years old. Previously, it housed the tehsil and treasury offices of Tarn Taran. It was converted into a police station in 1942. This building has also served as a set for films like Udta Punjab and Punjab 1984, due to its historic importance.” He added that the Punjab Police Housing Corporation is carrying out the restoration after consulting archaeological experts. “All artefacts in the building are being restored and nothing will be razed, so that our future generations can learn from history,” he said, claiming that work was likely to completed in two months and the City Police Station will again be shifted here. “We are planting saplings for greenery and plan to shift DSP-City office in this building,” the SSP said, adding that Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has also been engaged for installing a water harvesting system in the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-police-restoring-british-era-building-in-tarn-taran-101625761766321.html

The PPCB had sent a team to the site, after a video of the tubewell went viral on social media on Thursday. Farmers and owners of the land where the tubewell is located, claimed that they had been raising the issue for over ten years, but no one listened to their pleas.Kulwinder Singh, 60, the tubewell owner, said a private unit had polluted groundwater. On digging up to over 200metre, the problem started. “The tubewell of my nephew Amrit Singh is also throwing polluted water. Today, a team came to inspect the site. The waste chemicals of the factory were being disposed of into the land using a borewell. This polluted the entire groundwater of the area,” said Kulwinder Singh, who owns five acre. “I irrigate my fields from the tubewells of neighbours. I am not raising this issue for my land, I want to save the next generations from contaminated water,” he claimed.Harmail Singh, a leader of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), said the government should punish those polluting the groundwater. PPCB executive engineer Rajeev Gupta said the factory was dismantled in 2005 and the department had taken up the matter with National Green Tribunal (NGT), which had imposed a fine of ₹2 crore on factory owners, who did not pay up. “Our team has visited the sites. As of now, a tubewell was found throwing out coloured water, but we were told that there are two or three other tubewells. We have sent a report to the state government,” added Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sangrur-tubewell-spews-out-polluted-water-ppcb-blames-dismantled-factory-101625761465985.html

08-07-2021||Mumbai||New report highlights mismanagement of fly ash||A new report released Wednesday has flagged the continuous mismanagement of fly ash produced by thermal power plants in the country. Researchers analysed eight fly ash related accidents that occurred in the last two years, across five states, and found a common thread of “persistent violations” and “neglect”. Despite the scale of damage to communities and the ecology, criminal prosecution has been initiated in only one of these incidents, the authors note. The report has been authored and reviewed by members of three organisations -- including ASAR Social Impact Advisors, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), and Manthan Adhyayan Kendra -- on behalf of the Fly Ash Watch, “described as a collective of individuals and organisations working on the social, environmental, and human health impacts of fly ash on communities and ecosystems.” Fly ash is a byproduct of coal combustion, which generates more than 70 percent of India’s electricity. In 2018-19, the country produced 217 million tonnes of it, up 76 percent of from Coal ash is typically mixed with water and stored in large ash ponds, lined with dykes to hold the slurry in place. These dykes frequent collapse, flooding nearby farms, fields and even homes with toxic ash, which is known to pollute soil, air, water, damage crops, and cause cardio-pulmonary illnesses. “Causes cited for the accidents in official reports range from substandard construction of ash dykes, hydraulic pressure induced by excessive rainfall, to ‘overflow’ in storage units. It is apparent, however, that subpar technical design and a lack of consistent monitoring and revaluation of ash storage methods and structures are the larger issues at hand,” the authors note. Sehr Raheja, co-author, Manthan Adhyayan Kendra said, “The case studies are of structurally unstable ash ponds and leaking ash slurry pipelines that have caused the farms and areas to be covered in toxic coal ash. This can be seen across the incidents in different states.” The report assesses eight such accidents in Jharkhand, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh (which reported three instances in two years), and presents the aftermath of ecological damage, non-compliance with law, non-payment of dues to regulatory authorities and affected communities, poor clean-ups and environmental assessments, protracted legal proceedings conducted in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and inadequacy of ash disposal infrastructure. For example, on August 7, 2019, the ash pond of the Essar TPS breached, trapping six children in their homes, covering more than 100 acres of land in ash slurry, and destroying kharif crops of 500 farmers. A resident of Amelia Village in Singrauli, MP, shared that some of the fly ash is still lying in the fields while another from Sidhikala village, Singrauli, said that some wells within the vicinity of his village were still covered with ash, rendering them unfit for use. Compensation has allegedly not been disbursed in full to many of the affected people, who are now growing wheat in the ash-laden fields with reportedly lower yields. The authors go on to prescribe deterrent and remedial actions, ranging from criminal prosecution, mandatory routine technical assessment of ash ponds, and increasing transparency and public access to information. The report exhorts civil society to hold relevant authorities to account. Medha Kapoor, co-author, ASAR said, “All the flyash breaches are strung by a common thread, which is lack of industrial will towards transparency, accountability, compliance; and a governance system with law enforcement, penalization, and monitoring that routinely fall short.” The Union environment ministry on April 22 published the draft notification to utilise fly ash or legacy ash which is stored by thermal power stations. The notification extended the deadline for TPS’ to ensure “100% utilisation of fly ash by coal- or lignite-based thermal power plants” by 3 to 5 years and “sustainability of fly ash management system” among other provisions, and is open for public feedback for a period of two months from April 22. Shripad Dharmadhikary, Policy Researcher, Manthan Adhyayan Kendra questioned the provision on the term utilisation in the draft notification.“The draft notification as it exists does not make any distinction between the use or utilisation of fly ash, and its disposal. It’s like dumping fly ash on low lying land and dumping ash in abandoned mine voids is called ‘utilisation’, whereas it is nothing more than mere disposal of ash,” he said, highlighting the need to have more safeguards for disposal of this type of waste. Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust, said: “Since ash it is not treated like a raw material that can be used for manufacture of cement and concrete, it is invariably dumped in ash ponds, which are not lined to prevent seepage. As thermal power plants grow older or upgrade their capacity, the height of the dykes are raised without proper engineering because land availability becomes a problem. And even if stored in properly engineered ash ponds, shortage of water in summer results in the ash flying around for several kilometres and poisoning the environment. A better way is to mandate that dry fly ash is stored in silos and transported in air tight bulkers. This would also ensure that the fly ash can be productively used for manufacture of cement, concrete. The MoEF has to recognize that 100% utilization of ash will remain a pipe dream. Wanton dumping should result in prosecution and heavy financial penalties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-report-highlights-mismanagement-of-fly-ash-101625760085352.html

But there’s a story to how he got his screen name. Noted writer, Bhagwati Charan Varma of Lucknow, gave him the name – Dilip Kumar in 1944.“Bhagwati Charan Varma also penned the script of his first film Jwar Bhata,” said Dhirendra Varma,” the writer’s son. “Super star Ashok Kumar used to work with Bombay Talkies as a lead hero in the 1940s. At that time, heroes were employed by production houses on salary basis and were not allowed to work for other production houses. Ashok Kumar had given many hits for Bombay Talkies and was the most popular of all actors of his time. But after the movie ‘Kismat’, Ashok Kumar decided to set up his own production house. So he moved away from Bombay Talkies and the owner of Bombay Talkies Devika Rani was quite upset about it,” he said.Dhirendra Varma said, “She wanted a handsome and versatile actor to replace Ashok Kumar in her production house. She also had a script ‘Jwar Bhata’ penned by my father for the next film. Devika Rani spotted Yusuf Khan and called him for a screen test, which he passed easily. However, she wanted a romantic name for the actor because the script was an intense love story. She thought the name Yusuf Khan didn’t gel with the role.”In fact, Dilip Kumar was also interested in changing his name as he never wanted his father to come to know about him working in a Bollywood film as he was against all this. “And Devika Rani looked up to Bhagwati Charan Varma for a new name for Yusuf Khan,” said Dhirendra Varma.Noted writer Chandra Shekhar Varma, grandson of Bhagwati Charan Varma, said: “My grandfather suggested three names to Devika Rani – Dilip Kumar, Vasudev and Jehangir. Devika Rani wanted Dilip Kumar to choose Vasudev. But Yusuf Khan chose Dilip Kumar for himself. And the rest is history. Dilip Kumar shot to fame from his very first film, but he always remained thankful to Bhagwati Charan Varma for giving him a new identity in the cine world. He always considered Dilip Kumar as a lucky name for himself.”Dhirendra Varma said, “In 2005, I, along with my daughter Shivani Varma, visited Dilip Kumar’s house in Mumbai. He didn’t allow us to leave for 4 to 5 hours and spoke a lot about Bhagwati Charan Varma, literature, Lakhnawi culture, mangoes of Malihabad and Peshawar (where the actor was born). The warmth was exemplary…he was so loving and caring.”“It was the first Monday of Saawan and we were fasting. When he came to know about this, he arranged lassi, mewa and best of phalahari cuisine for us. Such was his eagerness to welcome anyone,” he added.Bhagwati Charan Varma also penned another script ‘Chanakya’ for Dilip Kumar, but that film didn’t work out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-lucknow-link-to-how-yusuf-khan-became-dilip-kumar-101625759125236.html

08-07-2021||Pune||Launches of new real estate projects in Pune fall by 30 per cent: report||According to the latest Gera Pune residential realty report for the period January 2021 to June 2021, Covid-19 induced lockdown and restrictions imposed to curb the virus spread has adversely affected new launches in Pune’s residential realty sector during June 2021. While the new residential property launches have declined by a significant 30 per cent, the available inventory for sale plunged to a nine-year low, which according to the report, was mainly due to the robust sales coupled with a lack of new supply to replace the sales. For every 100 units sold only 59 units was added, stated the report. The report is an outcome of the census-based study of the residential realty market of Pune. It is based on primary and proprietary research conducted by Gera developments and covers all existing projects in a 30-km radius of the city centre. Talking about the latest trends in Pune’s residential real estate market, Rohit Gera, managing director, Gera developments, said, “The market has been in an ongoing state of consolidation. With the number of new project launches declining, the unsold inventory has plunged to a seven-year low. Going forward, we believe that price rise seen in the past one year will gain further momentum. The surge in residential real estate prices will be due to decline in adequate inventory to meet the growing demand. Whenever demand outstrips supply, prices tend to go up.” According to the report, fewer new schemes and units were launched in the first half of 2021, which saw a fresh supply of 26,611 units. This was 26 per cent higher than the same period in 2020. However, sequentially it has come down by 30 per cent compared to second half of 2020. Comparing it with pre-Covid times, it is still half of what it was in December 2019 just before Covid hit the country, indicating supply squeeze prevailing in the Pune residential real estate space, stated the report. In fact, comparing the period from January 2020 to June 2021 against the corresponding period, there is a reduction of 39 per cent in new inventory being added to the market. “With new project launches at unprecedented lows, the robust demand will face supply-side bottlenecks. This has already propelled a 3.73 per cent surge in property prices on an average, over the past 12 months. However, as new project launches firm up, the prices, while maintaining their upward bias, will stabilize in the medium term,” further added Mr. Gera. He also underlined the increase in cost structure for developers. “In addition to the supply crunch, there is a tremendous increase in the cost structures for developers. The last 15 months have seen slower construction and project launches and as a result, the overhead costs for developers have increased. More significantly, the cost of several raw materials including the most critical items such as cement and steel have risen by 25% - 40%,” he further went on to say. According to report, inventory levels plunged to a 9-year low in June 2021. The report stated, the inventory available for sale has also reduced to 59,224 units, a reduction of 21% from 75,421 units a year ago. The total number of ongoing projects has also dropped significantly from a peak of 3,733 projects in Jun 2017 to 2,730 in Jun 2021. Assessing the percentage inventory available for sale indicates that 79.5% of the total inventory has been sold. This means, the level of 20.5% of the unsold inventory is the lowest level seen in the last decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/launches-of-new-real-estate-projects-in-pune-fall-by-30-per-cent-report-101625758765281.html

Prof Dandekar contributed in a varied manner to socio-economics, politics and mainly to agricultural economics and left his imprint on numerous domains such as logic of price policy in agriculture, crop insurance, irrigation policy, and cattle population of the country. His seminal work on estimation of poverty, carried out along with Prof. Nilkanth Rath, gave rise to a very significant debate on poverty and poverty line in India, he explained. In order to commemorate Prof Dandekar, a book titled “An Unparalleled Economist: Professor VM Dandekar” was jointly edited by Dr Manasi Gore, Dr Meenal Annachhatre and Prof Vilas Adhav, all from the Economics department, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/book-on-veteran-economist-dandekar-released-by-sppu-economics-department-101625758525340.html

According to officials, an approach road to a small bridge over Kataha, a hilly river originating from Nepal, collapsed at Marjadi village in Gaunaha block at West Champaran on Thursday morning, disrupting the communication between Marjadi and Marjadpur villages. Ajay Prakash Rai, block development officer (BDO), Gaunaha, said, “The approach road to the bridge collapsed owing to the erosion. We are looking forward to restoring the communication between the two villages.” Meanwhile, in the wake of heavy water discharge from the Valmikinagar barrage on Thursday afternoon and incessant rain in the catchment area, the Gopalganj district administration has alerted the villagers dwelling in the low lying area along the Gandak river. “Around 1000 people have been shifted to the safer location. Things are under control,” Dr Nawal Kishor Choudhary, district magistrate (DM), Gopalganj, said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flood-fury-approach-road-to-bridge-collapses-in-west-champaran-101625757625211.html
08-07-2021||Patna||Both EVMs and ballot papers in Bihar panchayat polls||The panchayat polls in Bihar, due to begin in August this year, will be conducted both through electronic voting machines (EVMs) and ballot papers, a top poll official said, citing shortage of EVMs.Earlier, State Election Commission had said these polls would be conducted entirely through EVMs.Under the new plan, elections for all four posts in the three-tier panchayat raj institutions of gram panchayat, mukhiyas, panchayat samiti members and district board members, would be held through EVMs. In case of gram kutcheries, which have judicial functions, election to the posts of sarpanch and panch would be held through ballot papers, sources said. SEC secretary Yogendra Ram said the preparations were afoot to hold the polls through both EVMs and ballot papers. The SEC had foreseen a requirement around 7-8 lakh EVMs for conducting the polls for all posts through EVMs in less number of phases. But reports from various states about lack of availability of single-post EVMs (an old model) has put paid to plans. “As per our latest assessment, we expect to get around 2 lakh single-post EVMs from southern and northern states. So far, there is confirmation of about 1.83 lakh EVMs. That’s why we have to think of conducting the polls both through EVMs and ballot papers,” said an SEC official engaged in poll preparations. In all, there are total 2.58 lakh posts in the PRIs, of which 1.14 lakh are of ward members in gram panchayats and an equal number of panch in the gram kutcheries. The panchayat polls, scheduled to held in March and April, have got delayed first due to dispute between SEC and Election Commission of India ( ECI) over getting EVMs and later due to the second wave of the Covid pandemic in April. Meanwhile, sources said nodal officers from all 38 districts in the state have been already dispatched to various states to ferry the EVMs within next one week so that the first level checking of voting machines could begin from July 15. There are possibilities that the SEC will be sending the schedule of polls to the state government for approval in the next few days so that a formal notification is issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/both-evms-and-ballot-papers-in-bihar-panchayat-polls-101625757565914.html

The children, some as young as three months old, left along with their guardians by air for specialised medical treatment to the Ahmedabad-based hospital, run by the Prashanti Medical Services and Research Foundation. The state government has an agreement with the foundation for free medical treatment and care of children suffering from congenital heart diseases like hole in the heart or ventricular septal defect. Among the children, three each were from Gopalganj, Madhubani and Vaishali; two each from Madhepura, Saran and Begusarai and one from Gaya. This is the second batch of children which has been sent to the foundation’s hospital. Earlier, 20 children were sent to the Ahmedabad-based hospital on April 2. Of them 20 had been cured while one was still undergoing treatment, said a communique by the state health department. The children were shortlisted by a team of experts from the foundation as well as doctors from the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences. The state government, based on previous experience, has decided to allow an additional attendant, besides the mother in case of children below six years of age. The state government bears the transportation cost up to ₹10,000 each for the child and the eligible attendants, for treatment outside the state. The Bihar government launched the Bal Hriday Yojana (BHY) this year after the state cabinet approved it on January 5. The BHY, conceived last year and linked with the government’s “Saat Nishchay (seven resolves) Part 2” programme, provides free additional medical and healthcare to children afflicted with heart-related ailments. The state health department had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Gujarat-based foundation on February 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/children-with-hole-in-heart-to-be-operated-free-in-ahmedabad-101625757565228.html

08-07-2021||Patna||Bihar heading for mid-term polls, says Chirag||Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan, who has been battling a coup in his party, on Thursday said Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) could split anytime and that the state was staring at mid-term polls.Accusing Kumar of engineering the split in LJP, Paswan said the Bihar CM had undermined his own party leaders and party just to keep one man (Chirag) out of the union cabinet. “I never craved for a ministerial berth, but I still don’t know from which party’s quota my uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras has been inducted in the union cabinet. It appears Nitish Kumar has sacrificed his own party leaders, especially Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh, to thwart me,” Paswan said from Samastipur, where he stayed overnight as part of his ongoing “Ashirvad Yatra”. Paras, the younger brother of LJP founder and Paswan’s father late Ram Vilas Paswan, recently led a rebellion by five of the six party MPs and successfully ousted Chirag Paswan as leader of the party in Lok Sabha. On Wednesday, Paras was inducted as a minister in latest reshuffle of Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi cabinet. On whether he felt let down by the BJP, Chirag said when he was cheated by his own, he could not carry a grudge against anyone else. “Time will tell everything. I never had any personal expectations from anyone,” he said. The Jamui MP said the way Lalan Singh, who played a key role in orchestrating split in the LJP at the behest of Kumar, was overlooked clearly points to an impending upheaval in JD(U), which could lead to mid-term elections. “Kumar went to lengths to see Paras through and that is why the ministerial berth that belonged to Lalan Singh was snatched from him. This has caused dissatisfaction within JD-U and could lead to a split. Many JD-U leaders are also in touch with us,” he said. Chirag said he was currently busy building up his own party organisation and his “Ashirvad yatra” would crisscross the state after which he would launch a trek (paidal yatra).On the two factions of LJP claiming to be the real one, he said the matter was pending with the Election Commission and till it was decided, he continued to be the president of the LJP. “Making anyone minister is the prerogative of the Prime Minister. I have also written to the Lok Sabha Speaker to review his decision to accord the legislature party leader status to Paras, citing the party constitution. Now the matter is also in the court. Justice will be done one day. I had also written to PM Narendra Modi in this regard and that is why I am surprised which party quota my uncle belongs to,” he said. He said that rest of the LJP MPs, who went with Paras, would also realise as to what did they achieve. “My uncle became a minister, but what did others get eventually? The realization will sink in sooner than later,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-heading-for-mid-term-polls-says-chirag-101625757445382.html
08-07-2021||Bangalore||Congress’ Siddaramaiah terms Cabinet reshuffle ‘insignificant’||Senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets on Thursday demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister of finance Nirmala Sitharaman. Siddaramaiah said that the Prime Minister is responsible for all the failures that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has suffered since 2014 and held Sitharaman responsible for ‘failed policies’.If the performances of ministers were the yardstick to reshuffle the cabinet, @narendramodi should have been removed from @PMOIndia first.He is directly responsible for all the failures of @BJP4India govt since 2014.#FailedReshuffle“If the performances of ministers were the yardstick to reshuffle the cabinet, Narendra Modi should have been removed from PMO first. He is directly responsible for all the failures of the BJP government since 2014,” the former Karnataka chief minister tweeted, tagging official handles of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Prime Minister’s office and of Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself.It was @narendramodi who appeared on TV repeatedly to announce all #Covid19 related decisions including that of banging vessels.But @drharshvardhan was removed for #Covid19 mismanagement.Is it not @narendramodi who had to resign?#FailedReshuffleSiddaramaiah took potshots at the Union finance minister next, blaming her for what he termed ‘failed policies’. He said that the demonetisation exercise and the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime ‘pushed the country to distress’. In his tweet he tagged Nirmala Sitharaman and asked her to step down while claiming that she was ‘responsible for all the economic failures.’.@narendramodi had called for ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governence’ when he came to power.Now there are 77 ministers.Is this Minimum Government?This is 'Maximum Government, Minimum Governance'#FailedReshuffleIn his series of tweets, Siddaramaiah used the hashtag ‘Failed Reshuffle’ to criticise the induction of the new ministers to the Union cabinet. He also lamented the stepping down of Harsh Vardhan from the post of Union health minister claiming that major Covid-19 related decisions were undertaken by the Prime Minister.He also said that with 77 ministers the BJP-led government walked back on its promise of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’ and said that the inductions show ‘maximum government, minimum governance’. He also said that the induction exercise was insignificant as the Prime Minister ‘takes all the major decisions’.None of the 6 ministers from Karnataka are from backward classes. 3 are Brahmins and 1 each from Lingayat, Vokkaliga and SC community. I have no objection to ministers from any caste but what happened to the social justice?There is no representation for more than 50% Ktaka.Siddaramiah in reference to the recent reports of factionalism in Karnataka BJP said that the party lacks internal democracy. Several Congress leaders including Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi and senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge attacked the government after the Cabinet reshuffle.However, four MPs from Karnataka were inducted into the Union cabinet as Union ministers of state on Wednesday.

08-07-2021||Jaipur||After 9-years, Rajasthan govt again pushes for a legislative council||The Rajasthan government has decided to ask the Central government to constitute a legislative council, a move, which the opposition leaders and experts see as aimed to control dissent in the ruling party.According to a government statement, a proposal to constitute the legislative assembly will be sent to Parliament after getting a nod of the state assembly. Amid talks of the cabinet reshuffle on cards, the state’s decision to push for legislative council has surprised many. If the Centre approves its constitution then the cabinet’s size will increase - 15% of the total members of the state assembly and council. Earlier also, such a proposal was sent to the Centre twice – in 2008 by Vasundhara Raje and in 2012 by Ashok Gehlot when the UPA was in power at the Centre. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice had sought the opinion of the state government regarding the suggestions of the Standing Committee of Parliament on the proposal to constitute the Legislative Council, which was passed in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly on 18 April 2012. After nine years, the state government is submitting its opinion, according to a government official. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan took the decision on legislative council two days after the West Bengal passed a resolution supporting an ad hoc committee report that favoured the creation of a legislative council amid opposition by the BJP. West Bengal Legislative Council was set up in 1952 and abolished in 1969.Currently, there are only six states in India that have Legislative Councils. They are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. Jammu and Kashmir also had the Upper House until the state was bifurcated into two Union territories in 2019. According to the Constitution, any legislative council of a state cannot have more than one-third of members of the state assembly or less than 40. The council cannot be dissolved and its member’s tenure is of six years. Commenting on the constitution of the council, state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara said, “The proposal for constituting legislative council has been passed by the cabinet unanimously as Narendra Modi government was continuously delaying it, and a letter was sent again asking whether you want it or not. A unanimous decision has been taken by the cabinet and we want that people and workers should get an opportunity, as this decision was taken unanimously by the previous Gehlot government but BJP government was delaying it.” “I want to urge all BJP leaders, they have their party government led by Modi in the Centre and can get the decision swiftly on this,” he said Deputy leader of Opposition, Rajendra Rathore said after nine years the state government is replying to the letter – it is clearly a move to suppress growing resentment in the Congress party. “The state is not in a healthy financial state due to the pandemic and the ruling government, just to pacify and please their leaders, is making such political stunts. When the BJP government moved such proposal in 2008, the state finance was healthy,” he said. Rathore continued by saying that the move of the Congress government is a ‘lollypop’ to leaders – giving hope of accommodating more, those who are sidelined and even the sitting MLAs, who if lose, can be brought back through council. “The government is constantly being cornered by party MLAs and leaders over the demand of cabinet reshuffle and political appointment. Such circumstances are proving to be challenging for the party as it is difficult to satisfy them,” he said. Political analyst Manish Godha said, “It looks like a message from the chief minister that I am trying to accommodate all. Even the Congressmen know that it is not possible, and mere a political gimmick.” He said this is a political move as in the last 40 years approval has not been given to constitute legislative council to any state. Besides, the constitution of the council requires a two-thirds majority of the parliament, and such approval doesn’t seem to be easy for a Congress-ruled state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/after-9-years-rajasthan-govt-again-pushes-for-a-legislative-council-101625752527042.html
08-07-2021||Kolkata||Four held in Kolkata for running job scam, one posed as police officer||The detective department of the Kolkata Police on Wednesday arrested four men for running a racket that duped youths by offering them jobs as home guards in the police department on payment of cash, said Murlidhar Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime).The case was filed on the basis of a complaint from 20-year-old Samaresh Mahata, a resident of Salboni in the West Midnapore district. He said that he and five of his friends gave the accused men ₹35 lakh in June. The youths were given fake appointment letters, khaki beret caps and belts. One of the accused, Masud Rana, a resident of Ranitala in Murshidabad district, used to pose as a deputy superintendent of police. He even flashed a fake identity card, said Sharma.The accused were arrested from a hotel in central Kolkata. Police seized ₹1.85 lakh in cash, fake appointment letters, beret caps and belts during the raid. It is suspected that the accused cheated more youths. A probe has started. The other three arrested persons are residents of North 24 Parganas, Malda and East Midnapore districts. This is the fourth case in recent weeks in which police have arrested imposters. On Tuesday, a man named Sanatan Roy Chaudhury, who claimed to be a lawyer working for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and also the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was arrested on charges of cheating. A receipt for the BJP membership fee was recovered from him. After the arrest, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “Millions of people become BJP members by paying membership fees by calling up the toll-free number. It is not possible to keep track of everyone. The guilty have to be punished. It is the government’s job to detect imposters.”In a second case, also recorded on Tuesday, eight people were held by the Bengal police at Memari in East Burdwan district for running a job racket. To dupe youths, the accused allegedly flaunted a document purportedly showing the signature of Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. These arrests came days after the detective department of the Kolkata Police arrested Debanjan Deb who posed as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer working for the Kolkata civic body and ran a fake Covid vaccination racket. He was exposed after Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha member Mimi Chakraborty got a job at a camp Deb held in Kolkata and informed the authorities when she did not receive any certificate. Deb held at least two camps in Kolkata last month where more than 800 people were allegedly given shots of Amikacin, an antibiotic. The ampules seized from his office have been sent for laboratory examination. He ran a job racket as well, said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/four-held-in-kolkata-for-running-job-scam-one-posed-as-police-officer-101625750125422.html

A manager of a bank told me yesterday that if I do not pay my loan instalment, it will be declared NPA. Once it is declared an NPA then the process of recovery is initiated,” Lobo said.“If a bank manager can call me and inform me that my account will be declared as an NPA, what about the common man? What about people who live hand-to-mouth and run small businesses? How will they pay instalments? This is an issue which is plaguing people in Goa as well as the rest of India,” said Lobo, who had once exuberantly said he would be buying a plot of land in Kashmir no sooner article 370 of the constitution was rescinded by Parliament back in 2019.“I am writing to our government, to the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister that the RBI should issue a circular to all nationalised banks that no account should be declared as an NPA during the second wave of the pandemic,” Lobo said.“Right from February till now, no businesses have been open and instalments have not been paid since then. Most affected are the small businesses,” Lobo said.Goa Tourism Development Corporation had conducted a state-wide survey through a consultant KPMG to understand the impact of the first wave of Covid-19 and lockdown on the Goa Tourism Industry. As per the survey, the overall loss of earnings in the tourism industry during lockdown has been estimated at Rs.2,062/-crores. Potential loss of earning for the 2020-21 season has been pegged at Rs.7,239/- crores and the potential job cuts were to the tune of 1.22 lakh (58%). The second wave is expected to erase a similar amount of value from the industry.Goa’s tourism sector is a big source of revenue for the state with the industry directly contributing 16.43% towards the state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and also provides employment to nearly 35% of the state’s population that is dependent on the sector, according to official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-minister-seeks-relief-for-tourism-businesses-says-he-s-affected-too-101625749045495.html

The SP said, “Sanjay Agrawal, Sanjay Gupta , and another businessman, are wholesalers of gold bullion in Jhansi. They purchased it from Delhi to supply it to jewellers in Jhansi. They were going to Delhi on June 17 on Jabalpur- Nizammuddin Express when the three police personnel and a Railway Protection Force (RPF) constable, Yogendra, asked them to show their bags at Dabra Railway station near Gwalior. The personnel introduced themselves as Crime Branch officers of Rajasthan Police.

During interrogation, Gurjar confessed to the crime and said he was suspended in 2015 after CBI filed a charge-sheet against him for using illegal means to clear the constable recruitment exam under the Vyapam scam. He was facing a financial crisis due to the court case. He had to return the money borrowed from private money lenders,” said an investigating officer, who is not authorised to talk to media. Police are interrogating them to find out if they were involved in any other crime. They are also trying to find how the accused knew all the details about the businessmen they robbed. The SP said, “We have written to RPF to take action against the fourth accused.”The Vyapam scam came to light in July 2013 when Indore Police arrested 20 impersonators who appeared for the medical entrance examination to help undeserving candidates secure high ranks. The cheating net also involved a clique of politicians and bureaucrats that facilitated the fraud in exchange for bribes, according to investigators.

When a 23-year-old Dharmanand Damodar Kosambi came from Goa to Pune to study Sanskrit, he had nowhere to go, and no place where he could eat. He went hungry for almost a week before he met Dr RG Bhandarkar, an eminent orientalist, and social reformer, who enrolled him in the Sanskrit school in Nagarkar wada. But, Kosambi still did not know where to have his daily meals. Most of the khanavals in the city refused to feed him because of his caste.In those days, the floors of houses (and those of the khanavals) were smeared with a mixture of cow dung, soil, and ash. In the khanavals run by and meant for Brahmins, Brahmin helpers would smear the floor after the khanaval members finished their meals. But because Kosambi was a “Saraswat”, the Brahmin khanaval-owners and their helpers did not want to “pollute” their space by feeding him and leaving the floor “un-smeared”.Finally, with the help of one of his acquaintances, Mr Redkar, Kosambi was successful in convincing a khanaval owner from Budhwar peth to let him have his meals at his eating house. The proprietor of the khanaval wanted Kosambi to smear the floor with cow dung daily after finishing his meals. Kosambi offered to pay 8 annas extra, and the owner agreed to take care of the smearing himself.There were many students and male workers like Kosambi who did not know where to sleep and have food when they arrived in cities like Bombay and Poona in the nineteenth century. When someone arrived in the city, they either stayed with relatives, friends, or acquaintances from their villages, boarded with a private family who accommodated one or two lodgers, or joined a khanaval. The khanaval would serve them food at a minimum cost and suit their traditional dietary beliefs and practices.The khanaval was an eating “house”, or sometimes a boarding “house”, to which people could subscribe and have their meals cooked for them. Also known as jevanaval or jevanghar in the nineteenth century, they were formal or informal public or semi-public eating houses for Indians in Bombay and later Poona. Occasionally, the traditional term Bhatiyarkhana, apparently was used, particularly to identify inns or eating houses run by and for Muslims. Molesworth’s monumental Marathi dictionary, in referring to the alternative terms jevanaval and jevanghar, reports that the eating houses had recently been set up in Bombay. The first edition of the dictionary was published in 1828, which means it could be estimated that the institution arose sometime around 1820 in Bombay.Society accepted the helplessness of a hearth-less person, and dining in the khanaval was tolerated strictly as a necessity. Because of the social proximity involved, many khanavals served men of the same village and caste. Some khanavals allowed homeless or unemployed people to use their space to sleep.NV Joshi, in his book “Pune Varnan” written in 1868, mentioned that there were almost 20 khanavals in Pune, and were mostly run by widows. The growth of the khanavals was a response to the growth of Bombay, and later Pune, as a market for rural labour and an education hub, and the consequent pattern of migration to the city by male workers. Most of these workers sought to minimise expenses to be able to send money home to their villages, so the khanaval food had to be inexpensive.JS Karandikar, the ex-editor of “Kesari”, wrote in an article published in “Navayug”: “In 1890, one paid ₹5 per month in a khanaval. For ₹2 extra, one could get ghee and chapati, instead of bhakari. Most students could not afford to pay the monthly fees. A few wealthy students carried ghee in small bowls with them. These khanavals never took a day off. Most of the students did not visit their villages during festivals and holidays. The khanavals made sure they were properly fed during the holidays.”After khanavals were established, students either had to secure membership in a khanaval or had to depend on the charity of certain families who would feed a few students as a charity in their homes. There were around 4,000 students studying in Pune in 1880, according to the Bombay Gazetteer published in 1885. This number swelled to 10,000 in 1910, according to a report in the newspaper “Jnanaprakash”.Before the British Raj, poor Brahmin boys coming to towns or cities from villages for education and would typically stay at the premises of a temple or a choultry. But, they had to make arrangements for their own food. To spare the students the trouble and humiliation of begging every day, compassionate families volunteered to feed the students once a week. So a student had to find seven or 14 sponsors depending on whether he chose to eat once or twice a day. This was known as “vaar laavoon jevane” (feeding every week, “varanna” in Kannada) and was in vogue till the First World War. Some students lived by begging food-grains which they would cook themselves. Known as “madhukari”, it helped poor students acquire education.In 1880, Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak established the New English School in Pune. It was one of the first “native-run” educational institutions in India to offer Western education. Keenly aware of the hardships faced by students and workers in arranging for meals daily, Chiplunkar, around the same time, helped establish another modern intuition, a restaurant, in Pune which would feed students, workers, and guests coming to Pune. After Chiplunkar’s death, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar took it upon himself to convince the residents of Maharashtra of the importance of restaurants.Let’s keep the story of the first restaurant in Pune, and Maharashtra, for the next week.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

Abdul Khaleque was arrested on charges of murdering Wahed Ali, a home guard posted at Bijni police station, on Tuesday evening. Ali had been attacked with sharp weapons and was believed to have been killed due to some personal dispute. “When we took the accused to the spot where he had allegedly thrown the murder weapon, he snatched the pistol of sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Bijni and fled towards the jungle while pointing the weapon at the police party,” Chirang superintendent of police Gaurav Upadhyay told journalists. He added that “in the interest of safety of police party, to secure the snatched weapon and to apprehend the accused” police tried to stop him by using “controlled minimum firing aimed at non-vital organs”. “We were able to apprehend the injured Khaleque and immediately rushed him to the nearest health centre at Bhetagaon in a police vehicle. But he was declared brought dead,” said Upadhyay. Incidents of police firing at alleged criminals while the latter try to flee from custody have increased in Assam in the recent weeks. According to police records, since June this year, at least 8 persons were injured in police firing while allegedly trying to escape. They include persons accused of drug peddling, cattle smuggling, dacoity and kidnapping. Defending the police action chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who handles the home portfolio, said on Monday, “Police shouldn’t shoot them in the chest, but law permits shooting them in the leg. Police in Assam shouldn’t be scared in taking such action. But no such action should be taken against innocent persons,” he said, while addressing officers in-charge of police stations in the state. “If police don’t retaliate, they themselves would die. But before we take such action, which is permitted by law, our conscience should be clear that whatever tough action we are taking, it is for the public good and not in our own interest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/murder-accused-killed-in-police-firing-while-trying-to-escape-in-assam-101625740226285.html

The legislation will be tabled in the next assembly session to be held later this month. “We had earlier announced that our government would bring a cow protection bill. The cabinet yesterday approved the introduction of the bill in the state assembly,” Hazarika said. While the exact contents of the legislation are not yet known, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier mentioned that the legislation would ban the movement of cattle from other parts of the country into Assam and also from the state to outside. The move is aimed at ending the smuggling of cattle to Bangladesh through the international border. At present, cattle from many states of the country are illegally transported to the region via Assam smuggled to the neighbouring country along with the border areas of the state and Meghalaya. Addressing the first session of the newly elected assembly in May, Governor Jagdish Mukhi informed that the proposed bill would adopt a zero-tolerance policy for the protection of the sacred animal, which provides us with ‘life-sustaining milk’. Defending the move, CM Sarma had said in the assembly in the first session that beef shouldn’t be consumed in those areas where Hindus live and where the animal is worshipped. “We believe cow is our mother. We don’t want cattle to enter our state from West Bengal. We want that beef is not consumed in areas where cows are worshipped. I am not saying people who consume beef should leave their habit, but there should be sensitivity towards others who don’t,” he said. Consumption of beef is not illegal in Assam. The Assam Cattle Preservation Act, 1950 allows the slaughter of cattle above 14 years of age with proper approval by local veterinary officers. Once enacted, Assam would join other BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which have similar legislation to protect cows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-cabinet-approves-cow-protection-bill-to-be-tabled-in-next-assembly-101625739806913.html

There’s hardly any leader who can match up to such popularity. So, when people woke up to the news of the 87-year-old leader’s passing away, it was termed as the end of an era. Also read: Raja Sahib who ruled hearts for 50 years loses last battleWith the state Congress at the crossroads ahead of the crucial 2022 assembly elections, it’s a challenge for the family to carry forward the legacy of Raja Sahib. His son Vikramaditya Singh, 31, is the obvious heir apparent with Virbhadra’s wife Pratibha Singh, who has been a two-term MP from Mandi, staying away from active politics since her defeat in the 2014 general election. Making way for his son Vikramaditya entered politics in 2013 when he was elected president of the Himachal Pradesh Youth Congress, a post he served for five years. In 2017, he was elected to the assembly from the Shimla Rural segment. Virbhadra had vacated the seat for his son and chosen to shift to Arki constituency in neighbouring Solan district. Though Vikramaditya entered politics at almost the same age as his father, stepping into his shoes and matching his popularity is going to be one tall order for the young scion of the Bushahr princely state. Virbhadra was known for his political acumen, administrative grip and compassion and Vikramaditya knows he has a long way to go. Congress, a divided house The Congress remains a divided house in the state with many claimants to the chief minister’s post though none of the present crop of leaders is a crowdpuller of Virbhadra’s stature. Prominent party leaders in the state are All India Congress Committee secretary Asha Kumari, leader of the opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, former minister and Virbhadra’s trusted lieutenant Sudhir Sharma, and former state chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and five-time legislator Harshwardhan Chauhan. Time to give younger leader a chance “After this colossal loss, it’s time for the Congress to give space to the younger leadership like its rival BJP has done,” said Harish Thakur, the chairman of the department of political science at Himachal Pradesh University (HPU), Shimla. He said Sukhu or Agnihotri could be appropriate to lead the party’s charge given their experience in state politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/son-rise-in-himachal-vikramaditya-to-take-virbhadra-s-legacy-forward-101625738426453.html

08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Finding heaven on earth in serenity of Pahalgam||I was already ruing my impulsive decision. Commandos togged up like space travellers, airport personnel, anonymous and ominous in their billowing personal protection kits, black menacing cameras whirring down at us from every conceivable angle, reminiscent of a disapproving Big Brother, sniffer dogs that somehow managed to single out our innocent luggage, Srinagar airport eerily resembled the sets of a Korean zombie film. It had taken a while to convince my daughter and a friend to visit Kashmir last week, but stepping out into the harsh sunlight, my heart was beating an uneven staccato as incidents of previous disruptions and terror attacks came to mind. The strange sight of rows of tables for rapid Covid-19 testing, the unfamiliar sing song dialect of the locals, the numerous paper checks and questions by gun-toting security further added to the feeling of unease and apprehension. Also read: Chance encounter with a raconteur par excellenceWearing our masks and insisting the taxi driver don his despite protestations that “there is no Covid in our beautiful valley, madam”, we wove our way into that heaven on earth that is Pahalgam! As the gushing waters of the Lidder river came into view, we watched in awe and hushed silence, the splendour of the tall pine trees, perfectly positioned like sentries clad in various shades of green, the imposing Pir Panjal range standing like a fortress behind them, while an azure blue, spotless sky cast its shadow and gave colour to the rocks and whirlpools of the singing river as it continued on its tireless journey to join the mighty Jhelum. The many-hued slanting roofs of charming little cottages looked surprisingly akin to Swiss chalets, while the herd of sheep and goats skittishly running around completed the picture-perfect postcard like landscape. The township of Pampore came into view and though it wasn’t the season for saffron, I could visualise the infinite fields of the Crocus Sativa flower, blooming in all their glory, their vivid gold competing with the sun, waving their magical powdered anthers and dispersing the scent of saffron in the cold, pure air. Soft-spoken with a shy demeanour, the Kashmiri people win your hearts with their hospitality and warmth. I wondered aloud as to why we didn’t see more women in public places and was told quite frankly and unapologetically that their women folk usually stay at home. Sampling Wazwan in a typical village home, we relished the astounding variety of lamb and chicken dishes, finger-licking fermented breads and of course, the mandatory and delicious finale to every meal, Kahwa, the aromatic Kashmiri tea. The locals were delighted with the influx of tourists but reticent on their personal views regarding the Government of India’s policies on the status of their state. Our garrulous cook opened up a little to proffer that politics were best left to the big leaders in Delhi and all that the general populace desired were conditions conducive to a peaceful and harmonious existence where they could earn an honest living, educate their children and envision a secure future for them. Is that too much to ask, I wonder? As for my fear and hesitation, it vanished at the sight of this most serene and exquisite place, touched by the very Hand of God, where surely nothing bad can ever happen. pallavisingh358@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor .

Further interrogation also revealed that the man, Sanatan Ray Chaudhuri, had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Dum Dum constituency as a candidate for Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party, but lost. “The accused claimed to have attended the BRICS summit held at Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2018.

"Yes, when there is smoke there must be a fire somewhere," wrote Supriyo in his post.He, however, later took to Facebook later to clarify that he had “resigned” from his post as the Union minister of state, and said it would be improper to frame his statement as if he has been asked to go.Taking a note of his earlier statement, Dilip Ghosh said, "They asked for his (Supriyo's) resignation so that someone else can take up the responsibility. That is how a party functions; you need to have faith in the due process. If he were to be fired instead, would that have made things any better?"Ghosh said that of the 12 ministers who resigned, no one else had made such a remark about the party.Supriyo recently lost in the state assembly election from Kolkata's Tollygunje assembly seat against Trinamool's Aroop Biswas, who was the incumbent MLA of the seat. Since then, the singer-turned-politician was found missing from the central leadership and his political presence appeared confined only in the criticism of the TMC leadership in the state.Just a day before his resignation, however, Babul Supriyo was present at an event in which his ministry signed a joint communication with the ministry of tribal affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/dilip-ghosh-jabs-babul-supriyo-over-asked-to-resign-facebook-post-101625719819252.html

With tin roofs and rickety furniture making up its mise-en-scène, it has students studying in classes 1 to 12 who are in urgent need of attention. Despite multiple efforts and interventions aimed at securing land for a school building, the school’s fate remains unchanged.In 2018, the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to allocate land for the school and the Delhi government to initiate work within six months. Four years later, uncertainty prevails over the future of the school as the stalemate over land allocation continues.Also Read | Schools in no-Covid zones can reopen for classes 8 to 12 starting July 15A 45-year wait continues The Urdu medium school was demolished during the 1976 Emergency and has been operating out of the Eidgah premises ever since. Residents said that since the Covid-19 pandemic has forced schools to shift classes online, the time is ripe for the construction of the building.School in-charge, Abdul Wahab, said that while online classes are ongoing, old battles await students when physical classes recommence.“Holding classes under tin roofs is not an easy task. Be it the excruciating heat of summers or incessant monsoon downpour, there are multiple challenges that students face. In non-pandemic days, we used to hold classes in two shifts due to the paucity of infrastructure. Online classes are taking place right now, but eventually, students will return to the school and the old challenges that come along with it,” said Wahab, who has been associated with the school in different capacities for the past 50 years.He is also a former student, who remembers the old campus. “Our old school was a double-storey building in Sarai Khalil. It was demolished in 1976. When no alternative was space, school authorities placed tents at the Eidgah premises, and since then, the school has been operating out of here,” said Wahab.Over the years, many students have dropped out or changed schools due to the absence of a school building. “Parents continue to call us and enquire if there has been any progress on the development of a school building. Since the school is in shambles, many students continue to move out,” said Wahab.Weathering the stormFormer students and residents of the area have sought land allocation for the school, but to no avail. Abdul Malik Qureshi, former manager of the school, has lodged a contempt petition to seek accountability for the delay in land allocation for the school. “In 2018, then chief justice Gita Mittal of Delhi high court had directed both the DDA and Delhi administration to allocate land for the school. DDA had promised to give 4,000 acres, but later said that they would give 1,600 acres. I had filed public litigation last year just before the lockdown. We have sought that 4,000 acres be granted to the school. The case is sub judice,” said Qureshi.Another former student, Shadab Qureshi, who graduated from the Eidgah campus, said that a new school building was long due. He said that the school had weathered many storms and recalled how teachers made efforts despite the constraints under which they worked. “During our time, we saw sheets getting replaced with makeshift tin roofs. We studied under these roofs in the late 1990s and the condition was quite bad. During the monsoon, the whole school would get flooded and the roofs would often get damaged due to strong winds. Things don’t seem to have changed. We did not get to see a new building while we studied there, and after all these years, generations of students after us are stuck in the same circumstances,” said Qureshi, who lives near the school.He added that locals had high hopes for the Aam Aadmi Party. “When the government came to power, we thought that the school will finally get a building. However, nothing has happened so far,” he said.The right to educationWaseem Siddiqui, an activist and Delhi resident, said that a proper school building is essential. “In line with the Right to Education (RTE) Act, the school needs a campus. The rights of children are important over other considerations. Urgent attention is needed towards the issue since the issue has remained unresolved over the years. The school has not received any attention from the government despite the court order,” said Siddiqui.HT contacted the DDA and the Delhi government multiple times for their comments, but they have not responded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nearly-five-decades-after-demolition-urdu-medium-school-still-awaits-a-new-building-101625721803968.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||In 15 years, Mumbai doctor gives 17-year-old Kolkata boy new lease of life twice||A Mumbai doctor has removed a coconut-sized stone weighing 1 kilogram from an augmented (enlarged) urinary bladder of a 17-year-old Kolkata resident. As the boy is an orphan, the surgery was done for free on compassionate grounds.This is for the second time that Dr Rajiv Redkar gave Reuben Sheikha new lease of life.Sheikh was born with an exposed urinary bladder and a malformed penis. He suffered from Exstrophy-Epispadias Complex (EEC) which is a rare condition, found in 1 in 100,000 live births. The biggest complication in such cases is that the exposed bladder can’t store urine or function normally, resulting in urine leakage.Almost 15 years ago, when Dr Redkar practised at Wadia hospital, he treated the boy for EEC. He had performed a bladder augmentation—an operation performed to increase the size of the bladder and Mitrofanoff Procedure which creates a new tube on a child’s belly through which a child can urinate by using a catheter.Also Read | Mumbai University teachers hold protest, demand health insurance, other benefits“The tube was made from the appendix, and it connected the bladder to a small hole created in the belly button. However, after his treatment, he went back to Kolkata and did not follow up,” said Dr Redkar who currently works as a consultant paediatric surgeon, SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim-Fortis Associate.Last month, Dr Redkar got a call from the boy who was experiencing severe discomfort, pain and inability to control urination. The teenager travelled 2,000kms and landed at Dr Redkar’s clinic with a local guardian.On June 30, Dr Redkar along with Dr Suresh Bhagat, consultant urologist and Dr Asmita Mahajan, consultant neonatologist from SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim, performed a surgery where they removed a large calcium oxalate stone from his bladder which was almost 13.4” in length and weighed a kilogram. Later, they reconstructed his augmented urinary bladder which was a challenging procedure, said the doctors.“Reuben has responded to the surgery extremely well. His kidneys are well protected and functioning fine. Such a case needs long-term management of the condition with regular follows and check-ups,” said Dr Redkar.“The boy travelled with a local guardian without any money. If left untreated, it could have proved fatal. So, when the hospital was informed about the case, they agreed to treat him free of cost to save his life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctor-removes-1kg-stone-from-teenager-s-urinary-bladder-101625719224134.html

According to NIA, Soni made a confession statement on Saturday before a metropolitan magistrate. Earlier, he had been sent to judicial custody by the magistrate court itself. His NIA custody ended on Tuesday, whereby NIA was required to produce him before the court for further remand. However, the NIA informed the special court that Soni had been remanded to judicial custody by the magistrate. The agency therefore pleaded to the special NIA court to pass an order remanding him to judicial custody.Also Read | Mumbai housing society vaccination fraud: Fifth accused brought from MPSoni’s lawyer Rahul Arote has objected to this, claiming it to be a case of illegal detention. He has now moved a bail plea for Soni as he was not produced before the NIA court for authorising his further custody.

On March 5, Hiran – the owner of the SUV – was found dead in a creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf.NIA has claimed that, Soni, Mothkuri and two others arrested in the case had killed Hiran and dumped his body in the creek near Mumbra.The murder, NIA claimed, was part of larger conspiracy and committed at the behest of former policemen Sachin Waze and Sharma. Besides Waze and Sharma, dismissed Mumbai police officers Riyazuddin Kazi and Sunil Mane had also been arrested in connection with the bomb scare case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-bomb-scare-alleged-hiran-killer-seeks-bail-over-illegal-detention-101625717363977.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi weather: Another hot day ahead; mercury may drop slightly||The national Capital is likely to have another heatwave day on Thursday, as per forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, forecasters say that the maximum temperature is expected to drop slightly from today, which may bring relief from the ongoing heatwave conditions in the city. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was 42.6 degrees Celsius (°C), six degrees above normal for this time of the year. According to IMD forecast, on Thursday also, the day temperature is likely to hover around 41°C. In the plains, heatwave days are classified as when the maximum temperature crosses 40°C, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5°C.Scientists said that the maximum temperature is likely to subside now that the monsoon is gradually progressing over the northwest region, including Delhi. “By Friday, there are chances of thundershowers, which will intensify on July 10-11. Hence, a further drop in the day temperature is expected by July 10, bringing much relief from the soaring heat and humidity,” said a senior IMD official. The IMD had on Monday revised the dates for monsoon arrival in Delhi and parts of northwest and central India to July 10. The latest it has arrived in the past 17 years for which IMD has data is on July 9 in 2006. So, this year is likely to make a record in terms of the most delayed onset over Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-weather-another-hot-day-ahead-mercury-may-drop-slightly-101625713583687.html

He was 87.“He passed away this morning and his family members were beside him,” said IGMC senior medical superintendent Dr Janakraj Pakhretia.Also read: Raja Sahib who ruled hearts for 50 years loses last battleVirbhadra Singh was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of IGMC and was put on ventilator support on Monday night after he suffered a heart attack. He was undergoing treatment in the cardiology department since April 23.On April 13, he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was taken to Max Hospital in Mohali. He was discharged after treatment on April 23 but on his arrival in Shimla, he developed breathing difficulty and was admitted to IGMC.Virbhadra Singh contracted the coronavirus infection again on June 11 and recovered.He turned 87 on June 23.Virbhadra Singh, a nine-time MLA and five-time member of Parliament, was Himachal Pradesh’s chief minister for six terms since 1983. Singh also remained the leader of Opposition from March 1998 to March 2003.He represented Arki constituency in Solan district in the present state assembly.His wife Pratibha Singh and son Vikramaditya Singh are also politicians. Pratibha is a former MP from Mandi, while Vikramaditya is the sitting MLA from Shimla Rural.Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Jagat Prakash Nadda, who visited Virbhadra Singh recently in hospital, expressed condolences, a BJP spokesperson said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/end-of-era-in-himachal-as-congress-leader-virbhadra-singh-passes-away-101625711603489.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Raja Sahib who ruled hearts for 50 years loses last battle||A scion of the Rampur-Bushahr royal family, Virbhadra Singh or Raja Sahib as he was known, didn’t rule a kingdom, but the hearts of the people of Himachal Pradesh for nearly six decades. The six-time chief minister, nine-time state legislator and five-time member of Parliament, passed away at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital in Shimla on Thursday. Part of the older generation of the Congress, he began his political career at 27 with the Lok Sabha elections in 1962. He went on to serve as a member of Parliament for four more terms, though not successive, in 1967, 1971, 1980 and 2009. Also read: Virbhadra Singh, former Himachal Pradesh CM and Congress leader, passes awaySeasoned at Centre, back to state His first stint as chief minister was in 1983 and lasted till 1990 when he was succeeded by Shanta Kumar of the BJP. In 1983, the Congress high command was considering a change of guard in Himachal Pradesh as the government helmed by Ram Lal Thakur was in the eye of a storm for sheltering the forest mafia. A loyalist of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Thakur was appointed Andhra Pradesh governor. It was easy to shunt him out but difficult to find an acceptable replacement. The state Congress was divided into a camp loyal to Thakur and the other opposed to him led by Sukh Ram, who was keen to become chief minister. Virbhadra successfully contested the byelections from Thakur’s turf of Jubbal Kotkhai in 1983 and 1985 and won over his loyalists, forcing him to float the Him Jan Kranti Morcha that merged with the Janata Dal. Though Thakur defeated Virbhadra from Jubbal Kotkhai, Virbhadra survived by winning from Rohru. Such was his popularity that he was re-elected chief minister in 1993, 2003 and 2012. He also won the Lok Sabha election in 2009 and served as Union minister of steel and later as minister of micro, small and medium enterprises. Fighting battles, winning warsVirbhadra survived nearly every curve ball thrown his way, including corruption charges and waning influence within the party. He fought off threats by many a party rival. Sukh Ram posed a formidable challenge. The Congress had won 52 of the 68 assembly seats in 1993. Sukh Ram, close to then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, was still keen to become CM. He had the support of 22 legislators but Virbhadra, known for his political acumen, secured the backing of 29 MLAs along with five independents to stake claim to power, forcing then Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, who was sent as an observer by the high command, to do a rethink. Virbhadra regained a foothold after Sukh Ram’s name cropped up in the telecom scam. In 1998, Sukh Ram again threw the gauntlet at Virbhadra after floating the Himachal Vikas Congress that won five seats and helped the BJP wrest control under Prem Kumar Dhumal on March 24. The Virbhadra Singh government resigned following the withdrawal of support by the lone independent MLA. The assembly election, held along with the Lok Sabha poll, threw up a hung House. Unmatched popularity None of the state leaders from his party or the rival BJP were a match to Virbhadra’s public connect. Affectionate, he listened to people with compassion. “Meri janata meri sabsay badhi takat hai (People are my biggest strength),” he would say in his speeches. Such was his public appeal that he would never campaign in his own constituency after filing his nomination papers yet he would win comfortably. His trusted lieutenants managed his constituency, while he would tour the state, leading the Congress campaign. Rough patch in sunset years Though Virbhadra weathered many a storm, outwitting rivals from Anand Sharma to Vidya Stokes and outmanouevring even the Congress high command simply because he was popular and could keep his flock together, he hit a rough patch in the sunset years of his political career when he was faced with charges of financial irregularities. Sharma often asserted his proximity to the Gandhi family but Virbhadra didn’t allow him to find a toehold in state politics. Though Stokes was given the sobriquet, Indira Gandhi of Himachal, she remained the state party chief and could not fulfil Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s aspiration to see her as chief minister. The high command chose Stokes as the leader of the opposition but Virbhadra was back in control in 1993. Even former state party chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu tried to pose a challenge but eventually, Virbhadra prevailed. His popularity forced the party high command to send him back to state and he replaced Kaul Singh Thakur as the state Congress chief and steered the party to victory in the 2012 assembly elections. Virbhadra spent most of the time in his last tenure as CM shuttling between Delhi and Shimla, battling money laundering charges. He eventually fell out with the high command. His worries compounded when he was forced to quit as Union minister as allegations of laundering disproportionate assets by investing in LIC policies surfaced. While serving as a Union minister from May 28, 2009, to June 26, 2012, the Enforcement Directorate accused him of investing huge amounts in LIC policies in his own name and that of his family members through an agent who was later jailed. The Central Bureau of investigation also chargesheeted Virbhadra, his wife Pratibha and others in the matter though he denied the allegations. Personal journey and legacy Born on June 23, 1934, Virbhadra was educated at Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, St Edward’s School, Shimla, and Bishop Cotton School, Shimla, before he graduated in English honours from St Stephen’s College, Delhi. He was married to Ratna Kumari in 1954 and had four daughters. He remarried in 85 and his wife, Pratibha Singh, went on to represent Mandi parliamentary constituency. Their son, Vikramaditya Singh, is the MLA from Shimla Rural, and daughter Aparajita is married to Angad Singh, the grandson of Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/raja-sahib-who-ruled-hearts-for-50-years-loses-last-battle-101625707463429.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||120 city hospitals have O2 facilities within premises: Delhi govt to HC||The Delhi government on Monday informed the Delhi high court that of the 135 private hospitals in the city with more than 50 beds, 120 have installed oxygen generation devices such as pressure swing adsorption plants and liquid medical oxygen tanks within their premises, and data on 15 others is awaited.On May 20, the high court nudged the city government and the hospital authorities for their failure to set up oxygen generation plants even as a devastating second wave of Covid-19 was sweeping through the Capital, overwhelming the medical infrastructure and leading to an acute shortage of medical oxygen across hospitals. The court said as the demand for medical oxygen in Delhi has gone up by nearly five times the normal consumption, it was time to make provisions so as to reduce dependence on outside sources, if a similar situation were to arise in the future.The Delhi government on May 28 directed the owners and management of hospitals to take steps to avert an oxygen crisis.The government directed hospitals with 100 beds or more to install PSA/refilling plants and create other necessary infrastructure with sufficient capacity to produce at twice their normal requirement of oxygen.Hospitals with 50 to 99 beds were told to set up PSA/refilling plants to meet at least their normal requirement of oxygen and those with 50 beds were asked to augment their infrastructure and add capacities.The government told the hospitals and nursing homes to provide a timeline for setting up these facilities by June 5.On Wednesday, in a status report filed through additional standing counsel Satyakam, the Delhi government informed a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh that 15 hospitals did not respond despite the deadline being extended till June 11.During the hearing, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that they have created storage capacity for buffer oxygen and 171 tanks have been installed. He added that another 150 are being set up.The court was hearing a bunch of pleas including one from lawyer Rakesh Malhotra seeking better facilities to manage the Covid crisis in the city.During the proceedings, the bench also directed the Centre to file a status report on availability of Liposomal Amphotericin B and other drugs, used for treating patients of black fungus which primarily affects those who have recovered from the coronavirus disease.“If we are preparing for the third wave of Covid-19, we need to see the arrangement for it,” it said, asking the Centre to indicate the status of quantities of Liposomal Amphotericin-B actually imported and the outstanding supplies along with its domestic production. The court also asked the Centre to file a status report on export, production and stocks of remdesivir, which is used for treatment of Covid symptoms.The court posted the matter for further hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/120-city-hospitals-have-o2-facilities-within-premises-delhi-govt-to-hc-101625697210577.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||CM Kejriwal inaugurates first genome sequencing lab at Lok Nayak hospital||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in the presence of health minister Satyender Jain, inaugurated the first laboratory under the Delhi government to sequence genomes of Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 at the Lok Nayak hospital on Wednesday. The lab, which has one sequencing machine, will start with eight to ten samples a day and expand the capacity to test more than 40 samples per day.“We hear about new variants emerging in news every day. So far, we were dependent on Centre’s NCDC lab to sequence the samples. Now, Lok Nayak will also sequence the Covid-19 virus and look for variants that are causing the infections in the city. This will help us frame a strategy to tackle the problem,” said Kejriwal at the inauguration.The other lab, which can test up to 400 samples a week, will be inaugurated on Thursday at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. The lab has two machines for genomic sequencing that were used for other viral research so far.“Currently, the researchers are working on standardising the data, after which the capacity will be increased to 40 to 50 samples a day,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director at Lok Nayak hospital.The labs together aim to sequence 5% of the samples that return positive in the RT-PCR test to keep an eye on concerning mutations that might lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases in future. So far, Delhi depended on the labs at National Centre for Disease Control and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, that are part of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).“With the Central labs sequencing samples from across the country, there was always a delay of two to three weeks in getting results of the samples sent for sequencing. At the beginning of the year, when the UK variant was first detected, our hospital was the designated centre for isolating such cases and it took long to get their reports,” said Dr Kumar. Lok Nayak had admitted 140 patients with UK variant in its special isolation ward. The hospital did not receive any patient who contracted the South African or Brazilian variant of Covid-19.The hospital has formed an inter-department committee that will refer random samples and samples of patients with atypical symptoms for genomic sequencing.“If we receive Covid-19 cases where the symptoms are different or the patient is taking long to recover, the samples will be sent for sequencing in addition to random sampling of admitted patients from within the hospital. We will also receive samples from the districts for sampling,” said Dr Kumar.The districts currently send some samples of mild, moderate, and severe Covid-19 cases, along with cases of re-infection, and infection after vaccination to INSACOG for sampling. The two labs by Delhi government will now share the load of testing samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-kejriwal-inaugurates-first-genome-sequencing-lab-at-lok-nayak-hospital-101625696917470.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Vasant Vihar murder: Help’s statement helped cops nab killers within 24 hours||It was planned less than two hours before it happened, but it was still supposed to be a perfect robbery and murder.The three men were so confident that they would find the elderly woman, Kitty Kumarmangalam, alone that they did not even bother to carry weapons with them. But at 8.10 pm on Tuesday, when the three men entered the flat, the door was opened by Kitty’s recently hired domestic help, Mithila, 33.To make sure there were no loose ends, they strangulated Mithila with a belt, and left her for dead. But she was only unconscious; she regained her senses about an hour later and it was her statement that helped the police zero in on two of three killers within 24 hours of the murder and robbery.“The three men, Raju Kanojia, Rakesh Kumar and Suraj, were drunk and believed they had successfully pulled off the heist. Before leaving the building, Raju even checked if Mithila was breathing. Maybe, he was drunk and failed to notice her faint breath. Had Mithila not survived, it would have taken us more time to catch the murderers,” one of the investigating officers, who asked not to be named, said.Police said the three assumed that both Kitty and Mithila were dead; they divided the loot among them and returned to their lives as if nothing had happened. Raju was asleep when police came knocking on his doors around 3am Wednesday. The second arrested man, Rakesh Raj, reported for work at the ministry of external affairs office on Wednesday morning, where he works as a contractual driver.“Rakesh went for work as usual and was returning home to Munirka in the afternoon when we arrested him. He could not believe Mithila had survived,” the investigation officer quote above said.Police officers privy to the probe said Kitty hired Mithila only a few days ago. Police suspect that Raju may not have seen Mithila when he last visited the flat to collect clothes for laundering. Mithila also did not know Raju and could only share with police the basic details about Raju and his two friends. Suddenly, every laundryman in the colony was a murder suspect.A SLEEPLESS NIGHT FOR LAUNDRYMEN OF VASANT VIHAR In Block A of Vasant Vihar, there are at least 10-12 laundrymen, who collect clothes from homes for ironing or washing. While some such as Geeta Ram,74, run their shop from the lanes in the block and also live there, others live in the nearby Bhanwar Singh camp -- a small slum settlement next to the bungalows of Vasant Vihar. There are several embassies in the block, including the embassy of the Republic of Lebanon, which is right next to Kitty’s flat.Geeta Ram said, “Police initially did not know who Raju was and so they picked up several laundrymen for questioning. I was also taken to the police station. There I saw several others who work in Block A. Although police did not abuse or harass us, it was still troubling as until Raju was arrested, we were all suspects.”Another laundryman, who asked not to be named, said inside the police station, around midnight on Tuesday, they were busy calling their friends and fellow laundrymen to help the police find Raju. “ All our life, we have lived there. Geeta Ram ji has lived here for over 50 years. Most of the upscale residents treat us like family and we visit their homes regularly to do the laundry and ironing. Now because of one incident, we are all under a cloud of suspicion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vasant-vihar-murder-help-s-statement-helped-cops-nab-killers-within-24-hours-101625694751542.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Wife of former Union minister murdered in her Vasant Vihar house||Kitty Kumarmangalam, 70, wife of former Union minister P Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, was murdered at her house in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar on Tuesday night, allegedly by her laundryman and his two accomplices, Delhi Police said on Wednesday, after arresting two of the three suspects.Kitty lived alone in a second floor flat in Vasant Vihar’s A block. Her late husband served as the minister of state for law, justice and company affairs in the PV Narasimha Rao government between 1991 and 1993, and as Union minister for power in the Vajpayee government from 1998 to 2000.Police identified the two arrested men as Raju Lakhan Kanojia, 24, the laundryman, and Rakesh Kumar Raj, 34, a contractual driver with a central ministry. The third alleged accomplice, Suraj, identified only by his first name, also a driver, is yet to be arrested. Police said robbery was the motive and the plan was hatched just a few hours before the murder.The three men also strangled Kitty’s domestic help, Mithila,33, with a belt and left the house believing her to be dead after she fell unconscious. After coming back to her senses, Mithila alerted neighbours, who informed the police control room.Also read | Vasant Vihar murder: Help’s statement helped cops nab killers within 24 hoursPolice said prime suspect Kanojia was known to Kitty as he did her laundry for the past five years. He visited the house once every few days to collect clothes.Around 6.30pm, exactly an hour and forty minutes before the three men entered Kitty’s flat, Raju called his two friends and asked them to join him for drinks. Police investigation shows that Raju reached PVR Priya Market in Vasant Vihar on his scooter, where Rakesh and Suraj joined him. Police have found CCTV footage showing the suspects at the market.“They bought three bottles of strong beer and drank it. Then, Raju bought a bottle of whisky and drank in a corner of the market. It was during this drinking session that Raju told them about an elderly woman (Kitty), who lived alone in a “posh” flat. He knew she was the wife of a former minister and may have seen the woman open her locker when he went to collect clothes. He said he could pull off the heist by murdering the woman without any resistance. He shared his plan with his friends and they decided to immediately execute it,” said an investigating officer, who asked not to be named.Around 8pm, the three rode together on Raju’s scooter’s to Kitty’s house. Nobody stopped them on the way. “Everyone in the colony knew Raju; he did the laundry and ironing in most houses there,” said Geeta Ram,74, another laundryman, who irons clothes in a lane near Kitty’s house.The CCTV camera outside the house shows Raju and his two friends entering the building. “At 8.10pm, Raju rang the doorbell and Mithila opened the door. Mithali told us that on hearing the doorbell, Kitty came out of her bedroom to see two new faces with Raju. She objected and asked Raju about them,” another investigating officer, who spoke to Mithila, said.Before the two women could raise the alarm, the three suspects overpowered both Kitty and Mithila. Police said Suraj slapped Mithila and took her to one of the bedrooms, where he strangled her with a belt. In the other room of the three-bedroom flat, Raju and Rakesh pinned Kitty to the floor. Suraj, who thought he had killed Mithila, walked in and they used a pillow to smother Kitty. Police later found her on the bedroom floor.“She must have died on the spot. They ransacked the house, took about ₹2.5 lakh cash, some jewellery and a small safety locker. At 9.10pm, they exited the building, got on the scooter and rode to Nelson Mandela Marg. Hiding in the bushes there, they divided the money (about ₹80,000 each) among them and broke open the locker. They found nothing valuable inside; it only had some papers, which they threw on the road. We have recovered these. Then, they went to their homes,” a third investigator said, requesting anonymity.Around the same time, police said, Mithila regained consciousness.Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police(south west), said Mithila called her husband and also alerted the security guards, who informed the police control room at 10.10pm. The neighbours informed Kitty’s daughter, Ruchira, who lives in Gurugram and son R Mohan, who lives in Bengaluru.“The most independent and powerful woman I knew, the one who taught me right from wrong, who raised me to be who I am, who suffered through my pain, laughed loudest for my joy, loved me unconditionally, left this realm on the date she gave birth to me. 6pm,Lodhi crematorium,” Mohan Kumaramangalam tweeted on Wednesday.A police team reached the flat and found Kitty unconscious on the floor, and the room ransacked. Police took the two women to Safdarjung hospital, where Kitty was declared brought dead. At the hospital, Mithila told police about what had happened.“Mithila told us about the laundryman who had come to the flat. Based on her statement, we checked multiple CCTV cameras, spoke to other laundrymen in the area and located Raju’s address in Bhanwar Singh camp in Vasant Vihar. He was arrested. His accomplice was also arrested on Wednesday morning. We have recovered the cash and the stolen locker from Raju’s house,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wife-of-former-union-minister-murdered-in-her-vasant-vihar-house-101625694744482.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Man arrested for killing two relatives with dumbbell in Palam Vihar||A day after a woman and her son were found murdered in their home in southwest Delhi’s Palam area, the police on Wednesday arrested the woman’s nephew for the crime.Police said the accused, Abhishek Verma (33), a resident of northwest Delhi’s Burari, allegedly killed his aunt Babita Verma (52) and her son Gaurav (27) at their home on Tuesday evening. Police said that in order to evade suspicion, Abhishek was present during the post-mortem of the bodies, and was detained from outside the mortuary.“ Verma alleged his aunt used to taunt and mentally torture him and his family to return ₹50,000 that they had taken for his sister’s marriage in 2019,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.Babita’s husband Krishan Swaroop (55), who works as an accountant with the Indian Air Force at Palam, was not home at the time of the incident. He informed the Palam village police station about the murders after he found his wife and son lying in a pool of blood.After registering an FIR, a police team started scanning the CCTV footage of the area and found a man leaving Babita’s house in an e-rickshaw, wearing blood-stained clothes. “Around 12pm on Wednesday, the police team traced the e-rickshaw, which the suspect had taken to leave from the woman’s house. The driver of the e-rickshaw said he had dropped a person, who had blood stains on his face and clothes, near Dashratpuri metro station,” said the DCP.“The driver told police that he had refused to accept the soiled currency notes that the suspect gave him, following which he was paid ₹30 using a mobile payment application. The account linked to the payment was traced to Verma,” said a senior police officer.Police said Verma had visited his aunt’s house on Sunday when an argument broke out over money. “On Tuesday, he went to their house with the intention of killing both the mother and the son. He reached Dashratpuri metro station on a two-wheeler, took an e-rickshaw from there and went to his aunt’s house. He was even carrying extra clothes with him. After killing them, he took the DVR attached to the CCTV camera and fled. When he was coming downstairs, he left open the cupboard open to give an impression that it was a robbery,” Singh said.“Babita kept on pestering and verbally abused Abhishek who, in a fit of rage, killed her. Later, he killed Gaurav as he had seen him killing his mother. Both of them were bludgeoned to death with dumbbells,” said Singh.The family lived in a three-storey bungalow and an army hawaldar lived on the ground floor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-arrested-for-killing-two-relatives-with-dumbbell-in-palam-vihar-101625694295425.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Another heatwave day in Delhi, but IMD says relief in sight||Delhi continued to reel under the ongoing heatwave with the maximum temperature, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), reaching 42.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, six degrees above normal for this time of the year. However, forecasters said relief is in sight as the mercury is likely to drop by at least two degrees from Thursday onwards.IMD data shows that Delhi experienced a spell of heatwave from June 29 to July 2 with the day temperature rising to as high as 43.5°C on June 30, seven degrees above normal which the IMD classifies as a ‘severe heatwave day’. However, thunderstorm and light showers on July 2 brought the mercury down, pulling the city out of the heatwave spell. From July 4, the city has been again experiencing heatwave-like conditions with the maximum temperature remaining above the 40°C-mark.In the plains, a heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature crosses 40°C or when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5 degrees. A severe heatwave is declared when there is a departure of 6.5 degrees or above from the normal temperatures.“The mercury is likely to subside Thursday onwards and so will the level of discomfort people are facing right now,” said a senior IMD official.On Monday, the IMD revised the dates for the arrival of monsoon in Delhi and parts of northwest and central India to July 10. According to the Met department, this will be the most delayed monsoon in at least the last 17 years. The last time the monsoon had arrived this late was on July 9, 2006.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster, said on Thursday, the maximum temperature is likely to drop by at least two degrees. By Friday, there are chances of thundershowers, which will intensify on July 10-11 in what could be called the “most delayed” monsoon in recent years. Hence, a further drop in the day temperature is expected by July 10, bringing much relief from the soaring heat and humidity.“This has been by far the most delayed monsoon in almost two decades. Now, that the monsoon trough is slowly progressing over northwest India, a drop in temperature is likely. Thundershowers are likely to intensify and bring in rainfall by July 10, with the day temperature likely to drop to around 35°C,” said Palawat.He further said so far, Delhi has been experiencing a combination of soaring heat and high humidity. “On Thursday, even if humidity is high on account of south easterly winds coming from the Bay of Bengal, the drop in temperature will bring some respite, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/another-heatwave-day-in-delhi-but-imd-says-relief-in-sight-101625693501429.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||AAP alleges North MCD not distributing mid-day meals||The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi municipal corporation has failed to distribute mid-day meal ration to about 350,000 children in around 700 schools.“It is surprising that in the North MCD, not even a single child has been given dry ration under the mid-day meal scheme. It is very shameful that about 3.5 lakh students in about 700 schools are not receiving ration. The North MCD, that was supposed to distribute 2,924 tons of ration, has failed to distribute even 1 kg of it,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj, addressing a press conference.“In the schools run by the Delhi government and the MCDs, mid-day meals are served to the young children. However, due to Covid-19, all schools have remained shut. So, the Delhi government took this initiative to give the children their due share in the form of dry ration by calling their parents and giving it to them. In this regard, all the schools run by the Delhi government made sure to give dry ration to their students last year. This practice is being carried out this year as well,” said Bhardwaj.The Delhi BJP, however, said that the civic body has already dispatched dry ration to most of its schools and that students will start receiving it in four-five days.“The North MCD last distributed dry ration to school students in March 2021, after which agreement with the NGO distributing the mid-day meal lapsed and new arrangements took time due to the lockdown. After this new agreement, dry ration in lieu of mid-day meal will be distributed every month,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“Bhardwaj should first ensure distribution of dry ration in Delhi government schools before accusing the North MCD. Even in Saurabh Bhardwaj’s own GK Assembly constituency, dry ration distribution is erratic,” he added.North MCD officials did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-alleges-north-mcd-not-distributing-mid-day-meals-101625693942875.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Police bust call centres duping US citizens, arrest 95, detain 2||Ninety-five people, including 19 women, were arrested for allegedly running two fraud call centres in Delhi’s Kirti Nagar and Mangolpuri from where they contacted the US citizens impersonating as officials of the country’s social security administration and duped them of their money by threatening to revoke their social security number (SSN), police said on Wednesday.The alleged suspects were using illegal techniques, VOIP calling, bypassing the legal international long distance (ILD) gateways for cheating the US citizens. A total of 82 computers, five laptops, 84 mobile phones and 48 identity cards were seized from the two call centres following simultaneous raids conducted at both the premises by teams of the crime branch on Tuesday night. Two minor boys working as tele-callers at the Mangolpuri call centre were also apprehended, the police said.This is the second such operation carried out by the Delhi Police in less than a fortnight against fraud call centres involved in cheating the US citizens. On June 24, 84 people were arrested for allegedly running an illegal call centre and duping thousands of the US citizens of their money by posing as employees of a leading e-commerce company and offering assistance in solving technical issues regarding the company’s services. Ninety-three laptops, four computers and two SUVs were seized along with ₹64.30 lakh from the arrested persons.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Manoj C said in the latest raids both the call centres were running for the past three to four months. The exact number of the US citizens cheated by the arrested persons and the total amount is still being ascertained. The fraudsters were running the call centres in the garb of a travel agency ’The Global Airfares’.Explaining the modus operandi, the DCP said the mastermind and other key players of the racket obtained the database of the US citizens through their contacts, whom they call “blockers”, based abroad. The database having details of the citizens such as their names, social security numbers, addresses and contact numbers, were given to the tele-callers, who are trained in speaking English with the American accent .The tele-callers contacted the US citizens by impersonating the officials of the US Social Security Administration and intimidated them that their social security number will be revoked because of some fraudulent transactions detected by the department. They tricked the citizens into buying online gift cards of an amount ranging between 100 US dollars to 1,000 US dollars and obtained their coupon codes and the PIN codes from them, said DCP Manoj C.“The gift card was considered a security deposit till the alleged investigation into the fraudulent transaction and verification of the antecedents of the SSN card holder was over. The fraudsters used to pass on the coupon code and passwords to the blockers, who redeemed them and transferred the amount to the fraudsters through hawala channels or by transferring cryptocurrency into their accounts,” said the DCP.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar said the crime branch teams first raided the fake call centre running in a rented building in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar around 8.30 pm on Tuesday, where 25 tele-callers were busy calling US citizens.“We arrested 30 people, two team leaders – Amit Kumar and Chandrahas Patel – and the manager, Narendra Mishra. The owner of the call centre, Amit Tyagi was also among the arrested persons,” said Kumar.Tyagi’s interrogation, the joint CP said, revealed that he ran a similar call centre in Mangolpuri as well. Another team conducted a raid and caught 67 people, including two juveniles, from the call centre named ‘TeleOne E-commerce Agency’.“We asked Amit Tyagi to produce the licence and other documents for running the call centre but he could not produce any documents. A case of impersonation, cheating and criminal conspiracy was registered and further investigation is on,” added Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-bust-call-centres-duping-us-citizens-arrest-95-detain-2-101625693278311.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab industry cries foul as power shutdown extended by a day||Manufacturers in Punjab on Wednesday condemned the decision of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to extend the three-day shutdown on industrial units by a day. With a number of industrialists willing to pay penalties to keep their units running, the corporation also increased the fine for violation of orders by as much as two-and-a-half times. Also, a delegation of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and other bodies from various parts of the state met the PSPCL managing director (MD) seeking a breather, but to no avail. CII (Punjab) vice chairman Amit Thapar said the situation has turned from bad to worse. “There were many industrialists who in the absence of power back-up wished to operate and were willing to pay penalties to save export orders from being cancelled. They were threatened by PSPCL officials that their supply will be snapped,” said Thapar. Shingora Textiles managing director Mridula Jain said, “Since Europe and the US are opening up now, the buyers are placing orders at the last minute. But with factories non-functional, the delayed shipments are to be shipped by air at our cost or we run the factories on generators incurring a daily expense of ₹2.5 lakh.” The PSPCL had earlier announced power regulatory measure with three weekly-off days for general industry (large scale), rolling mills, arc and induction furnaces consumers from July 7 to July 10. With the fresh extension, the industries will now be shut till 8am on July 11. Corporation MD A Venu Prasad said the power situation is “tight” in view of the prolonged dry spell, increase in demand of power from agriculture sector and the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) units going out of operation. “Rain is expected on Sunday and we hope we will soon be out of this situation. We are not imposing any domestic cuts and hope to give a breather to the industry soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-industry-cries-foul-as-power-shutdown-extended-by-a-day-101625690362298.html

The officials said that Barinder Kaur, daughter of Pearls Group owner Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, was reportedly leaving for the US when she was detained by the authorities at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, on the basis of a Look Out Circular (LOC) issued by the Punjab Police. “Delhi airport authorities intimated Punjab Police and a police team was sent to take Barinder in custody on Tuesday evening. Barinder was produced before a Ferozepur court and sent to a day’s police remand,” official sources privy to matter said. On May 28, Barinder’s husband Har Satinder Singh Hayer, also an accused, was arrested in the case and the SIT also filed a chargesheet against him. As many as 57 people, including company officials and family members of Bhangoo, were booked on charges of cheating, criminal conspiracy and other sections of the Indian Penal Code at the Zira police station in July last year. In April this year, the SIT filed a chargesheet against multiple accused in a Ferozepur court, saying despite the SC’s 2016 stricture, the PACL and its associate companies started disposing of land worth hundreds of crores in and outside India. Several arrests were made by the police on the complaint of one Pardeep Singh of Bhadson in Patiala district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-sale-of-assets-pearls-group-owner-bhangoo-s-daughter-held-from-delhi-airport-101625689642574.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Blazing sun no deterrent to BSF jawans manning barbed fence along Indo-Pak border||At 1pm, the sun was blazing hot at 42 degrees Celsius in the Kahangarh border outpost (BoP) area on the India-Pakistan border near Amritsar district’s Attari village on Tuesday. But the soaring temperature was no deterrent to the dedication of the Border Security Force (BSF) jawans manning the barbed-wire fence. Carrying water bottles with guns strapped around their shoulders, every jawan patrols the unpaved dusty road along the fence on foot for nearly 12 hours a day in two shifts, keeping an eagle eye on any suspicious movement across the fence. There is a lack of greenery along the border and the mercury sometimes touches 45 degrees here, but these troops’ willpower in guarding the sensitive border remains as high as ever. “After joining the force, we undergo special training for some months. The training not only makes us physically strong, but also equips us mentally to stay determined. Though we are also allowed to patrol on jeeps and motorcycles, we prefer to do it on foot given the sensitivity of the area,” said a head constable patrolling the fence. The company commandant, who took the HT team along to the border outpost, said they are responsible for manning the 5.5-km long area, including parts of the rail track connecting the two countries. “We have 80 personnel, including some women, who are deployed for 24x7 patrolling. Those patrolling the fence are from the ranks of the constable to assistant sub-inspector (ASI). Our jawans keep a strict vigil by using binoculars are from seven observation posts in the area. I never came across an incident when a jawan expressed unwillingness to go out citing severe heat,” he says. “When an alert is sounded, more jawans are sent from the headquarters for patrolling and sentinel duty. We have four horses for patrol and two sniffer dogs,” he adds. With the paddy season going on, several jawans are deployed across the fence and before the zero line when farmers go to their fields in the area for sowing the crop. These jawans stay with the farmers from 10am to 5pm. “The jawans are deployed to ensure the farmers’ safety. We ensure the farmers and labourers don’t cross the zero line. We thoroughly search the farmers and their vehicles during their entry and exit from the fencing gates,” says head constable Ram Das Sharma, who is posted as a sentinel. Another jawan demanded that scanners be installed along the fence to check vehicles to save time. When it rains, the dusty unpaved road along the fence turns marshy, making it difficult for the personnel to patrol the area. The company commandant says, “We have special rain suits and shoes for our jawans to perform duty. Since the drone sighting incidents are being reported, our jawans remain extra careful. We have issued shoot on sight orders.” Apart from Jammu, Rajasthan and Gujarat, Punjab shares a 553-km-long frontier with Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/blazing-sun-no-deterrent-to-bsf-jawans-manning-barbed-fence-along-indo-pak-border-101625689524688.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Give financial package to industry for losses due to power shutdown: Sukhbir to Capt govt||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday asked the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to announce a financial package to the state industry for the losses suffered due to the current forced shutdown in the wake of power supply mismanagement. In a press statement, the SAD chief said after suffering huge losses due to the Covid lockdown in the last one-and-a-half years, the industrial sector is under shutdown with the government imposing a three-day compulsory off for units besides closing large-scale industries for five days. “This has broken the back of the state industry which is suffering losses of crores of rupees on a daily basis besides losing orders,” he said. Claiming that the CM was directly responsible for this mess as he holds the power portfolio, Sukhbir said required electricity purchases should be made immediately to ensure adequate power for the industrial sector. “Power should also be provided at ₹5 per unit as promised by the chief minister. The industry is currently paying nearly ₹10 per unit,” he said. The SAD chief called for holding a special Vidhan Sabha session to discuss the complete mismanagement of the state power utility. “The PSPCL, which was declared as the best power utility in 2015 during the SAD government-led tenure, is now finding it difficult to even supply adequate electricity to consumers. Rampant corruption, mismanagement and the Congress government’s failure to add a single megawatt of power in more than four years has led to a situation where farmers are not getting adequate supply for sowing paddy,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/give-financial-package-to-industry-for-losses-due-to-power-shutdown-sukhbir-to-capt-govt-101625689523366.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||7 Jalandhar hospitals issued notices for not installing PSA oxygen plants||The district administration on Wednesday issued show-cause notices to seven private hospitals in Jalandhar for not installing pressure swing adsorption (PSA)-based oxygen generation plants despite repeated requests. Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said the erring facilities are Sharanjit Multispeciality Hospital, Kidney Hospital, Sikka Hospital, Oxford Hospital, Ghai Hospital, NeuroNova Hospital, and Caremax Hospital. On the other hand, the Sarvodya Hospital, Maan Medicity, Innocent Hearts Hospital, Johal Hospital, and Military Hospital have initiated the process of installing oxygen plants.“During the second peak of the pandemic, the hospitals were among those where demand for oxygen cylinders was above 50 per day. They were asked to install PSA plants by August. But no efforts were made by these hospitals to set up these plants to meet their oxygen requirement in view of the next wave. A number of hospitals have set up plants to be self-reliant in terms of oxygen,” he added. The administration may even recommend to the health department to cancel their licences as Covid care facilities in case they do not adhere to the guidelines issued by administration, he said. “Also, these hospitals would be held accountable in case of causality amid the third wave if there is a lack of oxygen,” he added. The hospitals having oxygen plants would get priority in the admission of Covid-19 patients in their facilities, the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/7-jalandhar-hospitals-issued-notices-for-not-installing-psa-oxygen-plants-101625689522290.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Book Simarjeet Bains in rape case: Court to Ludhiana cops||Acting on a complaint by a woman who had accused Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains and six others of rape, sexual harassment, destruction of evidence and criminal intimidation, a local court here on Wednesday directed the police to register an FIR in the case. The 45-year-old woman, a widow, had lodged a complaint against the legislator with city police chief Rakesh Agrawal on November 16, 2020. In view of the serious allegations levelled in the complaint, proper and thorough investigation should be carried out by the local police, said the additional chief judicial magistrate Harsimranjit Singh in his order. “The SHO of division number 6 police station is directed to register an FIR in the case without any further delay,” the court added. The court further stated the footage of CCTV cameras installed at various places near the scene of the crime are required to be collected. The woman said that she had approached Bains for help in 2019 in connection with a property issue after her husband’s death. However, she alleged that the MLA took advantage of her situation and raped her inside his office cabin. Bains, on his part, rubbished the allegations, terming them as politically motivated. Accused used political clout, says court The court said it is quite evident from the material on record that the victim is a hapless woman stricken by adversity who was unabashedly exploited. “The police have turned a blind eye as the accused exercised his political clout forcing the victim to knock the doors of the court for justice,” said the court. “The cries of help by a common man against an overbearing and powerful political figure are often found too faint to be heard at some forums. The complainant had been steadfastly pursuing the complaint against all odds and the extraordinary narrative of the sexual exploitation warrants a thorough investigation,” added the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/book-simarjeet-bains-in-rape-case-court-to-ludhiana-cops-101625689463647.html

The state seeks two more sainik schools — one in Gurdaspur and the other in Bathinda. States like Haryana, Bihar, and Maharashtra have two sainik schools each, while Uttar Pradesh has three,” he said. The Union defence minister assured him of due and adequate action, stating that he personally appreciates the role played by Sikhs and Punjabis in the defence of national security and the defence of India’s social and cultural values. Manpreet also presented a letter by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to the Union minister, stating that the state government has allocated 40 acres of land at Dalla Gorian in Gurdaspur for the sainik school. However, Punjab desires another sainik school in Bathinda. Manpreet also sought defence ministry’s approval and clearance for establishing in Bathinda a modern bus terminus, which is adjacent to the Bathinda military cantonment.

08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Charuni gives ‘mission Punjab’ call, exhorts farmers to fight 2022 polls||Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Charuni on Wednesday called upon the farmers agitating against Centre’s three farm laws to launch ‘mission Punjab’ ahead of assembly elections to form a “kisaan-majdoor sarkaar” in the border state. It is for the first time that Charuni, who has emerged as the prominent face of the agitation in Haryana, has candidly floated the proposal of pursuing political ambitions by turning the ongoing standoff with the Centre into a political movement. Ever since the current seven-and-a half-month-old agitation was launched against the three farm laws (now on the hold) it has united farmers from Punjab and Haryana in massive numbers who have been camping on Haryana-Delhi borders. Charuni’s call for ‘mission Punjab’ is set to give the much-needed ammunition to the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government in Haryana which has been repeatedly saying that by misleading the farmers in the garb of agitation, some self-styled farmer leaders were chasing a political agenda. “Our adversaries will raise questions over this idea...Why we should stay away from politics...Is politics a sinful field? With what authority those already in politics ask others to stay away from politics,” Charuni said while addressing his supporters through a digital platform on Wednesday from the protest site at Delhi-Haryana border. Earlier, the panel of farm unions that has been spearheading this agitation had decided to start “mission UP” in order to topple the BJP government. Differences have cropped up between Charuni and BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who hails from UP. Now, Charuni wants the farm unions to give top priority to his ‘mission Punjab’ call. According to Charuni, even if farmers as voters succeed in defeating the BJP in the states and at the Centre, there is no guarantee that the new government will fulfil their demands. “You have the capacity to change the governments as 65% of the voters are farmers and labourers. In the past, you changed one government after the another in Haryana also, but your demands were not accepted,” he said, adding the solution now lies in forming a “kisaan-majdoor ki sarkaar”. Asking for putting in place a plan to launch mission Punjab, he urged all the farm unions of Punjab participating in the agitation to unitedly jump into the political battle ground of Punjab and “capture power.” He said: “We have tested all the political parties and now the time has come to form a kisaan-majdoor ki sarkaar and set an example in good governance. People of Punjab want change. Hence, launching mission Punjab is imperative.” In an address lasting about 20 minutes, the Haryana BKU leader, whose political ambitions are not hidden, repeatedly appealed “people of Punjab” and “farmers, farm unions and intellectuals of Punjab” to immediately launch ‘mission Punjab’. “All the political outfits of Punjab will run for cover soon after you start ‘mission Punjab’. This is my guarantee,” he said, asking the farm unions to immediately hold discussions on this subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charuni-gives-mission-punjab-call-exhorts-farmers-to-fight-2022-polls-101625689282281.html

08-07-2021||Mumbai||A first since 2005: Chembur society flooding worries residents||On June 9 this year, when heavy rain caused severe waterlogging across Mumbai, disrupting public life, most ground-floor homes in Chembur’s Sindhi Society were submerged in at least 3-feet deep water and muck, as furniture floated around their rooms, elevators in multi-storey buildings were waterlogged and non-functional for days afterwards, and vehicles parked in residential premises were damaged.In response to the annual monsoon audit conducted by HT on June 23, residents from Sindhi society reached out to HT, sharing similar problems. “There was a little over knee-deep water on the ground floor in my home. A lot of our furniture was damaged, and we had to simply wait for the water to recede from the street and then out of our home. We then picked up buckets, mugs, jars and mops, to dry up our waterlogged rooms,” said Hitesh Rupani, who lives in an independent ground and two-storey in Sindhi society.While residents with homes on higher floors were luckier in this regard, Dutta Wadhone, who lives on the second floor of a seven-storey building, said, “Water did not enter our home luckily, but it submerged the elevator shaft in the high-rise building next to ours. The building's lift was non-functional for four days after June 9, and residents who live on the topmost floors were forced to use the staircase.”Every monsoon, residents of Sindhi Society, which is a colony of over 162 plots, witness waterlogged streets. However, this year is the first time since the deluge of 2005 that water entered most homes, leaving the residents running from pillar to post to ensure it does not repeat.According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities, Sindhi Society is located in a low-lying area and is prone to flooding due to its natural topography.A senior civic official from the storm water drains department said, “I have not yet inspected this particular waterlogging spot after June 9. However, over the years, as road level has increased due to repair and resurfacing work, the private premises in this area have naturally become low-lying. BMC has individual plans for mitigating waterlogging in chronic flooding spots. In this case, the Mahul pumping station will bring relief.”Owing to repeated encounters with waterlogging every year, residents have come up with solutions for their houses.Davinder Gupta, who lives in an independent building inside Sindhi Society premises, raised the elevation of his entire house by 4feet, after the 2005 deluge. He said, “Earlier, if water entered my house during the monsoon, I have seen my fridge being lifted off the floor, and float on the water surface. I raised the elevation of my entire house after the 2005 deluge. However, I still had ankle deep water in my house this monsoon.”Prithviraj Chauhan, additional municipal commissioner of the M/West ward, with jurisdiction over this area, said, “Immediately after June 9, I visited the area and directed the localised work to be taken up to mitigate waterlogging during the rest of the monsoon. BMC staff checked all drains in the area end to end for blockages. I also directed all drains in the area to be inspected and re-cleaned.”Chauhan attributed the incident partly to the very heavy rain in Chembur on June 9. He said, “Chembur recorded among the highest amount of rainfall across the city, in a very short span.”Residents of this society met with their elected representatives earlier this week, seeking a resolution to the problem. Rahul Shewale, MP representing the area, said, “I met the residents and have taken note of their issues. The BMC is already working on short-term localised solutions for this problem. In the long run, once the Mahul pumping station is set up and operational, it will bring relief to waterlogging problems in this area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-first-since-2005-chembur-society-flooding-worries-residents-101625687783193.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Cabinet reshuffle: Four Union ministers from Maharashtra, BJP goes by poll call||Political calculations in Maharashtra, as the Shiv Sena chose to stick to its new allies and the considerations for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, seem to have guided the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) choice of ministers to represent the state in the union cabinet. With chief minister Uddhav Thackeray remaining BJP’s top target in the state, his biggest critic and former chief minister Narayan Rane has been inducted as a cabinet minister, which is an indication that the party is likely to become more aggressive against Thackeray and the MVA government in the state. Besides Rane, MP from Bhiwandi Kapil Patil, MP from Dindori in Nashik Bharati Pawar and Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad have been inducted in union council of ministers. The BJP is expecting multiple political benefits by inducting Rane who wields influence over coastal Konkan area. The Sena is strong in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Konkan where Rane can help the BJP grow. Besides, he will come in handy for civic polls especially in Mumbai where Sena’s main support base in Marathi speaking population a significant chunk of which comes from Konkan. Rane is also a prominent Maratha leader and has been vocal on the demand for reservation to Maratha community in government jobs and education. With Supreme Court scrapping the reservation provided during the Fadnavis-led BJP government rule, the BJP is blaming the Sena-led government. Rane will come in handy to gain further support of the community which has been a traditional support base for both the Congress and NCP. Most importantly, Rane is now expected to lead the BJP’s campaign against Thackeray. Rane spent over two decades in Sena before he quit the party in 2005 following power tussle with Thackeray. Since then, he has been the latter’s fiercest critic. Within two hours of taking the oath, he launched an attack on the Thackeray government, blaming it for the SC order to strike down the Maratha reservation. “The Maratha reservation was struck down as the Maharashtra government failed to fight the legal battle in the right spirit. I will ensure that the reservation is restored,” he said. Not just Rane, BJP’s other choice from the region, Kapil Patil too is aimed at countering the Shiv Sena which is strong in Thane and Palghar districts. Patil is elected from Bhiwandi in Thane district and comes from Agri community which has significant presence in Thane, Raigad and Palghar districts. BJP expects Patil to get the community’s support. Of the four ministers, two are from Other Backward Classes (Kapil Patil and Bhagwat Karad) and one each from Maratha (Rane) and tribal community (Dr Pawar). With OBC community protesting against scrapping of political reservation it had in local self-government elections, the move assumes significance. Dr Pawar’s selection is also aimed at strengthening party’s presence in north Maharashtra where Sena and NCP have significant presence. The selection of ministers from Maharashtra also has a clear stamp of Fadnavis. According to party leaders, Fadnavis had a clear say in the selection. The selection is also a snub to Munde clan as the party picked Bhagwat Karad over Beed MP Pritam Munde, who is daughter of late Gopinath Munde and sister of prominent leader Pankaja Munde. A senior BJP leader said by choosing Karad over Pritam Munde, the leadership has tried to send out a message against dynasty. “Former CM and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has a clear imprint on the choice from Maharashtra. Exclusion of Sanjay Dhotre may disturb the equations in Vidarbha as no replacement has been given for him from the region comprising of 11 districts. We have only one union minister, Nitin Gadkari, who represents the region which is the stronghold of the party,” the leader said. “The BJP is in no mood to compromise with Sena politically and by inducting Rane and Patil, the message sent out is loud and clear. Secondly, had there been any plan of joining hands between the two, Sena would have been taken on board in NDA and given a few berths,” another state BJP leader said. The leader however said there is strong sentiment among party loyalists over the upper hand given to outsiders. Three of the four MPs from Maharashtra who were made union ministers have been new entrants to the BJP in the past five-six years. “I do not think the party has overlooked its loyalists. It is in fact a fair balance between the loyalists and new faces. Rane has been chosen to represent the cabinet for his seniority and his experience not because he is bete noire of Shiv Sena,” said union minister and former Maharashtra BJP chief Raosaheb Danve. Rane said, “I do not think much about the purpose behind my choice by the party leadership and if it to give a fitting reply to Sena.” Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “The BJP has given chance to the new faces like Dr Pawar and at the same time sent out the message against dynasty politics. The cabinet expansion has also ratified that the Sena and BJP are now unlikely to come together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cabinet-reshuffle-four-union-ministers-from-maharashtra-bjp-goes-by-poll-call-101625687721578.html

08-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai students protest ‘institutional murder’ of Stan Swamy||Students from various institutes in the city including the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay protested against the “institutional murder” of Jesuit priest and activist Father Stan Swamy who died on Monday. Swamy was among 16 activists who are under trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in an ongoing investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Bhima-Koregaon case. NIA has maintained that all the accused have links with the banned CPI(Maoist) party. On Wednesday, students came together at Chaityabhoomi in Dadar under the Joint Action Committee for Social Justice (JACSC), Maharashtra, to protest against NIA and demand that the judiciary acquit those arrested in the case. “In a chilling and cold-blooded manner, Father Stan Swamy has been institutionally murdered by the fascist Brahminical state. Fr Stan has been a life-long human rights activist, a tribal leader, an academician, an intellectual and a loved Jesuit. The murder of Fr Stan is the latest development in the well-planned state conspiracy against dissenting voices under what is to be known as Bhima-Koregaon case. It exposes the real face of the government, its investigative agencies and the judiciary,” JACSC said in a statement.Rafid Shahab, zonal secretary, Student Islamic Organisation, South Maharashtra, said, “We are deeply anguished by Father Stan’s killing and offer our deepest condolences to his family and near and dear ones. He was arrested on trumped up charges in a bogus conspiracy case and was denied bail as well as basic amenities in prison despite his old age and worsening health condition. Father Stan has been killed in judicial custody not because of any crime he committed, but because his ceaseless fight for justice was making the powers that be uncomfortable. Once again, this case has highlighted the fundamentally unjust nature of UAPA and other draconian laws.” “The demands of the protesting students and activists included release of the 15 accused in the Bhima-Koregaon case, quashing of the case, release of all political prisoners, and complete repeal of UAPA,” said a student from IIT-Bombay who is part of Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-students-protest-institutional-murder-of-stan-swamy-101625687301460.html
08-07-2021||Pune||Girish Chaudhari’s arrest a step in the right direction, says whistleblower in Eknath Khadse case||The whistleblower in the money laundering case against Eknath Khadse termed the arrest of Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari by the Enforcement directorate (ED) a step in the right direction. Hemant Gawande, the whistleblower who brought the case to light, said, “Chaudhari was involved in the sale of deed and the Bombay high court directed to register his name as an accused in the case. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has been inquiring for the past two years and it seems like a result of that inquiry. This is an open-and-shut case with no hidden points. He (Khadse) was the revenue minister and he directed revenue officers to forge the papers,” said The investigation following Gawande’s allegation had shown that Khadse had wrongfully acquired the land for ₹3.75 crore whereas the value of the land was more than ₹31 crore. The land located in Bhosari was first acquired from a private citizen in 1971. The original owner of the land was also an accused in the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) case.In 2017, ACB had lodged an FIR against then revenue minister Khadse, who was with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the time, his daughter Mandakini and son-in-law Chaudhari on the direction of the Bombay HC. In 2020, Khadse left the BJP and joined the Nationalist congress party (NCP).Reacting to Chaudhari’s arrest, Gawande said, “This is a legal process now. It never was and is still not pleasant news for me, but it does feel like a step in the right direction. Politicians enter politics for serve the people and eventually they forget why they entered the system and the only agenda that remains is earning money. This is bound to happen when money becomes more important. It should be a message to all politicians. I simply exposed this act.” Lawyer Asim Sarode, who had given some documents to ED regarding the case, said the ED action was following a trail of evidence. Sarode represents anti-corruption activist Anjali Damania who opposed ACB’s clean chit to Khadse in a Pune court in 2019. “ED is investigating in the right direction. Considering all the documents I have seen and prima facie evidences in the case, it is clearly a case of money laundering and misuse of power and position. He has asked and gotten many documents to be forged by officers working in the revenue department. I have a set of documents which clearly show that he changed many details to benefit him in the purchase of that land. Crores of rupees were siphoned through Mandakini Khadse and Girish Chaudhari. My client Anjali Damania found a pooja-essentials selling kiosk owner in whose name a shell company was formed. She came up with a list of such shell companies created to launder the money, and it was submitted in court. So we opposed the clean chit given to Khade in the Pune court,” said Sarode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/girish-chaudhari-s-arrest-a-step-in-the-right-direction-says-whistleblower-in-eknath-khadse-case-101625687301981.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||8 drown in Thane water bodies in 3 weeks as lockdown restrictions ease||Eight people have drowned in various lakes and water bodies in Thane city over the last three weeks. The officials claimed that since the lockdown restrictions were eased, many youngsters have started crowding the water bodies to enjoy with friends. However, none of them are trained swimmers. The Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC) officials have requested the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) officials to install barricades and signages along the water bodies to discourage people from entering.The body of the 35-year-old man who drowned in a quarry in Diva on Tuesday, was found 24 hours later with the use of underwater telescopic cameras.After the Thane city relaxed restrictions, the cases of drowning were witnessed since June 20, when three people drowned in two different ponds in Yeoor. The next day, two more drowned in Yeoor. The other drowning incidents were witnessed in Upvan Lake and the quarries in Kalwa and Diva.Santosh Kadam, head of the TMC’s RDMC, said, “Last year, there was a strict lockdown and thus not many ventured to the water bodies or quarries in the city. However, this year with the easing of the norms, many go out to have fun with friends at the water bodies. In all the cases, the deceased neither knew to swim well nor could they judge the depth and flow of water. A well-trained swimmer can analyse the risk. People should avoid getting in the water bodies, especially during the monsoon.”Additional commissioner of TMC, Sandeep Malvi, added, “We will be putting some warning signs at the water bodies frequented by the people.”The Vartak Nagar Police, under whose jurisdiction six out of the eight cases were reported, said that they have also increased the vigil at the spots where the incidents occurred. Santosh Ghatekar, senior police inspector of Vartak Nagar Police Station, said, “We have increased patrolling along the Upvan Lake. However, Yeoor forest is huge and we cannot cover it entirely. We have taken the help of forest officials to keep a watch on the people going near Nilapani Lake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/8-drown-in-thane-water-bodies-in-3-weeks-as-lockdown-restrictions-ease-101625687242832.html

The decision has sparked discontent among the residents who said it was unfair to deprive them of power, especially when most of them are in a financial stress due to the Covid-19 lockdown.AEML has defended the move saying it was acting against those who are not complying despite multiple remainders. “We have initiated disconnection action against only those consumers who have failed to make their electricity bill payment since June 2019. AEML has given multiple notices to these consumers. The continued payment default by them is resulting in undue tariff burden on other paying consumers. Therefore, we are constrained to disconnect power supply of defaulting consumers,” said AEML spokesperson.AEML, which provides electricity to nearly 3,250 customers at Siddharth Colony, said the 700 consumers owe ₹2.5 crore as unpaid bills.Residents said they have defaulted on bill payment as things are beyond their control. “My son lost his job last May and since then has been jobless. He is getting a job at Churchgate but he cannot travel as trains are shut for common citizens and buses are full. The company should not cut electricity on humanitarian grounds,” said a 56-year-old homemaker who is among the defaulters.Last August, AEML had put on hold their mass power disconnection drive after protests and a compromise was reached where the residents agreed to clear the bills. However while a majority of them paid the same, around 700 are still to do the needful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/700-adani-consumers-face-power-disconnection-due-to-non-payment-of-bills-101625687241598.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs MU to issue degree certificates of Mithibai College students||In a relief for Mithibai College at Vile Parle and 1,763 of its students whose degree certificates were withheld by the University of Mumbai (MU) as the college changed its marking system midway through the courses pursued by the students, the Bombay high court (HC) recently directed MU to hand over the degree certificates. The court added not giving the degree certificates to the students was illegal and would prejudice the interest of some students. The college had changed its marking system after being deemed an autonomous institution by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in March 2018. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice CV Bhadang, while hearing the petition of Mithibai College and its in-charge principal Dr Krutika Desai, was informed by senior advocate Prasad Dhakephalkar and advocate SK Srivastav that the college was granted autonomous status by UGC in March 2018, following which a governing council was constituted. He added that in June 2020, based on feedback from students, the council decided to include total marks and percentage along with grades in statement of marks and notified grading system for all its courses for academic year 2019-20. He further submitted that in light of the decision, MU withheld the issuance of degree certificates of 128 students who were allowed to keep term (ATKT) from 2018-19, 1,380 students of the regular undergraduate course from 2019-20, and 255 students of postgraduate courses stating that the college could not have changed the marking system midway through a course and the same should have been applied from the beginning. The college then approached the HC as the decision to refuse issuance of degree certificates was illegal and would prejudice the interest of some students who have enrolled themselves for further studies and taken up employment. Advocate Akshay Shinde for MU submitted that the varsity had issued letters to the college on July 6 and August 16, 2020, and again on March 5 this year stating that as per rule and precedents, the petitioner college was not entitled to mid-way change of grading system of a course that has commenced before the autonomy was granted. MU added that the college should change the system from first year of the course. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “The ground taken by MU to withhold degree certificates is not tenable and is vague. There could be various reasons that other autonomous colleges have followed a pattern of introducing the grading system from a point in time. It does not mean that they have surrendered their autonomy... Therefore, this ground taken is incorrect and has to be rejected.” The court noted that exams have already been held and students had been given a statement with percentages and marks, based on which some of them have taken admissions for higher studies in India and abroad while some have taken up jobs. It was not possible to recall and resubmit the results for change of grades, HC noted. “This practical difficulty is not considered by the board of examination of MU... The action of the university in not issuing the degree certificate to the students at this stage is, in fact, prejudicial to these students. We hold that reasons given to withhold degree certificates are not legal and valid,” the bench said and directed MU to issue the same within four weeks from the date of order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-directs-mu-to-issue-degree-certificates-of-mithibai-college-students-101625687242245.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: Widen probe, says Bombay HC to CBI||Referring to the observation of the Supreme Court that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh were working in close confidence, the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to inquire in it. The court noted that as per the April 5 order of the HC which directed CBI to conduct a preliminary probe into the allegations of corruption, bribery and criminal conspiracy against Deshmukh and others, the inquiry would not be complete unless the role of everyone including the unknown persons was considered in the April 21 first information report (FIR). On its part, CBI assured the court that it was carrying out a comprehensive probe and all those involved in the case had been identified and their roles had been ascertained, hence Deshmukh’s petition was misconceived and deserved to be dismissed. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the petition filed by Deshmukh challenging the FIR filed by CBI based on the HC order, was informed by senior advocate Amit Desai along with advocate Kamlesh Ghumre that the FIR was vague and inconsistent as it had not disclosed the names of persons between whom the alleged cognisable offences had occurred and also did it mention the place where it took place or the amount involved.Desai reiterated that the CBI’s FIR was filed with mala fide intent and vested interests as it named only Deshmukh and did not disclose names of other accused. In light of these submissions, Desai sought setting aside of the FIR. The HC had, on July 5, sought to know from CBI the names of the “unknown persons” mentioned in its FIR against Deshmukh and had observed that since it was over two months since the FIR was lodged, it expected the CBI to disclose the names as well as give a report on the progress of the investigation in a sealed cover. The bench then observed, “The highest functionaries cannot be let off. The minister might have been told to reinstate (suspended police officer Sachin Vaze), but can the person holding the main post say I will obey them and not perform my duties? The committee which reinstated Vaze can be probed.” The court then said that whoever held the top post could not plead innocence saying that he was helpless in the face of orders by someone superior. It was equally the duty of that officer, who was holding the main post to prevent the wrong. While expressing hope that CBI would conduct a broad base investigation, the bench said, “At this stage, hopefully the probe agency has found conspirators...If Sachin Vaze was such a dangerous man, then subject to what CBI counsel has to say, the committee that reinstated him can also be added as an accused in the case. We are not naming any individuals now. Who has inducted this inspector after 15 years?” Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi for CBI informed the bench that as per the investigating officer, persons involved in the case were identified and the amount of money involved was determined as well. Lekhi assured the bench the probe was comprehensive and no person covered in the complaint was excluded. He further said the grounds to challenge the FIR taken in the petition were misconceived. Justifying the CBI probe, Lekhi submitted it was necessitated as the state had failed to take adequate action on the March 20 letter written by Param Bir Singh.CBI will continue its arguments on July 12. Will not arrest Param Bir Singh, Rashmi Shukla till July 29: State to HC Due to paucity of time and other scheduled matter the Bombay HC adjourned hearing of the petitions filed by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, seeking quashing of an FIR lodged against him by the Thane Police under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act till July 28. Similarly, the petition filed by senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in the illegal phone tapping case registered by Mumbai Police was also adjourned to July 28. In light of the adjournments, the state assured the HC that no coercive steps, including arrest would be taken against Singh or Shukla till July 29 which was accepted by the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-case-widen-probe-says-bombay-hc-to-cbi-101625687181413.html

An MC committee had also visited Chennai to study the solid waste management model there last month. While there is a waste to energy plant and waste to compost plants in Okhla, the MC committee will visit the factory unit of a company where machinery including, static compactors, etc., are manufactured.Mayor Sandhu said that the MC is studying different solid waste management methods/techniques adopted by various companies before finalising the contractor and the method/technique for disposing of waste generated in the city.The MC has been facing flak over its apathy in dealing with the solid waste in the city. The monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also recently directed the PPCB to impose a penalty on the civic body for its failure to deal with over 16 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste accumulated at the main dumpsite at Tajpur road. Over 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage, which is generated in the city daily, is getting added to the legacy waste due to MC’s failure to deal with the issue. The residents have also been raising hue and cry over the open dumping of garbage at different points in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-panel-goes-to-delhi-rajasthan-to-study-waste-mgmt-model-101625687062221.html

There is not enough water to meet our household needs such as washing clothes, cleaning, cooking etc. In the absence of adequate arrangements by the civic authorities, we are relying on private tankers which we are hiring on our own,” said a resident, Sukhminder Singh.Another local Moti Lal said the water supply is resumed for a few hours whenever a complaint is lodged with the councillors or MC authorities. But they are bearing the brunt of MC’s failure in finding a concrete solution to the problem. “It is very difficult to fetch water in buckets from afar in sweltering weather, especially for women,” he said.Despite several attempts, councillor Surinder Atwal could not be reached for comments.MC sub-divisional officer Sukhdeep Singh, however, said the tubewell installed in the area had developed a snag and it has been repaired now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/facing-water-woes-for-a-month-residents-in-ludhiana-s-peeru-banda-protest-against-mc-101625686822164.html
08-07-2021||Bangalore||Govt looks to revive contact tracing to tackle Delta plus in Bengaluru||Bengaluru When Bengaluru reported its first Covid-19 case on March 8, 2020, the health department along with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) made a list comprising 2,666 primary and secondary contacts of the 40-year-old techie who had arrived from the US. In the following months, BBMP ensured that most of the contacts were traced and tested. This was one of the reasons why Bengaluru had only 385 cases on June 1, 2020, while Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi had reported 15,770; 40,877 and 20,834 cases respectively on the same day. More than a year later, while there was a surge in Covid cases, authorities were tracing only four contacts, while government guidelines required 20 contacts per patient to be traced. The failure of contact tracing was one of the biggest reasons attributed to the spike in Covid cases in the state, among others. With the cases coming down and the new Delta variant posing a threat, authorities are now looking to revive the contact tracing efforts, at least in the case of Delta variants. So far, the state has recorded 725 cases of the Delta variants and two cases of Delta plus. As per BBMP records, out of the 725 cases of Delta, 525 are from Bengaluru, followed by 77 from Vijayapura and 40 from Udupi. Two labs in Bengaluru — Nimhans and National Centre for Biological Sciences — are involved in genomic sequences of samples. A day after the second Delta Plus variant was detected in Karnataka, on June 23, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar had said that the state is monitoring the emergence of new variants and announced six genome labs for genome sequencing. “Wherever we have a suspicion, we are doing genomic sequencing. We are doing random checks of five per cent of the total samples checked,” Sudhakar had said. The Delta variant was the most predominant variant circulating in May and June in Karnataka. Nearly 3,000 samples have been processed at the two labs and Nimhans has done more than 1,000 of them. However, health department sources said the samples are almost a month old and results are coming now. The increased genome sequencing comes with a challenge and an opportunity for the health department officials. Since the new variants are considered a bigger concern, the health department is now focusing on increasing contact tracing in these cases. “We want to trace as many contacts as possible in these cases,” said a senior health department official on Tuesday, who didn’t want to be named. He, however, added that the department is facing a big challenge in contact tracing since it takes at least 15 days for genomic sequencing of samples. “Since it takes time for these sequencing results to come, most of the patients have left the hospitals after recovering or it has been a considerable amount of time before we can go back to them,” he said. He added that contact tracing in normal cases has been affected in recent times because of the spike in cases during the second wave. “In most of the cases, we have to go back to ensure in-depth tracing is done in case of Delta variants. It is a difficult task,” the officials added. Experts, however, said there is no need to panic over the new variants. Dr Ravi, former head of the neurovirology department at NIMHANS and member of Karnataka’s TAC on Covid-19 said that unnecessary panic around the variant should be avoided. “Whether is it more infectious, there is no evidence to show that. They are tracking the patients to find if the virus spreads faster. We will know this soon,” he said on Tuesday. He added that it doesn’t seem that variant is more virulent. “The pattern of disease in Delta plus is no different from what is seen in the Delta variant. Most of the Delta plus cases are from samples collected more than a month ago. My reading is that if it was collected one month back, had it (the Delta plus variant) been so deadly, there would have been a higher number of cases and deaths. In fact, the numbers are low now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/govt-looks-to-revive-contact-tracing-to-tackle-delta-plus-in-bengaluru-101625686761520.html
08-07-2021||Bangalore||Four K’taka MPs join Modi’s new Cabinet||Bengaluru Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inducted four new faces from Karnataka into his cabinet that included a mix of senior and debutant parliamentarians. While DV Sadananda Gowda, the union minister for chemicals and fertilizers, was dropped, Shobha Karandlaje, A Narayana Swamy, Bhagwanth Khuba and Rajya Sabha member of parliament from Karnataka, Rajeev Chandrashekar, were inducted as ministers of state into the cabinet at the centre. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a higher priority to Karnataka and inducted four ministers from the state. On behalf of the people of the state, I thank the Prime Minister. He has done a very good selection. All four are influential, works impactfully and this will also give the state more strength,” CM BS Yediyurappa said on Wednesday. Analysts and observers said that the induction of Karandlaje, the firebrand member of parliament from Udupi-Chikmagalur, raises several possibilities and has a bearing on the power struggle between the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national leadership and CM Yediyurappa. “The induction of Shobha Karandlaje can be seen in one of two ways. One is it can be seen as Yediyurappa is secure or as a kind of prelude to attacking Yediyurappa,” said one Bengaluru-based political analyst, requesting not to be named. BY Raghavendra, MP from Shivamogga and Yediyurappa’s son, who was among the probables; did not make it to the union cabinet. The analyst cited above said that the induction of Raghavendra would have been a clear sign that Yediyurappa would be replaced to further emphasize the BJP’s unwritten rule that only a person per family would be able to hold an administrative post. “The current selection is not going to have any political dividends for the BJP in Karnataka,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University told Hindustan Times on Wednesday. Karandlaje is a Vokkaliga, Khuba a Lingayat and Narayana Swamy is from the scheduled caste, which was seen as giving representation to all the major communities in Karnataka. Chandrashekar, a Brahmin, is likely to have been considered as a “technocrat”, analysts indicated. Karandlaje has long held a reputation of making provocative and communally charged statements, courting controversies, especially in the run up to the 2018 assembly elections. The selection also indicates how Yediyurappa’s powers have waned over the last decade where the BJP has ignored the choices put forward by the state and selected its own candidates even in the past for nominations for Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and even the legislative council. Barring Chandrashekar, the other three candidates are proficient only in Kannada, which puts them at a disadvantage in Hindi, a dominant narrative in Delhi, analysts said. They add that this would help the continuing consolidation of powers with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and very little with the ministers. The BJP is yet to come to an agreement with Yediyurappa who hopes to not just continue in the top chair for the remainder of the two-year term but also placate his sons within the party and government, people aware of the developments said. The 78-year-old Yediyurappa has been left to fend for himself amid attacks from all quarters, including from within his own government and party, alleging corruption, non-performance, mismanagement of the covid-19 pandemic and charges that his other son, BY Vijayendra, is running a parallel administration under the aegis of his father. His past cases have also returned to haunt him, making the negotiations harder between the BJP and the chief minister over a possible replacement. Though Yediyurappa was hailed as an unchallenged leader of the Lingayats, believed to be the single-largest community in the state, the sub-sects of the groups have now started to question this title, threatening to further dilute his core-support base, Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/four-k-taka-mps-join-modi-s-new-cabinet-101625686703221.html
08-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP MP attacks Suvendu Adhikari after quitting party post; then withdraws letter||Kolkata: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament Saumitra Khan on Wednesday announced his resignation as chief of the party’s youth wing in West Bengal and launched a blistering attack on party colleague Suvendu Adhikari. Khan, whose outburst led another BJP leader Rajib Banerjee to target Adhikari as well, however, withdrew his resignation nearly seven hours later, reportedly after the intervention of the BJP’s central leaders.“I take an opportunity to inform that under the instruction of our BJP leader’s BL Santhosh ji, Amit Shah ji and Tejasvi Surya ji, I withdraw my resignation as a mark of respect,” Khan, who represents Bishnupur seat in the Lok Sabha, tweeted late on Wednesday evening.The brief message did not refer to his scathing attack on Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of opposition in the Bengal assembly, earlier in the day that accused Suvendu Adhikari of promoting himself and misleading the party leadership.“The present LoP (leader of opposition) of the assembly is trying to project himself and not the party (BJP). He is frequently going to Delhi and misleading the central leaders while trying to project himself as the top leader. The way the party’s Bengal unit is moving nothing good can happen. I had even pointed out some flaws to the central leaders before the polls, but I was side-lined,” Khan, who subsequently clarified that he would remain with the BJP, said in his video message on Facebook. Soon, Rajib Banerjee also joined in. The leader of the opposition shouldn’t unnecessarily attack the chief minister who has returned to power for the third time with a sweeping victory, and instead should focus on how to check the rise in fuel prices, Banerjee said in a social media post.Suvendu Adhikari and his two in-house critics, Saumitra Khan and Rajib Banerjee, were earlier with the Trinamool Congress.In January 2019, Saumitra Khan was the first among the three to join the BJP, and won the Bishnupur Lok Sabha seat in the general elections that he had won in 2014 as a TMC candidate. Suvendu Adhikari joined the party in December 2020, contested from Nandigram and delivered chief minister Mamata Banerjee first electoral defeat in her political career of over three decades.Rajib Banerjee joined the BJP in January 2021, just two months before the assembly elections, and fought elections on a BJP ticket but did not clear the electoral test. This isn’t the first time that Rajib Banerjee has spoken out against his party and sparked speculation about his next move in June when he went to meet Trinamool Congress’ state general secretary Kunal Ghosh at his residence.Adhikari brushed aside the darts that his two colleagues were throwing at him.“Many people have this habit of posting on social media. These shouldn’t be taken seriously. When the state cabinet was formed, some TMC MLAs had made some comments on social media. They were not taken seriously. Today I am not taking this seriously,” said Suvendu Adhikari.Kunal Ghosh said Rajib Banerjee had made a valid point.“Saumitra may have spoken his mind. But whatever he has said is absolutely right. Adhikari joined the BJP to escape from central agencies and overnight he started personally attacking TMC leaders. But that didn’t help BJP. Instead, his joining triggered an ugly fight between the old times and newcomers,” said TMC’s Kunal Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-mp-attacks-suvendu-adhikari-after-quitting-party-post-then-withdraws-letter-101625686642004.html

It expressed serious concern over winding queues and heavy rush outside liquor outlets across the state. The state reported 15,600 new cases with a test positivity rate of 10.36% on Wednesday. The experts’ team sent by the union health ministry has asked the government on ramp up its virus control measures on a war footing. Health is more important than revenue, the court reminded the government and summoned the excise commissioner in this regard. A bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice P Chaly observed that Kerala is number one in Covid case share in the country and although the government is trying to control the spread, some places like liquor outlets continue to witness heavy rush and it can’t be allowed. The court expressed concern over flouting pandemic norms in liquor outlets and directed the government to furnish a reply by next Tuesday. The court said that even though periodic orders were issued by the central and state governments regarding virus protocol guidelines, “they do not seem to be observed in letter and spirit at some places, particularly in liquor shops.” “It is clearly mentioned in the above orders (of the Centre and states) that any lapse in following the restrictions would be viewed seriously. But we find that no action is taken against the defaulters so far,” it said. It also reminded the government that health is more important than revenue. In Kerala, booze and lottery are main revenue earners of the government. The corporation said in the 40-day lockdown during the second wave, the state lost ₹1000 crore. The court was hearing two public interest litigations - one filed by a lawyer P Vijayan who has sought directions to the state to prevent overcrowding outside liquor vends and the second initiated by the court on its own based on a letter by one of its judges. After checking some of the photographs furnished along with the petition by Vijayan, the court noted that there was large-scale gathering or big queues in front of liquor shops. Meanwhile, there is no dip in cases in the state. With 1,50,630 samples tested, 15,600 came back positive taking the TPR to 10.36%. Kerala also reported 148 deaths taking total fatalities to 14,108, according to the data released by the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-hc-pulls-up-state-over-rush-at-liquor-shops-101625686401366.html
08-07-2021||Other||War of words between AIADMK and BJP over Tamil Nadu electoral loss||Chennai: Two months after the state elections, AIADMK and BJP have been sparring over former AIADMK minister CV Shunmugam’s statement that the Dravidian party lost the assembly polls due to its alliance with the saffron party. In the assembly elections, the AIADMK won 66 seats, BJP won four and their combined alliance with other regional parties won a total of 75 seats.Speaking at an event in Vannur, the video of which began circulating on Wednesday, the former law minister says, “Since we had an alliance with BJP, we entirely lost the minority votes...The most important reason for loss is our alliance with the BJP. Minorities don’t have any issues with our party and governance. But due to ideological differences they have with the BJP, they didn’t vote for us.” Shunmugam lost to DMK’s R Lakshmanan by a margin of 22,291 votes in Villupuram. Reacting to the speech, BJP’s general secretary KT Raghavan said that minorities across India are voting for the party. “Even some of our cadre think that we lost in a few places because we allied with the AIADMK and due to certain decisions they took while they were governing in the last four years,” said Raghavan. “But we have to see if CV Shunmugam’s statement is the party’s opinion.” BJP’s Khushbu Sundar shared a Tamil newspaper report of his speech and tweeted, “Actually it’s the other way around.”The AIADMK said it’s not a formal statement but an off the record comment made during an internal meeting. “It was an internal party meeting. Several party members can share their opinions. That’s off the record,” AIADMK’s former minister and spokesperson D Jayakumar said. “He spoke among the party cadre internally so I cannot give my opinion on his statement.”Amid the war of words, AIADMK’s coordinator and deputy opposition leader O Panneerselvam tweeted a statement that the AIADMK has full faith in the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Considering the interests of the nation and also the welfare of Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK-BJP alliance will continue and there is no second opinion on this,” he said.In a joint statement, without mentioning BJP, AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami reiterated that the alliance formed ahead of the 2021 assembly elections will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/war-of-words-between-aiadmk-and-bjp-over-tamil-nadu-electoral-loss-101625686345234.html
08-07-2021||Lucknow||First two Delta Plus cases confirmed in Uttar Pradesh after genome sequencing, one dead||Genome sequencing has confirmed the first two cases of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh. One of them is a medical student from Gorakhpur who recovered in May, while the other patient, a resident of Deoria, died the same month. Both are from eastern Uttar Pradesh. “These were old Covid cases. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing, and they tested positive for the Delta Plus variant of Covid,” said additional chief secretary (medical health) Amit Mohan Prasad at a press conference here on Wednesday. The 23-year-old doctor of BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur had tested positive on May 23 and her sample was sent for genome sequencing, which tested positive. The medical student recovered in home isolation. All her contacts tested negative for Covid. The health department took samples of all the people who came in contact with her in the past over two weeks. “Till now, the samples of two patients have been confirmed for the Delta Plus variant,” said Dr Ganesh Kumar, principal of the Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur.The 66-year-old man from Deoria had fallen ill in the first week of May. He tested positive and was admitted on May 7. During this period, only his sample was sent for genome sequencing which tested positive for the Delta Plus variant.The man died on May 29 at BRD Medical College where he was admitted, said a senior health official. “There were six family members in close contact with the man. They tested negative for Covid,” said the health official. Over 100 people on the contact list of these two patients were screened. The close contacts are still being monitored and their health update is being taken by the health department The samples were sent to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi. Among the samples sent to Delhi from Gorakhpur, 27 tested positive for the Delta variant and two for Delta Plus.In Uttar Pradesh, the genome sequencing facility has recently started at King George’s Medical University and samples are now being sent to KGMU. UP’s first case of Kappa variant reported from Gorakhpur The first case of the Kappa variant of the coronavirus in Uttar Pradesh has been reported from Gorakhpur following genome sequencing. The B.1.617.1 variant of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has been designated as Kappa while the B1.617.2 variant has been named Delta. Kappa is a variant that is linked to the B.1.617 lineage of mutations that has also given rise to the Delta variant. Dr Amresh Singh of the microbiology department at the Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College Gorakhpur said, “We have received results of 30 samples till now. Of the 30 samples, 27 tested for Delta, two for Delta Plus and one for the Kappa variant of Covid.” In all, 72 samples were sent from Gorakhpur to New Delhi for genome sequencing. The results of the remaining 42 are awaited. As it evolved, the B.1.617 branched out into new lineages. One of those, B.1.617.2 is called Delta and is the most prevalent variant at present in India. The other lineage, B.1.617.1, is called Kappa and it was designated as a VoI by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in April this year. According to WHO, a VoI is one that “has been identified to cause community transmission/multiple Covid-19 cases/clusters, or has been detected in multiple countries”. B.1.617 has been found to carry more than a dozen mutations of which two stand out: E484Q and L452R, which is why this variant has also been called the “double mutant”. Kappa was first detected in India and more than 3,500 of the close to 30,000 cumulative samples submitted by the country to the GISAID initiative, which maintains a global database of novel coronavirus genomes, are of this variant. In the last 60 days, the Kappa variant has made up 3 per cent of all samples submitted by India. India, in fact, leads the GISAID table for Kappa submissions and is followed by the UK, US, Canada, etc. GISAID is a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses and the coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/first-two-delta-plus-cases-confirmed-in-uttar-pradesh-one-dead-101625686344726.html

The order details the duties and responsibilities of the MOH and other MC staff regarding sanitation in the city, for which they would be made accountable and against which their performance will be measured.The MOH will ensure that sanitation is regularly being performed in all parts of the city and there shall not be any garbage dumping points, other than the designated ones, the MC commissioner has directed.The area chief sanitary inspectors (CSI) and sanitary inspectors (SI) will be personally responsible for regular cleanliness activities and attendance of field staff. Removal of any visible eye soars, garbage dump, piling of waste along roadside or any vacant areas will be personal responsibility of the area SI. In case, an unclean area is found, disciplinary action will be initiated against the SI concerned, states the order.Officials to stay in the fieldTo prevent absenteeism among sanitation workers and ensure effective supervision, the presence of the MOH and other MC officials on the ground has been made mandatory. “MOH will ensure his presence in the field to supervise cleanliness activities in the forenoon and he will compulsorily spend this time in the field,” states the order. Area SIs will have to remain in the field the whole time the sanitation workers are on duty, while CSIs will also spend the first half of the day on the ground and submit a daily report to the MOH, which will be further submitted to the commissioner through the joint commissioner.The monitoring cell of commissioner office has been directed to ensure that the daily report is presented before the MC chief after collecting it from the MOH office. Residents decry poor sanitationHitesh Puri, chairperson, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said, “The sanitation situation in the city leaves much to be desired. In the past few months, we have seen garbage getting piled up on the roadside. Also, construction waste is being openly dumped in residential areas. It’s high time the MC enforces discipline among its workers to ensure cleanliness in the city.”Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, said: “There should be no visible garbage points in the city, as per the directions of the Swachh Bharat Mission and Swachh Survekshan 2021 protocol. The city’s star rating was reduced to three last year from the self-assessment of five because of the garbage eye soars across the city. This year, the situation has worsened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sanitation-chandigarh-mc-chief-fixes-accountability-of-officials-101625686343585.html

It has also asked the faculty not to submit award lists. The move comes a day after Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations (PFUCTO) made a similar appeal to teachers, and is expected to delay the declaration of exam results.The federation had held a meeting on Tuesday to deliberate on the delay by the Punjab government to implement pay scales recommended by the UGC and 6th Punjab Pay Commission. It was hosted by PUTA and attended by all constituents. The PU teachers’ body has said the delay is adversely affecting its members as well. It also wrote to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar on Wednesday informing him about the decision to suspend evaluation work. “While demanding immediate implementation of UGC pay scales and regulations, PFUCTO decided to give an ultimatum of two weeks to the Punjab government. They have decided to suspend all the evaluation work at the university level,” states the letter.PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar said: “We are forced to take such a harsh step due to the delay in implementation of UGC pay scales by the Punjab government. We hope that the state government will take necessary steps so that students do not suffer.”While PU officials were not available for comment, it has been learnt the authorities are likely discuss the matter with PUTA on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-pu-teachers-to-suspend-evaluation-work-may-delay-results-101625686162027.html

His video was shared on the Instagram page, Dharmshalalocal, and was widely circulated. “This little kid was seen on the streets on Dharamshala asking people to wear a mask. He doesn’t even have shoes to wear. See the smirking faces of these people. Who is educated and who is uneducated here?” read the caption of the post. The precocious child, who hails from Gujrat, said, “I would see policemen asking people use a mask. So, I thought I should also do it, as people were not following protocol.” As a token of appreciation, the local police honoured Amit and presented him with a pahari cap, snacks and an energy drink. The administrators of ‘Dharamshalalocal’ gifted pairs to Amit and his brothers.Abhay Karki, who runs the Instagram page, said help is also pouring in from locals.“An elderly couple gifted him clothes while many want to fund his education,” he said, adding that they will speak to his parents, who are out of town, once they return. Kangra senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vimukt Ranjan said that the situation in the hill state was alarming as tourists were not following Covid norms. “I have directed that police assistance rooms be set up at McLeodganj and Bhasunag to tackle the massive tourist influx. We will impose heavy penalties on those not following the norms,” Ranjan said, adding that he would visit McLeodganj and Bhagsunag on Thursday to review the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anticovid-fight-5-year-old-dharamshala-boy-becomes-police-mascot-101625685862376.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Former Congress leader Kripashankar Singh joins BJP||Former Congress leader and former minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday in presence of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil. Singh’s induction in the party is assumed to be an attempt by the BJP to woo north Indian voters in forthcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.Singh, who was Mumbai Congress chief during 2008-2012 quit the party in September 2019 after he felt sidelined by the party leadership. The leader is believed to have moved closer to BJP after he was discharged from a multi-crore disproportionate assets case by a special court in 2018. “I got everything in my political career without asking for anything. Likewise, there are no conditions put forth for any position. I was upset with the Congress over its stand of abrogation of Article 370 and I had asked for the reason on party’s stand on it. I would definitely work in the interest of party during the BMC elections,” he saidThe induction of Singh, however, has not gone well within the party. A few BJP leaders took to the social media to remind the party that the leader had blamed RSS for the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/former-congress-leader-kripashankar-singh-joins-bjp-101625685501215.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||NO2 pollution in Mumbai shoots up in a year||The city witnessed a 52% increase in the level of gaseous air pollution caused by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in April this year (as opposed to April 2020), says a new report by Greenpeace India (Behind the Smokescreen) released Wednesday. The report also claims that the general quantity of NO2 — a byproduct of fuel burning by motor vehicles, power generation and industrial activity — rose during this one month period in eight capital cities across India, also includingDelhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur and Lucknow.Delhi saw the most dramatic increase in NO2 levels during the study period, at 125%, followed by Chennai (94%), Bengaluru (90%), Hyderabad (69%), Mumbai, Jaipur (47%), Lucknow (32%) and lastly Kolkata (11%). NO2 can severely impact respiratory, circulatory and neurological systems in humans. With recent studies establishing a direct correlation between ambient air quality and the prevalence of severe Covid-19, the increase has elicited worry from experts.Many said these results, based on data from satellite observations, point to the heavy burden of tailpipe emissions from vehicles and other emissions from non-essential industries, which were all shuttered during the Covid-19 induced lockdown last year. This year, however, the movement of vehicles has been allowed to continue.“Tailpipe emission is a major reason for the rise in NO2 levels in air pollution of Mumbai. There are around 40 lakh private vehicles in Mumbai. The immediate agenda should be to restrict the number of private vehicles, increase public transport, phase out older automobiles, and promote clean mobility,” said Bhagwan Kesbhat of Waatavaran, an organization that works on air pollution.The sheer scale of these emissions sources becomes clearer when one looks at the deweathered scenario, which gives a picture of air pollution after removing the cleaning effect of the weather. “The deweathering model suggests that 2020 air pollution (in Mumbai) was strongly influenced by weather conditions and that the increase would have been as much as 164%, had weather conditions been the same in both years,” the Greenpeace report says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no2-pollution-in-mumbai-shoots-up-in-a-year-101625685441418.html

Four of the assailants have been identified as Gurpreet Singh, Gagandeep Singh, Jagga and Varinder. The case has been registered on the complaint of Chanpreet Singh.Additional deputy commissioner of police-II Jaskaran Singh Teja said the mother of one of the accused has been apprehended in connection with a drug peddling case. Police also found that the weapon used in the crime was not registered and was illegally procured. “Raids are on to nab the accused. Once they are nabbed, we will find out where they sourced the illegal weapon from,” said ADCP-II Teja.Gunshot victim stableMeanwhile, a day after the incident, residents of Preet Nagar area are still in shock.Victim, Surinder Singh, 75, a retired irrigation department employee, who had received a bullet injury on his left arm, is recuperating at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H). His condition is said to be stable.Surinder’s son Sukhdev Singh said his father had gone out to get ice-cream for his mother, who had her tooth extracted on Tuesday. “My father had stepped out around 7.30pm to bring ice cream for my mother. When he was about to pay the ice-cream vendor, he saw a youth running and two youngsters chasing him. One of the assailants opened fire and the bullet hit my father,” said Sukhdev.“My father fell on the road after being hit by the bullet.

08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Second vaccination turns woeful for 68-year-old Panchkula woman||Amid administrative oversight and a dwindling stock of Covid vaccine, a 68-year-old Panchkula woman, due for her second jab, was made to endure a harrowing experience.Over a five-day period, she went from pillar to post all by herself, waited in long queues for hours, met health officials, wrote applications — all this over a confirmatory text message, that the health department never sent.Suresh Rani of Sector 4 received the first dose of Covishield on April 7, but she neither got a text message nor any certificate confirming the administration of the jab to her.“On July 2 morning, I visited the Sector 16 dispensary to get my second jab. I waited for 2.5 hours in the scorching heat as there was no seating arrangement for the beneficiaries. Despite this, I waited another hour, only to be told by the health staff that there was no record of my first vaccination. It was then recommended that I visit the civil hospital in Sector 6,” said Rani, who had arrived at the dispensary at 10am that day and had to leave at 1pm without the jab.The next day, she trudged up five floors to meet the civil surgeon at the Sector 6 hospital, but the latter was out for a meeting.“Someone told me to visit Dr Meenu, who sits in room 104 of a building near Laxmi Narayan Temple. On July 5, I went to see her. After waiting for half an hour, she met me and explained the procedure. She asked me to write an application and give it to the chief medical officer,” said the elderly woman, who wrote to civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur highlighting the issue.Rani said that the civil surgeon listened to her with patience and called another doctor who told her to visit the Sector 7 dispensary at 12.30pm. However, this only added to her ordeal.“The situation was bad at the dispensary. There was a long queue of people waiting for jabs in the sun, including elderly citizens and women with little children. Within minutes, they announced that the centre had run out of vaccine,” she said.Seeing the panic, she decided to leave. But that is when a doctor came looking for her. “She took me to her room, made me drink water and called someone who gave me the jab and certificate,” Rani said, questioning the poor arrangements. “They should have mercy on people, especially the elderly, during this pandemic,” she said.When asked, immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sasan said, “Those who haven’t got the confirmation of first dose should write an application to the principal medical officer (PMO). It’s after PMO’s confirmation that we can give the second dose.”Covishield vaccine stock is almost over in Panchkula. There are hardly over 200 doses left, whereas Covaxin is only available for those seeking a second shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/second-vaccination-turns-woeful-for-68-year-old-panchkula-woman-101625685263319.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Despite searing heat, no end to power pangs in Mohali||Unscheduled power cuts running into four hours continue in Mohali city, Zirakpur, Kharar and Dera Bassi, compounding the woes of residents, who are already reeling under soaring temperatures. Overloaded transformers and lines due to inadequate transmission network are leading to outages through the day and night, leaving residents sweating.There are nearly 2,00,000 consumers in different categories in Mohali. As many as 1,70,000 are domestic connections, which have become even more crucial amid the pandemic, with residents required to work from home and attend online classes. According to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) records, nearly 50% of the 19 grid sub-stations in the district do not have sufficient infrastructure to cater to the rising power demand in urban areas, leading to overloading and crippling of supply. Among them 66 kV grids in Sunny Enclave and Gillco Valley in Kharar; Tuer village near Mullanpur; Seonk; Phase 9, Industrial Area; Bhabat at Zirakpur; and Mubarikpur remain fully loaded and any further increase in demand leads to power cuts.In several locations, power cables are also lying damaged.Kamal Tiwana, a resident of Kharar said, for the past one week, they had been facing unscheduled power cuts for two to three hours daily. A resident of Zirakpur, Jandial Naresh said a power outage started at 11pm on Tuesday and was not over until 11am the next day. Random outages through the night are prevalent across GMADA sectors in Mohali city as well.Worse, residents’ calls to the power department for resolution also evoke no response. In July 2019, with a move to resolve complaints swiftly, PSPCL has outsourced the relevant services to UK-based Teleperformance company. Yet, while the 1912 helpline is often unavailable, another helpline number 9646-115-973 always remains busy when the power is out, complain residents.PS Virdi, member, Punjab State Advisory Committee, regulatory electricity commission, said despite repeated reminders, the corporation had failed to upgrade the basic infrastructure. “The cables should have been replaced and capacity of the transformers increased, but no steps were taken over the past one year,” he said.PSPCL superintending engineer Mohit Sood said transformers were getting overloaded with demand peaking over the past week. “Work is in progress to sort this out at various sub-stations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-searing-heat-no-end-to-power-pangs-in-mohali-101625685202003.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Heatwave again sweeps Chandigarh, relief ahead||With the maximum temperature on Wednesday rising up to 40.2°C, five notches above normal, the India meteorological department (IMD) again declared heatwave in Chandigarh. Heatwave had last swept the city on June 30 and July 1, for the first time this summer. Meanwhile, the city also experienced the first warm night of the season, with the minimum temperature going up to 29.5°C, five notches above normal, in the wee hours of Wednesday. Similar conditions are likely to continue on Thursday, with the mercury expected to rise even further, said IMD officials. However, light rain is expected in the city from Thursday night, and will likely bring down the temperature by around five degrees within the next three days.According to the IMD, a heatwave is declared in the plains if the maximum temperature is more than 40°C and at least 4.5°C above normal, or if it crosses 45°C. A warm night is declared when the maximum temperature is more than 40°C and the minimum temperature is at least 4.5°C above normal. “While chances for heatwave will continue on Thursday as well, some relief can be expected from Friday onwards. Light to moderate rain up to 30 mm is likely with easterly winds starting to blow in the region again. Monsoon is expected to become active and cover the remaining parts of Punjab and Haryana by July 10,” said IMD scientist Shivinder Singh.A low pressure area will also develop over the northern parts of Bay of Bengal from July 11 and an increase in rainfall is expected in the region after that. With 127.8 mm showers in the city till Wednesday (since June 1), against a normal of 180.5 mm, the monsoon is 28% deficit, according to the IMD.In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 35 and 41 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 29 and 30 degrees, according to the weather bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heatwave-again-sweeps-chandigarh-relief-ahead-101625685142313.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Dilip Kumar never joined politics, but was close to leaders||Actor Dilip Kumar never joined active politics, but shared cordial relations with politicians in Mumbai as well as Delhi. The thespian was also actively involved in social work in the city. His attempts to bring two communities together following the 1992-93 Mumbai riots were widely appreciated. Right from the late prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to Maharashtra politicians such as NCP chief Sharad Pawar and the late Shiv Sena supremo, Bal Thackeray, the actor shared cordial relations across the political spectrum. He had even campaigned for former defence minister VK Krishna Menon, who was contesting the general elections from Mumbai North constituency in 1957, according to cinema chroniclers.“He used to insist and come to campaign in almost all my elections. I have been an admirer of ‘Yusuf bhai’ (Dilip Kumar) since childhood. We came in contact when I became active in politics and moved to Mumbai. We have shared a special bond since the past 40-50 years,” Pawar told ABP Majha on Wednesday .In 1999, Kumar campaigned for former prime minister Manmohan Singh, for the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. In 1994, he accompanied former prime minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh on a fundraiser tour of Dallas, US.Though Kumar and Thackeray were on friendly terms, his relations with the latter strained after the Sena supremo chose to take a hardcore Hindutva stance. Thackeray also opposed his decision of accepting Pakistan’s highest civilian honour called Nishan-e-Imtiaz. In 1999, he decided to retain the award after consulting with the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In a 2000 interview with NDTV, Kumar had said only the Shiv Sena and its leader had demanded he return the award and that if he did not, he should leave India and go back to Pakistan. “I think it is an abominable pronouncement by an irresponsible person. It has no legal validity. It is hurtful. It offends one’s sense of personal dignity and one feels wronged…,” he had said.In 1991, he was conferred with ‘Padma Bhushan’ (third highest civilian award) and ‘Padma Vibhushan’ (second highest civil award) in 2015. The then Union home minister Rajnath Singh visited his residence to present him the award along with then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Kumar was also active in social work. In 1980 he was appointed as Sheriff of Bombay. “As he was active in social work the then state government appointed him as Sheriff,” Pawar said.Kumar also led a relief campaign that started post the communal riots in Mumbai, as thousands of families were affected.“Dilip Sahab was the face of the relief campaign started in the city with the help of Bombay Aman Committee and several other social organisations to provide relief to the people. A control room was set up for the people for SOS calls and other relief work. The meetings related to the campaign used to be held at his residence at Pali Hill. Victims were provided with ration, their houses were repaired and they were also rehabilitated wherever possible,” said Sarfaraz Arzoo, editor, Daily Hindustan, an Urdu newspaper.Arzoo used to be part of the campaign as he used to provide contacts of the victims. According to Arzoo, many bureaucrats also helped Kumar for this campaign in personal capacity.Maulana Mehmood Dariyabadi, senior cleric and general secretary, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), said Kumar used to contribute in every possible way whenever the city was in crisis. “Soon after the communal riots in 1984, Kumar made attempts to restore peace in Mumbai and took help of several leaders from Dalit community. He also helped in relief work for lots of people post the 26/11 floods in Mumbai. He used to contribute in every possible way whenever the city was in trouble.”Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray reached his residence, along with son and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, to pay their last respects. “We have lost one who has enriched the Indian cinema and a shining star. He played everlasting roles and he will remain in the hearts of cinema lovers forever,” Thackeray said.Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari described Dilip Kumar as a “Mahanayak” of his generation. In his condolence message, Koshyari said, “Dilip Kumar was the first super star of Indian cinema. He represented the golden era of Indian films. I was so fascinated by his Mughal-E- Azam that I saw the film back to back twice. Unfortunately, I didn’t watch any film thereafter and Mughal-E- Azam remained the first and the last film I watched.”He said the Indian film industry is undoubtedly the most popular in the world. The credit for this success goes as much to film stars such as Dilip Kumar as it goes to great filmmakers, directors, lyricists, technicians, musicians, playback singers and others. “Dilip Kumar was a legend. Nobody can take his place. To me he was a ‘Mahanayak’,” he added.“I hardly have any friends in the cinema world. However, Dilip Kumar has been an exception. Like his fans, I admired him immensely as a thespian although I do not quite remember when we met for the first time,” wrote Sharad Pawar in his autobiography, ‘Sharad Pawar, On My Term’.“As a personal friend, he volunteered to address many of my election rallies in Baramati. He would call up my Pune-based childhood friend, Vitthal Maniyar, and ask, ‘Suna hai elections ayee hain. Bataaiye kab jaana hai?’ (I hear elections have been announced. Tell me when I should go.) Keeping aside his other engagements, he stole time between his shooting schedules and travelled all the way from Mumbai to Baramati to address my poll rallies. The turnout was always huge and the crowd lapped up every word he said,” Pawar said, hinting at a special bond he used to share with the veteran actor.Another politician, who he was close to was Rajan Patel, former Bombay Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief, a veteran Congress leader. Pawar believes he met Dilip Kumar through Patel. “The three of us grew quite close. Since our families also got acquainted, all of us went on long vacations in India and abroad whenever time permitted,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dilip-kumar-never-joined-politics-but-was-close-to-leaders-101625685141196.html
08-07-2021||Other||Ludhiana MC to conduct survey to identify dry, dead trees in city||To prevent loss of life and property during thunderstorms, Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has decided to conduct a survey to ascertain the number of dry or dead trees standing in different parts of the city. Dry, dead and bent trees have high chances of being uprooted during storms so the MC plans to replace such trees with new ones. The civic body has issued instructions to its staff to click pictures of such trees for proof. The MC has also roped in some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for the survey. Punjab road safety council member Rahul Verma said it is a good move as trees uprooted during thunderstorms pose a threat to residents’ lives and also hinder smooth traffic movement. Such incidents also cause damage to property and disrupt power supply due to snapping of electricity wires, Verma added. Dry and dead trees can be found across the city, but most commonly in Sarabha Nagar, Civil Lines and nearby areas.On June 10, during a late evening thunderstorm, trees got uprooted at as many as 55 locations in the city. Near Jamalpur Chowk, commuters had a narrow escape as trees fell on two cars that were stuck in traffic. The occupants of the car managed to get out safely. In Haibowal Kalan area, the boundary wall of a plot collapsed on a park car. Similar incidents were reported in Civil Lines, Model Town Extension, Model Gram, Haibowal, Dugri, Jamalpur, Gill road, Chandigarh Road, Rakh Bagh among other areas. Movement of traffic was hit at a few points, including Jamalpur Chowk, Civil Lines, Gill Road etc, after the damaged trees fell on roads. Electricity wires were damaged in most parts as trees fell on power supply lines. MC chief to take final decisionMC junior engineer (horticulture wing) Kirpal Singh said once the staff submits the reports of their respective areas, along with the pictures of trees, a compiled list will be submitted to MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal for the final decision on replacement of trees. “This is with the view that there is no unnecessary replacement. Sometimes healthy green trees also fall during thunderstorm, but this activity will minimise the risk,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-to-conduct-survey-to-identify-dry-dead-trees-in-city-101625685082105.html

Thackeray also asked his officials to spread awareness about vaccination among the masses and not let their guard down due to the decline in the number of cases.Thackeray, while addressing the collectors and commissioners of various districts, asked them to hold dialogues with the various industrialists in their districts to keep their units running in the eventuality of a third wave. “Those industrialists who are able to house their workers in their premises itself should be encouraged and if that is not possible, they should be accommodated in the nearby premises. The officials should offer all possible help to them,” said Thackeray. “The two waves were very challenging and we were able to restart the economic activities to some extent. However, in view of the third wave, it was necessary to maintain the momentum of the economic activities and hence the movement of the workers needs to be curtailed,” said Thackeray.Currently, an overwhelming number of businesses are facing huge losses due to the restrictive business timings and lack of sales. The Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), the apex body of traders in the manufacturing and retail sector, welcomed the move, but wanted the government to ease current restrictions. “It is a good move, but we need to assess how much it will succeed. However, the state needs to extend timings of the retail shops as the current one (7am to 4pm) is not enough and also allow common people to travel on trains,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT.Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 662 new cases and nine deaths, with its toll reaching 15,573.The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,122,893.There were 216,512 tests done on Wednesday, while the number of recoveries clocked 8,899.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 114,625, while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 123,857. There are currently 114,625 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 17,708 patients, followed by Thane with 16,657 active patients. The toll has now reached 123,857, with Pune leading with 17,034 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,573 patients..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ensure-businesses-not-hurt-in-case-of-3rd-wave-says-uddhav-101625685021137.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Congress starts reorganising party structure ahead of MC polls||After three successive electoral defeats at the hands of the BJP in Chandigarh, the city Congress has started preparing early for the municipal corporation polls scheduled for December this year. The Congress lost two Lok Sabha elections from the Chandigarh seat to BJP and also got a drubbing in the last MC elections (2016), where it could win only four of 26 seats. In view of the civic body elections, the party has started reorganising its party structure in the city, and is aiming to finalise a panel of probable candidates, three each from every ward, by the end of July. The total number of wards for the MC elections were recently increased from 26 to 35. Currently, Congress has five councillors in the 26-member MC house. Chandigarh Congress chief Subhash Chawla said the emphasis is now on building a strong party structure. “We will soon appoint secretaries, vice-presidents, general secretaries, organisational secretaries, special invitees and permanent invitees. After constitution of the state executive, a sub-committee will initiate the process of selection of candidates from each ward.” A panel of shortlisted probable candidates will be prepared from each ward. “Generally, we have eight to ten names of candidates from each ward. After discussions and analysing the ground report, we will shortlist three probable candidates from each ward,” said Chawla. The party has already started block-level meetings with the upcoming MC elections as the main agenda. “We have changed the strategy this time around. Instead of asking block level members to come to the party office, we are holding meetings in blocks.” Chawla’s tenure marred by factionalism Notably, it hasn’t been a smooth sailing for Chawla, who took over the party presidentship in February this year. The internal strife in the party had repeatedly come to the fore, particularly with the previous city chief Pardeep Chhabra openly criticising the incumbent city party leadership on multiple occasions. At the same time, the Chawla faction had indicated that action could be taken against Chhabra for his public criticism of the party’s leadership. “The factionalism in the party is set to flare up again. There is a concern in the party’s old guard over the new president favouring younger candidates over them. Chawla had even stated earlier that nearly 50% of the tickets would go to youngsters,” said a local Congress leader, requesting anonymity. The anti-incumbency factors against the ruling BJP can work in its favour. The entry of the Aam Admi Party (AAP) in the city’s MC polls might cut into its vote share. On his recent visit to the city, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal had asked the local party leadership to start preparing for the MC elections. But, Congress leaders have downplayed the relevance of AAP in the coming MC elections. “It will be a two-cornered fight between BJP and Congress. AAP organisationally is not in a position to make any major dent in the electoral fortune of the party,” said a Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-congress-starts-reorganising-party-structure-ahead-of-mcpolls-101625684841344.html

The sarpanch assured him that his daughter would be fine and asked him to visit the in-laws’ house the next morning.Later in the night, Surinderpal received another phone call, this time from Mandeep’s father-in-law, stating that she had received some burn injuries and was taken to the civil hospital.“I wasted no time and rushed to the civil hospital. But my daughter had been referred to the Rajindra Hospital in Patiala by then. She died on the way (Tuesday morning). When I finally got to see her body, I was shocked to find that she had suffered wounds on her head and jaw, and there burn injuries all over her body,” said the inconsolable father.He revealed that the dowry harassment had started right after marriage. “My daughter had got married to Balram Singh about three years ago. They have a one-year-old daughter. Balram as well as her family members used to frequently assault my daughter,” said Surinderpal.“We had raised the matter with the village panchayat. Some responsible people in the village helped us settle the issue but my daughter continued to suffer abuse at her in-laws’ house,” said Surinderpal. He added that he regrets not being able to bring his daughter back home to safety. “My son-in-law told me that he would kill my daughter if I didn’t take her home.

Agra MP SP Singh Baghel, who has also been inducted into the government, said that they would popularise various schemes and initiatives of the Prime Minister.Apna Dal (Sonelal) leader Anupriya Patel said the BJP-Apna Dal alliance had been liked by the people as it had yielded the results thrice.“We would continue the alliance as it has the people’s backing,” she said. BJP MP Ajay Mishra ‘Taini’ said, “The Prime Minister is a performance-oriented person. He himself works hard and expects the same from others. We engage in the politics of development.”Yogi, other party leaders congratulate new faces from U.P. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, other ministers and BJP functionaries in Uttar Pradesh welcomed the increasing representation of the state in the second Modi government’s first reshuffle on Wednesday. All the new faces in Modi ministry from U.P. have been made ministers of state. In his individual congratulatory tweets to all the new ministers, Yogi wished them best of luck in their new roles. He also praised those leaders who were associated with social causes. For instance, he congratulated Kaushal Kishore, the MP from Mohanlalganj who has at times been critical of the government’s handling of Covid, by praising the social efforts he was engaged in. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev also congratulated the new ministers from UP. “The increasing representation of U.P. is good news. I wish the new ministers all the best. We would take the policies of Modi and Yogi governments to the people and, together, we would ensure the BJP wins the 2022 UP polls,” the U.P. BJP chief said. Former ally Rajbhar hits out at BJP While the BJP focused on placating various castes in ministry expansion, BJP’s former ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar described the reshuffle as a “farce”. Rajbhar is a former UP minister.“Caste groups like Banjara, Rajbhar, Biyar, Arkvanshi, Aarak, Prajapati, Pal, Bind, Nishad, Kashyap, Kewat, Nai, Gond, Lonia and Vishwakarma feel cheated. In the 2022 UP polls, all these neglected caste groups would teach this government a befitting lesson,” Rajbhar tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-union-ministers-of-state-from-uttar-pradesh-welcome-their-new-assignment-101625684721813.html

08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Only 15% eligible population fully vaccinated In Chandigarh||In nearly six months of the vaccination drive, only 15% of the Chandigarh’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The UT, however, is performing much better than many states, as nationally, only 5% of the adult population has received both doses.According to the latest electoral list, around 7.1 lakh people are to be jabbed in Chandigarh. As on July 6, 1.05 lakh (15%) have completed their vaccination cycle while 4.75 lakh (67%) have taken the first dose. Even as the population in the 18-44 year age group was the last to be covered under the drive, as many as 2,12,973 have got the first dose, as compared to 2,09,440 in the 45+ age group.However, the younger population will have to wait for the second dose as the gap for the Covishield was extended to 84 days a couple of weeks after they became eligible for the first dose. Only 1,301 (0.6%) have completed the vaccination cycle, as compared to 69,693 (33%) in the 45+ group. Among healthcare workers and other frontline workers, who were the first target group, as many as 59% and 65%, respectively, are fully vaccinated.“When the vaccination drive began, people in Chandigarh were showing hesitancy to take even the first dose. By the time people started coming forward, the time gap between the doses was increased. Most of the population will become eligible for the second dose from next month,” said UT principal health secretary Arun Gupta, adding that special camps are being set up at public places and mobile vans are going to every locality to vaccinate people.“The first dose of vaccine helps in building antibodies, but without a booster dose, the antibodies are insufficient to fight the virus, especially with more deadly variants spreading fast. The beneficiaries get a message from the Co-WIN app when they get eligible for the second dose, and they must end hesitancy and come forward to take the jab,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health services, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-15-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-in-chandigarh-101625684302452.html

08-07-2021||Other||Dilip Kumar loved Lucknow’s cuisine, Dussehri mangoes||LUCKNOW: Actor Dilip Kumar’s love for Urdu and typical ucknowi zaban’ was unparalleled. He spoke chaste Urdu and won millions of hearts with his command on poetry. But each time he came to Lucknow, he would say, “Yahan aakar meri zabaan ladkhadane lagti hai,” ( I stammer whenever I come here) recalled Athar Nabi, founder of Hindi Urdu Sahitya Award Committee, who was very well connected with the actor. When the thespian breathed his last in Mumbai on Wednesday morning, Lucknow remembered his visits to the city. Dilip Kumar visited the city five times and left the people craving for a handshake and a mere glimpse, said Nabi. The lanes of Hewett Road were packed when the actor visited Athar Nabi’s house for lunch in the ‘90s with a select few. He recalled that people gathered in large numbers at the Begum Hazrat Mahal Park and Safed Baradari and KD Singh Babu stadium echoed with applause when the legendary actor aid a visit to these places. Nabi said, “Dilip Sa’ab was a true caregiver to the poor and needy. He was always there to help the downtrodden. I invited him to the city of nawabs and requested him to be a part of a friendly cricket match to raise money for drought-hit people. I told him that the funds would go to the chief minister’s relief fund and he agreed. I requested him to give me his confirmation in writing and he asked me to get it done and he signed it right away.” The actor came here with Pran, Om Puri and many other actors to take part in the event. “He relished the Lucknowi food and admired the culture and handicrafts. No matter where he stayed, food packed from the lanes of the Old City was brought for him and he would feast on the famous galawati kkabab and nihari kulcha of the city,” recalled Athar Nabi, who got a chance to show his hospitality to the actor each time he came to the city. Recalling his first first meeting with the actor, Nnabi said, “I was in Bombay when I expressed the desire to meet him.. Om Prakash ji took me to his home. Dilip saheb had a peculiar style-the staircase from his bedroom opened in the drawing room and each time he came down to meet the guests, he would come rolling his sleeves. I observed the same thing whenever I went to his house. May be this was his style.” Then actor became a part of the Muslim OBC conference held at the Baradari in August 1997. Lucknow also honoured him with Awadh samman given by Hindi Urdu Sahitya Award Committee and celebrated Jashn-e- Dilip Kumar in his honour. “Mulayam Singh Yadav was chief minister and Moti Lal Vohra was governor. The award committee gave ₹1 lakh and Lucknow Nagar Nigam gave ₹1 lakh,” Nabi said. “One thing that was very nice about him was his command on all subjects. He never required a script or a paper to speak on any issue,” said Nabi. “During one of his visits, he was offered custard apple (shareefa) and he liked it so much that whenever he came to the city, he asked for it. He also relished the Dussehri mangoes and regretted that they were not available in Mumbai in those years,” recalled Athar Nabi, who was closely associated with him. Retired bureaucrat Anis Ansari also recalled his first meeting with the actor at the OBC conference in Safed Baradari at Qaiserbagh area in the late ‘’90s. The event was organised by Athar Nabi. The actor was staying at Raj Bhawan. And Ansari was impressed with the actor’s humility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dilip-kumar-loved-lucknow-s-cuisine-dussehri-mangoes-101625684121802.html
08-07-2021||Other||Police bust two fraud call centres in Delhi, arrest 95||New Delhi: Ninety-five people, including 19 women, were arrested for allegedly running two fraud call centres in Delhi’s Kirti Nagar and Mangolpuri from where they contacted the US citizens impersonating as officials of the country’s social security administration and duped them of their money by threatening to revoke their social security number (SSN), police said on Wednesday.The alleged suspects were using illegal techniques, VOIP calling, bypassing the legal international long distance (ILD) gateways for cheating the US citizens. A total of 82 computers, five laptops, 84 mobile phones and 48 identity cards were seized from the two call centres following simultaneous raids conducted at both the premises by teams of the crime branch on Tuesday night. Two minor boys working as tele-callers at the Mangolpuri call centre were also apprehended, the police said.This is the second such operation carried out by the Delhi Police in less than a fortnight against fraud call centres involved in cheating the US citizens. On June 24, 84 people were arrested for allegedly running an illegal call centre and duping thousands of the US citizens of their money by posing as employees of a leading e-commerce company and offering assistance in solving technical issues regarding the company’s services. Ninety-three laptops, four computers and two SUVs were seized along with ₹64.30 lakh from the arrested persons.Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Manoj C said in the latest raids both the call centres were running for the past three to four months. The exact number of the US citizens cheated by the arrested persons and the total amount is still being ascertained. The fraudsters were running the call centres in the garb of a travel agency ’The Global Airfares’. Explaining the modus operandi, the DCP said the mastermind and other key players of the racket obtained the database of the US citizens through their contacts, whom they call “blockers”, based abroad. The database having details of the citizens such as their names, social security numbers, addresses and contact numbers, were given to the tele-callers, who are trained in speaking English with the American accent .The tele-callers contacted the US citizens by impersonating the officials of the US Social Security Administration and intimidated them that their social security number will be revoked because of some fraudulent transactions detected by the department. They tricked the citizens into buying online gift cards of an amount ranging between 100 US dollars to 1,000 US dollars and obtained their coupon codes and the PIN codes from them, said DCP Manoj C.“The gift card was considered a security deposit till the alleged investigation into the fraudulent transaction and verification of the antecedents of the SSN card holder was over. The fraudsters used to pass on the coupon code and passwords to the blockers, who redeemed them and transferred the amount to the fraudsters through hawala channels or by transferring cryptocurrency into their accounts,” said the DCP.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar said the crime branch teams first raided the fake call centre running in a rented building in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar around 8.30 pm on Tuesday, where 25 tele-callers were busy calling US citizens.“We arrested 30 people, two team leaders – Amit Kumar and Chandrahas Patel – and the manager, Narendra Mishra. The owner of the call centre, Amit Tyagi was also among the arrested persons,” said Kumar.Tyagi’s interrogation, the joint CP said, revealed that he ran a similar call centre in Mangolpuri as well. Another team conducted a raid and caught 67 people, including two juveniles, from the call centre named ‘TeleOne E-commerce Agency’. “We asked Amit Tyagi to produce the licence and other documents for running the call centre but he could not produce any documents. A case of impersonation, cheating and criminal conspiracy was registered and further investigation is on,” added Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-bust-two-fraud-call-centres-in-delhi-arrest-95-101625684121180.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula civil surgeon was suspended without CM’s nod||The orders to place Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur under suspension, issued on the directions of Haryana health minister Anil Vij, were not in conformity with the Rules of Business of the state government. The Rules of Business of the state government are framed under Article 166 of the Constitution for convenient transaction of the business of the government and for the allocation among ministers of the said business. As per Clause 28 (1) (xxiv) of the Rules of Business, a proposal for suspension of a Class-1 officer has to be submitted to the chief minister before an order is issued. This means that the chief minister has the power and authority to decide the proposal of suspension of a Class-1 officer. Dr Kaur, who is a Class-1 officer, however, was placed under suspension on the order of the health minister, a glaring omission unlikely to stand legal scrutiny, officials who have dealt with such matters said. While an ex post facto (done after an action has been taken) approval was accorded on file by the chief minister, questions are being asked in the health department about the tearing hurry shown by the health minister in ordering Dr Kaur’s suspension without sending the file to the competent authority — the chief minister. Dr Kaur’s suspension orders, signed by the superintendent health–1, additional chief secretary, health department, Haryana, were issued on the evening of July 6.Haryana speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta had confirmed the suspension was a fallout of personal reasons: “It seems Anil Vij had given some direction, which was not followed by her.”While Dr Kaur refused to talk, Vij and Rajeev Arora, Haryana’s additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, did not revert to HT’s multiple attempts to contact them.Support pours in from residents, fraternityDr Kaur had taken charge as the Panchkula’s civil surgeon in February 2020, a month before the pandemic, and led the fight against it from the front. “It is quite unfortunate... Dr Jasjeet Kaur deserves promotion for her dedication during the peak pandemic period; instead she has been put under suspension,” said SK Nayar, president of Citizens’ Welfare Association (CWA), an apex body of resident welfare associations in Panchkula, adding that he has received messages from many residents, who have shown their disappointment over the government action.The CWA members have also written letters to the Haryana chief minister besides Vij and Gian Chand Gupta, demanding that Dr Kaur be reinstated.People also criticised the move on social media. While a PGIMER doctor called it a “very poor treatment for a frontline worker”, a resident wrote: “Horrible! Only because she could not blindly follow the political bosses.” The government action has also been called “arbitrary” and “unjust” by many. Meanwhile, Dr Rajiv Arya, president, Indian Medical Association, Panchkula, said: “This is not a way to suspend a person who has done so much for Panchkula by making the civil hospital the top public hospital in the state. She did her job really well and must have been given proper opportunity to explain her point before taking the final decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-civil-surgeon-was-suspended-without-cm-s-nod-101625684061999.html
08-07-2021||Other||Delhi govt to bring in colour-coded graded plan to fight Covid-19||New Delhi A colour-coded graded response action plan, proposed by an expert committee formed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to guide the government’s Covid-19 preparedness in case of a possible wave of the pandemic in future, will see shopping malls and shops dealing in non-essential goods and services coming under an odd-even system when the alert level is raised to ‘Yellow’ in the Capital.The proposed plan documents seen by HT show that shops in malls will witness a further reduction in timings under the ‘Amber’ alert and will be shut altogether, along with weekly markets, when the alert is raised to ‘Orange’. Only essential services, stand-alone shops and construction activities, with on-site labourers, will be allowed during the ‘Orange’ alert.The alerts — Yellow, Amber, Orange and Red — have been arranged in terms of their severity, taking into consideration factors such as positivity rate, cumulative new positive cases, and average weekly occupancy rate of oxygen beds, said the documents.“While ‘Red’ is the highest level of alert in terms of severity, most economic activities will come to a halt with the announcement of an orange alert itself. Further restrictions will be planned under ‘Red’ alert when the situation arises,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.The plan, however, is yet to be submitted to Kejriwal or Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).A government spokesperson did not offer a comment.WARNING SYSTEMAccording to the expert committee’s plan, the Yellow alert will be issued if the positivity rate remains over 0.5% for two consecutive days, or cumulative new positive cases for seven days touches the 1,500-mark, or the average occupancy of oxygen beds in hospitals remains 500 for a week.With this alert, shops in markets and malls dealing with non-essential goods and services will be allowed to open between 10 am to 8 pm as per the odd-even formula. While one weekly market will be allowed per municipal zone at half the capacity of vendors, construction activities and industrial establishments and manufacturing units will be allowed to operate, said the government documents.An Amber alert will be issued if the test positivity rate remains over 1% for two consecutive days, or 3,500 new positive cases surface in a week, or average oxygen bed occupancy remains over the 700-mark for a week. Under this alert, construction activities and manufacturing units will be allowed though shops in markets and shopping malls will have to close by 6 pm, said the documents.The Orange alert kicks in if the city records a positivity rate of more than 2% for two consecutive days, or 9,000 cumulative new positive cases over a week, or average oxygen bed occupancy remains over the 1,000-mark for a week. This will entail closure of shopping malls and markets, except shops dealing with essential goods. Orange alert will also bring construction activities, which don’t accommodate labourers on-site, to a halt. Shops selling construction materials are not covered under essentials and, hence, they are likely to remain closed. For factories, only those producing essential commodities will be allowed if workers can live on site, the documents said.A Red alert will be issued if test positivity rate remains over 5% for two consecutive days, or the city touches the 16,000-mark for cumulative new positive cases in seven days, or average oxygen bed occupancy rate remains 3,000 or more for a week. Restrictions on economic activities under the orange alert will remain and more curbs will be introduced depending on the situation, said the senior official quoted above.Under the current plan, the committee has not yet taken a final call on phase-wise restrictions to be imposed on social activities – such as weddings, and political, religious and cultural gatherings, etc – and public transport. “However, the committee is planning to impose a 50% operational capacity curb on the metro service on an ‘Amber’ alert and on buses on an ‘Orange’ alert. The metro is likely to be closed for the general public during ‘Orange’ alert,” said the senior official. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said, “Such a strategy can be very useful in sending the right message to the masses. Currently, the government shares only numbers. Numbers that appear as a threat to me can seem relatively safe to another person. A colour-coded system can help bring in more objectivity and people can better assess what level of precautions to take at what stage. A graded action plan will also ensure better allocation of resources, protect the contact tracing and home isolation models and make triaging easy for the surveillance teams.”The colour-coded alerts in the graded response action plan for Covid-19 are similar to the system imposed by the state to tackle air pollution in the city in the winter. Under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) for pollution in the Capital, air quality scale is divided into four levels — moderate, poor, very poor, severe and severe plus or emergency -- with the government and enforcement agencies implementing a list of do’s and don’ts as and when the pollution level breaches a particular level.The graded response strategy for Covid-19 was drafted by an eight-member expert committee set up by Kejriwal on May 27. On the same day, Kejriwal formed another 13-member expert committee to guide the government on technical and healthcare-related measures in case Delhi sees another wave of the pandemic. At its peak, the Capital witnessed more than 28,300 new cases in a day on April 20, and a positivity rate of more than 36% on April 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-to-bring-in-colour-coded-graded-plan-to-fight-covid19-101625684001941.html
08-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Wife of former Union minister murdered in her Vasant Vihar house||Kitty Kumarmangalam, 70, wife of former Union minister P Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, was murdered at her house in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar on Tuesday night, allegedly by her laundryman and his two accomplices, Delhi Police said on Wednesday, after arresting two of the three suspects. Kitty lived alone in a second floor flat in Vasant Vihar’s A block. Her late husband served as the minister of state for law, justice and company affairs in the PV Narasimha Rao government between 1991 and 1993, and as Union minister for power in the Vajpayee government from 1998 to 2000. Police identified the two arrested men as Raju Lakhan Kanojia, 24, the laundryman, and Rakesh Kumar Raj, 34, a contractual driver with a central ministry. The third alleged accomplice, Suraj, identified only by his first name, also a driver, is yet to be arrested. Police said robbery was the motive and the plan was hatched just a few hours before the murder. The three men also strangled Kitty’s domestic help, Mithila,33, with a belt and left the house believing her to be dead after she fell unconscious. After coming back to her senses, Mithila alerted neighbours, who informed the police control room. Police said prime suspect Kanojia was known to Kitty as he did her laundry for the past five years. He visited the house once every few days to collect clothes. Around 6.30pm, exactly an hour and forty minutes before the three men entered Kitty’s flat, Raju called his two friends and asked them to join him for drinks. Police investigation shows that Raju reached PVR Priya Market in Vasant Vihar on his scooter, where Rakesh and Suraj joined him. Police have found CCTV footage showing the suspects at the market. “They bought three bottles of strong beer and drank it. Then, Raju bought a bottle of whisky and drank in a corner of the market. It was during this drinking session that Raju told them about an elderly woman (Kitty), who lived alone in a “posh” flat. He knew she was the wife of a former minister and may have seen the woman open her locker when he went to collect clothes. He said he could pull off the heist by murdering the woman without any resistance. He shared his plan with his friends and they decided to immediately execute it,” said an investigating officer, who asked not to be named. Around 8pm, the three rode together on Raju’s scooter’s to Kitty’s house. Nobody stopped them on the way. “Everyone in the colony knew Raju; he did the laundry and ironing in most houses there,” said Geeta Ram,74, another laundryman, who irons clothes in a lane near Kitty’s house. The CCTV camera outside the house shows Raju and his two friends entering the building. “At 8.10pm, Raju rang the doorbell and Mithila opened the door. Mithali told us that on hearing the doorbell, Kitty came out of her bedroom to see two new faces with Raju. She objected and asked Raju about them,” another investigating officer, who spoke to Mithila, said. Before the two women could raise the alarm, the three suspects overpowered both Kitty and Mithila. Police said Suraj slapped Mithila and took her to one of the bedrooms, where he strangled her with a belt. In the other room of the three-bedroom flat, Raju and Rakesh pinned Kitty to the floor. Suraj, who thought he had killed Mithila, walked in and they used a pillow to smother Kitty. Police later found her on the bedroom floor. “She must have died on the spot. They ransacked the house, took about ₹2.5 lakh cash, some jewellery and a small safety locker. At 9.10pm, they exited the building, got on the scooter and rode to Nelson Mandela Marg. Hiding in the bushes there, they divided the money (about ₹80,000 each) among them and broke open the locker. They found nothing valuable inside; it only had some papers, which they threw on the road. We have recovered these. Then, they went to their homes,” a third investigator said, requesting anonymity. Around the same time, police said, Mithila regained consciousness. Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police(south west), said Mithila called her husband and also alerted the security guards, who informed the police control room at 10.10pm. The neighbours informed Kitty’s daughter, Ruchira, who lives in Gurugram and son R Mohan, who lives in Bengaluru. “The most independent and powerful woman I knew, the one who taught me right from wrong, who raised me to be who I am, who suffered through my pain, laughed loudest for my joy, loved me unconditionally, left this realm on the date she gave birth to me. 6pm,Lodhi crematorium,” Mohan Kumaramangalam tweeted on Wednesday. A police team reached the flat and found Kitty unconscious on the floor, and the room ransacked. Police took the two women to Safdarjung hospital, where Kitty was declared brought dead. At the hospital, Mithila told police about what had happened. “Mithila told us about the laundryman who had come to the flat. Based on her statement, we checked multiple CCTV cameras, spoke to other laundrymen in the area and located Raju’s address in Bhanwar Singh camp in Vasant Vihar. He was arrested. His accomplice was also arrested on Wednesday morning. We have recovered the cash and the stolen locker from Raju’s house,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-wife-of-former-union-minister-murdered-in-her-vasant-vihar-house-101625683941242.html
08-07-2021||Lucknow||UP’s trillion dollar economy goal: Next move on appointment of consultant likely soon||The Uttar Pradesh government may soon take a call on making the next move about the appointment of a consultant to draw a roadmap to make the state a trillion dollar economy in the next five years.The state government had cancelled the global bids for the appointment of a consultant on March 22, 2021 after making a high-profile announcement earlier. The decision to cancel the global bids came nearly four months after zeroing in on the selection of a bidder.Those aware of the developments said the state government was in the process of holding discussions and a decision on the issue may be taken soon.“Agriculture production commissioner Alok Sinha has convened a meeting to discuss the issue on July 13, 2021,” said additional chief secretary (planning) Suresh Chandra.Although Chandra refused to elaborate on the agenda of the meeting, there are indications that a call on the issue will be taken after the meeting at APC’s level. The state government had decided to cancel the bids due to some lacunae in the process of examination/evaluation of bidders. No reason was, however, given for cancelling the bids in the notice issued by the special secretary (planning department) in this regard on March 22, 2021.“The tender process is hereby cancelled with the approval of the competent authority. Fresh tender notice in this regard is likely to be published soon,” read the notice.The consultant is expected to draw a five-year roadmap (2020-2025) to accomplish the task and the state government may have to rework the timeline as a considerable chunk of the given period has already lapsed.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had floated the idea of making the state a trillion-dollar economy at the Uttar Pradesh Investors’ Summit 2018 here on February 21, 2018. Referring to his association with the investors’ summit as the chief minister of Gujarat and later with the UP Investors Summit-2018 as the PM, Modi said Maharashtra, too, had set a target to become a trillion-dollar economy.“Can Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh compete with each other to become the trillion-dollar economy? Will the Uttar Pradesh government compete with other states? More the competition, the more will be the investment. This will result in the creation of more jobs and strengthen the concept of cooperative federalism,” he said at the UP Investors Summit here.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his team soon began working on the idea. After holding various rounds of discussions, the formal process of floating global bids for the appointment of a consultant began on June 19, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-trillion-dollar-economy-goal-next-move-on-appointment-of-consultant-likely-soon-101625683882432.html

The lab, which has one sequencing machine, will start with eight to ten samples a day and expand the capacity to test more than 40 samples per day. “We hear about new variants emerging in news every day. So far, we were dependent on Centre’s NCDC lab to sequence the samples. Now, Lok Nayak will also sequence the Covid-19 virus and look for variants that are causing the infections in the city. This will help us frame a strategy to tackle the problem,” said Kejriwal at the inauguration.The other lab, which can test up to 400 samples a week, will be inaugurated on Thursday at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. The lab has two machines for genomic sequencing that were used for other viral research so far. “Currently, the researchers are working on standardising the data, after which the capacity will be increased to 40 to 50 samples a day,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director at Lok Nayak hospital. The labs together aim to sequence 5% of the samples that return positive in the RT-PCR test to keep an eye on concerning mutations that might lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases in future. So far, Delhi depended on the labs at National Centre for Disease Control and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, that are part of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG). “With the Central labs sequencing samples from across the country, there was always a delay of two to three weeks in getting results of the samples sent for sequencing. At the beginning of the year, when the UK variant was first detected, our hospital was the designated centre for isolating such cases and it took long to get their reports,” said Dr Kumar. Lok Nayak had admitted 140 patients with UK variant in its special isolation ward. The hospital did not receive any patient who contracted the South African or Brazilian variant of Covid-19. The hospital has formed an inter-department committee that will refer random samples and samples of patients with atypical symptoms for genomic sequencing. “If we receive Covid-19 cases where the symptoms are different or the patient is taking long to recover, the samples will be sent for sequencing in addition to random sampling of admitted patients from within the hospital. We will also receive samples from the districts for sampling,” said Dr Kumar. The districts currently send some samples of mild, moderate, and severe Covid-19 cases, along with cases of re-infection, and infection after vaccination to INSACOG for sampling. The two labs by Delhi government will now share the load of testing samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-inaugurates-first-genome-sequencing-lab-at-lok-nayak-hospital-101625683881188.html
08-07-2021||Other||Delhi: Another heatwave day, but IMD says relief in sight||Delhi continued to reel under the ongoing heatwave with the maximum temperature, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), reaching 42.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, six degrees above normal for this time of the year. However, forecasters said relief is in sight as the mercury is likely to drop by at least two degrees from Thursday onwards. IMD data shows that Delhi experienced a spell of heatwave from June 29 to July 2 with the day temperature rising to as high as 43.5°C on June 30, seven degrees above normal which the IMD classifies as a ‘severe heatwave day’. However, thunderstorm and light showers on July 2 brought the mercury down, pulling the city out of the heatwave spell. From July 4, the city has been again experiencing heatwave-like conditions with the maximum temperature remaining above the 40°C-mark.In the plains, a heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature crosses 40°C or when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5 degrees. A severe heatwave is declared when there is a departure of 6.5 degrees or above from the normal temperatures.“The mercury is likely to subside Thursday onwards and so will the level of discomfort people are facing right now,” said a senior IMD official. On Monday, the IMD revised the dates for the arrival of monsoon in Delhi and parts of northwest and central India to July 10. According to the Met department, this will be the most delayed monsoon in at least the last 17 years. The last time the monsoon had arrived this late was on July 9, 2006. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster, said on Thursday, the maximum temperature is likely to drop by at least two degrees. By Friday, there are chances of thundershowers, which will intensify on July 10-11 in what could be called the “most delayed” monsoon in recent years. Hence, a further drop in the day temperature is expected by July 10, bringing much relief from the soaring heat and humidity.“This has been by far the most delayed monsoon in almost two decades. Now, that the monsoon trough is slowly progressing over northwest India, a drop in temperature is likely. Thundershowers are likely to intensify and bring in rainfall by July 10, with the day temperature likely to drop to around 35°C,” said Palawat. He further said so far, Delhi has been experiencing a combination of soaring heat and high humidity. “On Thursday, even if humidity is high on account of south easterly winds coming from the Bay of Bengal, the drop in temperature will bring some respite, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-another-heatwave-day-but-imd-says-relief-in-sight-101625683823358.html

The officials said the project will not only help people connect with the river but also check the dying ecosystem, both flora and fauna, of the Yamuna floodplains. Under the plan, the DDA will develop close to 1,400 hectares of land on the eastern and western banks of the river. The entire stretch has been divided into 10 projects, of which three — Kalindi Biodiversity, Park Asita East, Asita West — are in advanced stages of construction and will be completed in the next few months, officials familiar with the developments said. One of the biggest challenges in restoring the riverfront, DDA officials said, is removing encroachments and reclaiming the land. Baijal has asked DDA to take measures for adequate surveillance. “Advised DDA to take steps for adequate surveillance and security of the area in collaboration with local police to prevent any encroachment/unwarranted activity,” the L-G tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lg-anil-baijal-reviews-progress-of-yamuna-riverfront-rejuvenation-project-101625683822797.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||Power privatisation put on fast track in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh administration has put the power privatisation process on the fast track. After finalising technical bids, it has now sought the nod of the Union ministry of power for proceeding ahead with the process.UT adviser Dharam Pal has written a letter to the ministry of power on the issue. In the letter, he has stated that since the Supreme Court has stayed the stay order of the Punjab and Haryana high court on the power privatisation process, the ministry should now take a decision on the report of the bid evaluation committee.Pal said that on his recent visit to Delhi, Pal said he also met the secretary, power, and requested him to take further action on the bidding process. Now, the consultant appointed by the ministry will go through the report of the bid evaluation committee and give its final recommendations.“On the basis of the recommendations of the consultant, we will open the financial bids and a final decision will be taken,” said Pal. The nod from the Centre is expected within a week.The bid evaluation committee of the administration has analysed and prepared a final report on the strength and weaknesses of different bids. “After technical bids, financial bids will be opened. After the approval of the UT’s report on financial bids, the final approval of the Union cabinet will be taken, and thereafter the department will be privatized,” said a senior UT official dealing with the privatisation process. Seven firms in the fraySeven companies are in the fray to take over the UT electricity department. They are Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited, Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power, Torrent Power and Eminent Electricity Power Company.The high court on May 28 had stayed the administration’s move to privatise the power department, but the order was stayed by the Supreme Court on June 28, clearing the decks once again. The HC order was passed on a fresh plea from the UT Powermen Union, which had approached court pleading that opening and finalising of the tender bids be stopped. It was argued that the administration is not justified in hurrying through the process amid the pandemic. Earlier, on December 1, too, the HC had slammed brakes on the privatisation process. However, the UT had approached the Supreme Court, which stayed the HC order and remanded back the case to it. The decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. The centre has been pushing for privatisation of electricity departments in all the union territories. The administration had assured the Centre to complete the process by the year end.The move to privatise the profit-making department is being opposed by both the employee union and a number of resident welfare associations. Even several political leaders have raised objections to the decision. Meanwhile, the administration has allayed the fears of hike in charges after the department is taken over by a private company, stating that only the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission can decide the tariff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-privatisation-put-on-fast-track-in-chandigarh-101625683821795.html

Chicken was being sold at ₹220 per kg and eggs at ₹180 per tray, against weekend retail prices of ₹180-200 per kg and ₹160 per kg respectively.“Price of vegetables have increased in the last two days in the wholesale market, which has had a cascading effect on the retail stores. It usually happens during the rainy season. But monsoon is yet to set in,” said Brijesh Kumar, a retailer based in Delhi’s Mehrauli retail market.Petrol prices crossed ₹100 per litre in Delhi and Kolkata on Wednesday after fuel retailers raised petrol rates by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 17 paise in early morning. The 36th price hike in last 65 days have made petrol costlier by ₹9.81 per litre and diesel by ₹8.8 a litre since May 4. Petrol is now priced at ₹100.21 per litre and diesel at 89.59 a litre in New Delhi. Adil Khan, chairperson of the wholesale fruits and vegetables market in Azadpur, said, “Wholesale prices have shot up because of two factors. First, demand has increased with the city scaling down lockdown regulations. Second, a disproportionate increase in fuel prices have increased transportation cost. The central government should intervene at the earliest. People’s livelihoods have been affected because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Such increase in the prices of essentials at this point would cause an immense amount of distress.”The poultry market too is witnessing a similar phenomenon. “We are paying higher transport costs because of increase in price of auto fuels. So, wholesale and retail rates of chicken and eggs have gone up. There was a slump in the market in the last few weeks because of the lockdown. But now demand is increasing. With that, the additional burden of the transport cost has started reflecting in rates,” said Iqbal Qureshi, a poultry trader and vice-chairperson of the wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur.Delhi was under a hard lockdown since April 19, with Covid-19 cases witnessing an unprecedented surge that left the healthcare infrastructure in the city overwhelmed. As cases started declining, the government started scaling down restrictions in a phased manner from May 31. While restaurants and hotels in the city were only allowed to entertain home delivery during the lockdown, they were allowed to open their dine-in space to a maximum of 50% capacity from June 14. Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general of the All India Motor Transport Congress, said in the last several weeks, even though the prices of auto fuels were increasing, it did not reflect proportionally in prices of kitchen staples and essentials because demand for goods was low during the lockdown, even though supply capacity was stable. “As cities started relaxing regulations and allowed more economic activities, the demand has shot up. The increased price of transportation is now more likely to reflect in increased prices of essentials in the coming days,” Gupta said.Haji Yusuf, a fruits and vegetables retailer in southeast Delhi’s Okhla said the prices are expected to go further up once monsoon arrives in the city. “It is a seasonal phenomenon,” he added. However, poultry rates are likely to reduce slightly if the fuel prices decrease, said Rashid Khan, who runs a poultry shop in Saket. “The market is in a bad shape because of the pandemic. Demand is very low even though it has slightly increased recently with scaling down of lockdown restrictions. Fuel prices are the main factor adding to the cost burden.”Delhi residents said the imminent price rise will add further stress on the domestic budget. “Soon the price rise will start reflecting in food grains. Edible oil prices have already gone up. Any further increase would make things very difficult,” said Nishtha Arora, a resident of Vijay Nagar neighbourhood in north Delhi.Omprakash Jha, a resident of Neb Sarai said a large number of households have witnessed decrease in monthly net disposable income because of the pandemic. “Prices of essential items going up during these times is a disaster. The states and union governments should do something about it.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rise-in-prices-of-petrol-diesel-leads-to-spike-in-rates-of-veggies-poultry-in-delhi-101625683761211.html
08-07-2021||Other||Now Allahabad University’s ‘Save Ganga Volunteers’ to protect the Ganga||: A team of faculty members from Allahabad University (AU), having expertise in diverse fields, have formed ‘Save Ganga Volunteers’ group to protect the river from pollution and rejuvenate its banks through community participation.Acting on the directives of the VC Prof Sangita Srivastava, who issued orders in this regard on the directives of the Union ministry of Jal Shakti, AU authorities have formed a special team headed by Prof IR Siddiqui of the department of Chemistry, said AU officials. The five-member committee constituted by the AU’s Registrar Prof NK Shukla includes Prof IR Siddiqui (chairman), Prof AR Siddiqui head of the department of Geography, Manoj Singh of material science department, Priya Kesari of the department of Home Science and Richa Mishra of JK Institute. The committee would keep a tab on the Ganga waters and its banks besides undertaking an extensive survey of the riverbanks to identify potential dangers. The aim is to protect the national river and help plug major sources of pollution endangering the river, they added. The committee will work in collaboration with experts of IIT-Kanpur, the officials explained.“Ganga is not just a river for us but a flow of civilizations and cultures. Thus, efforts should be made to make Ganga pollution-free and ensure the continuity of its stream. For this, we would monitor the river, survey all the villages along the river, geotag the drains falling in the river and most-importantly involve the community living on its bank for protecting the river”, said Prof AR Siddiqui, head of the department of Geography and a member of the panel. Community support, including that of students and teachers of college and schools located in the villages along the river, would be roped in because routine life of the village revolves around the river and once, they are made aware about the need of preserving the river, half of the battle is won, he added. Support of NCC cadets and volunteers of NSS would be taken in associating the village residents, students, women and gram panchayats, said Prof Siddiqui. Prof AR Siddiqui further said that a survey will be conducted along the Ganga, in the stretch between Kaushambi and Prayagraj, identify the polluting spots and then efforts would be made to stop the same. Along with this, community outreach programmes would be organised so that massive campaign for protecting the river could be initiated, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-allahabad-university-s-save-ganga-volunteers-to-protect-the-ganga-101625683041228.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai, Maharashtra’s ‘thick tail’ of cases a concern: Experts||As the second wave of Covid-19 abates in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra, the higher number of daily positive cases — a trend that medical experts term as ‘thick tail’ — has become a cause of concern.“A thick tail essentially means that there is a continuing circulation of the virus in the area and there is susceptible population to which the virus can latch onto,” said Jacob John, professor at the Department of Community Health, Christian Medical College, Vellore. “Due to the relaxations in lockdown measures, this susceptible population may be mingling together leading to further infections,” said John.While Delhi has gone down to report cases in two digits, Mumbai has been hovering between 400-600 and Maharashtra has been recording anywhere between 8,000-9,000 cases daily. The concern among experts is that the daily numbers, clubbed with relaxations in the stay-at-home orders may drive the third wave closer.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “It is hard to pinpoint the exact reasons causing the thick tail, but there are several factors that could be contributing to it.”“The lack of adherence to protocols like sanitising, masking and overcrowding could be contributing factors. In addition, the population density, mobility, migration as well as lurking variants of the virus could be driving the thick tail,” said Dr Joshi.The proportion of the population exposed to the virus and the proportion of the vaccinated population also plays a role in the thick tail. Some experts believe that places that did not implement significant measures when the pandemic raged could be experiencing a ‘thinner tail’ as their population is already exposed to the virus. States like Maharashtra and Kerala are experiencing a thicker tail as they may have controlled the transmission with better measures during the peak of the pandemic.According to John, it appears that Mumbai was overall more efficient during the peak in terms of implementing lockdowns, testing, tracking, and managing patients. “Delhi, on the other hand, struggled. This could have exposed more people in Delhi to the virus, while Mumbai continues to have a susceptible population even now,” he said.While Delhi’s positivity rate dropped down to 0.12% on July 1, Mumbai’s positivity rate stood at 1.7%. Delhi had carried out 76468 tests that day, while Mumbai had carried out only 38652 tests. “Mumbai’s testing has to go up. The more we test, the more cases will surface,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “There should be more localised measures in terms of finding out where the cases are emerging from, the kind of population that is infected, etc. Such measures may provide more accurate answers to why Mumbai is experiencing a thick tail.”The civic body has already started focussing on wards that are recording higher cases. The Maharashtra Covid-19 task force is also working out various strategies to ensure that the thick tail does not trigger a massive spurt. Among various measures that have been suggested include aggressive campaigns to promote Covid appropriate behaviour such as masking, handwashing, and maintaining a physical distance. Other measures include random testing of the population and tackling vaccine hesitancy.“There is a pseudo sense of confidence among the population that has got vaccinated. We need targeted campaigns for such population so that they don’t drop the guard,” said task force member Joshi. “Vaccinating at a greater speed is also crucial to decrease the susceptible population,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-maharashtra-s-thick-tail-of-cases-a-concern-experts-101625682921205.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Schools in non-Covid zones can reopen for Class 8 to 12 from July 15: GR||Two days after releasing and immediately deleting a government resolution (GR) directing the reopening of schools for Class 8 to 12 in non-Covid zones, the state school education department released an updated GR on Wednesday. As per the updated GR, schools in zones with not a single Covid-19 case in the last one month will be allowed to restart physical classes for students from Class 8-12, after receiving the consent of parents. Since most cities are still recording Covid numbers daily, for the time being this GR will be implemented in rural Maharashtra only.The GR further specifies the formation of an eight-member committee consisting of local collectors, school principals and health officials to decide on Covid-free zones. In rural areas, this committee will be headed by the head of the gram panchayat to decide which school can be allowed to start physical classes. Similarly, each district will form the said committee and schools will need a go-ahead from the committee before reopening, states the GR.“Due to the lockdown, children from across the state have been holed up in their houses and missed out on quality education. Their education is limited to what they learn online which is leading to other troubles like addiction to screen time and even depression in some cases. Drop out rate has also increased in rural parts and the only solution for this is reopening of schools in a phased manner,” said the GR. It further stated that schools and junior colleges will follow basic standard operating procedures (SOP) and maintain social distancing and regular temperature checks of students when on campus. “Schools need to ensure that not more than 20 students should be seated in a class to ensure proper social distancing rules is followed,” adds the GR.In November last year, the school education department had released a similar circular announcing the reopening of schools for Classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner. By January, another circular was released directing students from Classes 5 to 8 to be brought back to school in groups and maintain Covid appropriate behaviour on campus. “Both these circulars were revoked once Covid cases started rising again and the state government called for another complete lockdown starting mid-April,” said a state education department official.While the GR released on Monday was deleted after some stakeholders complained about loopholes in the process, the new GR on Wednesday specifies details of how the re-opening will take place. Schools in Mumbai, however, feel this GR will be impossible to implement in districts like Mumbai, Thane and Pune. “The Covid situation in the state is still precarious and therefore, reopening of schools can’t be implemented across all districts. In cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune parents will never give consent for school reopening unless zero cases are reported in the city, or government starts vaccination for children as well,” said the principal of a south Mumbai school. She added that continuing classes online for the current semester at least is the only feasible option for schools at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/schools-in-non-covid-zones-can-reopen-for-class-8-to-12-from-july-15-gr-101625682860932.html
08-07-2021||Mumbai||Max city, expenses: Mumbai civic body has spent over ₹2K-crore on Covid||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), India’s richest civic body, spent around ₹2,000 crore in 2020-2021 on tackling Covid-19. While the third wave is anticipated later this year, the BMC projects that the expenditure in the ongoing fiscal will fall to half of 2020-2021. BMC officials said the expenditure may dip as there were only recurring expenses on maintaining and upgrading the health infrastructure and not much had to be spent on building new makeshift hospitals. This expenditure, however, will not include the administrative cost the BMC will bear to vaccinate citizens. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “The expenditure of the ongoing fiscal might not be much when we compare to that of the 2020-2021 fiscal. There is no concrete estimation, but it may be half, but again it depends [on the situation]. There are several factors behind the fall in the expenses and one of them is the ability to use the infrastructure already set up to handle the first and second wave.” However, according to BMC officials, these are just estimations, considering the third wave is expected to hit the city by September and the expenditure will depend on its intensity. Last year, the BMC’s expenditure of around ₹2,000 crore was towards enhancing health care in the form of jumbo bed facilities, setting up new Covid-19 care centres, followed by expenditure towards hotel bills for accommodation of frontline staff, along with recruiting new staff on contract basis. Money had to be spent on medical equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N 95 masks, 3 ply masks, gloves, face shields, hydroxychloroquine, thermometers, body-bags, protective eye-wear, sanitisers etc. Further, purchasing life-saving injections, including Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, was a substantial expenditure. In the ongoing fiscal, the BMC has spent over ₹400 crore on Covid-19, which include cost towards regular purchase of drugs and maintenance of Covid facilities. However, according to civic officials, in the coming days, an additional expenditure of ₹400 crore is expected for setting up oxygen plants in the city along with oxygen refilling plants. The BMC has plans to set up 16 oxygen plants at 12 civic hospitals in the city along with setting up an oxygen refilling plant in Mahul. In the 2020-2021 budget, the BMC had last year reserved ₹2 crore for fighting Covid-19 and later had spent money from the contingency funds. However, in the ongoing fiscal, the amount is being spent from the health budget. The BMC had allocated ₹4,728.53 crore, 12% of budget, to the health sector in the ongoing fiscal. However, corporators have questioned the BMC’s estimations. Vinod Mishra, BJP corporator and standing committee member, said, “The BMC has spent over ₹400 crore and another ₹400 crore will be spent in the coming days. This takes the figure to ₹800 crore which is around 40% of the expenditure last year. I feel the expenditure might be anywhere around ₹1,500 crore in the ongoing fiscal.” Mishra added, “Also, there needs to be more transparency in the expenditure on Covid-19. In the standing committee, we are getting proposals for post-facto approval under which expenditure is done due to emergency and later administrative approval is taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/max-city-expenses-mumbai-civic-body-has-spent-over-2k-crore-on-covid-101625682740953.html

All of them are ministers of state.Along with nine existing ministers from Uttar Pradesh in the Modi government, after the surprise exclusion of Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar, the state now has 16 ministers in the Union council of ministers. Gangwar is an eight-term MP from Bareilly.“What’s heartening to see is that most of the new ministers are well-read and have been associated with some social causes,” said Manuka Khanna, head of the political science department of Lucknow University. Apna Dal (Sonelal) leader Anupriya Patel, 40, who prior to joining politics was a teacher with an MBA background, is the only woman among the seven new faces from U.P., the youngest of them all. She is the only non-BJP face too from the state. An ally of the BJP since 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Anupriya represents the Kurmi community and is a second-term MP from Mirzapur, a constituency that is adjacent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Varanasi Lok Sabha seat.Union home minister Amit Shah had met Anupriya Patel prior to the reshuffle. “BJP has been working hard to develop its own grown Kurmi leadership but Anupriya’s recall in the Modi ministry is proof that the effort hasn’t matured as yet,” a BJP leader said. Among the new ministers from UP, while Anupriya Patel, Pankaj Chaudhary and B L Verma are from the Other Backward Classes, three others — Kaushal Kishore, Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma and S P Singh Baghel — are from the Scheduled Castes category. Ajay Kumar Taini is the lone Brahmin from the state among the new inductees.Rajya Sabha MP BL Verma, 59, a postgraduate and former chief of the party’s Braj region in western Uttar Pradesh. Verma belongs to the Lodh community and is considered to be a protégé of former U.P. chief minister Kalyan Singh. Ajay Kumar Taini, 61 is a second-term MP from Lakhimpur Kheri in the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, is a science graduate with a degree in law.SP Singh Baghel, an MP from Agra, who was a former personal security officer (PSO) of Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav who later made him an MP too, has been with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) before switching over to the BJP. “A PhD in military science, Baghel, 61, who has been associated with several social causes like checking child marriages and saying no to dowry, hails from Auraiya and has considerable experience as a fifth-term MP,” a BJP leader explained. Pankaj Chaudhary, 56, a graduate, is a sixth-term MP from Maharajganj and has been the face of the BJP in the district. He has served as the deputy mayor of Gorakhpur. “The belt he represents is associated with chief minister Yogi Adityanath. It’s generally understood that since BJP central leadership is backing Yogiji ahead of 2022 UP polls, the chief minister surely was consulted on the choice of the candidate from the region,” a BJP leader said. Kaushal Kishore, 61, the BJP’s second term Lok Sabha MP from Mohanlalganj (reserved) seat, was also inducted in the Modi government.A science graduate, he has taken up a campaign to make youths give up liquor after he lost his son to liver cirrhosis. Kishore, who belongs to the Pasi community, was described by a BJP leader as an extremely handy “all-rounder.” “He has a connect with his community, takes up social causes, is well read and has been rallying the youths with his no-to-liquor message,” a BJP leader said.As the then Uttar Pradesh BJP in-charge, Union home minister Amit Shah had dined at his residence in the run up to 2014 Lok Sabha polls to symbolically indicate party’s outreach to the Scheduled Castes in the state. “In 2014 LS polls if you recall, this outreach saw BSP not getting a single seat in UP,” the BJP leader said. Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma, 63, a fifth-term MP from Jalaun, is a postgraduate with a degree in law. He represents the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/modi-govt-reshuffle-seven-from-uttar-pradesh-get-a-lookin-101625681422074.html

The news of his demise prompted tributes from politicians, sportspersons and actors across India and Pakistan – a signal of the immense popularity that the veteran actor, whose career spanned six decades, enjoyed in the subcontinent. “Dilip Kumar summarised in himself a history of emerging India. The thespian’s charm transcended all boundaries, and he was loved across the subcontinent. With his demise, an era ends. Dilip Saab will live forever in the heart of India. Condolences to family and countless fans,” the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind wrote on social media platform, Twitter. “Dilip Kumar Ji will be remembered as a cinematic legend. He was blessed with unparalleled brilliance, due to which audiences across generations were enthralled. His passing away is a loss to our cultural world. Condolences to his family, friends and innumerable admirers. RIP,” prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted. State chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the residence of Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu to pay his respects said, “We have lost the one who has enriched the Indian cinema and a shining star. He played everlasting roles and he will remain in the hearts of cinema lovers forever.” The 98-year-old actor, a Padma Vibhushan awardee, was wrapped in the Indian tricolor and buried in the Santacruz kabristan [cremation ground]. While not more than 25-30 people were allowed inside for the funeral, the venue was packed with media and fans of the late star. A crowd of nearly 100 people, had gathered outside, while others stood on their rooftops to catch a glimpse of the late star.According to the actor’s family friend Faisal Farooqui, a handful of Kumar and his wife Saira Banu’s relatives were present at the cemetery. Several state leaders, including Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, as well as actors Dharmendra, Shahrukh Khan, Shabana Azmi and Vidya Balan, among a host of others, visited the actor’s Pali Hill residence to pay their respects. Kumar was suffering from an advanced stage of prostate cancer as well as kidney failure, had been hospitalized twice last month and even underwent a blood transfusion. He was admitted to the Hinduja hospital once more on Sunday after he complained of breathlessness and was found to have bilateral pleural effusion (accumulation of fluid outside the lungs). “He he already had several health issues and was bed-ridden,” said a doctor who was part of the team treating Dilip Kumar. “He had a medical set up in his house for his daily treatment. He had an advanced stage of prostate cancer. Along with it, he also suffered from kidney failure,” the doctor said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Born Muhammad Yusuf Khan on December 11, 1922, to a Pathan family in Peshawar – the fourth of 12 children -- Kumar moved to what was then Bombay, and later studied in Deolali. After completing his college, he took up a job in an Army canteen in Pune. However, a chance meeting with silver screen legend Devika Rani changed the course of his life. Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand were Hindi cinema’s superstars in the 1950s and 1960s; but it was only Kumar – who took on the screen name to appeal to a wider audience – who earned the sobriquet, Tragedy King, for his performances in films like Devdas (1955). A proponent of method acting – where the actor identifies emotionally with the character he is expected to play – Kumar eventually moved to the comedy genre on the advice of a psychiatrist. His acting range won him several fans, and he was popular among cinema lovers in Pakistan as well. In 1998, he was awarded the “Nishan-e-Imtiaz,” Pakistan’s highest civilian honor-- the only Indian citizen to receive it. “For my generation, Dilip Kumar was the greatest and most versatile actor,’’ Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan tweeted. A large group of people on Wednesday offered ghaibana Namaz-e-Janaza (funeral prayers in absentia) for legendary Indian actor Dilip Kumar at his ancestral house in Qissa Khawani Bazaar area of Peshawar in Pakistan. The first of the Khans, as he was sometimes referred to, was nominated to the Rajya Sabha for one term, awarded the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan and also served as sheriff of Mumbai. He was also honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke award.Kumar was under the care of a team of specialists, comprising cardiologist Dr Nitin Gokhale, pulmonologist Dr Jalil Parker and pulmonologist and urologist Dr Anita Patel. Even among his care-givers, he was known for his command over the Urdu language and his love for shayari. During his treatment, he often recited couplets to the medical staffers. “He was an ardent reader. When I was younger, I had seen him reading books in his car under a reading light. In fact, in hospitals, he would read books while lying on the bed,” Dr Parker said. Last year, Kumar lost two of his younger brothers—Aslam Khan, 88, and Ehsan Khan, 90 — to Covid-19.

08-07-2021||Pune||31 non-functional signals slow down Pune’s traffic||The city’s roads are slowly getting back to pre-Covid times with bumper-to-bumper traffic, however with as many as 31 non-functional signals across the city, citizens are experiencing congestions at various intersections. In an attempt to find out the cause of the congestions, traffic police Pune in the past month conducted a survey and found 31 spots where traffic signals are not working or inoperable. The city is covered with 230 signals and the city police work along with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in maintaining and upkeep of the traffic signals at various locations across the city. But this year, the authority is lagging behind in their work of maintaining the signals. “We conducted a survey a month ago, and every division (17) in total sent in their report which we collated and created a list of 31 traffic signals which are not working or have been knocked off,” said DCP traffic Rahul Shrirame. “We have handed over the list to PMC to take action. Our job is to make sure that with unlock, the carriage way should be cleared and the traffic working should be smooth. We are the enforcing agency, supervising and informing the Municipal authorities about problems such as non-working signals, potholes as well as open man holes,” he added. The list of 31 signals consists of small and medium intersections like Ramoshi gate chowk, with the reason mentioned that the signal has been not working for many days, or the one at Narpatgiri chowk where the cable lamp is broken. The situation in Rameshwar chowk as well as in Sonya Maruti Chowk too is similar where the cable lamps, as well as the controller is also broken. In Dattawadi area, the signals in Muktangan chowk, Shinde high school, the signal is closed indefinitely while the signal in Nath P chowk, it was shut off due to beautification of the chowk. The traffic signal in Disulphate chowk, Dhakawdi phata, RTO chowk, Shrimaan Chowk, Parnakuti chowk, Abhimaanshri Pashan chowk, are all broken or not in working condition due to either Metro work or flyover construction work. While most of the other chowks like Solapur Bazaar, Jambhulkar chowk, Tarkeshwar, Kalas phata, Deep Bangla, Shivaji road, Pashan, Ambedkar chowk in Aundh, Rajwada chowk, Baner, Rohini Bhate chowk, Deccan, Dhayari Phata, Shinde pul, Dange chowk, Warje, Dhumal chowk, Bibwewadi gaothan, Kunte chowk, Umbraya Maruti chowk and New English school chowk in Vishrambaug area are all non-working with broken cable, lamp and controller. Shrinivas Kandul, head, electrical department of the PMC, “We have just received the list and will work on priority as we have the contractors ready to fix the problems. The sanctions have been moving slow as everyone was busy with Covid duties and now with the unlock, things are slowly coming back to normal.” He also added that the idea of holding monthly co-ordination meetings with all heads of departments of PMC with the traffic police used to be held regularly earlier but since Covid, this too has taken a backseat. “This list will be the first such list after two years that has been submitted to PMC,” said Kandul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/31-non-functional-signals-slow-down-pune-s-traffic-101625673379988.html
08-07-2021||Chandigarh||More trouble for Hooda: SC orders CBI probe into Rohtak land release||More trouble is in store for former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a CBI investigation into the release of land in Rohtak to a real estate developer, Uddar Gagan Properties Limited, during the Congress rule under Hooda.About 850 acre was proposed to be acquired in 2002 for residential and commercial sectors in Rohtak by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). However, the award was passed for 422 acre in April 2005. A realtor, Uddar Gagan Properties Limited, in March 2005 entered into collaboration agreements with some farmers, whose land was under acquisition, for development of a colony.The developer had applied for a licence to develop a colony on land covering 280 acres. The licences were granted by the town and country planning director in June 2006 and the corresponding land was released from acquisition.The licences were addressed to the owners but remitted to the builder. This was followed by execution of sale deeds in favour of the builder through power-of-attorney holder of the land owners.In May 2016, the apex court quashed the land released from acquisition and transferring developer’s licences to HUDA.In its May 13, 2016, order the SC had asked the state government to inquire into the legality and bona fides of the action of the persons responsible for illegally entertaining the applications of the builder and releasing the land to it, when it had no title to the land on the date of notification under Section 4 and proceed against them in accordance with the law.Despite announcing on the floor of the assembly on March 13, 2018, that the government has decided to refer the Uddar Gagan matter to the CBI, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had backed down and instead ordered an inquiry by retired judge, justice RS Madan.The retired judge’s report gave a clean chit to officials of town and country planning department at the headquarters and in the field, officials of the urban estates department, stating that nothing has come on record to doubt the bona fides of these officials on official files. This report was accepted by the state government after taking legal opnion from the advocate general.Justice (retd) Madan had also recommended another inquiry by a senior financial commissioner rank officer into the role of land acquisition officer (LAO), estate officer of HUDA and office of the Rohtak deputy commissioner regarding delivery of possession of the acquired land. This inquiry was done by senior IAS officer Anurag Rastogi, who concluded that no act of omission or commission can be attributed to the then Rohtak deputy commissioner, sub divisional magistrate, tehsildar, kanungo and other officials of DC office.Rastogi’s report also said there was no illegality about the actions of the LAO, estate officer and officials of the DC office.The matter was first probed by retired IAS officer Rajan Gupta, who only pointed to a systemic failure in the entire episode and did not fix anyone’s responsibility. Gupta’s report was not accepted by the state government.‘SC HAS DONE WHAT BJP GOVT IN HARYANA FAILED TO DO’Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) general secretary Abhay Chautala on Wednesday said that the Supreme Court has done what the BJP government in Haryana has failed to do.Reacting to the apex court’s directions for a CBI investigation in the Uddar Gagan matter, the former leader of Opposition said he had in 2018 raised objection on the volte face done by Khattar in ordering a probe by a retired HC judge instead of a CBI probe.Abhay had in 2018 written to the Haryana assembly speaker seeking action against the CM for committing contempt of the state assembly by backing off from fulfilling the “solemn assurance to the House” that a CBI probe will be ordered in the matter.BOX:Status of cases against Hooda:Manesar land scam: CBI and ED have filed chargesheets in the trial courtAJL plot restoration case: CBI and ED have filed chargesheets.

08-07-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC judge recuses from hearing Banerjee’s plea against Nandigram loss, imposes ₹5 lakh fine||Calcutta high court judge Justice Kausik Chanda on Wednesday recused from hearing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s petition challenging her defeat in the assembly election from Nandigram but imposed a ₹5 lakh fine on the Trinamool Congress chief for the manner in which the recusal was sought.Justice Chanda also stressed that he did not think that there was any conflict of interest if he had continued hearing the case. “The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias,” the judge said as he stepped away from Banerjee’s petition which will be placed before another bench.In her petition, Banerjee has alleged voting irregularities in her narrow loss by 1,956 votes to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram, her first electoral loss in 32 years. The TMC had demanded a recount shortly after the results were announced in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate but the request was turned down by the Election Commission. Her case was slated to be heard by a single judge bench, Justice Chanda.Mamata Banerjee and her party asked for transferring the petition to another judge citing “apprehension of bias” since Justice Chanda had, before his elevation to the bench in 2019, represented the BJP and its leaders in court cases and was seen in photographs sharing a dais with BJP leaders including state unit chief Dilip Ghosh.Justice Chanda was upset that Banerjee did not raise their objections when he first heard the case on June 18 but her party leaders put out messages on social media, setting off what the judge described as a “media trial” with hundreds of tweets demanding that he recuse from the case.“Such calculative, psychological, and offensive attempts to seek recusal need to be firmly repulsed and a cost of ₹5 lakh is imposed upon the petitioner,” Justice Chanda said in his order on Wednesday. The money will be used to fight Covid-19.Mamata Banerjee declined to comment on the verdict. “This is a sub judice matter. I will not comment. The lawyers will decide whatever decisions need to be taken,” she said.TMC leaders hinted that the party might approach the Supreme Court over the ₹5 lakh fine.“We have full faith in the judiciary and Justice Chanda. But we had some reservations only in this matter because some pictures and old facts have come to the forefront. As far as the decision to move the SC, the party will take a decision soon,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.The BJP said it will not comment on a court order or a decision taken by a judge. “We have complete faith in the judiciary, Some political parties may not have faith,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president.In his order, Justice Chanda emphasised that he did not agree with Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Mamata Banerjee, that there was a conflict of interest since “I have a long, close, personal, professional, pecuniary and ideological relationship” with a political party.“The argument of Mr. Singhvi takes too sombre a view of the integrity of a judge. When a litigant raises the question of bias against a judge, who has taken the oath to discharge his duties without any fear or favour, the test has to be a real likelihood of bias or real danger of bias. The appearance of impartiality, in such a case, should not be viewed from the perspective of a common man,” he said.“If a lawyer appears in several cases for a political party, his association with the legal cell of the party or with its leaders is natural. In this country, it is almost impossible not to get a person who may not have said to have some political views. Anyone interested in politics may be said to have an “interest.” Like any other citizen of the country, a judge also exercises his voting rights in favour of a political party, but he lays aside his individual predilection while deciding a case. A lawyer’s mind is trained not to identify himself with his client and at the same time be loyal to his duty towards his client,” Justice Chanda said.“When a lawyer moves from Bar to Bench, he carries with him the same sense of detachment already in-built in him. Ironically, two leading counsel engaged in the case have well known political identities adverse to the petitioner’s party,” the judge said in his order, referring to Abhishek Manu Singhvi who was a member of the Congress but representing the TMC president along with senior lawyer SN Mookherjee who was from BJP.“It is preposterous to suggest that a judge having a past association with a political party as a lawyer should not receive a case involving the said political party or any of its members. The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias,” the order added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-banerjee-s-plea-against-nandigram-loss-101625643986757.html

Khadse joined the party last year after exiting the Bharatiya Janata Party. Officials said Chaudhary was arrested since he did not cooperate during a 12-hour interrogation on Tuesday. Chaudhary was produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court on Wednesday that sent him to ED’s custody till July 12..ED has booked Chaudhary and Khadse, a former revenue minister of the state, and is probing alleged money laundering to the tune of ₹61.25 crore in the land deal.The case pertains to the purchase of a plot on April 28, 2016 in Bhosari near Pune by Khadse’s family for ₹3.75 crore while the market rate was ₹31 crore. The plot’s ownership was contentious. The industries department acquired it in 1971, but the final award of the plot was not made, and the owner was not compensated for it.The complainant, Hemant Gawande, alleged that Khadse defrauded the exchequer in the deal. ED’s case is based on the complaint filed by Anti-Corruption Bureau, or ACB, against Khadse and his family members in 2017. The ACB closed the case in 2018 after submitting a report to the concerned court that cleared the minister of any wrongdoing. However, ED continued its investigation into the alleged financial irregularities.Khadse has maintained that investigations, including those by ACB and Income Tax department, found no irregularities. He claimed that the central agency reopened the probe against him for leaving the BJP.According to the ED’s case, Khadse and his family fraudulently purchased the said land, despite having knowledge that it was reserved for Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), so that when the MIDC acquired it, they could claim the compensation of more than double the market rate.ED said Khadse mobilised revenue officials to acquire the said land by MIDC so that his family could get compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ed-arrests-eknath-khadse-s-son-in-law-in-pune-land-deal-case-101625638578462.html
08-07-2021||World||US chose not to prosecute 82% of hate-crime suspects||The U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute 82% of people suspected of federal hate crimes over most of the past two decades, it said in a research report on Thursday, revealing a rate of prosecution far lower than that for other federal crimes.The report illustrates the complexity of the job ahead for Attorney General Merrick Garland as he aims to increase federal prosecutors' focus on hate crimes and improve coordination with local law enforcement and community advocacy groups.The Bureau of Justice Statistics said prosecutors investigated 1,864 suspects for possible hate crimes from Oct. 1, 2004 - the beginning of the 2005 fiscal year - through Sept. 30, 2019, and referred only 17% of those suspects for prosecution. One percent of hate crime suspects had their cases resolved by a magistrate judge.The report did not provide an overall rate for the total number of suspects of federal crimes the department declined to prosecute during the study period. But the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report available shows it declined to prosecute nearly 13% of people suspected of federal crimes in the 2018 fiscal year, a far lower rate.The department has warned that white supremacist groups https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-unveils-plan-tackle-domestic-terrorism-2021-06-15 represent a rising security threat to the United States after the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.At the same time, reports of hate-inspired attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have also been on the rise, spurred by what many say were former President Donald Trump's inflammatory remarks blaming the COVID-19 pandemic on China.In May, Garland outlined new steps to help state and local police track and investigate hate crimes, which historically have been an under-reported crime to the FBI by local law enforcement, and called for the department to expedite the review of possible hate crimes.He also ordered all 93 U.S. Attorneys around the country to assign local criminal and civil prosecutors to serve as civil rights coordinators, and asked them to establish district alliances against hate to improve coordination with local law enforcement.Frank Pezzella, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that policy priorities are often a driving force behind whether hate crimes get prosecuted or not."Even at the precinct level - when there is a clear-cut policy ... that hate crimes are going to be pursued and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, it sends a message," he said.Thursday's report also showed that when U.S. Attorneys have pursued federal hate crime charges, they have been largely successful. Conviction rates for hate crimes rose, from 83% during 2005-2009, to 94% during 2015-2019.High-profile cases have included the successful prosecution of white supremacist Dylann Roof, who in December 2016 was found guilty of federal hate crimes after he gunned down nine Black parishioners at a church in South Carolina.In April, the Justice Department charged three Georgia men with federal hate crimes in last year's slaying of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was gunned down as he was out jogging through a suburban neighborhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-chose-not-to-prosecute-82-of-hate-crime-suspects-101625765361432.html

The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) analysis showed that as of June 30, the deadline for applications for the new academic year, 9,930 applications were made by Indian students, up from last year’s 7,640 applications.While the increase in the number of applicants from Indian students has been on a steady rise in the past decade, the applications for the upcoming academic year has recorded the sharpest rise since 2012, the year from when UCAS analysis is available. India is only behind China in terms of most numbers of applications from foreign countries for British universities.There has been a 4% overall increase in total applicants from last year, which resulted in a more than 3% increase in offers made by British universities and colleges. UCAS has predicted that an increase in applications and offer making will see a record number of students starting university or college this autumn.Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International (UUKi), which represents over 140 British universities, said that the whole university community has shown incredible resilience this year. “It is really encouraging to see Indian students continue to make plans to study in the UK and we look forward to welcoming students safely,” she added.India remains on the UK’s travel “red list” which requires students with a valid visa to quarantine at a government-approved hotel for 10 days on arrival in the country. The UK has recently also announced that students will have the option to start online and travel later if necessary, or arriving for the start of term and being supported through any necessary quarantine period.“Today’s numbers show the clear demand for undergraduate study and apprenticeships is growing, rising significantly during the pandemic. Universities are ready to welcome more students onto courses this autumn and have worked hard to be flexible, enabling students to progress to their next level of study,” UCAS chief executive Clare Marchant said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/nri-news/record-applications-from-indian-students-for-uk-universities-despite-pandemic-101625764747030.html
08-07-2021||World||Single dose of two-shot jabs barely works against Delta variant: Study||A new study has highlighted the importance of both shots of two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca (AZ) Covid-19 vaccines against the Delta variant. Researchers have found single shots of these vaccines “barely” offered any protection.In India, AZ shots are being given under the Covishield brand, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. “Sera from individuals having received one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine barely inhibited variant Delta,” a group of French researchers said in an article published in journal Nature on Thursday. “Administration of two doses generated a neutralising response in 95% of individuals.”The finding is “good news”, Olivier Schwartz, lead author of the study and head of the Virus and Immunity Unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told The Washington Post.This new study offers more clarity on the efficacy of vaccines against the Delta variant, which has been found to be more contagious than its previous versions and has caused maximum damage in India triggering the devastating second wave.The findings are along similar lines as those of a study released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) earlier this week, which said two doses of Covid-19 vaccines offer 95% protection against infection to 82% for those with only one shot. Delta is now tearing through parts of the United States with low levels of vaccination. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said Delta has emerged as the dominant strain in America, accounting for 51.7% of new infections, overtaking Alpha.The new study points to increased vulnerability to the Delta variant among people who have either not been vaccinated for whatever reason or who have skipped or delayed their second shots. In the United Kingdom, for instance, this variant was seen responsible for a recent surge because it opted to administer only one of the two shots of these vaccines to broaden coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/single-dose-of-two-shot-jabs-barely-work-against-delta-variant-study-101625764166220.html
08-07-2021||World||Russian doctors battle virus and heat in hospital 'red zone'||Dressed in heavy protective gear during a record-breaking heatwave, doctors at Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky hospital have struggled in recent weeks to treat an overwhelming influx of coronavirus patients.Like the rest of Russia, the city has been hard hit by a new wave of the pandemic fuelled by the highly infectious Delta variant.The country's third wave -- which arrived as temperatures soared to over 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) -- has taken many Russians by surprise as authorities struggle to counter widespread anti-vaccine sentiment.Covered from head to toe in medical overalls and wearing rubber gloves and goggles, doctor Alexei Lepakov said he would "sometimes lose three kilos in a day because of the heat.""It's hard," he said as several new patients were brought in by ambulance. "But we're used to it."On Tuesday, Russia recorded 737 virus deaths and 23,378 new cases -- a record for the country since the start of the pandemic.Almost all 760 beds are occupied in the Mariinsky hospital's "red zone", which is exclusively for Covid-19 patients.Doctors have not seen this many coronavirus patients since mid-January, when Russia was coming out of a second wave.And this time, they have also had to contend with the heat.While Russia's second city recorded its highest temperatures in more than a century at the end of June, staff at the Mariinsky worked for several hours dressed in full protective gear.- 'You have to get vaccinated' -Inside the intensive care department, patients in the most serious condition are hooked to ventilators.Two dozen patients of different ages lie either on their front or on their side.Many are awake. One middle-aged man lies on his back, looking at the machine he is hooked to while panting heavily. A younger woman lying on her side holds on to her ventilator tubes.All 24 beds of the intensive care unit are occupied, the head of the department Pavel Yermakov told AFP.He stresses that all the patients are in extremely serious condition and that a lot depends on their physical state "for them to get out".Within an hour, two bodies wrapped in black were taken away by staff."I am sorry," Yermakov said.But he added that "luckily, most get out."That was the case for Mikhail Konovalov, who spent several days in the intensive care department before beginning to recover."All I can say to everyone: you have to get vaccinated," the 45-year-old airport employee said from his hospital bed.But Russians continue to be sceptical towards vaccines.Despite free vaccinations having been available since December, so far only 18.5 of 146 million Russians have been fully vaccinated.The slow uptake illustrates hesitancy among the 54 percent of Russians who say they don't plan to get vaccinated.Outside the imperial-era hospital, a guard gestured to a line of people carrying flowers the way to the morgue."Since mid-June, more and more people end up here. It's Covid," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctors-battle-virus-and-heat-in-hospital-red-zone-101625749902488.html
08-07-2021||World||Single shot of Pfizer, AstraZeneca ‘barely’ work against Delta variant, reveals new study||A single shot of Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccines “barely” induce neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant in individuals previously not infected with Sars-Cov-2, according to new research. The study, published in the journal Nature, highlighted the threat posed by viral mutations of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the Delta variant is rapidly becoming the dominant strain across the world.The researchers found that the Delta variant, first detected in India, has mutations that allow it to evade some of the neutralising antibodies produced either by vaccines or previous coronavirus infection. The study, however, suggests that fully vaccinated individuals, with two doses of Pfizer-BioNtech or AstraZeneca vaccine, retain significant protection against the highly contagious Delta variant.The latest findings underline the urgency for administering the recommended regimen of two shots of Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine to contain the virus at a time when Delta variant, a subtype of B.1.617 lineage, is threatening the pandemic response worldwide. India’s second wave of Covid-19 is believed to be largely driven by the Delta strain of coronavirus, which has been classified as a ‘variant of concern’ by the World Health Organization (WHO).Also Read | Delta variant is ‘Covid-19 on steroid’, says expert as US sees uptick in casesIn India, less than 5% of the population has been fully vaccinated and, taking the findings of the study at face value, the prevalence of Delta variant in the country suggests a large section remains under threat of the deadly contagion. While India has ramped up the vaccination drive in the past few days, experts have said that the third wave of Covid-19 could peak in October, given the low overall vaccination coverage.After weeks of lockdown-like restrictions in several states, authorities have started to gradually drop stringent measures amid a decline in Covid-19 cases. But the World Health Organization (WHO) emergencies programme head Michael Ryan on Wednesday urged countries to take extreme caution when reopening economies.“Countries opening up who have very low levels of vaccination coverage in the presence of variants is a real toxic mixture for your hospitals filling up again. And this is something that must absolutely be avoided,” said Ryan during a news conference in Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/single-shot-of-pfizer-astrazeneca-barely-work-against-delta-variant-reveals-new-study-101625761285821.html

For the first time in 45 years, there were incidents at the border with casualties,” Jaishankar said while addressing an event at the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow.Afghanistan situation to figure in India-Russia talks tomorrow“Peace and tranquility at the border are the fundamentals of a relationship between any neighbouring countries. Naturally the foundation has been disturbed, so has the relationship,” Jaishankar further added.Jaishankar’s observation came in response to a question on how India views the rise of China. He said that there has been a rise of new powers after several nations won their independence from colonial rule all over the world.“China is part of an exception and China is part of a trend as well, because of its history, scale and power today. For us (India), it is a natural happening to some degree because we see ourselves in a similar situation. The timing may show we are a few years behind and the pace and intensity of it may be slightly different but broadly in the same time span India’s position vis-a-vis the world has also changed,” Jaishankar said.Jaishankar further said that China's rise impacts India as it is India’s immediate neighbour. He said its rise also impacts Russia and Eurasia and forums like BRICS show how each of these nations profits collaboratively.“For the last 40 years we maintained a stable relationship with China, there is a big economic element since China emerged as our second-largest economic partner,” Jaishankar said referring to India’s economic relationship with its neighbour.During his address, Jaishankar said India’s strategic, diplomatic and cultural ties with Russia are important in today’s world. He said that ties between both countries ranging over military to medicine as well as space and nuclear shows India’s commitment towards stronger ties with Russia. Jaishankar said that the 2+2 dialogue between PM Modi and President Vladimir Putin ‘promises to provide new vitality’ to India-Russia relations.Jaishankar will meet Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foundation-of-our-relationship-with-china-has-been-disturbed-jaishankar-101625751941300.html

However, the PM didn’t mention the complete schedule of the withdrawal of British troops.“All British troops assigned to NATO's mission in Afghanistan are now returning home,” Johnson informed the UK parliament in a statement, news agency Reuters reported. “For obvious reasons, I will not disclose the timetable of our departure, though I can tell the house (parliament) that most of our personnel have already left,” he further said, hinting that many soldiers had already left Afghanistan.Britain, one of the NATO allies, has been part of the war in Afghanistan which began after the September 11 attacks (9/11 attacks) in the United States. So far, 457 British Soldiers have lost their lives in the ongoing war of over two decades since 2001, according to a report by the Reuters.Also read | Afghanistan situation to figure in India-Russia talks tomorrowJohnson further said that the UK would continue to provide development assistance to Afghanistan. “I hope no one will leap to the false conclusion that the withdrawal of our forces somehow means the end of Britain's commitment to Afghanistan, we are not about to turn away, nor are we under any illusions about the perils of today situation and what might lie ahead,” his statement to the parliament further said, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, Britain’s Chief of the Defence Staff Nick Carter said it was “plausible” that Afghanistan’s state could collapse after the pull-out of international troops from the country, following Johnson’s statement.Carter also warned that a civil war, like in the 1990s, was possible “where you would see a culture of warlordism and you might see some of the important institutions like security forces fracturing along ethnic, or for that matter, tribal lines,” Reuters reported. “If that were to happen, I guess the Taliban would control part of the country. But, of course, they would not control all of the country,” he further said.US President Joe Biden in April ordered the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan by September 11 and the Pentagon had earlier said that the process is 90% completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-british-troops-already-out-of-afghanistan-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tells-uk-parliament-101625751524118.html

Andy Slavitt told CNN on Wednesday that the Delta variant, first detected in India, is twice as infectious as the original strain of Sars-CoV-2 but presents “very little threat” to fully vaccinated individuals."We should think about the Delta variant as the 2020 version of Covid-19 on steroids," he said.The Delta variant has become the dominant variant in the United States, making up for more than half of the new Covid-19 cases in the country, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In some US states, the ‘variant of concern’ accounts for more than 80% of new infections, causing worry for authorities who are trying to achieve population immunity through high rates of vaccination.A recent analysis of Pfizer-BionTech vaccine efficacy by the Israeli government has renewed the debate around the Delta variant’s ability to escape immunity. Citing the analysis, the Israeli government earlier this week said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to be less effective against infections caused by the Delta variant as compared to other strains. As of June 6, the Pfizer vaccine, based on mRNA technology, provided 64% protection against the Delta variant, the government had said.Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both based on mRNA, have been widely used in the United States for inoculation and a reduced efficacy could jeopardise the pandemic response and reopening of economies. Responding to the analysis from the Israeli government, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN that "the Israelis know what they're doing," but the data is sparse.On Wednesday, World Health Organization (WHO) emergencies programme head Michael Ryan urged countries to take extreme caution when reopening economies amid the threat presented by the Delta variant. Ryan warned countries with low levels of vaccination coverage against opening up, saying the presence of variants could start filling the hospitals again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-is-covid-19-on-steroid-says-expert-as-us-sees-uptick-in-cases-101625749911181.html

The change in rules will be a huge boost to airlines and the tourism industry which has been reeling under months of restrictions."I can confirm today that from the 19th of July, UK residents who are fully vaccinated through the UK vaccine rollout will no longer have to self-isolate when they return to England," Shapps said.Currently, people travelling to the UK from countries and territories on the “amber list” are required to quarantine at home or at the place of their stay for at least 10 days. They also need to take a Covid-19 test on or before the second day and on or after the eighth day of their quarantine period. Destinations like Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States are on the amber list.While the quarantine is no longer required from travellers from amber list countries, they still have to take a Covid-19 test before they arrive home, followed by another test on or before the second day of their arrival, said Shapps. Children under the age of 18 will also need to take tests.Airlines including British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have been repeatedly calling for an end to mandatory 10-day quarantine, a rule that discouraged people from travelling abroad. Britain has vaccinated about 65% of its population which has given authorities the confidence to further relax the coronavirus-induced restrictions. However, non-Britons have to wait longer to be exempt from quarantine, said Shapps"We're working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scraps-quarantine-norm-for-fully-vaccinated-britons-returning-from-amber-list-nations-101625744916241.html

The death of Novilia Sjafri Bachtiar has raised questions on the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine which has been widely used in the fourth-most populous nation.Quoting an official of state-owned pharmaceuticals company BioFarma, Sindonews reported that Bachtiar was buried as per the Covid-19 protocols. Without revealing the cause of death, state enterprises minister Erick Thohir posted a message on Instagram mourning her "huge loss" at BioFarma, the company which makes the Sinovac vaccine in Indonesia."She was lead scientist and head of dozens of clinical trials done by BioFarma, including Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials in cooperation with Sinovac," he said.Bachtiar's death due to Covid-19, as reported by the local media, is not an isolated case as thousands of doctors and medical workers in Indonesia have been infected and many died despite being vaccinated with Sinovac. About 131 healthcare workers, mostly vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, have died since June, according to independent data group Lapor Covid-19.Also Read | Indonesia doctors fell sick, many died after taking Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine: ReportThe concern over the efficacy of the vaccine has prompted the country to consider offering booster shots to the medical workers inoculated against Covid-19 using Sinovac’s vaccine, according to a Reuters report. Citing preliminary data, Sinovac spokesperson Liu Peicheng told Reuters last month that the vaccine produced a three-fold reduction in neutralizing effect against the Delta variant."There's a lot of doctors and medical workers who have been vaccinated twice but endured medium and severe symptoms, or even died," Slamet Budiarto, deputy chief of the Indonesian Medical Association, told parliament on Monday.Countries like Turkey and the United Arab Emirates that used Chinese vaccines to inoculate their citizens have already started administering booster shots amid efficacy concerns. But Indonesia is battling a record-breaking surge in new Covid-19 cases and related deaths, led by the highly contagious Delta variant. The low vaccination coverage and high dependency on Chinese vaccines are making it difficult for the Southeast Asian nation to make any drastic change in vaccination policy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lead-sinovac-scientist-dies-of-suspected-covid-19-as-indonesia-mulls-booster-shot-101625741466427.html

Beijing’s premier economic planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission, said in a notice Tuesday, reported Bloomberg.The top economic planner has also directed local authorities to strictly limit construction of towers taller than 250 metres, citing quality concerns and public safety hazards in some projects stemming from a lack of proper oversight. Construction of buildings exceeding 100 metres will have to be at par with the fire rescue capability and the scale of the city where the buildings will be built.“It’s primarily for safety,” said Qiao Shitong, an associate law professor at the University of Hong Kong told Bloomberg, adding that skyscrapers “are more like signature projects for mayors and not necessarily efficient,” Only 10 buildings in the world are over 500 metres and half of them are located in mainland China.These new directives come after the near 300-metre-high (980 ft) Shenzhen Electronics Group Plaza, one of China's tallest skyscrapers, was evacuated on May 18 after it began to shake. Videos shot by bystanders and shared by local media on Weibo shows the mammoth tower shaking on its foundation as scores of terrified pedestrians ran helter-skelter fearing a collapse.Building collapses are not rare in China, where lax construction standards and rapid urbanisation lead to constructions being thrown up in haste. Just last year Chinese authorities had banned construction of buildings taller than 500 meters in cities like Beijing, and urged urban planners to construct buildings which “highlight Chinese characteristics" instead of modelling them after world landmarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bans-construction-of-tallest-skyscrapers-over-public-safety-concerns-101625739080955.html

More than 4,000 scientists, doctors, nurses and other professionals signed a letter published in The Lancet medical journal, condemning the government’s “dangerous and unethical experiment” when the Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2 is driving the third wave of Covid-19 across the United Kingdom.“We believe this decision is dangerous and premature,” they wrote.On Wednesday, Britain reported over 32,000 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in over five months. But the government has maintained its position to remove most of the restrictions imposed to contain the virus. The scientists noted that more than 17 million people will remain with no protection against Covid-19 even after assuming that 20% of unvaccinated people are protected by the previous infection.“We believe the government is embarking on a dangerous and unethical experiment, and we call on it to pause plans to abandon mitigations on July 19, 2021,” the scientists said.Also Read | Delta variant, first identified in India, now 'dominant' in USThey warned that the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases will “probably continue until millions more people are infected”, given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant. Citing preliminary modelling data, the scientists said that the government's strategy provides fertile ground for the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants which would place all at risk, including those already vaccinated.“Spread of potentially more transmissible escape variants would disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in our country and other countries with poor access to vaccines,” they added.Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all restrictions would be lifted on July 19, branding it as “Freedom Day”. The scientists have suggested that the government should delay complete re-opening until everyone has been offered vaccination and uptake is high.“Until then, public health measures must include those called for by WHO (universal mask wearing in indoor spaces, even for those vaccinated), the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ventilation and air filtration), and Independent SAGE (effective border quarantine; test, trace isolate, and support),” they wrote.The letter was originally signed by a few researchers and now has more than 4,200 online signatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-call-on-uk-govt-to-abandon-dangerous-and-unethical-opening-plans-amid-delta-scare-101625736778493.html

The practice, which was prevalent from 1909-1979, the government sterilised some people, mostly with mental illness or physical disability, whom it deemed unfit to have children, according to news agency Associated Press. Some of the victims of this practice include people as young as 13-year-old, the AP report further said.The supporters of the 'eugenics' believed the people with such "undesirable traits should not have children" in order to improve the human race.According to the Associated Press, more than 20,000 people were sterilised under this practice until the law was repealed in 1979. Notably, since the practice is so old, only a few hundred people might be alive by now.The state has set aside $7.5 million for the reparations program, part of its $262.6 billion operating budget that is awaiting governor Gavin Newsom’s signature.California is the third state in the US after Virginia and North Carolina to make compensation to the victims of the so-called "eugenics movement". Along with this, the state government will pay compensation to women who were sterilised in the prisons. Of which, some cases could be as recently as 2010, the news agency also reported.Between 2005 to 2013, California sterilised at least 144 women, it also reported. "We must address and face our horrific history,” said Lorena Garcia Zermeño, policy and communications coordinator for the advocacy group California Latinas for Reproductive Justice. “This isn’t something that just happened in the past."It also reported that the state while all of the women signed consent forms, officials in 39 cases did not do everything that was legally required to obtain their permission for the sterilisation.The first eugenics sterilization law was introduced in Indiana state in 1907. Later, it expanded to 30 states. It reached California in 1909. It was by far the largest program, accounting for about a third of everyone sterilised in the United States under those laws.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-to-pay-25-000-as-compensation-to-victims-of-forced-sterilisation-101625731801380.html

The state media later ran a story citing a citizen as saying North Koreans broke down in tears at the sight of the thinner Kim, comments that could have been aimed at building public support as he tries to revive a sickly economy.Kim’s weight is tracked by spy agencies for insights about the autocratic and secretive regime in Pyongyang especially since his family has a history of heart disease. South Korean spies told lawmakers in November last year that Kim weighed about 140 kilograms.Another lawmaker Ha Tae-keung said that there is no evidence that Kim has had a coronavirus vaccine.Kim warned last month that the “food situation is now getting tense.” His country’s perennial shortages were made worse by typhoons last year that wiped out crops and Kim’s decision to shut borders due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-lost-nearly-44-pounds-say-south-korean-spies-101625725698839.html

He will also give detail as to how the new rules will affect under-18s who are not currently being vaccinated.Under existing rules on foreign travel, visitors to more than 100 destinations including the US market and some of the most popular European destinations are required to isolate for 10 days on their return to the UK.This is because these destinations are on the government’s amber list, rated as medium risk for coronavirus. The government currently advises Britons not to travel to destinations on the amber list or the high risk red list, with only a handful of countries judged to be safe enough to put on the green list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-british-travelers-no-longer-need-to-isolate-under-new-rule-101625724312139.html

Following the abrupt closure, several students shared screenshots, to which WeChat replied that the accounts were blocked "after receiving relevant complaints". "All content has been blocked and the account has been put out of service," it also stated in the notice. The company also cited a violation of government regulation on the management of online public accounts."Many of us suffered at the same time," news agency Reuters quoted an account manager of one group as saying. However, people quoted in the Reuters story declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue."They censored us without any warning. All of us have been wiped out," the account manager also said.Many LGBT rights supporters also took to social media to protest against the closure of students' accounts. "The era is regressing. China wasn't like this 10 years ago. Gradually we're losing all our freedoms," said a user on Weibo, as per ANI report.However, some online nationalists have welcomed the move, who claimed that they are run by "anti-China forces." "I support the blocking of the accounts...why should we keep these public accounts run by anti-China forces in our higher education institutions? Are we waiting for them to brainwash university students who have yet to form their values?" ANI quoted one user as saying.In 1997, China decriminalised homecuality, but not until 2001, the government classified it as a "mental disorder."However, in a controversial ruling in March this year, a Chinese court upheld a university's description of homosexuality as a "psychological disorder" and said that it was not a factual error but merely an "academic view".The Cyberspace Administration of China recently pledged to clean up the internet to protect minors and crackdown on social media groups deemed a "bad influence".Traditionally, LGBT student groups do not get the support of university authorities in their work to raise awareness about the community, despite the decriminalisation.In May, the loyalty of LGBT university groups to the government and the Communist Party was discussed between student groups, university representatives of the Communist Youth League - a department in charge of student affairs run by the Chinese Communist Party, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter, Reuters had reported.During the meeting, the students were asked if they were anti-Party or anti-China, and whether any of their funds had originated from abroad, it also reported.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-wechat-blocks-lgbt-accounts-users-slam-anti-homosexuality-crackdown-in-china-101625722811640.html

She asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison to ramp up the vaccination rollout.Berejiklian has flagged that her government may need to impose harsher restrictions in three southwestern Sydney local government areas -- Fairfield, Liverpool and Canterbury-Bankstown.“The two biggest areas where people are spreading the virus is through household contacts of people close to them, and people who are undertaking activities with symptoms.

So, that is a mechanism for that,” she said.The US military exit from Afghanistan before September 11 stems from the February 2020 agreement Washington signed with the Taliban in return for counterterrorism guarantees and pledges the group would negotiate a political settlement to the war with the Afghan government.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-deliver-major-policy-speech-on-afghanistan-update-on-troop-drawdown-101625704213630.html

She told the Bloomberg news agency that this number is likely to be 52% now, which will be confirmed once the data for the two-week period ending July 3 comes in.Also Read | 'Lambda variant of coronavirus deadlier than delta': Malaysian health ministrySo far, the 'alpha' variant of Covid-19, first identified in the United Kingdom, had been dominant in the US. Now alpha cases constitute 28.7% of the total cases -- a declining trend -- while delta variant cases are on the rise.The data is a result of a study conducted by the CDC in which the health agency estimated proportions of the most common SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the US on a bi-weekly basis. The virus sequences have been collected in the national genomic surveillance since December last year.The US CDC categorised the delta Covid-19 variant as a 'variant of concern' last month, noting that the extent to which the strain has affected the country varies across regions. While the delta variant constitutes 30% of the total Covid-19 infections in the Pacific Northwest, it ranges to more than 80% of the cases in the Midwestern region of the country. However, the variant has been found in every US state, officials confirmed.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccines could be 8 times less effective against Delta variant: StudyThe delta variant of the coronavirus disease is believed to be more potent than the earlier strains of the virus, in the sense that it is more infectious and lethal, leaving the younger population especially vulnerable. It is rapidly spreading to most countries in the world, even as governments struggle with vaccination campaigns and debilitating infection trajectories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-first-identified-in-india-now-dominant-in-us-101625701597250.html

My friend saw something yellow coming (like) the sun. I took the picture and after (there was) a sound," said intern Clemence Lefaix, who is staying near the blast site and posted a photo of a bright orange light against the night sky in front of apartment buildings.A resident of Dubai's Marina district, close to the Jebel Ali port, told AFP they "saw the windows shaking"."I have been living here for 15 years and this is the first time I've seen and heard this," they said.There are 8,000 companies based at the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) which contributed 23 percent of Dubai's gross domestic product last year. It is the Middle East's largest trade zone.The glitzy Gulf emirate of Dubai transformed itself over 50 years from a sleepy port town to a regional travel, trade and financial services centre.The city state is now home to more than three million people, mostly foreigners, compared with only 15,000 inhabitants in the 1950s.Unlike Abu Dhabi, the leading member of the UAE that sits on a large wealth of petroleum, Dubai has dwindling oil resources and has worked to develop non-oil industries, diversifying into services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loud-explosion-rocks-dubai-port-no-casualty-101625701526796.html
08-07-2021||World||Key party in Malaysia ruling alliance pulls support for PM Muhyiddin Yassin||The largest party in Malaysia’s ruling alliance said Thursday that it will withdraw support for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin immediately and urged him to make way for a new leader.The announcement is a political bombshell that could potentially trigger the collapse of the government if he refuses to quit and spark a general election.Muhyiddin took power in March 2020 after initiating the downfall of the former reformist government that won the 2018 elections. His Bersatu party joined with the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, which was ousted in the 2018 polls, and others to form a new government, but his alliance has a razor-thin majority in Parliament.UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Muhyiddin’s government has failed to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, he said its inconsistent policies and half-baked lockdown measures have deepened the economic hardship.Zahid urged Muhyiddin to resign and make way for a temporary leader to take over until the pandemic eases and a general election can be held safely.“This is important to allow a government that is truly stable and has the mandate of the majority of the people to be formed,” he said in a statement after a meeting of UMNO’s top decision-making body.There was no immediate reaction from Muhyiddin or his party.UMNO’s decision came just hours after Muhyiddin named an UMNO lawmaker as his deputy, in what was seen as a calculated bid to persuade the party to stay on. Tensions have been brewing for months in the ruling alliance, with UMNO unhappy at playing second fiddle to Bersatu.The prime minister’s office named Defense Minister Ismail Sabri as the deputy premier and said he also would retain his security post. Muhyiddin had broken with tradition by not appointing a deputy premier to his Cabinet last year but named four senior ministers instead, two of which are from his own party and Ismail from UMNO.Muhyiddin’s office said Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein would take over Ismail’s post as one of the four senior ministers, while retaining his diplomatic portfolio. It had voiced hope that the promotions would unite the ruling parties and boost the government’s strength.Analysts said Muhyiddin has split UMNO by appointing second-tier leaders to his Cabinet and reinforced it with the new appointments. Both those two UMNO lawmakers are in a camp opposed to UMNO leader Zahid.But the move failed to stem the strong opposition in UMNO to Muhyiddin and his party.UMNO earlier this year said the party will not work with Muhyiddin’s alliance in the next general election. Its attempt to seek early elections has been stymied by a worsening coronavirus crisis, with the country plunged in a second national lockdown since June 1.Zahid noted that the country’s deaths from the pandemic had doubled to 5,768 since the lockdown began. Total confirmed coronavirus infections in Malaysia now stand near 800,000, with daily infections breaching 7,000 in the past two days.He said Muhyiddin abused a coronavirus emergency that was declared in January for his political gain. The emergency suspended Parliament, which means support for Muhyiddin’s leadership cannot be tested.Muhyiddin agreed to let Parliament resume July 26, ahead of the Aug. 1 expiration of the emergency, after growing pressure, including from the nation’s king.Zahid didn’t propose anyone as the interim prime minister but said UMNO will not support opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who has been lobbying for support. It is unclear how the political situation will pan out as no coalition now has a clear majority.“As long as Bersatu is in charge, UMNO will not be all right,” said Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-party-in-malaysia-ruling-alliance-pulls-support-for-pm-muhyiddin-yassin-101625687031406.html
08-07-2021||World||UN rights expert urges sanctions on Myanmar's oil and gas sector||A United Nations human rights investigator called on countries on Wednesday to impose economic sanctions on Myanmar's oil and gas sector to cripple the junta that took power five months ago.Myanmar has been in crisis since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1, unleashing nationwide anger that quickly turned into protests and strikes brutally suppressed by security forces, with nearly 900 killed.Thomas Andrews, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said that no state had imposed any sanctions on its oil and gas sector, although some had slapped them on military-controlled enterprises and revenue from gems, timber and mining."Oil- and gas-sector revenues are a financial lifeline for the junta and are estimated to be close to what is needed for the junta to maintain the security forces that are keeping them in power. They should be stopped," he told the Human Rights Council.Andrews, a former US congressman from Maine, called for forming an 'Emergency Coalition for the People of Myanmar' that would also ban the export of arms to the military.The US delegation called for decisive action to prevent further bloodshed, saying: "We urge all nations to cease the export of arms and transfer of dual-use technology to the military junta."Earlier, the top UN human rights official Michelle Bachelet urged ASEAN countries to launch a political dialogue with the military junta and the democratically-elected leadership in Myanmar.The United Nations must be allowed to deliver humanitarian aid to civilians in Myanmar, as agreed with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), without it being "instrumentalised" by the military, she said.The ASEAN bloc agreed a five-point consensus with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in April, "but unfortunately the Myanmar military leadership have shown little sign of abiding by it", Bachelet said."It is urgent for ASEAN to appoint a special envoy or team to get some kind of political dialogue underway. I encourage ASEAN to engage with the democratic leadership and civil society, not just the military front," Bachelet said.Sally Mansfield, Australia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said: "We welcome ASEAN’s efforts to chart a course out of this crisis and look forward to the announcement of a Special Envoy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-expert-urges-sanctions-on-myanmar-s-oil-and-gas-sector-101625686409051.html
08-07-2021||World||Tropical Storm Elsa to drench New York after lashing Florida||Tropical Storm Elsa is poised to gain strength off the coasts of New York and New Jersey on Friday, dumping heavy rain on the Northeast and the Canadian Maritimes after buffeting Florida earlier in the week.Elsa’s top winds fell to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour as it spun across northern Florida Wednesday, the US National Hurricane Center said in a 2 p.m. New York time advisory. The storm is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression Thursday over the Carolinas and Virginia before entering the Atlantic once again off New Jersey. A depression is the weakest class of storm in the family of systems that includes hurricanes.“The question then becomes is it able to re-strengthen into a tropical storm,” said Paul Walker, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster AccuWeather Inc. Regardless of whether they’re from Elsa or another system in the East, there will be “good rains from the mid-Atlantic into New England and into Atlantic Canada.”Elsa is the fifth Atlantic storm this year and became the season’s first hurricane as it moved through the Caribbean last week, killing at least three people. It’s also the third named storm to hit the US this year. While meteorologists don’t expect the tally of Atlantic storms in 2021 to reach last year’s record of 30, they’re predicting a more active hurricane season than normal.Moisture from Elsa combined with a weather front moving across the East Coast could bring as much as 5 inches of rain or more from Georgia to New Brunswick, Canada, in the next five days, according to the US Weather Prediction Center.The storm’s worst winds will remain on its east side, mainly out to sea, Walker said.“Heavy rain could come up the I-95 corridor,” Walker said.After Elsa sweeps off into the North Atlantic, the basin is poised to calm down for the next week. Hurricane season began June 1 and runs until November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-elsa-to-drench-new-york-after-lashing-florida-101625685821809.html
08-07-2021||World||Joe Biden visits community college in Illinois to sell voters on investments in families, education||President Joe Biden on Wednesday turned his focus to pitching his proposed investments in families and education, using a visit to a community college in an Illinois swing district to highlight how his spending on so-called human infrastructure would boost the economy.The president toured McHenry County College, a community college in Crystal Lake with a workforce development program and a child care center. He’s trying to sell voters on his vision to invest in child care, health care, education and other important aspects of everyday life for Americans, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday on Air Force One.Biden toured a metals lab at the community college, where he emphasized the need to invest in research and development to bolster manufacturing jobs.“We’ve got the best folks in the world, we’re just not investing the kind of money we should,” he said.The president also wants to put a renewed focus on the portions of his economic agenda that didn’t make it into the bipartisan infrastructure deal that he backed in June. That package includes hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in roads and bridges, transit systems and broadband, but it constitutes only part of the $4 trillion in spending Biden has proposed in a broader plan to reinvigorate the economy and boost the middle class.On Wednesday, the Democratic president took steps to highlight the rest, including his plans to invest in child care and workforce development programs and provide two years of free community college, universal prekindergarten and paid family and medical leave. He'll make the case that investments in such programs are needed to maintain America's economic growth and competitiveness globally.He’ll also highlight his proposals to establish a clean energy standard and invest in home care for seniors and affordable housing. And he'll speak about his plans to make permanent the expansion in the child tax credit and expanded health care premium subsidies from the COVID-19 aid bill.Democrats plan to include much of this in a bill they hope to pass through a legislative maneuver that would require just a simple majority vote, skirting the 60-vote hurdle in an evenly divided Senate. Biden has said he would prefer that the two bills move through Congress together, and Democrats are hoping to make progress this month on both.The Biden administration promoted its agenda on multiple fronts Wednesday.First lady Jill Biden visited an elementary school in Washington to discuss how the trillions of dollars the president wants Congress to spend on families would pay for more affordable child care, preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, larger salaries for teachers and modern school buildings with safe drinking water, along with more teachers of color and more nurses and counselors to help students with their emotional and other needs.“You and your students will continue to be one of our top priorities, not just in one legislative bill, but in everything we do,” she said during a speech to a virtual meeting of the American Federation of Teachers union.”President Biden was greeted by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot when he landed in Illinois and was met at the community college by Gov. J.B. Pritzker; Illinois' two Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth; and Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood, who represents the district.Biden won Illinois’ 14th Congressional District by about 2 percentage points in 2020, and Underwood won reelection by less than that. Hers is one of the top-targeted seats in the nation and is emblematic of the kind of district Democrats will need to hold onto in the 2022 midterms if they hope to maintain control of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-visits-community-college-in-illinois-to-sell-voters-on-investments-in-families-education-101625685379588.html
08-07-2021||India||Facebook must appear before Delhi assembly riots panel, says Supreme Court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday held that Facebook must appear before a Delhi assembly committee to respond to queries regarding its role and other aspects of the February 2020 Delhi riots, as it emphasised that the social media intermediary cannot escape responsibilities after becoming a “power centre” that can “polarise public debates” and “influence vast sections of opinions”. “Facebook cannot excuse themselves from appearing pursuant to the new summons issued to them on February 3, 2021... Facebook is a platform where political differences are reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their very business,” said the bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul. At the same time, the court clarified that the peace and harmony committee of the Delhi assembly cannot become a “prosecuting agency” which can hold people guilty and order filing of charge sheets in the riot cases. The Facebook executive will be at liberty not to answer questions relating to law and order and police, while such a refusal cannot lead to any coercive step by the assembly, said the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy. The bench dismissed the petition filed jointly by Facebook and Facebook India head Ajit Mohan against the summons issued to Mohan by the Delhi assembly committee, which is headed by Aaam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha, noting that the committee had authority to seek attendance of “non-members” of the assembly as well and to ask them to depose on oath on a subject within its jurisdiction. Underlining that Delhi assembly was as good as any other state assembly, with the only exception of absence of legislative powers on land, police and public order, the top court rejected Facebook’s contention that it cannot be compelled by any committee of the parliament or the state assembly to participate in an inquiry and that its move to appear before a parliamentary panel last year on information technology was a “business decision”. “As per their own acknowledgement, they would only appear before any committee if it served their commercial and operational interests, as it did when they appeared before the parliamentary committee. But if their business interests are not served, they seek a right to stay away. Such a stand is completely unacceptable to us. Facebook has the power of not simply a hand but a fist, gloved as it may be,” said the bench in its 188-page judgment. It bench, however, pointed to certain statements made on the alleged collusion of Facebook in the Delhi riots by the Chadha during a press conference in August last year, and said that “such statements are hardly conducive to fair proceedings before the Committee and should have been desisted from”. While Facebook and Mohan were represented through senior advocates Harish Salve and Arvind Datar, the Delhi government had senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and advocate Shadan Farasat to argue for the government and the committee. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared for the central government, which supported Facebook in saying that the summons could not be issued for want of legislative competence - an issue that the court called “premature”. Holding that lawmaking is not the only business of a legislative assembly, the bench underscored the role of an assembly committee in assisting the legislature in various issues of governance and said that Facebook, with their expanded role as an intermediary, “can hardly contend that they have some exceptional privilege to abstain from appearing before a committee duly constituted by the assembly.” The court further termed the Facebook’s petition plea “premature” and “speculative” since the Facebook executive was yet to appear before the committee to understand the ambit of questioning, and therefore, it said, issues of privilege power, right to free speech and silence, right to privacy etc. were “pre-emptory” and a “preventive endeavour”. It further said that the privilege power of the Delhi assembly was not just a statutory power but a constitutional one, on par with any other state assembly. Highlighting that the “unfortunate violence” that broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020 had left 53 people dead and several hundreds injured, the bench underlined that the need to go into this incident, both from a legal and social perspective, cannot be belittled. “The capital of the country can ill-afford any repetition of the occurrence and thus, the role of Facebook in this context must be looked into by the powers that be..the assembly being a local legislative and governance body, it cannot be said that their concerns were misconceived or illegitimate. It is not only their concern but their duty to ensure that ‘peace and harmony’ prevails,” said the court. Thus the committee, said the court, has the power to go into the incident and issuance of summons is key to this investigative exercise, which cannot be sidestepped by Facebook on the premise that it is an “outsider” which does not want to be drawn into a political divide. “Facebook is a platform where such political differences are reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their very business. As noticed earlier, their role is not as innocuous as they are seeking to contend. Similarly, we cannot accept the plea that an assembly must confine itself to the core function of legislation. This would be unreasonably restricting the role of an elected body,” held the bench. About the scope of the inquiry by the committee, the court said it would undermine the very purpose of a vital democratic polity if it were to say that informed deliberation in relation to the best measures through which online mass hate and violence in their geographical jurisdiction can be addressed would not be within the committee’s area of competence. Chadha welcomed the judgment. “The court has reaffirmed and acknowledged the important role of the committee of peace and harmony. We will study the judgment, and shall thereafter continue the proceedings in terms thereof. The committee, like other legislative committees of the assembly, is keen on continuing a genuine deliberative process on issues of concerns in the NCT of Delhi with full participation of all concerned,“ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-must-appear-before-delhi-assembly-riots-panel-says-supreme-court-101625768786587.html
08-07-2021||India||Facebook can’t take a different stand in India, says top court||The Supreme Court on Thursday made a strong pitch to make Facebook accountable for its social media content, citing the global trend on how Facebook had a “disruptive” potential that could threaten the diversity existing within India. Facebook was in court to challenge the summons issued by the Delhi assembly’s peace and harmony committee over some alleged hate speeches circulated on the platform during the riots that rocked north-east Delhi in February last year. While reaffirming the powers of the committee to summon Facebook executives, the bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul rejected the “simplistic” argument by the social media intermediary that it cannot be held liable because it neither initiates transmission of message nor controls it. It said that Facebook cannot be permitted to take contradictory stands in different jurisdictions depending upon its suitability and convenience. It underscored that in the United States of America, Facebook projected itself in the category of a publisher giving them protection under the ambit of the First Amendment and the control to justify moderation and removal of content. “Conspicuously in India, however, it has chosen to identify itself purely as a social media platform, despite its similar functions and services in the two countries. Thus, dependent on the nature of controversy, Facebook having almost identical reach to population of different countries seeks to modify its stand,” said the bench. Disapproving of this “hands-off approach”, the bench said, “It is difficult to accept the simplistic approach adopted by Facebook that it is merely a platform posting third party information and has no role in generating, controlling or modulating that information… Facebook today has influence over one-third population of this planet. Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power.” The judges noted that India is more diverse than the whole of Europe in terms of cultures, food, clothing, language, religion, and traditions. “We (India) have a history of what has now commonly been called ‘unity in diversity’. This cannot be disrupted at any cost or under any professed freedom by a giant like Facebook claiming ignorance or lack of any pivotal role.” The court cited a November 2018 international news report where Facebook had admitted to its role in failing to prevent a series of misinformation and posts that led to division and incitement of violence during the ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. The platform had even apologised for failing to respond to “evident signs of abuse of the platform” in Sri Lanka leading to widespread violence in 2018. “While Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and a means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy. In India, Facebook has about 270 million registered users. “The width of such access cannot be without responsibility as these platforms have become power centres themselves, having the ability to influence vast sections of opinions,” the bench observed. Less informed individuals using the platform tend to treat information received from populist leaders as “gospel truth” without verifying the same. Noting with concern how extremist views are being peddled into the mainstream to spread misinformation on social media platforms, the bench said, “The effect on a stable society can be cataclysmic with citizens being ‘polarised and paralysed’ by such ‘debates’, dividing the society vertically.” Even election and voting processes, considered the very foundation of a democratic government, are being threatened by social media manipulation, the bench observed, citing recent examples of how these platforms were blamed for “obfuscation of facts” and “spreading of outright lies in public sphere” during the 2016 US Presidential elections and Brexit. Countries like Australia, US, United Kingdom are contemplating laws to regulate social media platforms while the European Union has formulated legislative proposals, such as the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, to set down rules for platforms to follow, the judgment said. “The role played by Facebook is thus more active and not as innocuous as is often presented when dealing with third party content,” said the bench, observing that the ability to decide “which content to amplify, suggest, and elevate” lies with these platforms. Facebook admitted in court that it controls the content on its platform as it removed 22.5 million pieces of hate speech content in the second quarter of 2020. “This unprecedented degree of influence necessitates safeguards and caution in consonance with democratic values. Platforms and intermediaries must subserve the principal objective as a valuable tool for public good upholding democratic values,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-can-t-take-a-different-stand-in-india-says-top-court-101625768727088.html
08-07-2021||India||Centre and Delhi govt must walk ‘hand in hand’, says SC while hearing Facebook petition||New Delhi: The Centre and Delhi government must work together on governance issues in the Capital, the Supreme Court said on Thursday, urging both administrations to walk “hand in hand” without adopting a “my way or highway approach”.The comments by the top court came while deciding a petition by Facebook vice president Ajit Mohan, who challenged summons by a Delhi assembly panel in connection with communal riots that rocked northeast Delhi in February 2020.“No governance model requiring such collaboration can work if either of the two sides take a ‘my way or the highway’ approach –which both seem to have adopted,” said the three-judge bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul. The judges noted that Delhi’s hybrid administration – in which the Union government holds the prerogative for several key areas of governance –has worked well for many years with different political dispensations in power both at the Centre and State. “But the last few years have seen an unfortunate tussle on every aspect with the State government seeking to exercise powers as any other assembly and the Central Government unwilling to let them do so….” the bench added. “This has been responsible for a spate of litigation and despite repeated judicial counsel to work in tandem, this endeavour has not been successful,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.The Court called this an endeavour to “score points over the other”, which it said resulted in the present litigation filed by Facebook. The social media company, the court said, sought to take “advantage of this divergence of view” and the inability of both the Centre and State government to “see eye to eye on governance issues in Delhi”.Taking the role of a mediator, the bench advised the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre to show maturity at their ends. The Court asked AAP government to recognise and work within the constitutional scheme of division of powers in Delhi and “not what they think should be the division of powers”.On Centre, the bench said: “The central government is required to work in tandem, albeit with a different political dispensation… To work well, the central government and the state government have to walk hand in hand or at least walk side by side for better governance.”The court said that the two governments must realise the electoral mandate which has shown maturity to elect one dispensation in the Centre while seeking to choose another in the State, not once but twice.“The two powers unfortunately do not seek to recognise this aspect, and that is the bane of this structure requiring collaboration and concurrence. Some prior discussion and understanding could easily solve this problem instead of wasting large amounts of judicial time repeatedly arising from the failure of the two dispensations to have a broader outlook,” the bench remarked.In the present proceeding, the Court held that the Delhi government acted out of a duty to ensure that “peace and harmony” prevails in the Capital. “However, we may note that the long and repeated battles between the State and the Centre appear to have cast a shadow even over the well-meaning intent of the committee to assess peace and harmony as reflected in the Terms of Reference,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-and-delhi-govt-must-walk-hand-in-hand-says-sc-while-hearing-facebook-petition-101625768668391.html

Until late Thursday evening, the police team was waiting for officers from National Security Guard(NSG) headquarters in Manesar to reach this nondescript village in a south-western corner of the Capital. A drain cover on the footpath, with sand bags next to it, and a police teams guarding it, were the focus of attention as curious passersby peeked to check what had been discovered at the spot -- an old grenade, rusty on the outside, with parts of its surface chipped away by the years. It wasn’t the police who first discovered the suspicious device.On Thursday morning, a municipal corporation worker, cleaning drains as part of the civic body’s annual de-silting exercise before the monsoon, saw a round object in the drain. A police officer who spoke to the cleaner said the man initially thought it was some sort of a metal ball. He checked with other workers, and they thought that it looked like something they had seen in Hindi films -- a hand grenade with the “safety pin” on. Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police(south west), said: “At 11.55pm, we received a distress call on the 112 number about a safai karamchari discovering a grenade while cleaning a drain under the walkway. Immediately, the station house officer of the area rushed to the spot along with district bomb disposal team and found the old, corroded grenade at the spot. The district ballistics team safely placed it away from the crowded area, in an open space. Area around it has been buttressed using makeshift sandbags. A local police guard is posted there to ensure that no one goes near the grenade.” DCP Singh said police asked for the assistance of the National Security Guard(NSG) to ascertain the make and model of the grenade. Police suspect the grenade could be several decades old. They have no idea yet how it got there. Till late Thursday evening, the NSG commandos were yet to reach the spot. “We have been told that the NSG team has left Manesar. There is nothing to worry. It is totally safe. It is an old grenade. It has the marking HE 36. Our officers wasted no time in checking it out on Google. We were told it isn’t in use these days. We alerted our senior officers, issued an alert and they have asked for the NSG.

A statement issued by the Prime Minister Office (PMO) said Modi emphasised the need to adapt higher and technical education to keep in tune with the changing environment and emerging challenges. “This requires the institutions to reinvent and re-evaluate themselves, develop alternative and innovative models in accordance with the present and future needs of the country and society... There is a need to progress towards education models that are flexible, seamless, and able to provide learning opportunities as per requirements of the learners,” Modi said at the virtual interaction, adding that access, affordability, equity and quality should be the core values of such education models.The interaction was attended by over 100 heads of institutes, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Indian Institute of Science. It was also joined by newly-elected Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and ministers of state for education.Officials who attended the meeting said Modi was briefed on the ongoing research and development (R&D work) at these institutions and on the improvement in the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the past few years. “Digitisation of higher education can play a big role in increasing GER, and students will have easier access to good quality and affordable education,” Modi said. GER is a statistical measure used in the education sector to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level.The Prime Minister lauded the R&D work carried by these institutions towards meeting challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan will form the basis of dreams and aspirations of India in the coming 25 years when we celebrate 100 years of Independence. We need to focus on developing futuristic solutions in fields of education, healthcare, agriculture,defense, and cyber technologies,” he said.The Prime Minister also spoke on the need to develop an ecosystem of technological education in Indian languages and translate global journals into regional languages.“Had an enriching interaction with Directors of leading IITs and @iiscbangalore during which we exchanged thoughts on a wide range of subjects including making India a hub for R&D (Research and Development), innovation and popularising science among the youth,” Modi tweeted after the interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-stresses-need-for-modern-flexible-education-models-101625768665917.html

Earlier, five agencies had probed the same case and found nothing against me. I will cooperate with ED,” Khadse had told reporters before entering the ED office.Khadse, his wife Mandakani, Chaudhari and (Bhosari) land owner Abbas Rasalbhai Ukani were booked in the money laundering case by the ED on August 28, 2019. The central agency’s case is based on a complaint by Maharashtra’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) against Khadse’s family in 2017. While the ACB had later shut the case, the ED continued its investigation into the alleged financial irregularities in the land deal.The case pertains to the purchase of a plot at Bhosari village in Haveli Taluka of Pune district (having Survey No S2/2A/2) on April 28, 2016, by Khadse’s kin for ₹3.75 crore, against the prevalent market rate of ₹31 crore.The ownership of the plot was contentious as the industries department had acquired it in 1971 but the final award of the plot was not made and the owner was not compensated.According to the ED, Khadse and his family knew the plot was reserved for Maharashtra Industrial Development Cooperation. Yet they fraudulently purchased it so that they could claim a compensation of more than double the market rate whenever the MIDC would acquire it. According to people familiar with the development, the NCP leader was quizzed over his role in the alleged illegal purchase of the land and fudging of records at the registration office.The senior politician was also quizzed regarding a few meetings that took place in 2016 between the accused persons, including his son-in-law Chaudhari.ED officers also tried to find out if Khadse was aware of five shell companies which were used in layering of funds to purchase the land, the people cited above said. “We have been asked to submit certain documents. We will submit the same within 10 days. We will come as and when required by the ED. There has not been any other summons issued. We will cooperate with the investigation,” Khadse’s counsel Mohan Tekavade told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-probes-ncp-s-khadse-in-pune-land-case-101625768605812.html
08-07-2021||India||U’khand to review decision to stop kanwar yatra amid Covid||Dehradun: Uttarakhand on Thursday decided to review its decision to stop all Kanwar yatra devotees from entering the state this year, prompting experts to caution about a steep surge in Covid infections if safety protocols are violated.The decision on the yatra, which sees millions of people travel through several states by foot to the holy town of Haridwar, came a day after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath cleared the event and asked Uttarakhand to allow the procession.On Tuesday, the state government had decided not to allow the yatra over fears of a third Covid wave and increasing cases of delta variant in the state. The last Kanwar yatra was held in 2019 and roughly 30 million pilgrims reached Haridwar, as per official records. A senior official privy to the developments said chief minister Pushkar Dhami met senior officials on Thursday to discuss Kanwar yatra.“It was decided that state government will first hold talks with other states from where Kanwariyas come on how to conduct the yatra amid fears of the third wave, how the millions of pilgrims would be tested and whether there should be a cap on the numbers this time. The final call [on how to allow the yatra]will be taken after talks in a day or two,” said the official quoted above. Ashok Kumar, director-general of police (DGP) Uttarakhand, who was present in the meeting, said that Kanwar yatra was discussed in the meeting. “Various aspects of the yatra were discussed and pros and cons were weighed,” he said. This is the first major administrative decision by Dhami, who took charge on July 4. His predecessor, Tirath Singh Rawat, resigned on July 2 amid controversy over his administration’s decision to allow the Mahakumbh in Haridwar and large-scale fraud in testing during the holy event.Both Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party and are scheduled to go to the polls early next year.On Tuesday, the state government had issued an order stating that Kanwar pilgrims from neighbouring states won’t be allowed to enter Haridwar.Uttarakhand Police also held meeting with senior police officials of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab. Kumar had told his counterparts to publicise the government order on the ban and ask pilgrims from their states not to come to Haridwar. The state police had also decided to seal the borders of the state from July 22 to ensure Kanwariyas don’t enter Haridwar from Uttar Pradesh or Himachal Pradesh. But on Wednesday, Uttar Pradesh allowed the yatra from July 25. Adityanth also asked UP officials to coordinate to Uttarakhand administration and resolve any lingering problems.The fortnight-long Kanwar yatra is an annual pilgrimage of Shiva devotees -- known as Kanwariyas -- to Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand to fetch the water of the Ganga and carry it back to local temples. Devotees come from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh to Uttarakhand. The yatra was cancelled last year due to Covid and is usually held from July 23 to August 6. Uttarakhand government received sharp criticism from experts and the judiciary over its decision to allow full-scale organisation of the Mahakumbh, which saw 9.1 million people participate in violation of Covid norms and distancing guidelines. Roughly six million of these was in April at the height of the second wave and officials in many other north Indian states traced local infection surges to Kumbh returnees. The administration is probing if 100,000 rapid antigen tests at the event were faked.On June 28, the Uttarakhand high court also lashed out at the state government for allowing the Char Dham yatra and stayed its cabinet decision in this regard. Dr DD Choudhary, senior member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Uttarakhand said allowing Kanwar Yatra at this juncture will be a disaster. “The Kanwar yatra has the potential to spread the third wave like wildfire. It just needs few infected Kanwars to spread the Delta plus variant, which has also been detected in Uttarakhand now,” the doctor said. Rajesh Shivpuri, Garhwal-based political observer, said allowing millions of pilgrims when the country is readying to battle the third wave can be dangerous. “Every aspect should be considered before allowing Kanwar pilgrimage. It won’t be easy to manage Kanwariyas even if Kanwar yatra specific SoP is issued and restrictions are put in place,” he said. Suryakant Dhasmana, senior vice president of Uttarakhand Congress, criticised the state government’s U-turn. “Everyone knows what happened in Mahakumbh, what mess they have left behind, and how they endangered the lives of millions of people through fake Covid tests. During Kanwar yatra, which is mostly unorganised, with people come from different states, how can they manage such huge numbers at a time when they should be readying for third wave?” he asked. However, traders in Haridwar welcomed the decision. “All religious, festive baths and pilgrimages are being held in UP, then why not in our Uttarakhand. Right now, the Covid wave has come down sharply and the state is reporting few daily cases. There is no rationale in keeping the ban on the yatra,” said Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal Haridwar district president Sunil Sethi.

Stating that incidents of violence were reported away from nomination centres, Kumar admitted that it did cause law and order trouble, following which cases were filed.The ADG also said that extra police arrangements have been ordered for Friday, when candidates can take back their nominations, and on Saturday, when voting will take place to elect the block panchayat chiefs.Another police official said major trouble was reported from Sitapur’s Kasmanda block, where supporters of Bharatiya Janata Party and independent candidates scuffled while returning from the nomination centre. He said the incident led to firing between the supporters, in which three people suffered bullet injuries and were rushed to Lucknow for further treatment.A local resident in the area, however, alleged that the incident took place even as police personnel were present at some distance from the nomination centre. A video of Sitapur violence, which has gone viral, purportedly shows police personnel running for shelter amid indiscriminate firing by troublemakers. HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.In an incident, reported in Unnao’s Purwa block, the son of a BJP candidate alleged that the Samajwadi Party candidate in the block along with her supporters attacked and robbed him while he was returning home on Wednesday night. It led to a confrontation between supporters of the BJP and SP outside the nomination centre.In Ambedkar Nagar, former Bahujan Samaj Party minister Lalji Verma accused BJP candidate Tejaswi Jaiswal of snatching nomination form from his hand and misbehaving while he was going to extend support to another candidate at Tanda block.In Bahraich and Kannuaj, there were reports of stone-pelting between opponent groups, but no major injuries were reported, police said. Similar confrontations and verbal duels were also reported from Mainpuri, Siddarthnagar, Jaunpur, Ayodhya, Bulandshahr, Bijnor, Siddarthnagar, Amroha, Jhansi, Gorakhpur, Pilibhit and Basti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-mars-filing-of-papers-for-block-panchayat-chief-in-up-101625768427133.html
08-07-2021||India||Have right to suspend any account that violates terms: Twitter to HC||Social media firm Twitter on Thursday told the Delhi high court that it can suspend the account of any individual user found in breach of their service agreement, and that it has a “contractual obligation” to do so.The company, in response to a plea by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde challenging the suspension of his Twitter account, said that its services are “purely in the nature of a voluntary service” which it “provides to its users in a commercial capacity”. The social media intermediary also said there was no element of public function involved, and it was not obligated to render its service to further the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.“…the provision of services on Twitter is pursuant to a contractual obligation which the petitioner (Hegde) has signed up for, and the said contract gives Respondent No 2 (Twitter) the right to suspend an account if it is in violation of the user agreement and its policies. This shows that Respondent No 2 is merely discharging its contractual obligations,” Twitter said in an affidavit filed on Wednesday.“…the provision of service of Twitter is in no matter relatable to any function of the State carried out in its sovereign capacity; Its service is not in any manner a State protected monopoly, since there are multiple other such service providers which are intermediaries discharging similar functions,” the reply added.It also said that its services extended beyond the territorial boundaries of India, and it cannot be said that the platform owed a duty to the Indian public to facilitate free speech and expression.“For any activity to be classified as a public duty, it is necessary that a positive obligation is cast to discharge that duty. Efforts which are purely voluntary cannot be said to have the necessary public element in them,” Twitter told the high court.In December 2019, Hegde moved the high court challenging the permanent suspension of his account --“@sanjayuvacha”, from November 5, 2019 — alleging that the move was “arbitrary”, illegal as contrary to Twitter’s rules. According to the petition, Hegde’s account was suspended for allegedly re-tweeting two posts on the micro-blogging site. One of the posts was that of Kavita Krishnan, secretary of All India Progressive Women’s Association and member of CPI(ML) politburo who had shared Gorakh Pandey’s poem “Unko phaansi de do” in 2019. Hegde had re-tweeted the post with the caption “Hang Him”, an English translation of the poem’s title, the plea read. The second post was a picture of August Landmesser which Hegde was using as his profile header/ cover photo for over a year. The plea also contended that the suspension of account was a violation of his right to free speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (a)of the Indian Constitution. Advocate Pranjal Kishore, appearing for Hegde, sought directions to the Centre to frame guidelines to ensure that online speech is not arbitrarily censored by social media firms such as Twitter. He also sought restoration of the account.The petitioner argued that since Twitter imparts a public function, which is being a social media platform, facilitating the exchange of information and ideas, the plea was maintainable.Opposing this stand, Twitter said that its services were covered under the Information Technology Rules, and there was a mechanism provided under it, in case a user is aggrieved by any act or omission by an intermediary.Twitter has been in the eye of controversy over the past few months. On May 20, it labelled a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra “manipulated media” prompting a Delhi Police investigation. The special cell of Delhi Police questioned Manish Maheshwari, managing director of Twitter in India, in late May.The company then missed a May 25 deadline to comply with the new guidelines for intermediaries and social media firms, and an official in the IT ministry previously told HT that the company would lose the protection it enjoyed as an intermediary under the country’s IT law as a result.The Ghaziabad Police has been wanting to question Maheshwari over a video clip that went viral last month. The police believe Twitter did not do enough to halt the circulation of the clip which they believe misrepresents the nature of an attack on an elderly Muslim man as a communal hate crime. The Karkataka high court gave the Twitter executive protection from arrest and told the Ghaziabad Police that they could question him virtually, a ruling that has since been challenged in the Supreme Court.“Respondent No 2 (Twitter), in accordance with the IT Act and applicable rules has a grievance redressal mechanism and the petitioner’s recourse is to file a complaint on the said portal. The petitioner (Hegde), by filing this writ petition, is attempting to give a purely contractual dispute the colour of a public function allegedly being performed by it solely to make it amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the Court,” the reply by the social media firm said.Senior advocate Pavan Duggal said that even though the two parties are engaged in a contractual obligation, the agreement would not hold water in any court if it is in violation of the laws and the rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. If Twitter has suspended any account, then the IT Rules mandate that it has to be transparent and the site must spell out the reason for suspension, he said.The matter will now heard on August 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-right-to-suspend-any-account-that-violates-terms-twitter-to-hc-101625768366533.html
08-07-2021||India||‘No condition should be imposed,’ says Rakesh Tikait after Centre’s call for talks||Leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said that the government should not impose conditions on the protesting farmers if it wants to discuss the issue of the three farm laws.“The farm laws will not be curbed, yet they are asking us to end the protest. Farmers are not protesting for 8 months so that they could follow government’s orders. If they want to talk, they can talk, but no conditions should be imposed,” Tikait said, news agency ANI reported. His remarks came after Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar asked the farmers to give up the protests and come to the discussion table. Tomar, however, stood firm by the government’s position that the three farm laws would not be repealed.Also, the minister assured that more resources would be provided to the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) and they would be strengthened.Also read | APMCs to use ₹1 lakh crore fund, says Tomar, urges farmers to stop stir“APMCs will not be done away with. The Centre had declared in the Budget that the APMC will be part of the ₹1 lakh crore infrastructure fund. APMC can benefit from the fund through loans, interest waivers,” ANI quoted Tomar as saying. “ ₹1 lakh crore allocated under Atmanirbhar Bharat to Farmers Infrastructure Fund can be used by APMCs,” he further said.However, Tikait seemed unconvinced and questioned the government’s plan. “What is this formula that APMCs will continue to run despite no sales?” he asked. “They should tell us the system through which mandis will be saved. If produce are purchased outside Mandis, then they will be finished. There has been 0% sale in over 40 APMCs in Madhya Pradesh. They are on the verge of collapse. APMCs in Bihar, UP have been shut down,” he added.“If no purchases are done at mandis, how will they survive? They said APMCs will use ₹1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund. It may be possible that the government supports APMCs for one or two years but what will happen after that?” he further asked. Reiterating the farmer unions’ stance, he insisted that farmers will not be benefited unless there is a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP).Several farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s border since November last year against the three farm laws enacted by the Union government. More than ten rounds of discussions have taken place between the farmer unions’ leaders and the government, but no agreement has been reached.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-condition-should-be-imposed-says-rakesh-tikait-after-centre-s-call-for-talks-101625767712126.html

The ministry also said that the issue is being taken up with partners including those in the Gulf.“As we have said earlier, we hope that with the vastly improved Covid situation in India, countries would ease restrictions for travel from India. We have been taking up this issue with foreign partners wherever possible,” news agency PTI quoted Arindam Bagchi, the spokesperson for the external ministry, as saying. Bagchi said this in response to a question about the problems faced by Indian citizens travelling abroad, especially to Gulf countries.Highlighting a recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan and the Indian ambassadors in the Gulf nations, Bagchi said, “Our Ambassadors were requested to take up with their host countries the issue of resumption of flights with India."Also read | Active Covid-19 cases in India rise after 55 days; 8 states follow suitAlso, he mentioned that Jaishankar raised this issue during his bilateral meetings with representatives from other countries on the sidelines of the G-20 ministerial meetings in Italy, which concluded recently.

08-07-2021||India||EAM for greater regional efforts to ensure political settlement in Afghanistan||Against the backdrop of stepped-up efforts by the Taliban to capture territory, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday called for greater regional efforts to ensure a political settlement in Afghanistan that is good for both the country and the region.Jaishankar dismissed suggestions of a nuclear arms race between India and China but acknowledged that bilateral relations were disturbed because Beijing wasn’t abiding by border agreements and there had been a border incident that resulted in casualties after 45 years.He made the remarks during a question and answer session after delivering an address on the theme “India-Russia ties in a changing world” at the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow. The address was a key part of his three-day visit to Russia.The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan figured in Jaishankar’s meetings during a transit halt in Tehran on Wednesday and it is also expected to be a key part of his talks with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday.Recalling the role played by India and Russia in supporting the erstwhile Northern Alliance in Afghanistan two decades ago, Jaishankar said both countries want a united and sovereign Afghanistan “at peace with itself and at peace with its neighbours”, and where minorities have a fair share of representation.“I do think that the countries of the region... have a very strong interest in ensuring that we get an outcome in Afghanistan which is both good for Afghanistan and which is good for the region. And they are not different because I can tell you what is good for Afghanistan will automatically be good for the region,” he said.Responding to questions that focused on China, including the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Jaishankar said the two countries had a very stable relationship for the past 40 years. “I’m not saying that there were no issues and challenges in the relationship but it has been very stable and it saw a big economic element where China essentially emerged as our second-largest trade partner,” he said.“But for the last one year, there has been a lot of concern about the relationship because China has not observed agreements that it had signed up to when it came to our border. After 45 years we actually had a border incident with casualties and peace and tranquillity on the border, for any country, is a foundation of a relationship with a neighbour,” he added.He brushed aside a question on a nuclear arms race between India and China, saying the Chinese side had become a nuclear weapon power in 1964 with a primary focused on the US and the erstwhile USSR, while India exercised the nuclear option in 1998 while making it clear that it was aiming only for a minimum deterrent.There is no basis for an arms race, given the 30-year gap between the nuclear weapons programmes of the two sides and India’s decision to have a minimum deterrent, he said.Jaishankar also addressed Russian concerns about the Indo-Pacific by saying that the country could be part of the concept as it was not aimed at shutting anyone out. He described the Indo-Pacific as a “further advancement” of India’s Act East policy to focus on a region where the nation’s top trade partners are located, including China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Australia and the ASEAN states.“In many ways, Russia is there. If Russia acts like Russia, Russia will make its full contribution [to the Indo-Pacific],” he said, adding that Indian investments in Russia’s Far East, Russia’s participation in the East Asia Summit are “part of the Indo-Pacific”.During his address, Jaishankar said relations between Russia and India have been “among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world after World War 2”. He added, “Where India-Russia bilateral ties are concerned, there have been changes – even issues – from time to time. But at the end of the day, the logic of geo-politics was so compelling that we barely remember these even as minor aberrations.”“On the political front, it is essential for India and Russia to work together to ensure the stability and diversity of the world as we know it. This includes an insistence on honouring agreements and observing laws. On the economic side, there is a growing realisation on the importance of resilient and reliable supply chains. Our collaboration can surely add to the options before the world, as we have already seen in the case of vaccines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-for-greater-regional-efforts-to-ensure-political-settlement-in-afghanistan-101625765426264.html
08-07-2021||India||'A single mistake': PM Modi's Covid-19 warning at ministers' meet||The photos and videos of crowded places and people roaming about without masks, throwing social distancing to the wind should instil a sense of fear, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday as he met his new council of ministers a day after the Cabinet reshuffle. This is not a time for carelessness or complacency, the prime minister said adding that a single mistake would have far-reaching impacts and would also weaken the fight to overcome Covid-19, news agency ANI reported quoting sources.His warning comes as the union health ministry, which got a new minister on Wednesday, too expressed its concern over people indulging in "revenge travel" at a time when the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is not yet over and the threat of a 3rd wave is looming large.The ministry on Tuesday said the photos of people thronging hill stations are "frightening" as 73 districts across 17 states and Union territories are still reporting a positivity rate of more than 10 per cent. Not only in Shimla, Mussoorie, but people also started crowding local markets in Delhi, Mumbai as well.Active Covid-19 cases in India go up after 55 days; 8 states follow suit"As ministers, our aim should not be to instil fear but to request people to keep taking all possible precautions so that we are able to move beyond this pandemic in the times to come," PM Modi said, expressing concern at the persistently high number of Covid-19 cases being reported from Maharashtra and Kerala.The second wave of the pandemic which reached its peak in April, May is on its way out now, but experts have warned that the third wave in India might be "inevitable". While the northeastern states are now reporting a higher test positivity rate, cases in Kerala and Maharashtra are also not coming down below a certain point. On Thursday, India's active Covid-19 cases recorded a spike after 55 days. The number of new infections reported on Thursday (45,892) also surpassed the recoveries reported in the same period (44,291), marking a departure from the recent trend of higher recoveries and lower daily infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-space-for-complacency-pm-modi-s-covid-19-warning-at-ministers-meet-101625763139496.html
08-07-2021||India||‘Waited for decades...’: Fans-turned-political workers feel dejected as Rajinikanth moves on||As actor Rajinikanth is set to return to Chennai on Friday from the US where he underwent a health-check up and is readying for his new Tamil release in November, some of his fans are still picking up the pieces after being abandoned in his political quest.A dejected, SM Rabik has left Rajinikanth’s fan club in Madurai of which he was one of the founding members since 1977. He was also working as part of the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), a conglomeration of all his fans clubs launched when the superstar announced his entry into politics in December 2017.“I’ve relieved myself from everything since he has decided not to pursue it,” says Rabik. “I was never interested in any other political party. But I was waiting for decades for him to enter politics,” he said not wishing to elaborate further.The RMM was packed with Rajinikanth’s cult following, with no background in politics, but they turned into his foot soldiers as he began from scratch.Another fan and RMM functionary, who wanted his identity protected, resigned from a private software company in Chennai, three days after Rajinikanth announced his exit due to excessive trolling he faced in his office and online. The actor returned from his shooting from the sets of ‘Annaatthe’ and on 29 December 2020, he announced that he will not pursue politics due to his health condition.“I had canvassed for votes for him everywhere including my office and everyone kept telling me he will back out,” he says. “So when he did back out, my colleagues humiliated me for wasting my time. One friend even got me a t-shirt with the slogan ‘Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum (this too shall pass)’.” He shifted jobs and his new company isn’t aware of his association with Rajinikanth’s brief stint in politics.For some Rajinikanth fans, the questions remain if he was forced into politics for multiple reasons. “And if he did it for commerce,” says a fan who wrote a book on the superstar and he didn’t want to be identified. “Rajini was this duck who laid a golden egg with a film every two years and fans would crave for it. Ever since he announced his political entry he has been making back-to-back films and none of them had any hint of his politics.” He says he compared Rajinikanth straddling films and politics with his predecessors like MG Ramachandran and Vijayakanth.Tamil Nadu is after all a pioneer in fusing silver screen and politicking. “But with Rajinikanth, several things were off the mark so disappointment with him is something that happened slowly unlike his hardcore fans for whom it was a big bang disappointment,” the writer says. He adds that he was wondering how Rajinikanth would plan an exit strategy after his press conference in March 2020 where he announced he would lead the party but someone else would be chief minister. “The hardcore fans told me I should be thinking loyally not logically. For them, Rajinikanth is God and God will never do anything wrong to us. While some still hold on to that belief, this shattered for a few others.” He gives the example of a 60-year-old RMM functionary who was a Rajinikanth’s fan club president and pawned his wife and children’s gold jewellery and spent 6-lakhs on Rajinikanth’s birthday on December 12 2020. He moved on to another party.Several others, including those who held key positions in the RMM, have joined other parties such as the DMK and the BJP with Rajinikanth’s blessing. Political greenhorns like Gayathri Srinivas believe that RMM gave them a political launchpad. She was the RMM’s district secretary of the women’s wing in south Chennai who joined the BJP earlier this year.“Along with family and friends, I joined RMM to work towards social causes and bring about an alternative politically,” says Srinivas. “I’m a huge fan and meeting him just once for me was a divine experience. I had no idea about joining politics until he announced his entry. Now that I’ve learnt so much over the last three years, I didn’t want to waste the experience.” She adds that she chose BJP as she felt their ideology aligned with Rajinikanth’s politics.Despite the disappointment, sections of his fan base remain intact such as 27-year-old Nagaraj Jayakumar who was RMM youth wing head of Chennai’s Alandur. “We wouldn’t have learnt the basics in politics in established parties like the DMK and the AIADMK but here we completed work in 70% of the booths,” says Jayakumar. He had started a YouTube channel, Samaniyar exclusive for Rajinikanth to bust fake news about him. But he says it’s been hard to move on. “I worked for the party during weekends. We have spent a lot of time on party work, so it’s frustrating and several people are still stuck not knowing what to do next. I’ve continued with my day job.”The kind of impact Rajinikanth’s brief political foray and exit had on his fandom could be indicated by the response to his new film, ‘Annaatthe’ slated for a Diwali release. The film is produced by DMK patriarch late M Karunanidhi’s grand-nephew Kalanidhi Maran’s Sun Pictures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waited-for-decades-fans-turned-political-workers-feel-dejected-as-rajinikanth-moves-on-101625763146068.html

Global study finds gene link||An international study involving over 3,000 researchers from 25 countries has found out the genetic answer to the question of why some people get more sick from Covid while some other do not report any symptoms. There are age and co-morbidity factors, but still, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been exactly the same for two people. And the answer to it lies in TYK2 gene that appears strongly connected to the disease severity, the study published in Nature said."Susceptibility to life-threatening infections and immune-mediated diseases are both strongly heritable. In particular, susceptibility to respiratory viruses such as influenza is heritable and known to be associated with specific genetic variants. In the case of Covid-19, one genetic locus—on chromosome 3p21.31—has been repeatedly associated with hospitalization. As with other virus-associated diseases, there are several examples of loss-of-function variants affecting essential immune processes that lead to severe disease in young people," the study said.The results may help pinpoint “some clear biological markers that could be used to repurpose existing drugs or drugs in the pipeline,” Bloomberg quoted Mark Daly, a study co-author who is the director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland at the University of Helsinki and a geneticist at Harvard University, as saying.The research began in March 2020 and in its course, the scientists studied almost 50,000 infected people and two million uninfected. About 13 generic locations have been identified in the research which are strongly linked to either susceptibility to the virus or severity. Some of these 13 genetic locations had previously been linked to other illnesses, including lung cancer and autoimmune diseases, the study said.Several studies aiming to shed light on the genetic link behind severity have associated blood group with SARS-CoV-2 and claimed that O blood type provides more protection from Covid-19.(With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-some-people-get-more-sick-from-covid-19-global-study-finds-gene-link-101625762779843.html
08-07-2021||India||Don’t allow OIC to be subverted by ‘vested interests’ like Pak, says India||India on Thursday called on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to not allow its platform to be subverted by “vested interests” such as Pakistan to interfere in India’s internal affairs or to carry out propaganda against the country.The Indian position was articulated by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi during a regular news briefing while responding to questions on the OIC’s offer to arrange a meeting between India and Pakistan and the organisation’s proposal to send a delegation to Jammu and Kashmir.OIC secretary-general Yousef Al-Othaimeen had raised these issues with Indian ambassador Ausaf Sayeed during a meeting in Jeddah on July 5. Pakistan latched on to a statement issued by the OIC after the meeting to claim this was the first time the position of 57 OIC member states had been “duly conveyed to India”.Bagchi noted that the meeting with the Indian envoy was held in response to an earlier request from the OIC secretary-general and said the “OIC should be watchful that their platform is not subverted by... vested interests for comments on internal affairs of India or for anti-India propaganda through biased and one-sided resolutions”.Asked about Pakistan’s role in the entire affair, Bagchi said, “As regards Pakistan, I have already referred to vested interests in my remarks.”Bagchi also said the Indian ambassador had used the meeting with the OIC official to convey the “need to correct some of the misperceptions about India that are perpetrated by vested interests in the OIC”.The OIC, in its statement, had said that Al-Othaimeen had reviewed “issues concerning the situation of Muslims in India, along with the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and relevant UN and OIC resolutions opposing any unilateral actions on the issue” during the meeting with the Indian envoy.Al-Othaimeen conveyed OIC’s desire to send a delegation to Jammu and Kashmir in line with resolutions of the OIC council of foreign ministers, and “asked about the possibility of a meeting between Pakistan and India, stating that the general secretariat stands ready to assist if the two parties would so request,” the statement added.Pakistan has repeatedly sought to raise the Kashmir issue at the OIC against the backdrop of India’s dramatically improved relations with several key players in West Asia and in the Islamic organisation, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Indonesia and Bangladesh.In 2019, Pakistan was angered when then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj was invited by the UAE to attend and address an OIC foreign ministers meeting as a special guest. Pakistan has also been finding fewer takers among OIC member states for resolutions aimed against India but continues to rake up matters such as Kashmir at the grouping.The OIC CFM in Niamey in November 2020 categorically rejected India’s unilateral actions since 5 August 2019. It also demanded that India rescind its illegal actions and respect the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination, as promised by numerous UNSC resolutions.The Kashmir issue wasn’t on the official agenda of a meeting of OIC foreign ministers held in Niger in November 2020 but Pakistan subsequently proposed a resolution on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-allow-oic-platform-to-be-subverted-by-vested-interests-like-pakistan-says-india-101625759245929.html

Just focus on the supply of vaccines to all states,” the Congress leader wrote in another tweet, taking a dig at the central government’s claim of carrying out the biggest Covid-19 vaccination drive in the world a few weeks before.No more games to enter the Guinness Book of Records please. Just focus on the supply of vaccines to all the States.Notably, the resignation of Dr Harsh Vardhan came to many as quite a shock since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always lauded him for his handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in India since its outbreak in March last year.Vardhan, who is an ENT surgeon by profession, was managing the ministries of science and technology, and earth sciences as well. He was even elected to the executive board of the World Health Organisation (WHO) last year.Soon after Vardhan’s resignation surfaced, Congress leaders Randeep Surjewala and Jairam Ramesh extended defence for the former, saying that he has been made a “scapegoat” for the failures of the Centre. “Poor Dr. Harsh Vardhan, a good man has been made a scapegoat for monumental failures at the highest level — nowhere else,” Ramesh tweeted.Meanwhile, vaccine shortage has lately been an issue across India with vaccination drive reportedly affected in several states, including Jharkhand and Maharashtra, among others. The Union health ministry issued statements on Tuesday and Wednesday to clarify that the Centre informs the states and UTs in advance about the number of vaccine doses being sent to them. The ministry also pointed out that states have been asked to plan their Covid-19 vaccination drive based on the availability of vaccine doses.The Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO, Adar Poonawalla, on Thursday congratulated the new health minister and said that the company is “looking forward” to Mandaviya’s “leadership” to navigate through the Covid-19 pandemic.A Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat, Mandaviya holds a master’s degree in Political Science from Bhavnagar University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-adequate-vaccine-supply-chidambaram-to-new-health-minister-mandaviya-101625757956835.html

Paras, however, acquiesced that Chirag has the right to his late father’s assets"I am the real political successor of Paswanji (Ram Vilas Paswan). Chirag Paswan is definitely his son but he is not and cannot be his political successor. He (Chirag) definitely has a right on his father's assets," PTI said quoting Paras.Paswan founded Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) after he split from the Janata Dal in 2000. A factional fight had broken out between Chirag and Paras, with both claiming rights to lead the party. On June 17, the party split as the Paras-led faction, consisting of five Members of Parliament (MP), rebelled against Chirag. LJP which is an alliance partner in the National Democratic Alliance government (NDA) currently has six MPs in the house. The Lok Sabha speaker recognised Paras as the leader of LJP in the house.Paras, who is the brother of the late Paswan, told reporters that he idealises his late brother. "I consider Ram Vilas Paswanji as my ideal. He was my elder brother," he said.Also Read: Chirag Paswan to move court against uncle Paras’s induction in Union cabinetChirag, who represents Jamui constituency, and was considered to be his father’s political successor, said he will move the Delhi high court against his uncle’s induction in the Narendra Modi cabinet. He claimed that since Paras had already been expelled by LJP, he cannot be offered a ministerial berth on the party’s quota. “LJP has nothing to do with him if he is made a minister from his faction,” Chirag Paswan had said on July 7.On being asked about his nephew’s decision to challenge the Lok Sabha speaker’s act of recognising him as the party’s leader, Paras said that it was not "legally correct" and that in a democracy, the majority always prevails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-the-real-political-successor-chirag-can-claim-paswan-s-assets-pashupati-paras-101625756839121.html

The minister was reportedly hesitant to step on water and was hence carried by the man, which he denied while talking to reporters.Radhakrishnan was at Pulicat in Tiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu to inspect erosion in a nearby lake along with the district collector and MLAs. During his inspection, more than 30 people travelled along with the minister in a boat that can only transport seven people at a time, local Tamil news station Puthiyathalaimurai TV reported. Because of this, the boat began to lose balance and some people were moved to another boat.The minister then continued his inspection and while returning he reportedly was not sure about stepping on the water. Following this, a fisherman nearby with the minister carried him on his shoulder in ankle-deep water to land.In the video of the incident, which garnered large attention on social media platforms like Twitter, another man could be seen assisting the minister and the fisherman who carried him. Several news reports also said that the minister didn’t want his shoes to get wet.However, Radhakrishnan had denied such claims. He also said that he had not asked anyone to carry him and that the fisherman volunteered to do so because of his “affection” Puthiyathalaimurai TV quoted the minister as saying earlier on Thursday.Despite the minister’s explanation, the video received many angry reactions, especially on Twitter. Many people called out the minister for the ‘VVIP treatment.’Radhakrishnan, the current minister for the Tamil Nadu department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, won the Tiruchendur constituency in the Thoothukudi district in the recently concluded Tamil Nadu state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fisherman-carries-tn-minister-anitha-radhakrishnan-in-ankle-deep-water-video-stokes-controversy-101625756321544.html
08-07-2021||India||India, Iran express concern at deteriorating security in Afghanistan||India and Iran have expressed concern about the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and called for strengthening intra-Afghan dialogue to find a comprehensive political solution against the backdrop of the drawdown of US and international forces.The situation in Afghanistan figured in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif in Tehran on Wednesday. Jaishankar also met president-elect Ayatollah Sayyid Ebrahim Raisi when he made a transit halt in the Iranian capital while travelling to Russia.Jaishankar’s stopover in Tehran coincided with a meeting in Tehran between an Afghan government delegation and Taliban representatives that was arranged by the Iranian government. This was the first formal contact between the two sides since talks in Qatar stalled several months ago. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday the Indian and Iranian sides exchanged views on regional and global issues during Jaishankar’s technical halt in Tehran. “They also discussed the evolving situation in Afghanistan and expressed concerns over the deteriorating security there,” he said.A statement issued by Iran’s foreign ministry said the two sides “stressed the need to strengthen intra-Afghan dialogue in Afghanistan which leads to a comprehensive political solution”. The statement added that Jaishankar referred to the talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Tehran, and “thanked Iran for its efforts to bring the two sides closer to a comprehensive political solution”.Western security officials have said the Taliban have captured more than 100 districts in Afghanistan, while the insurgents claim to hold more than 200 districts in 34 provinces. Main cities and provincial capitals remain under the control of government forces.India, which has been keeping a wary eye on the fighting, has said its embassy in Kabul and consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif are currently functional. However, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that officials are closely tracking the extremely fluid situation and plans are being framed to cater for all contingencies, including the evacuation of Indian nationals and diplomats.Bagchi said, “We are carefully monitoring the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and its implications on the safety and security of Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Our response will be calibrated accordingly.”The spokesperson further said India and Iran also discussed joint connectivity initiatives in the region, such as the International North-South Transport Corridor and Chabahar port. Jaishankar “reiterated India’s interests in the region and support for efforts to maintain peace, security and stability”, he added.Jaishankar also handed over a congratulatory message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Iranian president-elect.Iran’s foreign ministry said Jaishankar and Zarif discussed the “prospects for the Vienna talks” on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the Iran nuclear deal, and cooperation in transport and communications, including the Chabahar port, to promote convergence in the region.Since the US pulled out of the JCPOA under the former Trump administration, India has consistently backed a negotiated settlement of the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-iran-express-concern-at-deteriorating-security-in-afghanistan-101625756485765.html

I have said that the elephants are now roaming across five revenue divisions of the state, so do you mean that the whole of Chhattisgarh should be declared as elephant reserve… No, this is not possible,” the senior minister said.The six-time lawmaker’s comments come days after health minister TS Singhdeo made it clear that he did not support limiting the elephant reserve to 450 square kilometres but wanted the government to stick to its plan of 2020 to set up the reserve across 1,995 sq km.The plan to set up the elephant reserve across 450 sq km was conceived by the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Raman Singh in 2005. In two years, it got the approval of the Union government also. But the project never took off.The Bhupesh Baghel government revived the plan after the change of guard in 2018, initially proposing to set up the elephant reserve in north Chhattisgarh across 450 sq km. In 2020, the Chhattisgarh government decided to expand the proposed reserve to 1,995 sq km and later, initiated another proposal to increase the size further to 3,720 sq km in mineral-rich north Chhattisgarh.A controversy erupted this week after health minister Singhdeo objected to the forest department’s pitch for going back to the original plan of 450 sq km citing objections from eight lawmakers including health minister Singhdeo. The minister was livid and sent a sharp rebuttal to the forest department’s claim. On Wednesday, another MLA Laljeet Rathia demanded that coal mining in the jungles of Hasdeo Aranya be stopped.On Thursday, Chhattisgarh agriculture and water resources minister Ravindra Chaubey said the divergence of opinion shouldn’t be seen as a conflict. “We cannot make such a big project over a suggestion of only one person hence suggestions are coming and it should not be seen as a conflict,” Chaubey said.For now, the government hasn’t spelt out its stand. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel held a review meeting with forest officials on Thursday but according to a senior official who was present, the elephant reserve wasn’t discussed.“The controversy over the elephant reserve was not discussed in the meeting. I believe that suggestions from some MLAs will be taken and finally, the decision will be taken by the cabinet meeting on expanding or reducing the size of the reserve,” the official said,Some of the controversy and the resistance to the reserve is linked to the direct impact that it would have on coal mines in north Chhattisgarh and the displacement of tribal villages.“If the elephant reserve is not to be made or extended at least the minister should announce that mining will not be allowed in this jungle,” said Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, recalling that Rahul Gandhi promised tribals in 2015 that no tribal will be removed from the jungle and Congress will not even do anything that increases the human-elephant conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jumbos-roam-everywhere-can-t-make-chhattisgarh-an-elephant-reserve-minister-101625756427344.html

Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar again made the request on Thursday. The only difference was that the request came along with a few announcements for the farm sector taken in the very first meeting of the new Cabinet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Agricultural Produce Market Committees will be able to use ₹1 lakh crore fund, the minister said, announcing the Cabinet decisions.PM Modi's new Cabinet clears new ₹23,132 crore package for Covid management"Whatever the government announces it has the will to implement them. In this year's Budget, it was announced that mandis will not be stopped. It was also announced that APMCs will be allowed to use the ₹1 lakh crore fund allocated under Aatmanirbhar Bharat to Farmers Infrastructure Fund. In today's Cabinet meeting, it has been decided to implement that announcement. All state-centre co-operatives, federations, and autonomous federations will be able to utilise this fund," the minister said adding that many people will benefit from the tweaks that the Cabinet has introduced as criteria to avail of this fund.On further talks between the government and the protesting unions, the minister said, "I have urged the unions several times that we are ready to talk on any issue except the repeal of the laws. The government has always been sensitive to the demands of the farmers. PM Modi government has the highest regard for farmers. We want farmers to prosper under this government. And the three laws are in that direction only. Farmers' union should now rethink the steps we are taking to strengthen APMCs.""Since the protest began, you are seeing what we doing on MSP. Farmers from those areas which are at the forefront of the protest are reaping the maximum benefits of our MSP scheme. So I would again urge the union leaders to resume talks," the minister said.In another agriculture-related decision, the Cabinet has decided to amend the Coconut Development Board Act, 1979 to make the post of chairman non-executive, as part of its efforts to boost production and productivity in this sector. The post of the chairman will be non-executive and there would be a CEO for executive powers. Those who have field experience will be appointed as non-executive chairman of the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apmcs-to-use-rs-1-lakh-crore-fund-says-tomar-urges-farmers-to-stop-stir-101625755448730.html
08-07-2021||India||Zika virus cases in Kerala: Symptoms, prevention and treatment of mosquito-borne disease||Amid efforts to contain coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Kerala on Thursday reported 13 cases of mosquito-borne Zika virus for the first time. All samples tested positive for the Zika virus were collected from the Thiruvananthapuram district and sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. The samples were collected for testing after a 24-year-old pregnant woman sought treatment late last month with symptoms like fever, headache, and red marks on the skin, according to Mathrubhumi news portal.Zika virus spreads mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito, which bites during the day. Aedes mosquitoes are the same that transmit dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus and can cause infants to be born with microcephaly and other congenital malformations.It is also associated with other complications of pregnancy including preterm birth and miscarriage. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), individuals infected with the Zika virus can also transmit the disease to their sex partners.Also Read | Kerala: Thiruvananthapuram district reports 13 cases of Zika virusSymptoms of Zika virus infectionThe symptoms for the mosquito-borne disease include mild and include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache. The incubation period of Zika virus disease is estimated to be 3–14 days and the symptoms typically last for 2–7 days. Most people with Zika virus infection do not develop symptoms, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Prevention and TreatmentThere is no specific treatment or vaccine for the Zika virus and the development of the Zika vaccine remains an active area of research. The UN health agency advises people with symptoms to get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and “treat pain and fever with common medicines.” Zika virus infection can only be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites. Special attention should be given to prevent mosquito bites among pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and young children, says WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zika-virus-cases-in-kerala-symptoms-prevention-and-treatment-of-mosquito-borne-disease-101625754202624.html

Besides, a low pressure is likely to form over Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coasts around July 11.Under the influence of these conditions, heavy rainfall along with thunderstorms are expected in several states of India.Here is a list of important IMD alerts for the next few days:1. Heavy rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over Goa and Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, coastal Andhra Pradesh, and Mahe in Puducherry between July 8 to 12.2. Owing to strengthening of southwest monsoon over Arabian Sea and the expected low pressure over Bay of Bengal, heavy rainfall along the west and east coasts of the country is likely to continue in the next five days.3. Northeast India will receive scattered to widespread rainfall from July 9 onwards. Furthermore, heavy rainfall is also very likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Punjab on July 11 and 12, and over west Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand between July 8 to 12.4. Between July 10 to 12, heavy rainfall activity is very likely over Haryana, east Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.5. Scattered to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is very likely over central Indian regions such as Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh in the next five days.6. The revival of southwest monsoon from today, however, will lead to the reduction in the intensity and distribution of rainfall over the northeastern states, including Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland from July 9 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-alerts-low-pressure-over-bay-of-bengal-to-bring-rainfall-in-these-states-101625753225025.html
08-07-2021||India||Amid cabinet reshuffle, health ministry again issues statement over vaccine shortage claims||Amid reports of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine shortage from various parts of the country, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has released another statement to clarify their stand, citing all states and Union territories (UTs) are informed well in advance about the number of vaccines to be sent to them.In the statement – second one in this week, the health ministry quashed media reports claiming there was 32 per cent less vaccination in the past one week as opposed to the previous one.“It is clarified that all states or UTs are being informed much in advance about the doses that will be available during the month of July 2021, including the supply to private hospitals. The states or UTs have been advised to plan their Covid-19 vaccination sessions based on the availability of the vaccines,” the statement read.The ministry also informed that after discussion with the vaccine manufacturers, it had already been conveyed to all states or UTs that they will receive “more than 12 crore doses” of Covid-19 vaccine in July.“Till today morning, over 2.19 crore doses have already been supplied to all states or UTs from July’s supply,” the statement added, reiterating that the health ministry is informing the states “adequately in advance” about the supply of vaccines being sent to them.According to the statement, states or UTs have also been asked to share their demand for vaccine doses with the Centre in case there is a need for more owing to increased coverage.The ministry’s statement on Wednesday comes a day after it struck down media reports claiming Covid-19 vaccine shortage led to the closure of some vaccination centres in Rajasthan.The Centre said Rajasthan had more than 1.69 lakh unutilised stock of vaccine jabs as of July 1, and under the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme, the state was given over 8.89 lakh doses of vaccine between July 1 and 6.“In addition, Rajasthan would receive an additional 3,951,000 doses during the remaining part of July 2021. Hence, in entire…July, Rajasthan will receive more than 5,090,000 vaccine doses,” the statement by the health ministry read.The Centre also clarified that Covid-19 vaccines being a biological product, its manufacturing process “takes time” and does not “translate into immediate supply”.Last week, owing to vaccine shortage in Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and state vaccination centres suspended their vaccination drive in Mumbai. On June 29, 3,87,644 Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered in the state, which dropped to 2,56,019 on June 30, and rose marginally to 2,72,714 on July 1.In Uttar Pradesh’s Noida, a government district hospital was flooded by beneficiaries, who flouted coronavirus norms, to get their jabs. Speaking to ANI, the chief medical superintendent said that the crowd was due to the hospital not getting enough vaccines for two days.On Thursday, in a veiled jibe at the appointment of Mansukh Mandaviya as the Union health minister amid cabinet reshuffle, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Does this mean no more vaccine shortage? #change”Notably, Dr Harsh Vardhan’s resignation came as shocking to many as he was widely applauded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his management of the ongoing coronavirus crisis in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-again-issues-statement-over-vaccine-shortage-claims-101625751681647.html

After a single injection, high neutralising antibody levels were also generated in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting strong potential for development as a booster vaccine.In a two-stage approach, the study will initially investigate the efficacy of a vaccine formulation targeting the original virus strain (D.614), while a second stage will evaluate a second formulation targeting the Beta variant (B.1.351).The design of the phase 3 study, conducted across a broad diversity of geographies, also allows evaluation of the efficacy of the candidate against a variety of circulating variants. Sanofi and GSK will also run clinical studies to assess the ability of the adjuvanted recombinant-protein Covid-19 vaccine candidate to generate a strong booster response regardless of the type of vaccine initially received.“India is participating in Sanofi Pasteur’s pivotal Phase 3 study… we should soon begin enrolment of study participants in the country,” said Annapurna Das, country head, Sanofi Pasteur India.“As the virus continues to evolve, we are anticipating what will be needed in the coming months and years, and accordingly, have adapted our vaccine development programme. We believe our Covid-19 adjuvanted, recombinant vaccine can make a significant contribution to the ongoing fight against Covid-19 and are committed to initiating our clinical programme in India, at the earliest.”As part of their partnership to develop the Covid-19 vaccine, Sanofi provides its recombinant antigen and GSK contributes its pandemic adjuvant, both established vaccine platforms that have proven successful against influenza.“As Covid-19 vaccination becomes available, study participants are encouraged to receive an approved Covid-19 vaccine during the study, if they wish to do so. As part of the study design, all participants including the control group will be offered the study vaccine as soon as it is determined to be safe and effective,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanofigsk-covid-vaccine-candidate-gets-nod-for-phase-3-trials-in-india-101625749046640.html

It’s been in my head for a long time. I am ready for the unfinished business. I have launched a crowdfunding campaign to arrange funds for a boat and several other associated expenses,” Tomy said over phone from Goa.Also Read | Living in isolation is hard... but it’s not without benefits, writes Abhilash TomyHe has launched a fundraising campaign on the Ketto crowdfunding platform, and fondly describes his supporters as “crew” who stand a chance “to be a part of a race around the world”.Tomy suffered a debilitating back injury on September 21, 2018, after rough seas and powerful winds in the southern Indian Ocean -- one of the remotest spots on Earth -- crippled his yacht, SV Thuriya. He was rescued 70 hours later.“I did not suffer from any post-traumatic stress disorder after the accident. There are no fear issues. I was doing fairly well until the storm took Thuriya down. I regard my participation in GGR-22 as a fitting tribute to the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence,” he said.Before the September 21 accident, Tomy was in the third position among 11 international participants and had sailed more than 10,500 nautical miles since the race began on July 1, 2018, from a port in France.Pause.

ShareGolden Globe Race 2022 - India Entry https://t.co/J2qkRjbQ0zThat was the 50th year of the race that commemorates Robin Knox-Johnston’s feat in 1968, with participants required to operate under the same conditions, even navigating using charts and the stars.“This time, it’s going to be even harder as participants will be given only 25 litres of fuel compared to 120 litres in 2018. I had kept all the fuel for power generation. This time, I will be dependent on sun and winds to charge batteries. The good thing is that participants will be allowed to carry cameras this time,” said Tomy, who took premature retirement from the navy in January 2021.Tomy became the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe on board his previous boat Mhadei -- solo, non-stop and unassisted -- in 2013. At the end of the five-month-long voyage, the President of India received Tomy and his boat at the Gateway of India in Mumbai. He was awarded India’s second-highest peace-time gallantry award, Kirti Chakra, for the achievement.Tomy has raised around ₹1.5 lakh on the crowdfunding platform over the last two days against a goal of ₹three crore. He launched the campaign on July 6.“It all boils down to how much money I can raise. There are costs associated with getting a boat, its refit, entry fee for the event, technical managers and other expenses. I have approached some corporate houses too but haven’t had any response so far,” he said.Tomy first announced that he would take part in GGR-22 at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit-2019. Speaking at the 17th edition of the summit, he gave details of the harrowing moments that abruptly ended his participation in GGR-18 but thrust him into the spotlight for surviving an ordeal that tested the limits of human endurance.“When the boat turned upright after the second knockdown, my wrist was stuck on wires connecting the mast. At one point, the strap of my watch broke, and I fell nine metres on a piece of aluminium called the boom. Then I fell to the deck on my back. I cleaned up some of the broken equipment, but half an hour later, I could not stand,” said Tomy of the moments that turned out to be the point when he broke his spine in four places.When a rescue team -- a coordinated effort of four nations -- finally reached him, his first thought was that he was hallucinating.“After 48 hours of sleep deprivation, hallucination is common. When I heard the knock, I thought this could be a hallucination and I must be prepared for that. But then they were there, real people — and I told them you are like angels to me,” he said at the summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/champion-sailor-abhilash-tomy-seeks-funds-for-race-that-almost-killed-him-101625747785446.html

It has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be used as a remedial medication.It is advisable to consult a medical practitioner before incorporating Guduchi in one's diet. pic.twitter.com/oW5YVaajj1Reports quoting Mumbai doctors said six patients with severe liver damage were found between September and December and each of them had a history of taking Giloy, which became popular as an immunity booster, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic.What does the study say?Aabha Nagral, the lead author of the study, published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, said biopsy result proved that the liver injury was linked to the herb Tinospora cordifolia which is known as Giloy.The consumption of Giloy reportedly shot up during the first wave of the pandemic as it is considered a natural immunity booster.What has the government said?The Ayush ministry on Wednesday said the study is misleading as the liver damage linked to Giloy was only reported in six patients. The researchers did not analyse the contents of the herb that was consumed by the patients, the ministry said. The ministry also said that the study did not clearly identify the herb and did not mention the dosage the patients took.What has Patanjali said?Giloy juice is available under many brands in India. Yoga guru Ramdev's Patanjali is one of them. Patanjali Ayurved managing director Acharya Balkrishna issued a statement and said the case study has been limited, not satisfactory. All six patients had pre-existing diseases and were taking other allopathic medicines. Dismissing the link between Giloy and liver diseases, Balkrishna said Giloy has been traditionally used in Ayurveda to treat liver disorders. "There is a wide variation in the quantity of the herb taken by be the patients, formulations employed and the duration of consumption. Consequently, the outcomes of the case series should not be attributed to the medicinal safe use of Giloy. Moreover, the investigators have neglected several crucial parameters such as previous medication history, identification of chemical constituents in the formulation as well in the damaged liver and blood," Balkrishna said.What should you do?The Ayush ministry has now said Giloy when taken regularly can do wonders to overall health. The ministry has now advised consulting a medical practitioner before incorporating Giloy in one's diet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/giloy-and-liver-damage-what-is-the-controversy-and-what-govt-says-101625746392253.html
08-07-2021||India||Row over parole to Abhaya case convicts, activist moves HC||Human rights activist Jomon Puthanpurakkal on Thursday moved the Kerala High Court questioning the parole granted to two life-term convicts in Sister Abhaya murder case, Father Thomas Kotoor and Sister Sefi. Both were released on 90-day special parole in May citing the recommendations of the committee constituted by the Supreme Court in view of the pandemic situation.The prisons department had released over 1500 prisoners, including two life-term convicts, as part of its efforts to decongest jails in the wake of the second Covid-19 wave. But the petitioner alleged that both were granted bail even before completing five months in jail and prisoners involved in offences up to 10 years were eligible for such parole.“The state government and jail department illegally granted parole to both after pressure from a section of the church. The government also ignored the fact that both had moved the higher court questioning the verdict and it refused to stay the verdict,” said Puthanpurakkal, who single-handedly fought the case for 27 years. He wanted the court to cancel their parole and send them back to jail. Later, the Kerala Legal Service Authority also made it clear it never commended parole for both. But the jail department said it had released many life convicts earlier also on parole and it had not shown any favouritism in the particular case. A Central Intelligence Bureau (CBI) court in Thiruvananthapuram had convicted the two last December, 28 years after the crime.Sister Abhaya (19), a plus-two student, was found dead in the well of the Pious X Convent in Kottayam in March 1992. It was initially dismissed as a suicide by the state police and crime branch, but the CBI later concluded that it was murder. In 2009 the CBI charge-sheeted Catholic priest Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sefi in the case. But the case again dragged after different petitions came up and it witnessed many twists and turns. During the long battle, the Kanaya Catholic church stood with the accused and even after the verdict it maintained that both were victimised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-parole-to-abhaya-case-convicts-activist-moves-hc-101625746287839.html
08-07-2021||India||Env minister Bhupender Yadav’s law expertise may help perform a balancing act||Several environmentalists and former bureaucrats are hopeful with Bhupender Yadav’s appointment as the new environment minister.Yadav, a lawyer and former national secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party, is also called the “Committee Man” because he has chaired several parliamentary committees on critical issues, such as the Rajya Sabha Select Committee on Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015 etc.More importantly, he has co-authored a book with environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta in 2011 on the legal aspects of forest conservation in India titled “Supreme Court on Forest Conservation.”On Thursday afternoon, when he took charge of the environment ministry, some officials felt that he came across as a more approachable minister. Yadav first participated in a plantation drive and then met senior officials from the ministry for a briefing on ongoing projects and issues.“I will not be able to answer questions today. All I can say is that I am grateful that I have been selected for this responsibility,” he told the media. “He seems soft spoken and more understanding of complex issues surrounding environment and climate change,” said a senior environment ministry official.Anup Nayak, former member secretary, national tiger conservation authority (NTCA) tweeted: “With the change in guard in the MoEFCC, let’s hope that the highhandedness and arrogance will give way to humility and rational decision-making benefitting forestry.”“It’s good that a lawyer has taken charge of the ministry. The ministry was circumventing the parliamentary process through various office memorandums and orders. I really hope he addresses that first. Given his background in law, he can help improve the functioning of the ministry. He has been associated with various environmental movements and has taken up environmental cases so he knows the issues very well. He has chaired the highest number of parliamentary committees also,” said Ritwick Dutta. Yadav has, for example, taken up issues related to Sethu Samudram project and Andaman and Nicobar in the SC, Dutta added.“I think we have reasons to maintain hope. He is an advocate with knowledge of environmental law and being one of the cadre he may listen to people’s voices. It’s an opportunity for the NDA to clean up the damage done through various dilutions in the past seven years,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, a Chhattisgarh-based lawyer who is working on cases related to Hasdeo Arand.The environment ministry has been facing public backlash on various controversial decisions in the past few years during Prakash Javadekar’s tenure. The draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification published on March 23, 2020, has been in the eye of a storm because of widespread opposition to certain clauses which can weaken the process of environmental appraisal of industries and infrastructure projects. The Delhi Police had sent a notice on July 8 last year to youth climate group Fridays for Future under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for sending multiple emails to Javadekar against draft EIA 2020. Delhi Police had later clarified that sending the notice was a clerical error. The ministry had received over 200,000 objections and comments to the draft EIA 2020 which are being assessed by a committee.Large infrastructure projects, such as townships planned in the fragile Andaman and Nicobar Islands; the Char Dham road project through Himalayas in Uttarakhand; hydropower projects in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley; mining in Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand forests are presently being considered by the ministry. The ministry has also started amending almost all environmental legislations to ensure they meet current requirements according to officials. The ministry’s wildlife division has prepared a Cabinet note to amend the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 which is yet to be cleared by the Cabinet; a similar note on the amendment to Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 has also been finalised after circulating it internally among ministries. Recently, the ministry has called for expression of interest from consulting agencies, firms, and joint venture consortiums to prepare a new draft amendment to the Indian Forest Act, 1927. A private law firm is preparing a draft environmental management act which will subsume the Air Act 1981, Water Act 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and serve as an overarching law particularly for all infrastructure and industry projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/env-minister-bhupender-yadav-s-law-expertise-may-help-perform-a-balancing-act-101625746045333.html

08-07-2021||India||Look forward to your leadership: Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla's tweet for Mansukh Mandaviya||Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the world's largest vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, on Thursday congratulated new health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and said his company is looking forward to the new health minister's leadership, navigating through the Covid-19 pandemic. "It was a pleasure interacting with you during your visit," Poonawalla wrote, posting a photo of Mansukh Madviya's recent visit to the Pune facility of vaccine firm.Congratulations Hon. @mansukhmandviya Ji. As our new Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare India and Chemical & Fertilizers, we look forward to your leadership as we navigate through this pandemic. It was a pleasure interacting with you during your visit to @SerumInstIndia. https://t.co/84jmzkrKxcIn a major reshuffle, several key ministers of the Modi Cabinet, including former health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, were dropped on Wednesday as new ministers took their oath on the same day. The axing of Dr Harsh Vardhan has triggered a debate whether the move is an indirect statement on the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Congress criticised the decision and said the former health minister has been made a scapegoat. Replacing Dr Harsh Vardhan with Mansukh Mandaviya who was in charge of the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers and the ministry of ports and shipping and waterways has also triggered controversies as old tweets purportedly by the minister have now been dug out on social media platforms.Also Read: Cabinet reshuffle | Here’s what new ministers said after PM Modi’s resetHaving taken charge amid the ongoing second wave and the looming threats of a third wave of the pandemic, Mansukh Mandaviya's primary challenge will be to pace up vaccination across the country. As India has largely been dependant on Covishield, the vaccine manufactured by Adar Poonawalla's Serum Institute of India, continuous coordination with the vaccine manufacturer will be crucial.Two days before the Cabinet was reshuffled, Mansukh Mandaviya, as evident from Serum CEO's tweet, visited the Pune facility of Serum and held a detailed discussion with Adar Poonawalla to understand the challenges of vaccine production.Pune's Serum Institute has been supplying Covishield at a discounted price to the government since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January. While Serum is looking at working on its new Covid-19 vaccine Covavax, it is also expected to accelerate vaccine production by several notches.With former health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan too, Serum shared a close relationship. Before the Covid-19 pamdemic, in 2019, Harsh Vardhan had inaugurated Serum Instiute of India's Manjri plant. In 2020, Dr Vardhan inaugurated the country's first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, developed by Serum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/look-forward-to-your-leadership-serum-ceo-adar-poonawalla-s-tweet-for-mansukh-mandaviya-101625742362203.html
08-07-2021||India||‘Peace and Harmony Committee can summon FB but not recommend prosecution’: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by Facebook India vice president Ajit Mohan challenging the summons issued to the company by the Peace and Harmony Committee of the Delhi Legislative Assembly in connection with the Delhi riots in February last year.A three-judge bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said that the Committee was well within its power to issue summons for appearance to Facebook but it certainly did not have the legislative mandate to recommend action in case of persons against whom a prima facie case is made out. Such a term of reference would fall within the domain of law and order and police, which are subjects on which the Delhi Assembly cannot legislate.The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said that it was this term of reference that created a legitimate apprehension in the mind of the petitioner (Mohan) that Facebook is sought to be made an accused. The Court also said that ‘Peace’ and ‘Harmony’ are subjects beyond law and order, yet care must be taken by the Committee in framing the terms of reference so that it does not traverse the excluded territories (law and order, police).It was on September 23, 2020 when Facebook India vice-president Ajit Mohan filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the Peace and Harmony Committee of the Delhi Assembly seeking his presence before the panel.The Court had protected Mohan against any coercive action and during the course of arguments wished to know if the Assembly intended the personal appearance of Mohan alone or anybody from the company. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for Mohan, claimed that as an intermediary for the exchange of information on his platform, he cannot be compelled to come and state on oath before a non-statutory Committee.For the Assembly, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi had advanced arguments and said that the notice never required Mohan to depose but any senior, responsible person from the company capable of assisting the Committee. It was pursuant to this, a fresh notice was issued to Facebook India by the Delhi Legislative Assembly in February 2021, this time asking a senior, responsible officer from the company to appear before the Peace and Harmony Committee. This notice was taken on record by the Court. The case was dealt with on three fronts by the court – the issue of legislative privileges, the question of free speech and expression raised by Mohan, and the legislative competence of the Committee.The Delhi Assembly had relied on various entries in the state list and concurrent list, by which the Delhi Assembly derived its power to discuss and debate on the issue in question. It cited entry 1 in the state list dealing with public order, which is distinct from law and order and entry 1 in concurrent list which gives sweeping power to state assemblies to legislate on the subject ‘criminal law’. Further, entry 39 in state list that gave assemblies power to enforce the attendance of witnesses for purpose of recording statements was also relied upon. In addition, he said that the issue raised a question of the legislative dignity of the Delhi Assembly.Even the Peace and Harmony Committee joined as a party to the proceedings and was represented by senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan. The committee informed the Court that it had received the mandate to suggest measures to eliminate factors and situations having the potential to disturb communal harmony in the capital and to establish harmony among different religious or linguistic groups.The Court reserved orders on the petition on February 24 this year but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the decision was delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-and-harmony-committee-can-summon-fb-but-not-recommend-prosecution-sc-101625740405000.html

She joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1996 and served as a member of the state legislative council before getting elected as a lawmaker in 2008.A postgraduate in sociology, Karandlaje, who has been named as Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers welfare, is considered to be a close aide to Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa.Also Watch | What drove Modi Cabinet reboot: Polls, appeasement or governance?Karandlaje has been known for her controversial statements. In July 2017, she submitted a list to the central government alleging 23 Hindus were “murdered” in Karnataka since 2015 when Congress was in power in the state. It later emerged that the list included even those who died by suicide. In December 2017, she was booked for inflammatory tweets related to the alleged rape and murder of a Dalit girl. When a 19-year-old man died under mysterious circumstances in Honnavar in Uttara Kannada, Karandlaje claimed that he was tortured by “Jihadis”.

08-07-2021||India||'No more vaccine shortage?': Rahul Gandhi's dig as Mansukh Mandaviya replaces Harsh Vardhan as health minister||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi once again took a dig at the alleged deficiency of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India, at a time when Mansukh Mandaviya replaces Dr Harsh Vardhan as the health minister of the country. Mandaviya took charge of the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rejig of the Union cabinet.The change in the portfolio comes at a crucial juncture when India is in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic, with reports of vaccine shortages plaguing various parts of the country."Does this mean no more vaccine shortage?" the Congress leader asked, popping his post with the hashtag "#change". Rahul Gandhi’s veiled jibe at the cabinet reshuffle seems to have pointed out a question: If the new health minister would respond to the issue of vaccine deficiency, or if he would follow in the footsteps of his predecessor who frequently hit back against critiques over the same.Does this mean no more vaccine shortage?#ChangeThe former Congress president has been a harsh critic of the Centre’s vaccination policy for months. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on numerous counts, to end the 'shortage' of vaccine doses in the country, a claim that the BJP-led government debunked as a “lie”.Earlier on several occasions, Gandhi took potshots at the Centre’s vaccination policy, which he has described as “lacking”. Just last week, the Congress leader had questioned the government on vaccine availability and asked, "It's July already, yet there are no vaccines. Where are the vaccines?"Hitting back at Gandhi, the then health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan had, in turn, asked, "What is Rahul Gandhi's problem? Does he not read? Does he not understand?" The former minister had added that "facts" regarding vaccine availability have been put out by the government for the month of July. "There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance," he remarked, adding that Congress must think about a "leadership overhaul".Last Saturday, Rahul Gandhi shared a cumulative vaccination tracker and pointed out that India's actual Covid-19 vaccination rate is 27% below the government's target rate to avoid a potential third wave of the pandemic.Meanwhile, there have been reports of vaccine shortages across the country. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday that the national capital has run out of vaccines once again and urged the Centre to provide vaccines as per the requirement to the people of Delhi.Last week, the Odisha government halted the vaccination drive in 16 of its districts owing to a "shortage" of Covishield doses. Meanwhile, the Himata Biswa Sarma-led Assam government said that it could only vaccinate a population 45% less than the set target, due to a massive shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.In Maharashtra, the administration suspended the vaccination drive across 281 civic-run centers and 20 government-run centers in Mumbai last week due to a shortage of stocks. Several other states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, etc have also said that they are facing a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-more-vaccine-shortage-rahul-gandhi-s-dig-as-mansukh-mandaviya-replaces-harsh-vardhan-as-health-minister-101625730596818.html

Days after shocking pictures from Manali showed crowded streets and zero regard to social distancing norms, now tourists have gathered in Uttarakhand.Videos have emerged on social media which show tourists bathing at Mussoorie's famous Kempty Falls. Social distancing went for a toss as people gathered at the popular tourist spot; not even a single person was seen wearing a mask in the videos.#infobug07july21With no #masks in sight, hundreds of tourists appeared to be #vacationing their '#pandemic' troubles away at the Kempty falls in #Mussoorie.#repost #viral #Internet pic.twitter.com/3lnjLVG2gKHotels were full and there were long queues of vehicles on the streets as people escaped to the hills in order to beat the summer heat. Stunned by the videos, many took jibes at the carelessness of the public, saying that if citizens don’t learn their lessons, the third wave of Covid-19 is not far away.Popular hill stations like Shimla, Mussoorie, Kufri, Narkanda, Dalhousie and Manali, are witnessing the arrival of tourists in large numbers, who are looking to get rid of the scorching heat in the northern plains. Due to the dip in Covid-19 cases, states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have relaxed the restrictions which has led to an influx of the people from other states. A few days ago, pictures of crowded streets in Manali had gone viral.The increase in the number of tourists has also posed a challenge to the state government to ensure adhering of Covid-19 norms by the visitors amid fears of an impending third wave of coronavirus infections.The Union health ministry earlier on Tuesday expressed concern over people flocking to hill stations and markets without following Covid-19-appropriate behaviours and warned that such laxity can nullify the gains made in the management of the pandemic so far."People are indulging in revenge travel with restrictions being lifted. They need to understand that the virus and the disease is still here. People roaming in hill stations and markets without maintaining physical distance and not wearing masks can nullify the gains made in the management of the pandemic so far," joint secretary in the health ministry Lav Agarwal said as he stressed on following Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flouting-covid-19-rules-maskless-tourists-throng-mussoorie-s-kempty-falls-101625727416130.html
08-07-2021||India||Ministry of cooperation is a political game changer for 2024||With Union home minister Amit Shah taking charge of the newly created ministry of cooperation, the writing is on the wall. Though the decision taken in the run-up to 2024 general elections didn’t not exactly rule the airwaves but is aimed at reviving the cooperatives in the country, and stopping the exploitation of agriculturists by the middlemen in India’ rural areas.Interestingly, the new ministry was also created in the backdrop of ongoing farmer protests against the new farm laws. The movement has now significant political overtones and are aimed at consolidating the opposition against the BJP in poll bound states of Punjab, Uttarakhand and UP in 2022.“This ministry will provide a separate administrative, legal and policy framework for strengthening the cooperative movement in the country.It will help deepen cooperatives as a true people-based movement reaching upto the grassroots,” the cabinet secretariat said in a 6 July statement.India has a history of successful cooperative movements. A case in point being Amul that was founded in 1946.“The exploitative trade practices followed by the local trade cartel triggered off the cooperative movement. Angered by unfair and manipulative practices followed by the trade, the farmers of the district approached the great Indian patriot Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for a solution. He advised them to get rid of the middlemen and form their own co-operative, which would have procurement, processing and marketing under their control,” according to information available on Amul website.The model has been very successful with the revenue of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) that markets dairy products under Amul brand growing to Rs39,200 crore.A successful agriculture and livestock cooperative movement in other parts of country after new farm laws will not only increase the income of farmers and productivity of land but also add to the nation’s growth in pure GDP terms.Facing farm protests, the government has been working on this new playbook for some time now. Given the fact that Amit Shah is decisive and hard taskmaster, the new ministry will take off before the 2024 general elections and dampen the already dwindling support to the anti-famer laws agitation.“The Government is committed to the development of Multi-State Cooperatives and will provide all support to them. To further streamline the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ for Cooperatives, I propose to set up a separate Administrative Structure for them,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech earlier this year.“In a historic move, a separate ‘Ministry of Co-operation’ has been created by the Modi Government for realizing the vision of ‘Sahkar se Samriddhi’. In our country, a Co-operative based economic development model is very relevant where each member works with a spirit of responsibility,” the cabinet secretariat' statement said and added, “The Ministry will work to streamline processes for ‘Ease of doing business’ for co-operatives and enable development of Multi-State Co-operatives (MSCS).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministry-of-cooperation-is-a-political-game-changer-for-2024-101625731239268.html

Paswan was speaking in Samastipur, where he has made a stop during the yatra.“I never craved for a ministerial berth, but I still don’t know from which party’s quota my uncle Pashu Pati Kumar Paras has been inducted in the Cabinet.

If anyone is made minister as an independent or from some other party, I have no issue, as it is entirely the prerogative of the Prime Minister. But as far as the LJP is concerned, the party Constitution allows me to be the president and the matter is before the Election Commission (EC) as well as the Lok Sabha Speaker,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-sacrificed-his-party-leaders-to-make-pashupati-a-minister-chirag-paswan-101625724385806.html

08-07-2021||India||Former IAS officer and engineer from Odisha get key portfolios in Cabinet||Ashwini Vaishnaw, a bureaucrat-turned-politician who was inducted on Wednesday into the Union Cabinet in charge of railways, electronics, and information technology, is known as a backroom boy. A 1994 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, he first came into prominence in June 2019 when the ruling Biju Janata Dal in Odisha and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supported his candidature in Rajya Sabha polls.Born in Jodhpur, Vaishnaw, 50, graduated from Rajasthan’s Jai Narain Vyas University in 1992 with a gold medal in electronics and communications engineering. Two years later, he joined the IAS. His work was recognised when days before the super cyclone hit Odisha in 1999, Vaishnaw tracked a US Navy website to know its path to keep top officials informed about it and help them deal better with the natural disaster. His timely evacuation of 10,000 people in Balasore despite a lack of shelters also earned him much acclaim.Also Watch | What drove Modi Cabinet reboot: Polls, appeasement or governance?Former Odisha chief secretary Sahadev Sahoo, who worked with Vaishnaw, described the minister as meticulous. “He was a copybook officer, never kept work pending. (He) talks little and did not belong to any faction in bureaucracy. Though he stayed mostly outside Odisha, his Odia speaking skills are proof of his eagerness to learn,” said Sahoo.Vaishnaw worked in Odisha till 2003 when he joined Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s office as deputy secretary. In 2006, he became the deputy chairman of Mormugao Port Trust, where he worked for two years before pursuing a Master of Business Administration course from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He later quit IAS and worked in private companies until 2012. He was in Gujarat to set up two components manufacturing units of automobile companies Maruti and Honda in 2012. Vaishnaw lived in a container for seven months so that the work could be finished in record time.Sudhanshu Mani, former Integral Coach Factory general manager, said the railway ministry’s functioning will improve under Vaishnaw, a technocrat. “I had the fortune to know him and see him work closely as a senior executive of GE Transportation and Siemens. He knows Indian Railways in and out and I could see that he was cut out for much higher things. Indian Railways are in for a genuine makeover,” Mani tweeted.Bishweswar Tudu, the other new minister from Odisha in the council of ministers, is also a former government servant. He took voluntary retirement to successfully contest the 2019 national polls from the tribal-dominated Mayurbhanj. Tudu has been associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram. He was an engineer in the Odisha water resources department before he quit in 2019. A Santhal tribal, Tudu’s inclusion is also seen as part of an attempt to reach out to the tribal community in Odisha ahead of next year’s panchayat polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-ias-officer-and-engineer-from-odisha-get-key-portfolios-in-union-council-101625722344115.html

She was the Jharkhand unit chief of Lalu Prasad Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) when she defected to the BJP and went on to win the Lok Sabha election from Koderma. Devi defeated former chief minister Babulal Marandi, a joint candidate of the United Progressive Alliance, by around 450,000 votes.Devi was the vice president of the BJP’s Jharkhand unit before her elevation as the national vice-president. She was also named as BJP’s Haryana co-in charge. Devi is the second Union minister from Jharkhand apart from Arjun Munda. Another Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is also a member of Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand.Also Read | Sonowal’s second stint in Delhi ends speculation about his future roleDevi, who was born into a Bengali-speaking family in Dumka, has a master’s from Ranchi University. She joined politics after the death of her husband and RJD legislator Ramesh Yadav. She won a state assembly by-poll in 1998 and became a minister in the RJD government of undivided Bihar. She was re-elected as an assembly member in 2000, 2005, and 2009. She became a minister in Jharkhand in 2013 before losing assembly polls a year later. Devi has emerged as the Other Backward Class (OBC) face of the BJP especially after the BJP’s loss in the 2019 assembly polls under Raghubar Das’s leadership.BJP insiders said the elevation of Devi and her rapid rise in the BJP indicates the central leadership is banking on her in Jharkhand. “Belonging to a Yadav family, Annapurna Devi could play a crucial role in wooing the OBC vote bank, especially in the districts bordering Bihar that have a large number of Yadav voters. She could also play a crucial role in wooing Bengali-speaking voters in Santhal areas bordering Bengal,” said a Jharkhand BJP leader, who did not want to be named.A ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader acknowledged Devi’s impact in the Dumka Lok Sabha election in 2019. “... our leader Shibu Soren lost. Though she was new to the BJP, she campaigned in the Masiliya area and actually made an impact among the Bengali-speaking population. Though she did not speak much against our leader, her presence made a difference in the result,” said the leader on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/annapurna-devi-s-elevation-marks-her-growing-stature-in-bjp-101625720123955.html

His former state Cabinet colleague Himanta Biswa Sarma succeeded Sonowal, 58, as the chief minister in May.Sarma was among those who congratulated Sonowal over his induction. “We are grateful to you for steering so successfully for five years. Your enormous administrative experience and acumen shall immensely benefit the government,” Sarma tweeted on Wednesday.This will be Sonowal’s second stint in the Union ministry. He was the minister of state (independent charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports in the first government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi from 2014 to 2016. He returned to Assam to head the first BJP-led coalition government in the state in 2016.Also Read | PM Modi’s Cabinet reshuffle: Scindia, Puri, Sonowal among bigwigs inductedSonowal, who will now be in charge of the ministries of Ports, Shipping, Waterways as well as the Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-rigpa, and Homeopathy, is known as jatiya nayak (hero of the community) for his role in Supreme Court’s scrapping of Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act in 2005. He petitioned the top court against the law, which was applicable only to Assam. The law shifted the onus of proving one is an undocumented immigrant on the accuser and police and not the suspected foreigner. In the Foreigners Act, applicable across India, the onus of proving one‘s citizenship lies on the person suspected to be an undocumented immigrant.A graduate in arts, law, communication, and journalism from Dibrugarh and Gauhati universities, Sonowal headed the All-Assam Students Union from 1992 to 1999. He was the chairman of the North-East Students Union from 1994 to 2004 before he joined Asom Gana Parishad and went on to become a Lok Sabha member.Sonowal, who was first elected to the state assembly in 2001, joined the BJP in 2011 and quickly rose to become the party’s state chief the next year.

He is known for his physical fitness and for being very particular about his health.Sonowal, who was elected from the Majuli assembly seat in Assam this year, is expected to get the Rajya Sabha seat Biswajit Daimary vacated this year.

08-07-2021||India||Nishank resigned as education minister just ahead of NEP completing a year||Ramesh Pokhriyal stepping down as education minister on Wednesday came just ahead of the Modi government completing a year of its biggest education reform, the National Education Policy (NEP), this month. The 61-year-old former chief minister of Uttarakhand officially cited ill-health for his resignation, as he had spent over a month at the All India Institute of Medical sciences(AIIMS) recovering from coronavirus disease.“He has not been well at all,” said a staff member in his office.Popularly known as Nishank, a pseudonym he used as a poet, he took charge of the crucial education ministry in the second term of the Modi government in 2019. Right from the start, the choice was considered unusual because Nishank was known more for his belief in astrology and in championing the use of Sanskrit in the development of computers. However, HT has learnt that the immediate reason for his exit is that the minister was seen as too slow to take decisions which would help the government implement the NEP. Even the Sangh, which refused to comment, had one of its affiliates talk about the need to speed up its implementation.Also Read | Dharmendra Pradhan is the new Education Minister“The education policy was good, and the work done by them---but the implementation needs to be done at a great pace. NEP talks about great many changes needed at Central and government levels, work is needed on that. It will be a year since the policy was introduced; there needs to be a review,” said Atul Kothari of Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas, an RSS affiliate body.NEP, which was introduced last year by the Modi government, may have been under Nishank’s watch, but was mostly devised by domain experts and a team of bureaucrats. It has been hailed by educationists and even opposition leaders with concepts like pre-school education and using mother tongue as a mode of instruction for students up to Class 5.“It’s a great document. However, it also requires a lot of work because how are you going to get the human resource to teach pre-school children? You can’t get anganwadi workers to do this,” said a former education secretary who requested anonymity. “Also in the last few years, the allocation for education has also been going down.”Another education official said that Nishank was also perceived as someone who was not quick to take decisions. For instance, one major problem that is yet to be sorted by the government is a common entrance exam for Delhi University. Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) is used by 15 central universities and the government is keen that Delhi university adopt it too, but that clearance is yet to come. This isn’t the only one and according to one official, there is a long list of pending decisions at the minister’s office. Other than that, there are a whole host of universities across the country that are operating without a Vice-Chancellor.“Basically, the government has gone for an image makeover. Nishank invited controversy,” said a senior bureaucrat. Soon after he became education minister in 2019, Nishank went to the IIT Bombay convocation and claimed that NASA had acknowledged Sanskrit’s potential as a scientific language. It turned out to be a hoax that was viral on the internet. The new education minister Dharmendra Pradhan is expected to be at the IIT directors’ meeting as one of his first appointments of his new assignment on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nishank-resigned-as-education-minister-just-ahead-of-nep-completing-a-year-101625716103969.html

In a first, the state detected two cases of the Delta plus Covid-19 variant from Gorakhpur and Deoria. One of the patients has died, the publication confirmed, adding that the news has generated a considerable stir in the region.Also Read | Explained: Delta Plus variant symptoms and how to protect yourselfThe Union health ministry said on Wednesday that 'variants of concern' of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have been detected in as many as 174 districts across 35 states and Union territories. The highest number of these cases have been from Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Telangana, West Bengal, and Gujarat, according to the health ministry.The Delta plus Covid-19 variant in eastern UP was detected through samples of Covid-19 patients earlier sent for genome sequencing to the Council of Scientific Industrial Research (CSIR) at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi. The reports of the genome sequencing test were received last Tuesday, where it was seen that over 80% of the samples had tested positive for the Delta variant -- or B.1.617.2 -- while around 6% detected the alpha variant, first detected in the UK.Also Read | Contact tracing in Delta variants a challenge: KarnatakaOnly two samples tested positive for the Delta plus variant, stirring up panic among the locals.

Of these two victims, the elderly victim, who had tested positive on May 17, passed away during the course of receiving treatment.The news has generated considerable excitement in the region because it is said that the Delta plus Covid-19 variant may drive a potential third wave of the pandemic in India. The Delta variant was the key driver behind the last wave, which was almost twice as deadly as the first. About 20,000 people were found infected by the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, while the second wave hit around 36,000 people in India, reports said. There was a scramble for government beds, medical oxygen, ventilators, and other pieces of equipment across the country, even while the death toll and infections continued to rise exponentially.The rate of infection was so fast during the second wave that on average, around 1000 people were reported to be getting infected by Covid-19 daily during the months of April and May, while the 'real' death toll was believed to be far beyond the official tally. Now that the second wave of the pandemic is finally showing signs of receding, news of a potential third wave, driven by the Delta plus variant, has pushed the country to a frenzy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-latest-to-report-delta-plus-cases-variants-of-concern-found-in-174-districts-101625711002100.html

The launch is expected to take place at a private function in Hyderabad, the capital city that Andhra Pradesh and Telangana share. Sharmila will also release the party's agenda and a flag at the event, which is expected to be a low-key affair due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The day of the launch coincides with the birth anniversary of S Rajasekhara Reddy, former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh and father of Jagan Mohan and Sharmila.Along with party loyalists, mother YS Vijyamma is expected to be present at the launch event scheduled for 3pm, multiple media reports said.Sharmila had announced the launch of her party in April. Speaking then, Sharmila said she wants to walk on the same path as YSR, hence she is stepping into politics for the first time. "Exactly, on April 9, 18 years back from Chevella, YS Rajasekhara Reddy began his Pada Yatra and he walked for 22 kilometres each day. Listening to the problems of the people, YSR has walked through places and that is the inception of various schemes that were later brought in by YSR." She also said that she wants to walk on the same path as YSR, hence she is stepping into politics for the first time.Noting that the state lacks an opposition, Sharmila also said that she aims to "bring back the same reign of YSR."The Assembly polls for 119 seats in Telangana state are scheduled to be held in 2023. In the 2018 Assembly polls, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi under the leadership of K Chandrashekar Rao emerged victorious, securing 88 seats in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-jagan-mohan-reddy-s-sister-ys-sharmila-to-launch-political-party-101625713083208.html

Thackeray also asked his officials to spread awareness about vaccination among the masses and not let their guard down due to the decline in the number of cases.Thackeray, while addressing the collectors and commissioners of various districts, asked them to hold dialogues with the various industrialists in their districts to keep their units running in case of a third wave. “Those who are able to house their workers in their premises itself should be encouraged and if that is not possible, they should be accommodated in the nearby premises. The officials should offer all possible help to them,” said Thackeray.Also Read | Schools in no-Covid zones in Maharashtra can reopen for classes 8 to 12 starting July 15 “The two waves were very challenging and we were able to restart the economic activities to some extent. However, in view of the third wave, it was necessary to maintain the momentum of the economic activities and hence the movement of the workers needs to be curtailed,” said Thackeray.Currently, an overwhelming number of businesses are facing huge losses due to the restrictive business timings and lack of sales. The Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), the apex body of traders in the manufacturing and retail sector, welcomed the move, but wanted the government to ease current restrictions. “It is a good move, but we need to assess how much it will succeed. However, the state needs to extend timings of the retail shops as the current one, of 7am to 4pm, is not enough. They should also allow common people to travel on trains,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-9-558-fresh-covid-cases-cm-calls-for-vaccine-awareness-101625712503655.html

The study also included checking the biological characteristics of the river.Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were badly hit when the second wave of coronavirus swept the nation. There was also a fear whether the bodies, possibly of Covid-19 infected patients, had led to the contamination of the river water which is a major source of drinking for the population in the districts along it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-traces-of-coronavirus-in-ganga-study-finds-report-101625710296476.html

The notices were issued in a case related to last year's riots in northeast Delhi.The plea was filed by vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan, Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd and Facebook Inc. It challenges the September 10 and 18 last year notices issued by the committee that sought Mohan's presence as a witness before the panel which is probing the Delhi riots in February and Facebook's role in the spread of alleged hate speeches.The verdict in the case was reserved by a bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy on February 24.During the arguments before the apex court, Mohan’s counsel had said that “right to silence” is a virtue in present “noisy times”. The counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of the Delhi assembly, saying it has no legislative power to set up a panel to examine the issue of peace and harmony.Senior advocate Harish Salve is representing Facebook official in the top court. He also pointed out that setting up the peace panel was not the core function of the Delhi assembly as the law and order issue fell under the domain of the Centre in the national capital.Senior advocate AM Singhvi who was representing the panel of the assembly has responded to this saying that the assembly has the power to summon.In an affidavit, the Delhi assembly also clarified that Mohan has not been issued any summons for breach of privilege.

On June 6, the high court pulled up the micro-blogging company over the non-compliance of the new guidelines, which mandates every social media company in the country to have a resident grievance officer (RGO), chief compliance officer, and nodal contact person. As of Tuesday's hearing, the company didn't have either of the officers.During the proceedings, Twitter had informed the court that it was in the process of doing so.Hearing the case against Twitter, Justice Rekha Palli also took note of the fact the court was not informed about the earlier interim appointment of the resident grievance officer (RGO). She said that it has misled the court by giving a wrong impression by not informing that the officer was on an interim basis."If he went away on June 21, the least Twitter could do was to appoint another officer in these 15 days since you knew that this matter was coming up for hearing on July 6. We are considered with the compliance. How long does your process take? If Twitter thinks it can take as long as it wants in my country, I will not allow that," the judge had said.On June 27, the company's interim resident grievance officer in India, Dharmendra Chatur, resigned amid differences with the central government over the new norms. Twitter then appointed US national Jeremy Kessel in the role, making the company in violation of the rules.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were announced on February 25. Social media companies operating in India, including Twitter, were given time till May 25 to comply with these. On July 5, the central government filed an affidavit in the Delhi high court, accusing the social media giant of failing to comply with the IT rules, which it described as the "law of the land."The petition against the San Francisco-headquartered company was filed in the Delhi high court on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitters-deadline-to-inform-delhi-high-court-about-resident-grievance-officer-ends-today-101625706252002.html

08-07-2021||India||Modi's new cabinet: Blend of youth, skills, social engineering||The new Union council of ministers sworn in on Wednesday has more representation from socially and economically backward communities, women and people with administrative and legislative experience. The new team is being built with an eye on the forthcoming state elections and in line with the party’s outreach towards the socially and economically deprived sections, part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) social engineering strategy.On Wednesday, 43 ministers were sworn in. Of these, 36 are new to the council of ministers; seven are ministers of state (including some ministers of state with independent charge) that have been promoted. Of the 43, seven are women and all are new to the council.The changes, and the resignation of 12 ministers from the council, takes the overall size of the new council of ministers to 77, excluding the prime minister. Of this, 11 are women, including two cabinet ministers (finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and women and child development minister Smriti Irani).
08-07-2021||India||Two voices of govt Prasad, Javadekar left out in reshuffle||Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar, both senior ministers who emerged as voices of the government over the past seven years – the two addressed more press briefings than most other ministers put together – have been dropped from the council of ministers.Both ministers were at the forefront of the ongoing information (or narrative) wars – Prasad, with technology platforms that enjoyed as much clout and influence as media companies, and Javadekar with digital media companies – but the reasons for their exits wasn’t immediately clear. Nor was it immediately known whether the two would be inducted in senior roles in the party organisation to help the Bharatiya Janata Party prepare for five key elections next year (including Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat).It was initially believed that Prasad and Javadekar, both of whom oversee two important portfolios each, would be divested of one – Prasad was law and information technology (IT) minister, and Javadekar, environment and information and broadcasting (I&B) minister – but when Rashtrapati Bhavan sent out a list of ministers whose resignations had been accepted by the President, their names were on it.Neither Prasad nor Javadekar were immediately available for comments on the development.There is some speculation that both, or at least one of them could find space in the BJP’s parliamentary board, which currently has five vacancies, but there was no confirmation of this from the party.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said it is solely the PM’s prerogative to choose the council of ministers. “The karyakartas of the party are committed towards working for the welfare of the people, either through the organisation or wherever the party assigns them. Every appointment has to be seen in that context,” Kohli said.Still, with the two ministers who emerged its voices exiting, the government will now have new ones – which is perhaps in keeping with the completely new look it now has after the reshuffle, even with clarity on portfolios likely to emerge only late Wednesday or on Thursday.Sanjay Kumar, co-director of Lokniti, Centre for Study of Developing Societies, said, “I don’t think there is an issue of prominent voices being dropped. If you drop heavyweights from the Cabinet and replace them with newer ones, it will increase the PM’s grip on the Cabinet. Dropping Prasad seems to be a product of the bad press that the government was getting. You can add Harsh Vardhan to this list.”“The dropping of three key ministers shows an attempt to regain the image the PM had globally. Nationally, Modi is also trying to send out the message that if you are the minister you have to work for the people of the country. Dropping Vardhan is a clear message that he couldn’t handle the pandemic. Prasad’s fight with Twitter also was backfiring nationally. People started thinking that real issues are getting sidelined. In order to rebuild the image of the government, these names have been dropped,” he said.Prasad and Javadekar were at the forefront of comprehensive new social media guidelines rolled out in February that demanded extra due diligence from significant social media intermediaries, such as Facebook and Twitter. The rules also brought digital news media outlets, including websites of traditional news media platforms, and over-the-top content providers such as Netflix and Amazon, under the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.The move saw push back from many stakeholders, with eight different legal challenges being lodged in various high courts. Though some intermediaries complied with the guidelines, the government has been locked in an escalating conflict with Twitter.Prasad’s ministry threatened Twitter with the loss of safe harbour, which is provided to intermediaries under the IT Act. Twitter refused to cede space on the implementation of its policies, as it said it was defending free speech. Earlier this week, the ministry told the Delhi high court that Twitter has lost its legal shield from prosecution because it had not complied with the guidelines.Javadekar also courted controversy after many news organisations wrote to him seeking exemption from the guidelines, especially section 69(A) that allowed the government to order content to be taken down.Javadekar was also in charge of shaping public opinion in favour of the government as it struggled to cope with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw health infrastructure crumble and infection rates surge.His ministry also recently introduced an amendment to the cinematograph act, which allows the government to ask the censor board to reconsider a film on the grounds of public order, sovereignty, integrity of India and relationship with foreign states. The amendment triggered criticism as many filmmakers argued that it would result in a loss of freedom of creative expression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-voices-of-govt-prasad-javadekar-left-out-in-reshuffle-101625696387324.html
08-07-2021||India||Booster shot for Modi 2.0||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inducted 36 new faces into his council of ministers, promoted seven junior ministers (to independent or Cabinet roles), and dropped 12 ministers, including the ministers of health, education, information technology, law, environment and information and broadcasting, in his biggest reshuffle ever in the past seven years, and the first major one of his second term.In the new 77-member council, only 30 Cabinet ministers and two ministers of state with independent charge will manage all Union ministries as the government trained its focus on enhancing synergies between departments.The changes seem to have been motivated by performance (or lack of it); the need to accommodate allies, find room for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who were asked to sacrifice regional aspirations, and include lateral entrants; and an eye on coming elections in major states. Of the 36 new ministers, three are from allies of the BJP.“I congratulate all the colleagues who have taken oath today and wish them the very best for their ministerial tenure. We will continue working to fulfil aspirations of the people and build a strong and prosperous India. #Govt4Growth,” tweeted Modi shortly after the swearing-in ceremony.A meeting of the Union Cabinet is likely at 5pm on Thursday, followed by a meeting of the council of ministers at 7pm, said people aware of the developments.Prominent among the new Cabinet ministers are Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane and BJP Rajya Sabha MP Bhupender Yadav.They were inducted on the basis of their strong record as administrators and organisational capabilities.“Under the able leadership of honourable Shri Modi ji, I will follow the ideology of the party and discharge any responsibility given to me to the best of my ability and dedication,” said Scindia.“Thank you Hon’ble PM @narendramodi ji for this great opportunity to serve the Nation and for your encouraging words. Under your guidance, we will dedicate ourselves to build a strong and prosperous India,” tweeted Sonowal.And prominent among those dropped are former IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, former environment and I&B minister Prakash Javadekar, former health minister Harsh Vardhan and former education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’.They were dropped at a time Covid-19 has ravaged the healthcare sector and derailed education, and when India is locked in a legal tussle with prominent social media companies over the country’s new Information and Technology rules.Five themes are evident in the reshuffle, which takes the overall size of Modi’s council of ministers to 77, excluding the PM, just four short of the maximum possible 81.The first is performance appraisal, and it is exemplified in the removal of Harsh Vardhan as health minister. While no causes are ever given for ministerial reshuffles, it is no secret that Vardhan’s handling of Covid-19 has been inadequate.Experts said this is likely the closest the Modi government will come to admitting it could have managed the pandemic better.The second is the need to accommodate lateral entrants such as Jyotiraditya Scindia as well as leaders such as Sarbananda Sonawal who gave up regional leadership roles (the BJP retained Assam under Sonawal but decided to make Himanta Biswa Sarma the chief minister).The third is the imperative to accommodate allies. The Modi council, before the reshuffle, had only one representative of another party – RPI’s Ramdas Athawale.It now has four ministers from four allies (The Janata Dal (United), Lok Janshakti Party and Apna Dal are the new ones) which should go some way in blunting criticism that the BJP can’t work with allies or does not treat them well.Four, the importance of looking ahead to coming assembly elections, especially in crucial states, and to facilitate leadership transitions in some states.In Karnataka, for instance, it is widely known that the central leadership of the BJP would like the incumbent chief minister BS Yediyurappa, 78, to make way for someone else. Among the new ministers named is one of his closest aides Shobha Karandlaje.And seven of the new ministers (including Anupriya Patel from Apna Dal) are from Uttar Pradesh, which goes to the polls in 2022, and which is the most important state in India from the perspective of parliamentary polls.Five, the desire to reinforce the social engineering strategy of creating a Hindu bloc by consolidating Hindu voters across other backward classes (OBCs) and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs/STs). This has worked to the BJP’s advantage in many states.In the council, 27 are from OBCs and 20 belong to SCs/STs.Overall, this takes the total number of ministers from OBCs and SCs/STs in the 77-strong council to 47.The Congress welcomed the new ministers but took a dig at the Prime Minister.“Congratulations to the newly appointed ministers in the GoI. I am hopeful that the new cabinet will work with great integrity & honesty for the nation. I am optimistic that @PMOIndia will not wrest all the powers & ministers will be able to delegate their responsibilities freely,” said Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/booster-shot-for-modi-20-101625696064522.html
08-07-2021||India||Petrol at ₹100/ litre in Delhi, hits century in all metros||Petrol prices crossed ₹100 per litre in Delhi and Kolkata on Wednesday after fuel retailers raised prices by 35 paise per litre even as international crude oil prices slumped on Tuesday following an inconclusive meeting of the producers’ cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) -- over supply cuts.Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their respective international benchmarks of previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. Pump rates of auto fuels rose in India on Wednesday even as international oil prices fell sharply the previous day.An impasse in the meeting of OPEC+ saw profit booking on Tuesday that led to a sharp 3.4% decline in Brent crude to $74.53 per barrel after it hit the session’s peak at $77.84, the highest since October 2018. The US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also fell 2.4% to $73.37 that day, after hitting $76.98 during the intraday trade, its highest since November 2014.The international oil price rally resumed on Wednesday. Brent opened weak on Wednesday, but gained $1.40, or 1.88%, to $75.93 a barrel during intraday trades.The Wednesday revision of India’s domestic fuel rates is the 36th hike in last 65 days that has made petrol costlier by ₹9.81 per litre and diesel by ₹8.8 a litre since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared. Petrol is now priced at ₹100.21 per litre and diesel at ₹89.59 a litre in New Delhi.While fuel rates of state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes, local levies, and transport surcharges.With the latest hike, petrol rates in all major metros have crossed ₹100 per litre. In Kolkata, petrol is priced at ₹100.23 per litre and diesel at ₹92.50 a litre. The cost of one litre of petrol in financial capital Mumbai is now ₹106.25 and diesel, ₹97.09. High fuel prices have an inflationary effect on the economy. Fuel prices have a weightage of 6.8% (fuel and light) in the consumer price index of CPI, a measure of retail inflation. The latest CPI number, for May, is 6.3%, above the Reserve bank of India’s comfort level of 6%.The highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar where pumps are selling petrol at ₹111.50 per litre and diesel at ₹102.78 a litre.Surging international oil rates and skewed domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps.In Delhi, central levies account for 33.29% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.07%, according to an official data of July 1. On diesel, central taxes account for around 35.66% while state taxes, about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.The unrelenting upward movement of fuel rates since May 4 has already seen petrol prices crossing the ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and Union territories (UTs) of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali and Darjeeling.Even as international oil prices saw volatility since May 4, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude falling to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest over the past 46 days, petrol and diesel rates went up on May 21 by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre, respectively.According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies are recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one UT.During the 66-day pause on price hikes, state-run retailers also reduced petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively, in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010, and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-at-100-litre-in-delhi-hits-century-in-all-metros-101625695485779.html
08-07-2021||India||Calcutta HC judge recuses from hearing Banerjee’s plea, imposes ₹5 lakh fine||Calcutta high court judge Justice Kausik Chanda on Wednesday recused from hearing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s petition challenging her defeat in the assembly election from Nandigram but imposed a ₹5 lakh fine on the Trinamool Congress chief for the manner in which the recusal was sought.Justice Chanda also stressed that he did not think that there was any conflict of interest if he had continued hearing the case. “The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias,” the judge said as he stepped away from Banerjee’s petition which will be placed before another bench.In her petition, Banerjee has alleged voting irregularities in her narrow loss by 1,956 votes to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram, her first electoral loss in 32 years. The TMC had demanded a recount shortly after the results were announced in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate but the request was turned down by the Election Commission. Her case was slated to be heard by a single judge bench, Justice Chanda.Mamata Banerjee and her party asked for transferring the petition to another judge citing “apprehension of bias” since Justice Chanda had, before his elevation to the bench in 2019, represented the BJP and its leaders in court cases and was seen in photographs sharing a dais with BJP leaders including state unit chief Dilip Ghosh.Justice Chanda was upset that Banerjee did not raise their objections when he first heard the case on June 18 but her party leaders put out messages on social media, setting off what the judge described as a “media trial” with hundreds of tweets demanding that he recuse from the case.“Such calculative, psychological, and offensive attempts to seek recusal need to be firmly repulsed and a cost of ₹5 lakh is imposed upon the petitioner,” Justice Chanda said in his order on Wednesday. The money will be used to fight Covid-19.Mamata Banerjee declined to comment on the verdict. “This is a sub judice matter. I will not comment. The lawyers will decide whatever decisions need to be taken,” she said.TMC leaders hinted that the party might approach the Supreme Court over the ₹5 lakh fine.“We have full faith in the judiciary and Justice Chanda. But we had some reservations only in this matter because some pictures and old facts have come to the forefront. As far as the decision to move the SC, the party will take a decision soon,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.The BJP said it will not comment on a court order or a decision taken by a judge. “We have complete faith in the judiciary, Some political parties may not have faith,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president.In his order, Justice Chanda emphasised that he did not agree with Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Mamata Banerjee, that there was a conflict of interest since “I have a long, close, personal, professional, pecuniary and ideological relationship” with a political party.“The argument of Mr. Singhvi takes too sombre a view of the integrity of a judge. When a litigant raises the question of bias against a judge, who has taken the oath to discharge his duties without any fear or favour, the test has to be a real likelihood of bias or real danger of bias. The appearance of impartiality, in such a case, should not be viewed from the perspective of a common man,” he said.“If a lawyer appears in several cases for a political party, his association with the legal cell of the party or with its leaders is natural. In this country, it is almost impossible not to get a person who may not have said to have some political views. Anyone interested in politics may be said to have an “interest.” Like any other citizen of the country, a judge also exercises his voting rights in favour of a political party, but he lays aside his individual predilection while deciding a case. A lawyer’s mind is trained not to identify himself with his client and at the same time be loyal to his duty towards his client,” Justice Chanda said.“When a lawyer moves from Bar to Bench, he carries with him the same sense of detachment already in-built in him. Ironically, two leading counsel engaged in the case have well known political identities adverse to the petitioner’s party,” the judge said in his order, referring to Abhishek Manu Singhvi who was a member of the Congress but representing the TMC president along with senior lawyer SN Mookherjee who was from BJP.“It is preposterous to suggest that a judge having a past association with a political party as a lawyer should not receive a case involving the said political party or any of its members. The past association of a judge with a political party by itself cannot form apprehension of bias,” the order added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-banerjee-s-plea-imposes-5-lakh-fine-101625692786105.html
08-07-2021||India||Delimitation panel continues discussions in Jammu-Kashmir||On the second day of its visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the Delimitation Commission on Wednesday met more than three dozen delegations of different political parties, civil society groups and government officials from south Kashmir’s four districts -- Kulgam, Pulwama, Shopian and Anantnag. In the evening, the commission members also met delegations from central and north Kashmir districts – Baramulla, Kupwara, Budgam, Ganderbal and Bandipore.After meeting 17 delegations in Srinagar on Tuesday, the commission members travelled to Pahalgam in Anantnag district on Wednesday and held meetings with delegations of several mainstream political parties -- including the National Conference (NC), Congress, Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP), People’s Conference, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- and groups from various districts of the Union territory. The mainstream parties were represented by their district presidents and other senior leaders. They presented their suggestions and apprehensions about the delimitation process, people aware of the developments said.“We presented them our point of view about delimitation process,” said Congress Pulwama district president Umar Jan soon after the meeting.National Conference leader Altaf Kaloo, who headed the delegation, said they presented the memorandum to the Commission. “We briefed them about the stand of our party vis a vis delimitation.”While the majority of the parties suggested that population should be the main criteria for reorganisation of constituencies, the People’s Conference and the CPI(M) demanded that the census figures of 2011 should be the benchmark for the exercise.Other delegations that met the panel in Pahalgam included members of Social and Vikas Foudnation, Anantnag , Gujjar Ethiad, Pahari Culture and Welfare Forum, Sheikh-ul –Alam Turst, Gujjar and Bakerwal Conference and Sikh Welfare Society.Former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai heads the commission that was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. The commission has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise. It will also carve constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the first time in Jammu & Kashmir.The delimitation issue was discussed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir on June 24. The Centre has sought the completion of the delimitation exercise before assembly polls are held there. However, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a grouping of political major parties such as the National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), said they were disappointed over the outcome of the meeting with Modi. The grouping has demanded the restoration of the region’s statehood before elections are held there. It also criticised the lack of “confidence-building measures”.At the time of going to press, the commission members were holding meetings with delegations of political parties from north and central Kashmir districts at a hotel in Pahalgam.Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP and Awami National Conference, both constituents of the PAGD, have decided not to meet the commission, with the former saying that there was a perception that the outcome of the process was pre-planned.On Thursday, the commission will head to the Jammu division to meet delegations from Jammu, Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Udhampur, Samba and Reasi districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-panel-continues-discussions-in-jammukashmir-101625692655187.html
08-07-2021||India||Interpol issues fresh red notice against LeT chief Hafiz Saeed||Interpol, acting on India’s request, has issued a fresh red notice against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed for spearheading anti-India activities from across the border, people familiar with the matter said.This is the second red notice since 2009 against the United Nations designated terrorist, currently lodged in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat prison. The first global arrest warrant against Saeed was issued on August 28, 2009 in connection with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, in which 166 people , including 25 foreigners were killed and 235 people were injured.One of the people cited above said that NIA “sent a request to the Interpol last month seeking a fresh red notice against Hafiz Saeed listing fresh charges against him”.A red notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.A first-of-its-kind drone attack at Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Jammu on June 27 was carried out by Saeed’s organisation, according to a preliminary probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).A car-bomb that exploded outside Hafiz Saeed’s residence in Lahore’s Johar town on June 23, and Pakistan has claimed that India’s spy agency, Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) was behind the attack, a charge strongly denied by Indian officials who have termed the allegation “motivated”.The 71-year-old founder of LeT and its frontal organisation, Jamat-ud-Dawa, is wanted in India for multiple attacks including December 22, 2000 Red Fort attack, December 2001 Parliament attack, ambush on Border Security Force (BSF) convoy at Udampur in August 5, 2015, and multiple other blasts in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities. He is also wanted in connection to a case on terror funding in Jammu & Kashmir, in which several separatist leaders were arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in 2017-18. Both NIA and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), have named Saeed as the mastermind in J&K terror funding probe where they believe that he, Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin, separatist leaders, several businessmen in Kashmir and officials in the Pakistan high commission, were funding terrorist attacks and stone-pelters as part of a well-planned criminal conspiracy of securing secession of the state of Jammu & Kashmir from India.Despite India’s repeated requests and the United States announcing a reward of $10 million on him, Pakistan is yet to take concrete action against Saeed and he continues to carry out his activities.Although he is lodged in a Lahore jail, Indian counter-terrorism officials say this is just an “eye-wash” by Pakistan as part of its review by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which has kept in the “grey-list” since June 2018 for failing to meet the agency’s action plan on cracking down on terror-financing.He was arrested by Pakistani authorities on multiple occasions since 2000 for terror activities, only to be released after few days.Saeed has a close relationship with Pakistan’s military and spy agency ISI, who often speak in his favour. He is also closely associated with Taliban leadership, which is reflected in the fact that he established an office of LeT in Quetta, Pakistan in June 2006 to assist Taliban in the conduct of their operations in Afghanistan, according to the UN Security Council notice against him.“In 2005, Saeed determined where graduates of a LeT camp in Pakistan should be sent to fight, and personally organized the infiltration of LeT militants into Iraq during a trip to Saudi Arabia. In 2006, Saeed oversaw the management of a terrorist camp, including funding of the camp. Saeed also arranged for a LeT operative to be sent to Europe as LeT’s European fundraising coordinator,” according to the United Nations Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interpol-issues-fresh-red-notice-against-let-chief-hafiz-saeed-101625692356912.html

But there were several other departures from tradition too.The newly appointed ministers sat in two different areas as opposed to the norm of all of them sitting together on the right side of the hall in front of the Prime Minister and other invitees. Apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Union home minister Amit Shah, only a few other Union ministers came to attend the programme. A Rashtrapati Bhavan functionary said, “We have made seating arrangements keeping in mind the Covid protocol of the past few months.”Each new minister who took oath on Wednesday was requested to bring only one guest along as seats were limited. Since last year, President Ram Nath Kovind has cut down on the number of events where his physical presence is required and conducts most of his business online. In keeping with that, he received credentials of some foreign envoys through a digital platform on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-reshuffle-rituals-take-back-seat-amid-covid-protocols-101625690501772.html
08-07-2021||India||From farmer to lawyer, new faces from varied backgrounds make it to Cabinet||From a 52-year-old farmer, to a career lawyer and a former IAS officer with a business degree from one of the top schools in world, the new council of ministers has a motley mix of young, experienced and highly educated new entrants, even as it strives to remain inclusive and representative.“There are 14 Ministers below 50 years of age, including six Cabinet Ministers,” said one person familiar with the thinking behind the composition of the council.Among the new inductees is Pratima Bhoumik, 52, who is serving her first term as a member of Parliament from Tripura West. An agriculturist by profession, Bhoumik has a degree in bio-sciences from Women’s College, Agartala.A former IAS officer, Ashwini Vaishnaw hails from Odisha and joined the BJP as recently as 2019 after becoming a member of the Rajya Sabha . But Vaishnav, 51, is no stranger to the party. He served as the private secretary to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004, after serving a brief stint with the Prime Minister’s office during Vajpayee’s term in 2002. He was educated at MBM Engineering College, Jodhpur, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Wharton Business School. In 2006, he also served as the deputy chairman of Goa’s Mormugoa Port Trust.BJP’s state president from Tamil Nadu, L. Murugan, 44, also finds his way into the council. A Dalit leader, Murugan will have to become a member of Parliament within six months of his appointment to continue as a minister in the union cabinet. A career lawyer, he was the former vice chairperson for the national commission for schedule castes. He has a doctorate in Human Rights Law from the Department of Legal studies, University of Madras.Thirty-nine-year-old Shantanu Thakur is a member of parliament from Bagaon, West Bengal, which is a reserved constituency.

08-07-2021||India||Centre merges dept of enterprises with finance ministry||The government has carved out the department of public enterprises (DPE) from the ministry of heavy industries and put it under the umbrella of the finance ministry to monitor performance of state-run firms, monetise their assets better through divestment and strategic sales, and direct their procurements policies to boost local industries.DPE has come full circle now. It came into existence in 1965 as the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in the Union ministry of finance as a centralised coordinating unit appraising the performance of public enterprises, two officials aware of the development said requesting anonymity. In 1985, BPE was shifted to the ministry of industry. Five years later it was made a department, and subsequently put under the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises.“DPE is brought to the finance ministry for direct and better coordination. The purpose is to improve efficiency of CPSEs [central public sector enterprises], effective monetisation of their resources that are lying idle and nudge them to promote ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ [Self-reliant India] by procuring goods and services from within the country, particularly from MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises],” one of the officials cited above said.The change should be seen in the context of this year’s budget announcement, where the finance minister placed special emphasis on asset monetisation, the second official said. Delivering her budget speech on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “A ‘National Monetization Pipeline’ of potential brownfield infrastructure assets will be launched.”“CPSEs have idle or underutilised assets. For example, 156 of them have over 4,000 acres of prime land in various parts of the country, which could be made productive assets. Besides, the change will also facilitate government’s disinvestment programme,” this official added.The budget on February 1 proposed monetising of land through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and closure of sick or loss-making CPSEs. The government has budgeted for ₹1.75 lakh crore as receipts from disinvestment in 2021-22.Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners, said: “As stated by the finance minister in her Budget speech, the transfer of DPE to the finance ministry gives a strong indication of the government’s push towards disinvestments. The fiscal stress brought on by the pandemic has exacerbated the need for privatisation of public enterprises and monetisation of under-utilised assets. This move would also allow effective enablement of PSEs to align with the vision of boosting the domestic ecosystem by encouraging procurement through Indian MSMEs.”The change in ministerial control of DPE was effected through a notification issued by the Cabinet Secretariat on July 6. Accordingly, the finance ministry will now have six departments – the department of economic affairs (DEA), the department of revenue (DoR), the department of expenditure (DoE), the department of financial services (DFS), the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), and DPE. The ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises has now been renamed as the ministry of heavy industries (MHI).The ministerial restructuring was, however, made public on Wednesday, hours before a cabinet expansion.

08-07-2021||India||Eye on elections, Team Modi casts a wider net to capture fresh talent||In picking the new faces for the council of ministers, the Narendra Modi government has skilfully balanced caste and regional aspirations — key aspects of electoral politics — with the intent of bringing on board candidates who are younger, more qualified, and with administrative and legislative experience.The leitmotif of the new council, however, is the social engineering that has been attempted by giving a seat at the high table to castes considered to be at the bottom of the social and economic pyramid but that are assiduously wooed by the BJP.As per the data shared by the government, there are as many as 27 Other Backward Castes,12 Scheduled Castes and eight Scheduled Tribes in the council of ministers. Notably these include some of the castes such as Darzi, Modh Teli among others that have been represented for the first time.This clever mosaic of castes is aimed at building the Bharatiya Janata Party’s base in not just the election-bound states such as Uttar Pradesh but also in states where the party is keen to expand its footprint, such as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Karnataka, and in states such as Rajasthan and Maharashtra where it hopes to regain the seat of power.The inclusions from UP have hogged the headlines for the possible impact it will have on the state elections in 2022. Caste is considered a key element in determining election outcomes in the state.Of the seven who took oath today from the state, three are SCs, 3 OBCs and one upper caste. The composition is being perceived to reach out to the communities, particularly the OBCs who comprise nearly 40% of the electorate and have supported the BJP but are said to be upset over a slew of issues, including the lack of employment avenues. “The talk of sub-categorisation of OBCs, for instance, has not gone down well in UP, where larger groups like Kurmis feel their share of the reservation pie will be reduced,” said a senior BJP leader and a former minister on condition of anonymity.To make up for the alienation, the BJP has included Anupriya Patel, a Kurmi leader in the council, along with B L Varma from the Lodh community, and SP Singh Baghel, Bhanu Pratap Verma and Kaushal Kishore who are Dalits.“The BJP has been focusing on consolidating the non-Yadav OBCs, who are essentially Samajwadi Party supporters, and the choice of ministers is in keeping with that,” the leader quoted above said.BJP’s former MP Bizay Sonkar Shastri, however, said the number of inclusions from UP should not be seen from the electoral prism alone. “The state is geographically large and has a larger constituency of people from many castes and communities. It makes sense to have more faces from UP to represent these sections,” he said.From Gujarat that also goes to polls in 2022, the party has included Darshana Jardosh and elevated Parshottam Rupala and Mansukh Mandaviya as cabinet ministers.Similarly, Anurag Thakur from poll-bound Himachal Pradesh has also been elevated to the cabinet and Ajay Bhatt from Uttarakhand included in the council as minister of state. Manipur that will also pick a new assembly in 2022 has been represented by a first-time MP, Rajkumar Ranjan Singh, who has been given a cabinet berth.In Jharkhand where the BJP is also not in power anymore, the party has picked Annpurna Devi, a former close aide of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, to be part of the council of ministers. Annapurna Devi is considered to have considerable clout among the Yadavs in Jharkhand. Similarly, the inclusion of Pashupati Kumar Paras is a move to consolidate its position among the Dalits in Bihar where the party is in a coalition government with the Janata Dal (United).Will the choice of ministers accrue benefits for the party? Political commentator Abhay Deshpande said, “The BJP has been careful in picking the caste combination that will impact not just the election-bound states of Uttar Pradesh but also the outcome in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The party has chosen to focus on states which have the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats and also where it has the maximum strike rate.”Dropping senior ministers ostensibly for reasons of performance is also an indication that the party is trying to project leaders with the clout among communities, Deshpande said.“The party is clear that it wants leaders who can bring votes from a particular community or a region for maximum benefit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-elections-team-modi-casts-a-wider-net-to-capture-fresh-talent-101625689951246.html
08-07-2021||India||2 ex-IAS officers added to new team||The Modi government’s new Cabinet now comprises five former bureaucrats and diplomats with the induction of two former Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officers, Ashwini Vaishnaw and Ramchandra Prasad Singh, on Wednesday.While power minister Raj Kumar Singh was elevated as a Cabinet minister from Minister of State rank, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and external affairs minister S Jaishankar are already a part of the Union council of ministers.Vaishnaw, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Odisha in 2019, is a former IAS officer of 1994 batch. He had served as deputy secretary in the office of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004 after serving a brief stint with the Prime Minister’s Office during Vajpayee’s term in 2002.Vaishnaw is expected to bring managerial expertise to the Modi government. He completed his MTech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and also attended a management programme at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.As a bureaucrat, Vaishnaw had earned praise for his handling of relief and rehabilitation of people affected by cyclones in Odisha.Janata Dal (United) lawmaker Ramchandra Prasad Singh, who was also allotted a Cabinet berth on Wednesday, is a former IAS officer of 1984 batch, from the Uttar Pradesh cadre. He is also the national president of his party.Singh had served as principal secretary to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar in one of his earlier terms. He availed voluntary retirement in 2010 before his nomination to Rajya Sabha in the same year.Raj Kumar Singh is a former secretary of home affairs.

08-07-2021||India||NDA ties may be on the mend as BJP allies find space in new Cabinet||The Bharatiya Janata Party has signalled that its ties with its partners in the National Democratic Alliance are on the mend by including three leaders (one each) from the Janata Dal (U), Apna Dal, and the Lok Janshakti Party in the Union council of ministers that was sworn in on Wednesday. Of these, two were sworn in as Cabinet ministers.This is the first time that the council will have representation from the JDU, an ally with whom the BJP runs a coalition government in Bihar. There was speculation that there were differences between the two allies over the number of ministerial berths, but as things stood, RCP Singh of the party was sworn in as Cabinet minister.Also sworn in as Cabinet minister was the LJP’s Pashupati Kumar Paras who is entangled in a feud with his nephew and Lok Sabha MP Chirag Paswan for control of the party. Paswan has already approached the Delhi high court saying Paras cannot be sworn in as a member of the LJP because he (Paswan) represents the partyStill, Paras’ inclusion has cleared the air on LJP-BJP ties, which came under a cloud ahead of the Bihar election after Paswan attacked JDU leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar.Anupriya Patel, a Kurmi leader of the Apna Dal, which is a crucial ally of the BJP in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, was also sworn in. She was the minister of state for health and family welfare in the council of ministers in 2014 when the BJP first came to power at the centre in 2014. Patel’s entry is seen as an outreach to other backward classes in Uttar Pradesh which goes to the polls next year.After the exit of two of its oldest allies, the Shiv Sena in 2019 over the issue of power sharing in Maharashtra and the Shiromani Akali Dal in 2020 following a fall-out over the farm laws, the BJP was accused of not taking on board views from the partners.The absence of allies from the council of ministers cemented the perception that there were fissures within the National Democratic Alliance. After the passing of LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan in 2020 the Union cabinet had no representation from the allies, the only non BJP member in the council of ministers was RPI’s Ramdas Athawale.Political commentator Abhay Deshpande said the BJP is making an effort to strengthen ties with its allies because they will need partners for the 2024 general elections.“Right now they have the mandate but after 10 years, there will be a number of issues that the BJP will have to face such as anti-incumbency, the impact of Covid on economy and in such a scenario, they will need the allies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-ties-may-be-on-the-mend-as-bjp-allies-find-space-in-new-cabinet-101625689236822.html
08-07-2021||India||New Cabinet portfolios overlap to boost work efficiency||Thirty Cabinet ministers and two ministers of state with independent charge will handle all Union ministries as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government moved on Wednesday to create synergies between departments with similar or overlapping domains and break silos to boost work efficiency.Union home minister Amit Shah will manage the newly created ministry of cooperation, the statement added.Among the new Cabinet ministers, Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia will be in charge of the ministry of civil aviation, technocrat-turned-politician Ashwini Vaishnaw will handle the ministry of railways, the ministry of communications; and the ministry of electronics and information technology, and former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane will manage the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises.To facilitate synergy, the Union ministries of health, and chemicals and fertilisers, were brought under one minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, to better coordinate the two critical departments in helping the government fight the Covid pandemic. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals essential for drugs are key to medical infrastructure.Similarly, the Union ministries of education, and skill development and entrepreneurship, were clubbed under Dharmendra Pradhan to help the departments work in unison to bring the Covid-ravaged sector back on track.“These are among the most important ministries…It was thus imperative that these be handled by the same minister so that the same can work in unison for achieving common objectives,” said a government functionary aware of developments.Mandaviya, who was earlier in charge of the ministries of ports and shipping and chemicals and fertilisers, played a key role in resolving a supply crisis of Remdesivir. “Health and pharma are being allocated to the same Cabinet minister to bring critically needed synergy between the two in the middle of a global pandemic,’’ explained a senior official in the government.The official quoted above said that the clubbing of ministries under Pradhan was done to “implement the PM’s vision of overhauling the education landscape.”The distribution of portfolios was announced hours after 43 ministers were sworn in and the new council of ministers was a mix of fresh faces and experienced hands with a focus on harnessing effectiveness.In all, the 77-member new Union council of ministers will have 30 cabinet ministers, two ministers of state with independent charge and 45 ministers of state, said a statement from Rashtrapati Bhavan.HT learnt that the Prime Minister felt that the IT ministry was best handled by ”professional technocrats”. The former minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, had several run-ins with social media companies over new intermediary guidelines this year.Former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal will handle the ministry of ports, shipping and waterways, and the ministry of Ayush. Rajya Sabha member Bhupender Yadav will look after the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, and the ministry of labour and employmentAmong ministers who were promoted to cabinet rank, Anurag Thakur will handle the ministry of information and broadcasting; and the ministry of youth affairs and sports; Hardeep Puri will look after the ministry of petroleum and natural gas; and the ministry of housing and urban affairs; and Kiren Rijiju will be in charge of the ministry of law and justice.Among the BJP’s allies, Lok Janshakti Party’s Pashupati Kumar Paras was named the cabinet minister for food processing industries, Janata Dal (United) leader RCP Singh was given the ministry of steel and Apna Dal (Sonelal) leader Anupriya Patel was appointed minister of state in the ministry of commerce and industry.The textile ministry was moved from Union women and child development minister Smriti Irani to commerce minister Piyush Goyal, who was relieved of the railways portfolio. The rural development ministry and panchayati raj ministry were shifted from Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar to Giriraj Singh.Virendra Kumar was appointed the Union social justice minister and Parshottam Rupala the minister for culture; tourism; and development of north eastern region. New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi was named minister of state in the ministry of external affairs and ministry of culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-cabinet-portfolios-overlap-to-boost-work-efficiency-101625688771613.html
08-07-2021||India||SC seeks status on vacancies under RTI Act in four weeks||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday gave four weeks to the Centre and states to report the status on vacancies in Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions after three transparency activists complained of huge pendency of cases under the Right to Information Act 2005 on account of the vacancies.A bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari passed the order while hearing an application filed by three RTI activists – Anjali Bhardwaj, Commodore (retd) Lokesh K Batra and Amrita Johri, in a pending public interest litigation (PIL) filed by them. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who argued the application, told the court that the pendency of cases at the CIC has crossed 36,000 while in Maharashtra, it has crossed 75,000 cases due to continuing vacancies of information commissioners.In February 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the government to start the process to fill vacancies two months before a post is to fall vacant. Later, in December 2019 when the top court saw that many posts were still vacant in the CIC, the court fixed a three-month deadline to fill up the posts.The CIC has 10 sanctioned posts of information commissioners and one chief information commissioner.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Madhavi Divan, appearing for the Centre, said the Centre complied with the top court’s order and even filed a compliance report in April 2020. It has seven information commissioners and one chief information commissioner. Bhushan informed the court that as per the February 2019 ruling, the Centre was also required to disclose its criteria to shortlist candidates for appointment to CIC and State information Commissions. He said that though 324 applications were received for the posts of information commissioners (IC) and chief information commissioner at CIC, the search committee headed by Cabinet Secretary did not disclose on what basis seven names were shortlisted for ICs and two names for Chief IC. Prashant Bhushan referred to a dissent note of October 24, 2020 by Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, who as a member of the selection committee under the RTI Act, was critical of the manner in which only retired bureaucrats were shortlisted for these posts along with a journalist who never applied in the first place. “The government initially does not fill up vacancies and if they do, they do it with party acolytes, one of them being a bogus journalist and bureaucrats. They (Centre) are destroying the RTI Act,” Bhushan said. He requested the court to direct the Centre to disclose the selection criteria and the dissent note by Chaudhary. ASG Divan objected to the use of the term “bogus journalist” and said that it was not proper for Bhushan to make statements against members without filing an affidavit to this effect. The bench flagged the crucial issue of vacancies and said that since April 2020, no fresh affidavit had come from Centre, it would like to be apprised of the current situation.The issue of vacancies at CIC and SICs was viewed with anguish by the apex court in its February 2019 judgment where the court said, “This Right to Information Act is enacted not only to sub-serve and ensure freedom of speech. On proper implementation, it has the potential to bring about good governance which is an integral part of any vibrant democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-status-on-vacancies-under-rti-act-in-four-weeks-101625687782680.html
08-07-2021||India||Gangs of Bengaluru: How IT boom changed the face of gang wars||Bengaluru:On 27 July 2012, traffic came to a standstill on the busy Tumkur Road on the National Highway 4, but this logjam wasn’t the one residents of Bengaluru encounter often. Little did people stuck in the traffic know that ahead on the road, a politician was being butchered by a group of machete-wielding, gun-holding gangsters.Around 8.45 pm, BEML Krishnappa, a resident of Nelamangala and Congress member of Bangalore Rural Zilla panchayat, was heading home after attending a business meeting at Basaveshwara Circle near Vidhana Soudha. He was accompanied by an armed bodyguard in his SUV when he realised around 30 men armed with guns, machetes and other lethal weapons were on his tail. Moments later, his car came to a screeching halt after being blocked by a truck, as planned by the gangsters, who first opened fire at him and then to be sure he had died, hacked him.For Bengaluru, which had moved on from the gang violence of the 90s, this was a chilling déjà vu. The murder was part of a gang rivalry between two Bettanagere cousins Srinivas alias Seena and Shankar alias Shankara.While gang rivalries in the decades from 1970 to 90 were mainly over illegal sale of liquor, kerosene and oil, in the new liberalised Bengaluru, claim over lucrative real estate became the primary lure for gang wars.Praveen Sood, the current Karnataka Police chief, who served in Bengaluru in the early 2000s in various roles including the city police commissioner and additional commissioner of police, traffic, said liberalisation led to the property value in the city shooting up. “Before the IT boom, it was the licence raj that was the source of quick money for gangsters. They battled to gain control over whatever became scarce because of the licences. That’s the reason we had gangsters like Oil Kumar, who had control over the oil supply of Bengaluru. This seems like a small thing, but then it provided profit,” Sood added.As the city expanded, most of these gang activities moved to the outskirts. “Post-liberalisation, rowdy activities shifted towards real estate. If you look at Bengaluru’s development as concentric circles and if you draw a line on the extend of gangster activities from 1990 to 2020, you will see the activities moving towards the outermost edge, where new layouts were coming up and land disputes were common. Here, gangsters used their muscle power,” said MN Anucheth, a 2009-batch IPS officer, who is currently posted as the DCP central.The story of the Bettanagere brothers and their growth coincided with the real estate boom in Nelamangala, Devanahalli and other north Bengaluru areas in the last decade.In 2005, Seena and Shankara, the Bettanagere cousins, were jailed in connection with the murder of Balekai Bassavaiah, who had defeated Hanumanthaiah, Seena’s father, in the taluk milk producers’ co-operative elections in 2004.The rivalry began when Shankara managed to get bail and walked out of the prison, while Seena remained in jail. The rivalry resulted in nine murders, including that of Krishnappa. The murders were the result of the disputes over real estate deals and Seena’s political ambitions.Political ambitions were another trait of the post-90s gangsters. “In the earlier days, being a gangster meant fame and fear that would help them hold on to their territories. But in the 2000s, most rowdies aspired to get political powers and not come into the limelight as much. They believe that political power gave them legitimacy and more power,” said a serving police officer, who didn’t want to be named.“If politicians used gangsters to further their agenda, a look now at the criminal background of several politicians, especially at corporator level, one can see being a rowdy was a steppingstone,” the officer added.In 2005, Seena was serving as a gram panchayat member and Shankara was opposed to his cousin’s political ambitions. Krishnappa is said to have helped Shankara get bail and soon the two joined hands.In 2008, Krishnappa allegedly got his rival and member of Nelamangala Taluk Panchayat, Hadiyaala Devi, killed by Shankar’s gang. Devi was Seena’s brother-in-law.The gang war between both gangs left a trail of blood. The first to be killed were advocate Devaraj and farmer Krishnamurthy, who were eyewitnesses to Basavaiah murder. Since Devaraj was killed in front of his father Bylappa, he was murdered too. Devaraj’s son-in-law, Gangondanahalli Ramamurthy, a local politician, too was murdered when he tried to take revenge on the cousins.In retaliation of Devi’s murder, Seena’s gang is said to have murdered realtor Lohith Gowda, who was close to Shankara. The gang rivalry eventually resulted in the mid-highway murder of Krishnappa in 2012.A month later, in September 2012, Seena was killed in a police encounter.In November 2003, Rowdy Rajendra alias Bekkina Kannu (cat eye) Rajendra was hacked to death by a gang of five persons near Chalukya hotel in High Grounds police station limits. Years before his murder, Rajendra had been involved in the real estate and cable business.He was also a contractor for the Bengaluru Development Authority and Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, thus enjoying close contact with several politicians in the city. One of the suspects in his murder, another gangster Silent Sunil, is on top of the police list, said officials of the Central Crime Branch (CCB).Another gang rivalry over real estate was reported in June 2016, when a gang of four men, armed with swords and choppers, barged into a Cafe Coffee Day outlet and attacked a realtor and history-sheeter, Mahesh, killing him on the spot.The investigation revealed that the public attack was the fallout of the murder of a 28-year-old gangster Harsha, who was hacked to death in Vijaya Nagar on April 27 this year by 10 men. The assailants are suspected to be Harsha’s associates. The rival gang suspected Mahesh of financing Harsha’s murder.In March 2019, Lakshmana, 42, allegedly involved in several cases of murder and land grab, was hacked to death by a five-member gang in Mahalakshmi Layout, near Iskcon Temple.Police suspect the killing to be the fallout of a gang rivalry. Lakshmana, who lived in Sunkadakatte, is the twin of Rama, was also a gangster. The duo, known as the Rama-Lakshmana brothers in Bengaluru’s rowdy sheets, had specialised in grabbing land from people by using threats and violence.Some gangsters tried to create an underworld in line with the Mumbai’s underworld in the 1990s. A prominent one being gangster Ravi Poojari. One of the first cases against him was for his alleged involvement in a fatal shootout against builder Subbaraju in 2001 in Bengaluru. He has been charge-sheeted in the case but is yet to stand trial. He is also charge-sheeted for the shootout at realty firm Shabnam Developers, which left two dead in February 2007.His henchmen allegedly carried out a shootout at UTV, the Bollywood production company’s office in 2009, and at the office of Mantri Developers in 2010, both in Bengaluru. The last shootout he was allegedly involved in was against Bharati Builders in Mangaluru in 2014.However, he was unable to establish control over Bengaluru and was eventually taken into custody in February 2020.According to police, while earlier gangs tried to keep control over the entire city, in the later years, the war of domination was localised and limited to areas in the outskirts of the city. “The nature of crime has changed before and post-liberalisation. Even though not as brazen as the 90s, gang rivalries continue to be a top priority in policing, especially in Bengaluru,” said DG and IGP Sood. “Unlike the 90s, the rivalries are more decentralised and localised. Still, it poses a big challenge,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gangs-of-bengaluru-how-it-boom-changed-the-face-of-gang-wars-101625686701506.html
08-07-2021||India||TN runner Revathi overcomes poverty and patriarchy to secure a place in Olympics||Chennai: V Revathi sprinted 400 metres in 53.55 seconds coming first in the trials on Sunday and be picked for the Tokyo Olympics in the mixed 4x400 metres relay. But, her journey toward this achievement had been arduous, overcoming poverty and patriarchy. She was 7-year-old when her father died and a year later she lost her mother. Revathi and her younger sister, a football player, were raised by their maternal grandmother, Arammal.The sisters lived and studied in a government-run hostel cum school in the district, while their septuagenarian grandmother worked as a labourer under the MGNREGA scheme in Madurai’s Sakkimangalam village. Arammal was key to Revathi pursuing competitive athletics. “She sent us to study from a hostel because of our poverty,” says Revathi, who is training at Sports Authority of India’s centre at Patiala in Punjab. She has been training for the Olympics from the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports for the past two years. “She used to visit us at least once a month. Everyone else had parents who visited the hostel every week. My sister and I used to feel very sad looking at that. And, today this wouldn’t have been possible for me without paati (grandmother in Tamil).”Revathi, now 23, had won several medals from track events in school. It was when she was in class 12 during a zonal competition where her talent was identified. “We obviously couldn’t afford shoes so I used to run barefoot. After the event Kannan sir came up to me and said, ‘I will buy shoes for you. Will you come for training every morning and evening?’” Revathi recalls. She declined because she couldn’t afford a bus fare of ₹40 to the Sports Development Authority stadium in Madurai’s Race Course where K Kannan was the coach.So Kannan made another offer to fund her college education and hostel accommodation at Lady Doak College which was walking distance from the stadium. Revathi’s grandmother agreed and she graduated with a BA in Tamil. “Every time I won a medal, paati used to show it to the villagers but they in turn scolded her for letting a girl run like a boy,” says Revathi. She adds that they would suggest her grandmother to rest at home by either getting the sisters married or sending them to work. Revathi didn’t face much of these pressures directly as she had been living in hostels since class 2. “I really don’t know how paati stood up to them. Most of them in my village aren’t educated. But she wanted us to study and she told us that we should do what we want to do.”Arammal has toured cities like Chennai to watch her granddaughter run. “She cried every time,” says Revathi. “She’d ask, ‘Do you have to run under the scorching sun? Do you have to run so fast?”. Kannan had helped the family financially over the years. Revathi’s fellow runners did too. “My peers would put in whatever money they could to help me fund my travel tickets for competitions. Everyone around us helped,” she says. Financially, things are looking up for the family now after Revathi got a job last year in southern railways as a Commercial Clerk-cum-Ticket Collector. Her sister joined the Chennai police force.“Until now we didn’t have any means. There was no other way other than running and saving prize money. So we kept running,” says Revathi. “Now even if I have some sports injury, I’ve a job to rely on.” Revathi had a right-knee injury last year which put her off action for three months. She has been training now without a day off from a German coach. Arammal works as a cook with Kannan for five of his student athletes who live with his family. “All your hard work has been rewarded,” Arammal is said to have broken down and told Revathi over the phone after her selection. Arammal hadn’t understood what Olympics meant until Revathi had to shift base to Punjab for training. 53.55 seconds is her “personal best” so far, she says and is training to better it at the Olympics where she will compete.Revathi is among five track runners-- Subha Venkatesan, S Dhanalakshmi, Arokia Rajiv and Naganathan Pandi--who have qualified from Tamil Nadu for the Olympics, announced on Tuesday. Chief minister MK Stalin issued a ₹5 lakh incentive for each of them on Tuesday after the announcement. Seven others including sailors, table tennis players and fencers had qualified earlier from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-runner-revathi-overcomes-poverty-and-patriarchy-to-secure-a-place-in-olympics-101625686345853.html
08-07-2021||India||Madras HC grants conditional bail to former AIADMK minister in rape case||Chennai: The Madras high court on Wednesday granted conditional bail to former All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) minister M Manikandan who was arrested on a slew of charges including rape and cheating in a case filed by a Malayasian citizen who had acted in Tamil and Malayalam movies. Justice M Nirmal Kumar ordered that the petitioner be released on bail by surrendering his passport, executing two sureties of a sum of ₹10,000 and to appear before the investigating officer everyday for two weeks and whenever he is called. According to the complainant, the accused had sexual relations with her on the pretext of marriage after divorcing his wife. The actress complained that she also got pregnant thrice and was forced to abort during this period. The court had granted Manikandan interim protection from June 3 to 9 which were reserved on the 9th but the court had dismissed his anticipatory bail on June 16. Police arrested Manikandan from Bengaluru on June 20 under Sections 417, 376, 313, 323 and 506(i) of IPC and Section 67-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Upon his arrest, police recorded his confession and recovered two of his mobile phones. The accused was also taken to Madurai where the duo had stayed often in an apartment from where a phone was also recovered. The senior counsel for the accused pointed out that a substantial portion of the investigation was over and assured the court that he will “not evade from justice and shall abide by any condition”. He stated that the case was filed out of political vendetta. After hearing both sides of the argument, the court noted that they were in a relationship from May 2017 to April 2021 was not in dispute. There were differences of opinion when she got pregnant thrice and he had arranged for abortions against her wish. The court said that the complainant had the intelligence to understand what she was consenting to. “The defacto complainant was well aware of the consequence that the marriage between her and the petitioner would not take place,” the court said in its orders. “Thus leading to the inference that she freely, voluntarily and consciously consented to have sexual intercourse with the petitioner and her consent was not in consequence of any misconception of fact and they were living together as man and wife. Thus, there is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-grants-conditional-bail-to-former-aiadmk-minister-in-rape-case-101625686285372.html
08-07-2021||India||Centre merges dept. of enterprises with finance ministry||The government has carved out the department of public enterprises (DPE) from the ministry of heavy industries and put it under the umbrella of the finance ministry to monitor performance of state-run firms, monetise their assets better through divestment and strategic sales, and direct their procurements policies to boost local industries. DPE has come full circle now. It came into existence in 1965 as the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in the Union ministry of finance as a centralised coordinating unit appraising the performance of public enterprises, two officials aware of the development said requesting anonymity. In 1985, BPE was shifted to the ministry of industry. Five years later it was made a department, and subsequently put under the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises.“DPE is brought to the finance ministry for direct and better coordination. The purpose is to improve efficiency of CPSEs [central public sector enterprises], effective monetisation of their resources that are lying idle and nudge them to promote ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ [Self-reliant India] by procuring goods and services from within the country, particularly from MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises],” one of the officials cited above said.The change should be seen in the context of this year’s budget announcement, where the finance minister placed special emphasis on asset monetisation, the second official said. Delivering her budget speech on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “A ‘National Monetization Pipeline’ of potential brownfield infrastructure assets will be launched.”“CPSEs have idle or underutilised assets. For example, 156 of them have over 4,000 acres of prime land in various parts of the country, which could be made productive assets. Besides, the change will also facilitate government’s disinvestment programme,” this official added. The budget on February 1 proposed monetising of land through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and closure of sick or loss-making CPSEs. The government has budgeted for ₹1.75 lakh crore as receipts from disinvestment in 2021-22.Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners, said: “As stated by the finance minister in her Budget speech, the transfer of DPE to the finance ministry gives a strong indication of the government’s push towards disinvestments. The fiscal stress brought on by the pandemic has exacerbated the need for privatisation of public enterprises and monetisation of under-utilised assets. This move would also allow effective enablement of PSEs to align with the vision of boosting the domestic ecosystem by encouraging procurement through Indian MSMEs.” The change in ministerial control of DPE was effected through a notification issued by the Cabinet Secretariat on July 6. Accordingly, the finance ministry will now have six departments – the department of economic affairs (DEA), the department of revenue (DoR), the department of expenditure (DoE), the department of financial services (DFS), the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), and DPE. The ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises has now been renamed as the ministry of heavy industries (MHI).The ministerial restructuring was, however, made public on Wednesday, hours before a cabinet expansion. The gazette notification said that the changes “shall come into force at once.” According to the notification, DPE will coordinate matters of general policy affecting all public sector enterprises (PSEs), evaluate and monitor their performances, and review their capital expenditure plans. It will also undertake the “residual work relating to erstwhile Bureau of Public Enterprises [BPE] including Industrial Management Pool [of talented managers],” the notification said.Other functions of DPE include counselling, training and rehabilitation of employees in CPSEs under voluntary retirement scheme, rendering advice relating to revival, restructuring or closure of a state-run firm and conferring them ‘Ratna’ status. Based on financial performances such as turnover and net worth criteria, CPSEs are given ‘Maharatna’, ‘Navratna’ and ‘Miniratna’ status.MHI will continue to administer the capital goods and automobile industries. As per the notification, it will continue to oversee 44 areas including central public sector enterprises Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, HMT Ltd, Scooters India Ltd, Cement Corporation of India Ltd, Hindustan Newsprint Ltd, and Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-merges-dept-of-enterprises-with-finance-ministry-101625685741289.html
08-07-2021||India||Health minister changed over Covid-19 crisis||Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday was dropped as India’s minister for health and family welfare, a decision that appeared to stem from his inadequate handling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, leading to an erosion of trust in the government as health facilities were overrun particularly during the second national wave.Harsh Vardhan (66), an ENT specialist who practised in east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar until early 1990s, also held the science and technology, and earth sciences portfolios.The second Covid wave, which took a heavy toll from early April to early June -- with the total number of cases and deaths peaking at 414,188 and 4,192 respective in terms of seven-day averages -- exposed the health ministry’s inability to predict such as massive surge, and gaping holes in country’s health care delivery system. A significant number of patients literally died gasping for breath in their homes for want of a hospital bed (both general and ICU), and essential supplies such as oxygen or medicines.Experts said the preparedness for, and handling of, the second wave was inadequate.“We celebrated a little too early; there was insufficient learning from our failures that was quite obvious during the second wave. Health was the core line ministry, and its job should have been to see what was promised regarding health systems was followed through. In the second wave there was a huge gap between what was needed and what was there, which eroded the trust in the government, especially during the second wave,” said Dr Chadrakant Lahariya, a senior public health expert.Another part of the pandemic response that could not keep pace with the requirements imposed by rise in cases was the pace of vaccination.While India offered doses in a graded manner in four phases, its procurement policy and delivery mechanism, coupled with vaccine hesitancy and what appeared to be mixed messages by the health ministry, resulted in a roll-out that appeared suboptimal.For example, in the first three and half months of the campaign (from January 16 to April 30), India administered first doses to 125.38 million people, of which 88% were above the age of 45, while remaining 12% were given to health care and frontline workers in the 18-45 age group. When it expanded the drive to all adults from May 1, India administered 73.04 million first doses to people in the 18-45 age group until June 20. In all, until another policy shift on June 21, 275 million doses were given (225.2 million first and 49.8 second), accounting for 24% of the adult population covered by at least one dose over a five-month period.To be sure, vaccination picked up after June 21, reaching a high of 6.4 million daily doses (7-day average) on June 26. This pace has slowed down again over the past week to just above 4 million daily doses on average, though India remains confident of achieving 100% vaccination by the year-end.“The government should have put in advanced purchase orders; what they did instead is purchase what the manufacturers had on their shelves. So the companies produced the doses at their own pace instead of the government dictating how many doses they need and by when. Now, the vaccination drive needs to focus on people who are likely to die if they get the infection; something which we were doing in January and February when we should have been carrying out large scale vaccination campaign to prevent the second wave,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Doctors also complained about the lack of adequate support from the government.“As the health minister of this country, he should have led from the front, especially when dealing with safety concerns of people from the medical fraternity who were managing the crisis in adverse conditions. He couldn’t give assurances to health care professionals that their safety will be ensured. The PM himself had to intervene and speak to doctors at least twice, the recent being on the doctors’ day. Ideally, this should have been done through the health minister,” said Dr JA Jayalal, president, Indian Medical Association.The health minister also made several gaffes in the form of statements that did not stem from adequate scientific knowledge.In March 2021, he said that India was in the “endgame” of Covid-19 pandemic. “We are in the endgame of the Covid-19 pandemic in India. Unlike most other countries, we have a steady supply of Covid-19 vaccines that are safe with proven immunogenicity and efficacy.”A month later, cases were at an all-time high.During his tenure, Harsh Vardhan also received flak for endorsing alternative therapy products. He was present at the relaunch of Coronil termed to be “first evidence-based medicine for coronavirus”; and endorsed Ayurvedic Covid-19 treatment and Ayush 64.“We could have done much better than what we have done; a lot of unnecessary animosity could have been avoided,” said Jayalal.Harsh Vardhan did not comment on the matter till the time of print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-changed-over-covid-19-crisis-101625685072619.html
08-07-2021||India||A gentleman actor whose intensity shone on screen: Waheeda Rehman on Dilip Kumar||Dilip saab was suffering for a long time and we all knew that this day would come. But we also knew that when he leaves us, we would feel really upset. This is the strangeness of human reactions, you see.My first film with Dilip saab was Dil Diya Dard Liya (1966), and while on the set with him, I realised that despite being such a big star and a great actor, he was extremely friendly. On the first day of our shoot, I was a bit nervous. As a new actor, when you work with someone so big and established, it’s natural to feel like that. But, he himself walked over to me and asked, ‘How are you feeling?’, and that put me at ease. He was that sort of a person.I did three more films with him — Ram Aur Shyam (1967), Aadmi (1968), and Mashaal (1984) — and we both shared a good bond and were very comfortable with each other.Dil Diya unfortunately, did not do well at the box office. So, when we started working on Aadmi, Dilip saab told me, “I promise you, abki baar achhi picture banaunga, aur yeh jaroor chalegi” [This time around, we’ll make a good film and it will do well.] I told him, “Dilip saab koshish toh sabhi karte hain, kabhie kabhie miss ho jata hai” [Everyone tries their best. It’s a miss, sometimes.] But he insisted and said, “No, no, no! It has to be a good movie!”He was very, very intense. At that time, no one else depicted that degree of intensity on the screen. He was a combination of a great star and a great actor, which is so rare. At the same time, he was a gentleman: very polite, full of tameez.Back then, there was barely any socialising outside of work. In fact, never. Actors used to work together on the set and then go back to their respective homes. I was friendly only with Sunil Dutt and Nargis. I last met Dilip saab some nine or 10 years ago. It was at the celebrations of his birthday at his home and it was a big bash, like a wedding. He had already started to lose his memory, so at first, he could not recognise me. He was sitting on the sofa and when I went to greet him and said aadaab, and he looked at me with a quizzicla expression. So, Saira, his wife, said, “Saab yeh Waheeda ji hain” [This is Waheedaji]. His brother, Ehsaan also reminded him.I could see that he was struggling to place me, but he wasn’t able to. He got tears in his eyes and seeing him struggle, I also got teary-eyed. It wasn’t just me. Whoever came and shook hands with him, he struggled to recognise them. His expression seemed to say: ‘I know this person but what is their name?’ It felt terrible and made me very sad. I felt bad for him that the people he has worked with, laughed and made memories with, now he is struggling to recognise them. After that I never met him.However, Sairaji used to call sometimes, but we seldom met. The film industry is such a place that the moment the film is over, you don’t meet your co-stars at all, unless and until, god forbid, someone falls is very sick, so you call up that person to check on them. It is a very strange industry. We work day and night, sometimes months together, shoot outdoors also, but once the project is over, we start working on new productions, new films, and with new people.We will miss Dilip saab. Back in the day, whenever a newcomer came into the film industry, the only thing they would say is, “We want to become Dilip Kumar.” If someone said this before me, I would respond: ”It is not impossible to be like Dilip Kumar but you will have to work really hard, dedicate and devote your heart into what you do.” But then, we all know, there was only one Dilip Kumar. The name that he has left behind, no one can ever come close to that. And it would never get erased from the history of the Hindi film industry. May god bless his soul.-- As told to Monika Rawal Kukreja||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-gentleman-actor-whose-intensity-shone-on-screen-waheeda-rehman-on-dilip-kumar-101625684755298.html
08-07-2021||India||Doctors raise demand for Protection Act in meeting with union DGHS||New Delhi: The union director general of health services met with representatives of doctors’ associations to come up with measures to prevent violence against healthcare providers. A central act making violence against healthcare worker punishable was suggested by the doctors and nurses present in the meeting. A previous attempt in 2019 to draft a similar law that made violence against doctors punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment was stalled after home ministry said a special law was not feasible as health is a state subject. Dr Sunil Kumar, the director general of health services, stressed on preventing overcrowding of patients and relatives, filling up of vacancies, and allowing nurses to optimise their work, according to the representatives of Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) present in the meeting. Dr Manish Kumar, president of Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) said, “Almost all the demands made by us, including the Central Act, was accepted in the meeting. We are waiting for the minutes of the meeting.” This comes after the doctors held a nation-wide black ribbon protest in June after several instances of violence were highlighted. On June 1, a doctor posted at a Covid Care Centre in Assam was assaulted by the relatives of a patient who succumbed to the virus. On April 26, relatives of a deceased patient vandalised the emergency ward and injured several employees of Delhi’s Indraprastha Apollo hospital. “Currently, 21 states have local laws but what we need is a strong central law to protect doctors from violence...,” the Indian Medical Association during the protest had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-raise-demand-for-protection-act-in-meeting-with-union-dghs-101625684901231.html
08-07-2021||India||Take quick decision on appeal by life convicts: SC to 3 states||New Delhi: Governments in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh will have to decide applications for premature release of life convicts who have served 14 years within eight months of the requests being filed, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday, ordering the three states to implement a scheme drafted by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) on an experimental basis. The top court involved NASLA in January this year after a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta came across a case in Chhattisgarh where a convict who completed 14 years imprisonment had to wait another three years for his remission plea to be decided. NALSA got back to the top court in February this year, telling the bench that there were 1,649 prisoners languishing in prisons awaiting a decision on their requests. Besides, it said, there were 431 prisoners who were eligible to file a request but hadn’t applied, 83 prisoners sought legal aid to apply and 752 prisoners had their applications rejected.The findings convinced the bench to ask NALSA to study state policies and come up with a uniform scheme to deal with remission applications.Advocate Gaurav Agrawal who appeared for NALSA informed the court that a uniform scheme would be problematic since states had different policies, criteria on the eligibility of prisoners and the period that life convicts need to serve. Even the authority empowered to approve remission requests were different. In some states, the jail officials are empowered while some others require a recommendation of an advisory committee.One common factor, NALSA’s analysis concluded, was that there were no deadlines for the authorities. The NALSA scheme approved by the Supreme Court on Wednesday involves three steps. It gives states three months for identification and collection of data about eligible prisoners by prison authorities, three months for a recommendation by Sentence Review Board (SRB) or Advisory Board, and two more months to the state government for missing the final orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-quick-decision-on-appeal-by-life-convicts-sc-to-3-states-101625684782555.html
08-07-2021||India||Juhi Chawla’s pleas against fine frivolous: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday termed as “frivolous” and said that it was shocked at pleas by Bollywood actress Juhi Chawla seeking waiver of ₹20 lakh cost imposed on them for their plea challenging 5G wireless network technology.Justice J R Midha, who retired from the Delhi high court on Wednesday, said that he had never seen such a frivolous application in his judicial career.“I was shocked to see such an application. This court took a lenient view and did not issue contempt when a clear case was made out... I was inclined. You say the court had no power to impose costs (but) the court has the power to issue contempt,” the court said as it took strong exception to the application.Chawla had filed applications for waiver of costs and replacing the word “dismissed” in the judgment with “rejected”.The court’s reaction came after Chawla’s counsel, senior Advocate Meet Malhotra, after withdrawing the application for waiver of costs, said that costs would either be deposited in a week or ten days or legal remedies against the same would be taken.“I’m yet to see a person in my judicial career who is not willing to pay court fees,” it added.“On one hand you move the frivolous application and on the other hand, you withdraw the application and plaintiffs are not even willing to gracefully deposit the costs,” the court said.The court, however, granted one week to Chawla to deposit the fine.Advocate Deepak Khosla appearing for Chawla said that the court fee has already been deposited. Malhotra clarified that the stand was not that the costs would not be paid, and did not even press the application for its waiver. In June, the high court had dismissed the lawsuit by Chawla and others against the setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and slapped a cost of ₹20 lakh.The court had described the plea as “defective”, “abuse of process of law” and filed for “gaining publicity”. The judge had also issued a show-cause notice to a “disruptor” who started singing songs from Chawla’s movies, halting the proceedings thrice on June 2 in the matter.It had also asked the Delhi police to identify the person and take action against him.An unidentified person disrupted virtual proceedings of the Delhi high court thrice on June 2... until he was muted and finally thrown off the online proceedings because the participant did not stop singing songs from popular movies of actor Juhi Chawla -- one of the plaintiffs in the plea being heard by the judges.On his farewell on Wednesday, Justice Midha played a song from a Bollywood movie Sadak 2 as the last thanksgiving to his own life.“The last thanksgiving I want to give is to my own life for giving me this opportunity,” he said.At the full court reference, Midha said that he is retiring with a lot of satisfaction.“A judge’s job is to impart justice. I’m demitting office today with the fullest satisfaction of having discharged my responsibility as per the constitution, be it the district court or this Court,” he said.Justice Midha was appointed as an Additional judge from April 11, 2008, and a permanent judge from July 6, 2011.He had recently given a landmark judgment that allowed the citizens to feed community or stray dogs ending a long-lasting fight between the neighbours. He also formulated Special Scheme for Motor Accident Claims and also gave a ruling that conviction of the husband for the offence of murder amounts to cruelty to the wife and held to be a valid ground for divorce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/juhi-chawla-s-pleas-against-fine-frivolous-delhi-hc-101625684541191.html
08-07-2021||India||Monsoon likely to revive from today, says IMD||After a hiatus of around 10 days, the monsoon is likely to revive gradually from Thursday onwards and spread across northwest India over the weekend, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said. There has been a 5% deficiency in the rain in the country since June 1. Central India is 7% rain deficient, northwest India 13%, and east and northeast 2%.IMD scientists are expecting active monsoon conditions in northwest India around July 16-17 when a low-pressure system is expected to move there. Moist easterly winds in the lower levels from the Bay of Bengal are likely to establish gradually over parts of eastern India from July 8 onwards. They are likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10. Accordingly, the southwest monsoon is likely to advance into the remaining parts of west Uttar Pradesh, more parts of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi around July 10, IMD said in its bulletin on Wednesday.A deviation in the predicted weather pattern has led to delayed and scanty rainfall in most parts of the country. The subdued monsoon has coincided with the critical period of sowing and paddy transplantation. It is likely to impact agricultural activities such as sowing and transplantation of crops, irrigation scheduling, and power requirements.A western disturbance is also likely to impact the Western Himalayas and parts of northwest India around July 10. “There will be rain over northwest India on July 10 and 11 and then an active spell of monsoon is likely around July 16. This is because a low-pressure system is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal on July 11 which will travel north-westwards covering central India and move towards Rajasthan. It is likely to bring a lot of rain in its path,” said DS Pai, who heads IMD’s climate research and services. “A western disturbance is also likely to affect the region around July 10, but it may not weaken the monsoon winds. Sometimes monsoon winds interact with westerlies to bring heavy rain.”RMSI, a global disaster risk management firm, said on Tuesday that the mid-latitude westerly winds and westerly trough approaching northwest India would hold back the rapid monsoon advancement during the next week. So, Delhi and other north-western areas would not get much rain as should normally be the case after the arrival of the monsoon.Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather, said western disturbances have been forming one after the other but they are feeble. “The Madden Julian Oscillation (characterised by a band of rain clouds moving across the tropics) is likely to be in the Indian Ocean in the next couple of days which will enhance monsoon flow. So, we do not expect the monsoon to weaken.”IMD said scattered to widespread rainfall was very likely in Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh from July 8 onwards. Isolated very heavy rainfall was also very likely in Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on April 8, West Madhya Pradesh on April 11, and East Madhya Pradesh on July 10. IMD said scattered to widespread rainfall was also very likely in northwest India from July 9 onwards. It added isolated heavy rainfall was also very likely in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh from July 9 and in East Rajasthan from July 10 onwards. IMD said due to the strengthening of monsoon over the Arabian Sea and likely formation of a low-pressure area over the west-central Bay of Bengal around July 11, enhanced rainfall activity was very likely along the west coast from July 9 onwards.Due to the revival of monsoon from July 8, rainfall intensity and distribution is very likely to decrease over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura from July 9 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-revive-from-today-says-imd-101625684421248.html
08-07-2021||India||SC orders CBI probe in Haryana land case||NEW DELHI The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the culpability of Haryana government functionaries and officials for releasing nearly 400-acre land in Rohtak from acquisition, and granting colonisation licences on 280 acres to real estate developer Uddar Gagan Properties in 2005-06, when Bhupinder Singh Hooda was the chief minister.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Uday U Lalit expressed dissatisfaction with the inquiries conducted by the Haryana government, saying it was time to hand over the probe to the central agency for a thorough investigation into illegalities and the role of officials in releasing the land to Uddar Gagan.This the second instance of the CBI investigating the alleged complicity of Haryana government officials and private builders in tainted land deals when Bhupinder Singh Hooda was the chief minister between 2005 and 2014. The CBI, which was probing the land deal in Gurugram’s Manesar at the instance of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, was told by the Supreme Court in March 2018 to also look into substantial sums allegedly paid to “middlemen” for the Manesar deal.The bench, which included Justice Ajay Rastogi and Justice Aniruddha Bose, expressed anguish at the government’s inaction in fastening the responsibility of its officials for their role in releasing 400 acres of land in Rohtak.“This court delivered a judgment in 2016, and five years down the line, we are still groping in the dark. We wanted the fraud to be unearthed, and we wanted those involved should be proceeded against. But the whole thing looks like a subterfuge now,” observed the bench.It lamented that the latest inquiry report by an IAS officer, Anurag Rastogi, flagged just a “systemic failure” and did not fix anyone’s responsibility.“According to you, everything is a systemic failure and nothing is wrong. But there will naturally be somebody and more people behind this whole thing,” the bench told Haryana’s senior additional advocate general Anil Grover.The judges accepted the submission of senior advocate and amicus curiae Joydeep Gupta that the present case warrants a CBI probe since all inquiries by the state governments have failed to pinpoint the culpability of any official of the state government. Advocate Kanika Agnihotri, who represents real estate developer Uddar Gagan Properties, was present during the hearing.Anil Grover, on behalf of the state government, opposed a CBI probe, saying that the facts of this case were entirely different from the facts of Manesar’s land acquisition case where middlemen were said to be involved. He supported the findings of the inquiry reports by Rastogi and the previous report by retired high court judge RS Madan.But the court turned down the submission and recorded in its order: “Having considered the submissions of the amicus and his contentions about the previous order in Rameshwar Vs Haryana, in our view the matter must be made over to CBI to consider all the issues pertaining to direction 33.9 in Uddar Gagan judgment (relating to the role of persons responsible).”The bench clarified that it has not pronounced upon the merits of the matter which shall be looked into by the CBI independently and the agency will submit a report in the court.Nearly 850 acres of land was proposed to be acquired in 2002 for residential and commercial sectors in Rohtak by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). However, the award was passed for around 422 acres in April 2005.In March 2005, realtor Uddar Gagan Properties Ltd entered into a collaboration agreement with some farmers, whose land was acquired to develop a colony. The builder applied for a licence to develop a colony on 280 acres.The licences were granted by the town and country planning director in June 2006, and the corresponding land was released from acquisition. The licences were addressed to the owners but remitted to the builder.Upholding the land acquisition process, the top court had in May 2006 ordered that the land will vest in HUDA free from all encumbrances, adding all land-release orders in favour of the builder for the land covered stood quashed.The Manesar case pertained to the alleged purchase of 400 acres of land from farmers for ₹100 crore when the actual worth (according to market rate) was ₹1,600 crore. The purchase, according to the CBI, was made during 2004-2007, under the “threat and false apprehension of acquisition of the land by the state government” while the officials continued giving licences to the private realtors for developing the land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-cbi-probe-in-haryana-land-case-101625684361335.html
08-07-2021||India||In memoriam Dilip Kumar: The thespian’s last bow||For most of us, the passing of Dilip Kumar is a tragic event, the end of an era. We know that he was one of the greatest actors — in international terms, even — of the 20th century.But what we may forget is that Dilip Kumar was much more than an actor. In many ways, he was an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of a post-Independence generation that dreamt of an India that overcame the divisions of religion and progressed to take its place as one of the great nations of the world.In the 1950s, when the term nation-building was in vogue, and Dilip Kumar was already a big star, Jawaharlal Nehru enlisted him for the task of helping build up morale in the young nation. He fronted several social welfare programmes, starred in patriotic short films and appeared at events designed to promote national integration or to raise funds for the armed forces. He did all this for free; it never occurred to him to ask for money when it came to patriotic causes.There was, of course, always an elephant in the room. In the years immediately following Partition, Dilip Kumar was the most popular Muslim in India. He was as popular as all of today’s Khans put together and far more respected. Nehru used him to demonstrate that though Pakistan was a Muslim homeland, India was a secular country where Muslims could rise to the very top and be loved by all Indians regardless of their religion.Dilip Kumar was happy to help but always slightly awkward when people mentioned his religion. How did it matter that he was a Muslim? Why couldn’t he just be treated as another Indian, he would ask?But, of course, it did matter. He was born Yusuf Khan and all his friends called him Yusuf. He changed his name, it was widely believed, to appeal across the religious divide. He always denied that interpretation. Many names had been considered, he said, and he almost chose the name Jehangir, but Dilip Kumar just sounded better.Well perhaps.But it is hard to deny that throughout his career, his Muslimness never ceased to matter. I first met him when I was a small boy and the censors were demanding scores of cuts in his film Ganga Jamuna. My father was his lawyer and he was shocked to find that one of the cuts demanded was that the last words of the character played by Dilip Kumar should be cut. The words were “Hey Ram” and the censors said they could not accept him saying those words on screen.My father pushed the point and the censors finally came back with a weak explanation. Well, they said, the character was a dacoit. How could he use the same last words as Gandhiji? Finally, and with bad grace, the censors conceded the point.For all this, Dilip Kumar never took the easy way out. I have been searching my memory but I cannot come up with a single Muslim he played on screen with the exception of Salim in Mughal-e-Azam. He was an Indian, he said, and he would not be tied to any particular religion or community.But that was not how everybody else saw it. In the early sixties, the Calcutta police arrested a young man who they said was a Pakistani agent. They recovered a diary from him which included the names of many Muslims, including Dilip Kumar. A team arrived in Mumbai, raided the house of these Muslims on the grounds that they might all be spies. Even Dilip Kumar was not spared. They came to check if there was a secret transmitter in his house that he used to communicate with his Pakistani handlers! For a time, it even seemed possible that he would be arrested.It is worth remembering that all of this happened when Nehru was prime minister. Even then, there was no dearth of prejudice. Decades later, the Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Nirupam launched an attack on Dilip Kumar’s so-called divided loyalties and said to me in an interview that Dilip Kumar’s expenses were met by Pakistan. Nirupam’s reward was to be granted admission to the Congress, where he became Rahul Gandhi’s favourite.So no single party has a monopoly on communal prejudice.The last time I interviewed Dilip Kumar was for HT Brunch when Mughal-e-Azam was re-released a decade or so ago. His health was already failing but he was eager to talk. As always, he did not dwell on the bad times and the prejudice. He had earned the love of Indians across all communities, he said. Why talk about his bad times?He had, almost throughout his life, a curiously detached view of his career. He often acted as though Dilip Kumar the star was a different person from him. I met him in the early 1980s on the sets of Kranti, one of the films that launched his comeback as a sort of character-actor. I asked him why he took the role. (The film was horrible). He said, “Well, I thought about it. And if it is the beginning of a new chapter for Dilip Kumar, then it has to be the kind of cinema that works today.”In his heyday, he was famously choosy, making just one film a year and (it was said) taking control of the movie from the director and the scriptwriter. This meant that he made some very good movies. But there were also many stinkers.Often his reasons for turning down films seem flawed in retrospect. The British director David Lean pushed him to play Sharif Ali in Lawrence of Arabia. Dilip Kumar turned down the film arguing that he would not be convincing as an Arab. The part went to Omar Sharif who became a star.When I asked him if he regretted that decision, he was philosophical. “How do you know the film would have been a hit if I had taken the role?” he smiled. “I would have been so unconvincing that I could have sunk the film!”He outlived all of his contemporaries but even at the end, when he was old and frail, lovingly cared for by his wife Saira Banu (“ever since I was a school girl”, she once told me, “my ambition was to marry Dilip Kumar”), he never gave up on the things he believed in.He still talked about patriotism, about the future of India and about communal harmony. By then ‘nation-building’ had become a punch line and ‘secularism’ had fallen from favour.But not for Dilip Kumar. Till his last breath, he believed.Vir Sanghvi writes a column called the Taste for the Hindustan TimesTRIBUTES TO THE ACTOR
08-07-2021||India||Petrol at ₹100/L in Delhi, hits century in all metros||Petrol prices crossed ₹100 per litre in Delhi and Kolkata on Wednesday after fuel retailers raised prices by 35 paise per litre even as international crude oil prices slumped on Tuesday following an inconclusive meeting of the producers’ cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) -- over supply cuts. Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their respective international benchmarks of previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. Pump rates of auto fuels rose in India on Wednesday even as international oil prices fell sharply the previous day. An impasse in the meeting of OPEC+ saw profit booking on Tuesday that led to a sharp 3.4% decline in Brent crude to $74.53 per barrel after it hit the session’s peak at $77.84, the highest since October 2018. The US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also fell 2.4% to $73.37 that day, after hitting $76.98 during the intraday trade, its highest since November 2014. The international oil price rally resumed on Wednesday. Brent opened weak on Wednesday, but gained $1.40, or 1.88%, to $75.93 a barrel during intraday trades. The Wednesday revision of India’s domestic fuel rates is the 36th hike in last 65 days that has made petrol costlier by ₹9.81 per litre and diesel by ₹8.8 a litre since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared. Petrol is now priced at ₹100.21 per litre and diesel at ₹89.59 a litre in New Delhi. While fuel rates of state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes, local levies, and transport surcharges. With the latest hike, petrol rates in all major metros have crossed ₹100 per litre. In Kolkata, petrol is priced at ₹100.23 per litre and diesel at ₹92.50 a litre. The cost of one litre of petrol in financial capital Mumbai is now ₹106.25 and diesel, ₹97.09. High fuel prices have an inflationary effect on the economy. Fuel prices have a weightage of 6.8% (fuel and light) in the consumer price index of CPI, a measure of retail inflation. The latest CPI number, for May, is 6.3%, above the Reserve bank of India’s comfort level of 6%. The highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar where pumps are selling petrol at ₹111.50 per litre and diesel at ₹102.78 a litre. Surging international oil rates and skewed domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps. In Delhi, central levies account for 33.29% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.07%, according to an official data of July 1. On diesel, central taxes account for around 35.66% while state taxes, about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. The unrelenting upward movement of fuel rates since May 4 has already seen petrol prices crossing the ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and Union territories (UTs) of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali and Darjeeling. Even as international oil prices saw volatility since May 4, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude falling to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest over the past 46 days, petrol and diesel rates went up on May 21 by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre, respectively. According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies are recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one UT. During the 66-day pause on price hikes, state-run retailers also reduced petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively, in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010, and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-at-100-l-in-delhi-hits-century-in-all-metros-101625684304137.html
08-07-2021||India||UP approves Kanwar Yatra amid pandemic||Lucknow/Varanasi: The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government has decided to allow the annual Kanwar Yatra from July 25, senior government officials said on Wednesday. But enforcing Covid-19 guidelines and arranging Ganga water for the devotees with Uttarakhand blocking access to Haridwar will be the major challenges. Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal said detailed guidelines regarding the yatra will be issued soon. “Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked us to coordinate with neighbouring Bihar and Uttarakhand and ensure Covid guidelines are followed during the yatra,” Sehgal said. Another senior government official said on condition of anonymity that top officials were figuring out how to coordinate with the Uttarakhand authorities after the government there cancelled the yatra again due to the pandemic and asked the devotees not to come to Haridwar to collect Ganga water. “We are thinking of different options if devotees are not allowed to visit Haridwar to collect Ganga Jal. One option could be to provide water from Haridwar through tankers to the devotees in UP; the other could be to persuade the devotees to collect Ganga water by staying within UP,” the official cited above said. The Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage carried out by the devotees of Lord Shiva who collect water from River Ganga (usually at Haridwar in Uttarakhand) and offer that at Shiva temples in their respective states. The devotees, called kanwariyas, come from far-off places, covering hundreds of kilometres on foot, and visit places along the Ganga. Apart from Haridwar, they visit Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand and Sultanganj in Bihar. Last year, the pilgrimage was not held in Uttar Pradesh due to the pandemic restrictions. Nearly 50 lakh devotees have participated in this annual pilgrimage in the past, including around 10 lakh people only from the districts of west UP that are closer to Haridwar.However, kanwar yatras in the past have been mired in communal violence too. This time, said UP additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar, directions have been issued to ensure that no meat shops operate along the yatra routes to prevent any communal flare-up. Kumar also said that a plan has been chalked out to ensure no law-and-order problems are created due to restrictions imposed by the neighbouring states. “We are in touch with Uttarakhand state authorities and trying to sort out the issue. We are also trying to coordinate with the Bihar authorities,” Kumar said. The ADG also said that the police have been asked to make all necessary arrangements like preparing route charts for the devotees, intensifying patrolling, maintaining aerial surveillance through drones on the yatra route, etc. District police chiefs have also been asked to impart behavioural training to the personnel on ground to deal with the devotees. In Varanasi, which is another preferred spot to offer Ganga water to Lord Shiva at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, preparations have already been done following which Varanasi commissioner of police (CP) A Satish Ganesh held a meeting with senior police officials. In Varanasi, over 30 lakh kanwariyas visit the Shiva temple to offer Ganga Jal and Sangam Jal (water from the confluence of the Ganga,Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers in Prayagraj).The Varanasi police commissioner said any decision regarding Kanwar Yatra taken by the government will be implemented. He said police personnel deployed for the security of Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Gyanvapi Mosque would be imparted behavioural training to deal with the devotees. Over 50,000 devotees visit the Kashi Vishwanth Temple daily on other days in the Hindu month of Shravan, while the number goes up to 3 lakh on all Mondays during the month. They include kanwariyas from Prayagraj, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Ghazipur and various other districts. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, only around 30,000 devotees offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple on the Mondays of Shravan. The figure was about 10,000 daily on the other days of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upapproves-kanwar-yatra-amid-pandemic-101625684303459.html
08-07-2021||India||Health minister Harsh Vardhan changed over Covid-19 crisis||New Delhi: Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday was dropped as India’s minister for health and family welfare, a decision that appeared to stem from his inadequate handling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, leading to an erosion of trust in the government as health facilities were overrun particularly during the second national wave.Harsh Vardhan (66), an ENT specialist who practised in east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar until early 1990s, also held the science and technology, and earth sciences portfolios.The second Covid wave, which took a heavy toll from early April to early June -- with the total number of cases and deaths peaking at 414,188 and 4,192 respective in terms of seven-day averages -- exposed the health ministry’s inability to predict such as massive surge, and gaping holes in country’s health care delivery system. A significant number of patients literally died gasping for breath in their homes for want of a hospital bed (both general and ICU), and essential supplies such as oxygen or medicines.Experts said the preparedness for, and handling of, the second wave was inadequate.“We celebrated a little too early; there was insufficient learning from our failures that was quite obvious during the second wave. Health was the core line ministry, and its job should have been to see what was promised regarding health systems was followed through. In the second wave there was a huge gap between what was needed and what was there, which eroded the trust in the government, especially during the second wave,” said Dr Chadrakant Lahariya, a senior public health expert.Another part of the pandemic response that could not keep pace with the requirements imposed by rise in cases was the pace of vaccination.While India offered doses in a graded manner in four phases, its procurement policy and delivery mechanism, coupled with vaccine hesitancy and what appeared to be mixed messages by the health ministry, resulted in a roll-out that appeared suboptimal.For example, in the first three and half months of the campaign (from January 16 to April 30), India administered first doses to 125.38 million people, of which 88% were above the age of 45, while remaining 12% were given to health care and frontline workers in the 18-45 age group. When it expanded the drive to all adults from May 1, India administered 73.04 million first doses to people in the 18-45 age group until June 20. In all, until another policy shift on June 21, 275 million doses were given (225.2 million first and 49.8 second), accounting for 24% of the adult population covered by at least one dose over a five-month period.To be sure, vaccination picked up after June 21, reaching a high of 6.4 million daily doses (7-day average) on June 26. This pace has slowed down again over the past week to just above 4 million daily doses on average, though India remains confident of achieving 100% vaccination by the year-end.“The government should have put in advanced purchase orders; what they did instead is purchase what the manufacturers had on their shelves. So the companies produced the doses at their own pace instead of the government dictating how many doses they need and by when. Now, the vaccination drive needs to focus on people who are likely to die if they get the infection; something which we were doing in January and February when we should have been carrying out large scale vaccination campaign to prevent the second wave,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Doctors also complained about the lack of adequate support from the government.“As the health minister of this country, he should have led from the front, especially when dealing with safety concerns of people from the medical fraternity who were managing the crisis in adverse conditions. He couldn’t give assurances to health care professionals that their safety will be ensured. The PM himself had to intervene and speak to doctors at least twice, the recent being on the doctors’ day. Ideally, this should have been done through the health minister,” said Dr JA Jayalal, president, Indian Medical Association.The health minister also made several gaffes in the form of statements that did not stem from adequate scientific knowledge.In March 2021, he said that India was in the “endgame” of Covid-19 pandemic. “We are in the endgame of the Covid-19 pandemic in India. Unlike most other countries, we have a steady supply of Covid-19 vaccines that are safe with proven immunogenicity and efficacy.”A month later, cases were at an all-time high.During his tenure, Harsh Vardhan also received flak for endorsing alternative therapy products. He was present at the relaunch of Coronil termed to be “first evidence-based medicine for coronavirus”; and endorsed Ayurvedic Covid-19 treatment and Ayush 64.“We could have done much better than what we have done; a lot of unnecessary animosity could have been avoided,” said Jayalal.Harsh Vardhan did not comment on the matter till the time of print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-changed-over-covid-19-crisis-101625684242948.html
08-07-2021||India||12 ministers dropped in Cabinet rejig||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday dropped 12 ministers from his council, including 6 senior Cabinet ministers (the last time as many Cabinet ministers were dropped was in 1963 during the so-called Kamraj plan), effecting a significant makeover of his team based on performance; and addressing the need to accommodate allies, political imperatives, and requirements, of the next few years.One of the ministers, Thaawarchand Gehlot resigned after being named governor on Tuesday; another, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal `Nishank’ has been unwell for some time; and chemicals and fertilizers minister DV Sadananda Gowda may be needed in Bengaluru to manage the fluid political situation in the state (although there may have been other reasons for his exit as well). But the exits of health and science minister Harsh Vardhan, law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, and I&B and environment minister Prakash Javadekar came as a surprise. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Vardhan, Prasad, and Javadekar would be accommodated in the party organisation. The health minister’s exit is widely seen as a consequence of the patchy way in which India has managed Covid-19. The government has put up a brave front in the face of criticism, and maintained its response was adequate, but Vardhan’s exit may well be acknowledgement that things could have been handled better. Also dropped was Santosh Kumar Gangwar (independent charge of labour), and ministers of state Babul Supriyo, Dhotre Sanjay Shamrao, Rattan Lal Kataria, Pratap Chandra Sarangi and Debasree Chaudhuri have also been dropped. President Ram Nath Kovind has accepted all the resignations. Prasad, the law and IT minister has been removed at a time when India’s first data privacy bill is awaiting parliamentary approval, but people familiar with the matter said that his tussle with social media giants, especially Twitter, created unnecessary controversies for the government. Javadekar’s stint in the environment ministry was also marred by controversies especially when the draft environment impact assessment policy led to a fierce public storm. As Javadekar started getting hundreds and thousands of mails and protest letters, he sought to file a case under the stringent UAPA laws against young climate activists. The Opposition had also charged him for diluting major environmental laws to placate industries.Gowda started his innings in the first Modi government as the minister for law but was soon shifted to ministry for programme implementation and statistics. His regime at the chemical and fertilizers ministry may have been cut short after India reeled under shortage of crucial medicines and drugs during the second wave of the Covid. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to directly supervise availability of medicines and his office regularly called the chemical and fertilizers secretary for Covid review meetings,” said a senior official who asked not to be named. Pokhriyal tested positive for Covid19 in April , seemingly recovered, but then was admitted at AIIMS last month following complications. Union labour minister Gangwar, the people familiar with the matter said, may have paid the price for his ministry’s handling of the migrant crisis during the first wave of Covid-19. His ministry came under severe criticism as hapless migrant workers scrambled to return home last year during the lockdown. The labour ministry even failed to provide a realistic estimate of the returnees. The much-awaited labour reforms, a key agenda of the Modi government to push ease of doing business, also hit road bumps. All four labour codes — on wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational health and safety — have been approved in Parliament, but none have been implemented so far. The recent assembly election in West Bengal has also cast a shadow on the reshuffle. The BJP expected to win the state, but it was the TMC that won by a landslide. The two ministers of state, Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, from Bengal have been dropped after the BJP failed to do well in their areas. Supriyo, who brought little value as a minister in the Modi government, contested and lost the election. Dhotre Sanjay Shamrao and Rattan Lal Kataria have been dropped to accommodate fresh faces, the people familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-ministers-dropped-in-cabinet-rejig-101625684181147.html
08-07-2021||India||Blend of youth, skills and social engineering in Modi’s new Cabinet||New Delhi: The new Union council of ministers sworn in on Wednesday has more representation from socially and economically backward communities, women and people with administrative and legislative experience. The new team is being built within eye on the forthcoming state elections and in line with the party’s outreach towards the socially and economically deprived sections, part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) social engineering strategy. On Wednesday, 43 ministers were sworn in. Of these, 36 are new to the council of ministers; seven are ministers of state (including some ministers of state with independent charge) that have been promoted. Of the 43, seven are women and all are new to the council. The changes, and the resignation of 12 ministers from the council, takes the overall size of the new council of ministers to 77, excluding the prime minister. Of this, 11 are women, including two cabinet ministers (finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and women and child development minister Smriti Irani). There are 27 ministers from 19 other backward class (OBC) communities spread across 15 states; there are eight ministers from the scheduled tribes (ST) from across seven communities and 8 states; and there are 12 ministers from scheduled castes (SC) from across 12 communities and eight states. Five of the ministers from OBC communities and five from SCs/STs are of cabinet rank. There are also five ministers from minority communities (1 Muslim, 1 Sikh, 1 Christian, and 2 Buddhists), including 3 of cabinet rank. “The BJP walks the talk on inclusivity. We choose to go with the constitutional definition of who can be defined as a minority, while the opposition parties only consider Muslims as minorities. It is for the first time probably that proper representation has been given to all communities,” said former MP and spokesperson Bizay Sonkar Shastri. The emphasis on OBCs and SCs/STs -- together, a total of 47 members of the 77-strong council of ministers are from these -- isn’t surprising. The BJP’s success in many states has come from consolidating the traditionally fragmented Hindu vote across OBCs and by appealing to SCs/STs. For example, three of the four ministers inducted from Bengal -- Cooch Behar MP Nisith Pramanik, Alipurduar MP John Barla, and Bongaon MP Shantanu Thakur -- are from SC/ST communities. Shastri however said, that electoral compulsions are not the reason for the representation to backward and socially deprived sections. “The BJP’s mantra is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas. By giving proportionate representation to OBCs, SCs and STs in the council we have followed our Mantra. The decision also give people confidence that PM Modi believes in social justice and when given a chance delivers on it too,” said Shastri who is also a former chairman of the national commission for SC and ST. The average age of the council of ministers is now 58 years, against the average age of the previous council of 61 years. In all, 14 ministers are under the age of 50 years; of these, six are of cabinet rank. For instance, Pramanik is 35, Thakur 38 and Mirzapur MP Anupriya Patel 40. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always spoken of a new and aspirational India. The choice of candidates for the council of ministers is the implementation of this vision. It is the prerogative of the PM to decide the names of the council which reflects his vision,” said Nalin Kohli, national spokesperson of the BJP. According to people aware of the thinking behind the reshuffle, ministers were also chosen based on their administrative experience to address gaps that have emerged in certain areas -- health, for instance. Of all the ministers in the council, 46 have prior experience. The new council also has ministers with expertise across professional sectors. In all, of the total council of 77, there are 13 lawyers, six doctors, five engineers, seven former civil servants, three MBAs, and seven with Ph.Ds. For instance, Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia is a graduate from Harvard and Stanford universities and Rajya Sabha MP Ashwini Vaishnaw is a graduate of Wharton School of Business and IIT-Kanpur. The new council also addresses the electoral need of states going to polls in 2022. Of the 36 new faces, seven are from Uttar Pradesh and three (one new and two elevated) are from Gujarat, two important states that will vote for new assemblies in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blend-of-youth-skills-and-social-engineering-in-modi-s-new-cabinet-101625684123003.html
08-07-2021||India||Delimitation panel continues discussions in J&K||Srinagar: On the second day of its visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the Delimitation Commission on Wednesday met more than three dozen delegations of different political parties, civil society groups and government officials from south Kashmir’s four districts -- Kulgam, Pulwama, Shopian and Anantnag. In the evening, the commission members also met delegations from central and north Kashmir districts – Baramulla, Kupwara, Budgam, Ganderbal and Bandipore.After meeting 17 delegations in Srinagar on Tuesday, the commission members travelled to Pahalgam in Anantnag district on Wednesday and held meetings with delegations of several mainstream political parties -- including the National Conference (NC), Congress, Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP), People’s Conference, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- and groups from various districts of the Union territory. The mainstream parties were represented by their district presidents and other senior leaders. They presented their suggestions and apprehensions about the delimitation process, people aware of the developments said. “We presented them our point of view about delimitation process,” said Congress Pulwama district president Umar Jan soon after the meeting. National Conference leader Altaf Kaloo, who headed the delegation, said they presented the memorandum to the Commission. “We briefed them about the stand of our party vis a vis delimitation.”While the majority of the parties suggested that population should be the main criteria for reorganisation of constituencies, the People’s Conference and the CPI(M) demanded that the census figures of 2011 should be the benchmark for the exercise.Other delegations that met the panel in Pahalgam included members of Social and Vikas Foudnation, Anantnag , Gujjar Ethiad, Pahari Culture and Welfare Forum, Sheikh-ul –Alam Turst, Gujjar and Bakerwal Conference and Sikh Welfare Society.Former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai heads the commission that was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. The commission has nearly nine months left to complete the exercise. It will also carve constituencies to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the first time in Jammu & Kashmir. The delimitation issue was discussed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir on June 24. The Centre has sought the completion of the delimitation exercise before assembly polls are held there. However, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a grouping of political major parties such as the National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), said they were disappointed over the outcome of the meeting with Modi. The grouping has demanded the restoration of the region’s statehood before elections are held there. It also criticised the lack of “confidence-building measures”.At the time of going to press, the commission members were holding meetings with delegations of political parties from north and central Kashmir districts at a hotel in Pahalgam. Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP and Awami National Conference, both constituents of the PAGD, have decided not to meet the commission, with the former saying that there was a perception that the outcome of the process was pre-planned. On Thursday, the commission will head to the Jammu division to meet delegations from Jammu, Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Udhampur, Samba and Reasi districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-panel-continues-discussions-in-jk-101625684122491.html

Halwai was killed in an exchange of fire when he was taken to locate weapons at a hideout and he allegedly picked up his rifle and started firing at security forces, said officials familiar with the matter.“One of the oldest and top commanders of HM terror outfit, Mehrajuddin Halwai alias Ubaid, got neutralised in the Handwara encounter. He was involved in several terror crimes. A big success,” said Inspector General of Police (Kashmir), Vijay Kumar.Police said Halwai was a contemporary of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, who was killed in 2016.Halwai was apprehended at a checkpoint at Watyen Handwara on July 6, after he allegedly behaved suspiciously, the police said in a statement, adding that a grenade was also recovered from his possession.According to the police, Halwai was taken to the village of Pazipora Renan Kralgund Handwara on Wednesday, where he tried to pinpoint the location where he had kept his arms and ammunition.“Upon reaching the disclosed hideout location, Halwai picked up his hidden AK-47 rifle and started firing indiscriminately upon the joint search party which led to an encounter. In the ensuing firefight, the said terrorist got killed,” said the statement.Police said they have recovered arms and ammunition, including one AK-47 and four magazines, from the hideout. They added Halwai was a categorized A++ militant and was the group commander of HM. A diploma holder in computer applications, Halwai was responsible for “misusing social media and new methods of communication” for militancy, police said.“He was active since 2012 and was involved in several killings in north Kashmir. He had a long terror crime history including attacks on police, other security forces, and civilian atrocities,” the statement said. It listed a series of attacks in which Halwai and his associates were involved. The statement added the attacks led to the killings of 10 persons including five policemen. “The killed terrorist was well acquainted with modern means of communication by which he would communicate with other terrorists and plan & execute different terror activities on the ground. He was instrumental in motivating and recruitment of youth into terrorist ranks besides raising funds for the promotion of terrorist activities.”This is the third such encounter since June 3.On June 29, a day after the arrest of Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Nadeem Abrar Bhat, police said he was killed in an exchange of fire on Srinagar’s outskirts.On June 3, police said Amin Malik, a resident of south Kashmir’s Tral, was killed in an overnight joint operation after his arrest on May 30.

08-07-2021||India||Gangs of Bengaluru: The bloody history of gang wars in licence raj era||Bengaluru: On the morning of 25 January 1977, Gopi Thigalarpete, a wanted rowdy, was on his way to appear before a city court in Bengaluru. As soon as he entered the premises of the court number 2, a man, flanked with a dozen armed persons, approached him while concealing a sword under the shawl. In a matter of seconds, the gang brutally attacked Gopi, who ran inside the courtroom to take cover. Though Gopi survived the attack and later recorded his statement with police, the case was one of the rarest occasions where a judge became the complainant. The man involved in the murder attempt was identified as Jayaraj P, a criminal who is often acknowledged as the first don of Bengaluru. In her 2017 book ‘Bhais of Bengaluru’ (loosely translated as goons of Bengaluru), journalist Jyoti Shelar highlights how criminal gangs wreaked terror in several parts of the city. According to police, it was Jayaraj, a former employee of the Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL), who started an organised underworld in the city.After being fired from HAL for skipping work, Jayaraj, who was also a bodybuilder, took to extortion as his next career option. His fate in the crime world took a leap, when D Nataraj, the son-in-law of former two-term chief minister D Devaraj Urs, took him under his wing. Also Read: Gangs of Bengaluru: How IT boom changed the face of gang wars“Nataraj, in a press statement, had once said that he wanted to model Indira Brigade on the lines of Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (KGB)—the main security agency of the erstwhile Soviet Union. Nataraj envisioned Indira Brigade would function like a powerful and robust intelligence unit. The main aim of the brigade was to protect Indira Gandhi,” Shelar writes in her book. Jayaraj soon became the leader of the Indira Brigade, which, police say, was nothing but a gang of goons protected by some leaders of the ruling dispensation. “They were just goondas, who were at the disposal of Nataraj and chief minister Urs to be used as muscle for the political work. They started by harassing and looting couples at parks, but with political backing, they graduated to extortion, and most of them had attempt to murder or assault cases against them. The fear they created worked in the favour of the ruling party,” said a retired senior police officer, who didn’t wish to be named. Retired assistant commissioner of police BB Ashok Kumar said the gang was so notorious that they had their own torture rooms. “When we raided Jayaraj’s house in Wilson Garden once, we found a torture room in his backyard garage. In another instance, a police inspector of Wilson Garden was trying to trace Jayaraj, who had threatened him in the police station. He even kept a sword in front of the officer to scare him,” the retired officer recounted. However, his reign came to an end, with the murder attempt in the court premises. Soon after the attack in court, Jayaraj went into hiding, taking shelters in houses of several politicians. Around this time, Jayaraj also had a fallout with Nataraj, according to police officials. With Judge Chandrasekaraya’s testimony against Jayaraj, he was sentenced to 10-year imprisonment in 1979. The void created by Jayaraj’s arrest was filled by one of his old mates and a former navy sailor, Ramachandra Rao alias Kotwal Ramachandra. With Jayaraj in jail, Kotwal grew closer to the political masters. “He was a perverted character. He dressed well but he enjoyed harassing couples at parks. But over time, he took over Jayaraj’s extortion business and all the haftas (extortion money) paid to him. He was as intimidating as Jayaraj to the businessmen in the city,” said the retired officer. Jayaraj tried to control the extortion business from the prison and even sent his men around the city to ensure his presence was felt. However, Kotwal was simultaneously expanding his reach in the city. In 1984, after serving a reduced sentence of five years, Jayaraj came out of prison. Realising that Kotwal had taken over his empire, Jayaraj ordered attacks on Kotwal’s gang to send a strong message. After the battle for supremacy, which continued for over two years, on January 3, 1986, a compromise meeting was arranged between the two gangs. But instead of a compromise, Kotwal attempted to murder Jayaraj during that meeting. But the assassination attempt failed. Two months later, on March 22, 1986, Kotwal was hacked to death. Kotwal’s murder has been recounted in detail by one of the killers, Agni Sreedhar, a civil service aspirant-turned criminal, in his memoir, My Days in the Underworld—Rise of the Bangalore Mafia. Agni and his associates, Bachchan and Seetharam Shetty, were small-time criminals involved in intimidation and other minor crimes. In the book, he writes how Jayaraj approached him to execute Kotwal. Agni also writes how he made it clear to Jayaraj that the latter’s grouse against Kotwal was personal and that under no circumstances should his name be linked to the murder and the underworld. Jayaraj was ready to face murder charges as it would earn him the reputation of being the city’s most dreaded criminal. Finally, along with associates Bachchan and Shetty, Agni killed Kotwal in his sleep, at the latter’s farmhouse. Jayaraj and his men burned Kotwal’s body after the murder. In his book, Agni describes the murder by recounting Shetty’s statement to the police after he was arrested, three months later: “When the moon went behind the clouds, I looked at everyone. They all nodded. I hit Kotwal on the head with a machete. Bachchan landed blows to his neck and head. Sreedhar struck with a nunchaku. Kotwal died without offering resistance.”Following Shetty’s statement, police arrested Agni, Bachchan and Jayaraj in 1986. Agni and his associates served a jail term of 20 months under trial, before finally being released due to lack of evidence. Meanwhile, Jayaraj, who also came out of the jail on bail, realised that his power over the city had reduced over time. Police had by now cracked down on his gang, which opened an opportunity for another don to takeover Bengaluru’s underworld’s mantle. This time, the void was filled by Muthappa Rai, who worked as a clerk in the Vijaya Bank in Bengaluru. Although a clerk by title, he was involved in the loan recovery for the bank. During this time, he made contact with other criminals in the city and eventually got the job of managing a bar on Bengaluru’s MG Road, which was frequented by goons in the city. He managed to keep the bar from losing business and kept the local goons away, with help of a gang he recruited from his hometown in Dakshin Kannada district. The bar was eventually sold to Rai, who then emerged as the main don in the city. However, Jayaraj was still around. “Rai knew that taking Jayaraj out would make him the don of Bengaluru. He knew the risk involved, so he got in touch with his Mumbai contacts to arrange for firearms. They attacked him in front of the central jail in Bengaluru once and in a hospital another time. In both cases, Jayaraj escaped. During this time, Jayaraj decided to contest elections to gain more power, which made Rai and the gang desperate,” said the retired police officer, who didn’t want to be named. On 21 November 1989, one day before he would go to jail in the murder case, Jayaraj was returning from Siddapura police station after signing the register, as per the court’s order. Around 7.20 am, his car was waylaid, and he was shot dead. The attack was led by Rai and three shooters who were roped in from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s gang from Mumbai. “Rai went into hiding after the attack, but it had made him don of Bengaluru. Rai was ambitious and authoritarian. He wanted to be the sole power centre in Bengaluru and a one-point contact. Bengaluru had several smaller groups of rowdies, who had earlier owed allegiance to Kotwal and Jayaraj. All these groups were now under Rai, and Sreedhar played the middleman as he had more ground-level contacts,” Shelar, writes in her book. In the beginning of 1990s, liberalisation opened up new opportunities for Bengaluru in the global economy. Around the time, Bengaluru police started major crackdown on various criminal elements and activities in the city. On 12 April 1993, Rai was shot in front of a city civic court, but he managed to escape. He later claimed that police had orchestrated the attack, only for the police to deny the accusation. After getting bail and realising his life was in danger, Rai fled to Dubai. When chief minister HD Deve Gowda pitched for ‘Brand Bengaluru’ to the world during his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum in 1995, police intensified their crackdown on gangs in the city, to change the recent bloodied history of Bengaluru. While various gangs continued to thrive in the city even in the post-liberalisation era, the gang rivalries spilling out on the streets of Bengaluru were controlled to a large extent in the city for the sake of the IT boom, but more on that in the second part of this two-part series.

08-07-2021||Today's||The key to getting all eligible Indians vaccinated||A submicroscopic infectious agent — Covid-19 — has shaken our planet. The world watched in horror as the second wave wreaked havoc in India — with people gasping for oxygen, funeral pyres in makeshift lots, bodies buried on the banks of the holy Ganges. The unfolding narrative brought into sharp focus an ill-prepared nation — marked by stark disparities and inequities; a befuddled citizenry whipped by the vortex of grieving devastation, longing for coherence, and not finding it.The past aside, India’s need of the hour is to implement a comprehensive, coordinated, and coherent strategy — anchored in the principles and practices of social and behaviour change communication (SBCC). For this, India is aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) — it has the experience, ability, and vital capacities to implement an SBCC strategy, creating an informed and engaged citizenry that seeks vaccinations, while complying with all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) — hand hygiene, masking, distancing, and others.However, across the country, there remains the issue of vaccine hesitancy.Also Read | Ministry of cooperation is a political game changer for 2024A quick dipstick exercise was co-facilitated by the Advisory Group on Community Action (AGCA) members and the AGCA secretariat team housed at Population Foundation of India. Conducted in 37 districts across seven states — Bihar, Goa Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan — it brought to light various misplaced beliefs and myths.One, many community members believe that vaccination can lead to extreme sickness and death. Two, tribal communities believe that Covid-19 is a problem of the urban elite, and so, they will be unaffected. Three, some communities believe that vaccination is a measure to control the population, falsely believing that it leads to infertility and impotency. Four, the government is paying huge sums of money to Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) to get people vaccinated.To tackle falsehoods, bust myths and ensure that the entire eligible population of the country is vaccinated, what considerations should drive its SBCC strategy? Here are some ideas that are concrete, implementable, and have the potential for success.First, any SBCC strategy should identify “positive deviants” — i.e; communities or individuals that have already solved a Covid-19 problem with no extra resources, and while overcoming great odds. Janefal, a village in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district, represents a positive deviant (PD) case. “Positive” since National Geographic reported that it has vaccinated 100% of its eligible citizens with the first dose, and “deviant” because it represents a statistical exception.Also Read | Don’t turn the clock back on investment normsHow did Janefal counter rumours to vaccinate all its residents?A task force was established of local stakeholders, including government officials, the village head, village council members, ASHA workers, and volunteers. All eligible citizens were identified and mapped, and a micro-plan was prepared to guide home visits. To counter resistance, WhatsApp videos of local officials and village leaders taking their vaccine jabs were shown. Influencers also recorded testimonials about vaccine safety — including information about the minimal and manageable side-effects.As more adults signed on, a diffusion effect was observed — non-conforming individuals felt an increased pressure to comply with the shifting norm of vaccine acceptance. A few smartphones were used to register everyone on Co-WIN — the government’s vaccine portal — overcoming the digital divide instantly. On vaccination day, Janefal residents gathered en masse, displaying cohesion, solidarity and collective pride. According to National Geographic, the success in Janefal spurred similar vaccine drives in 16 neighbouring rural communities.Remarkably, there are other PD villages in India. India Today identified several communities in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Kerala that remained 100% Covid-19-free across both waves. While awaiting vaccines, these communities went for a “social vaccine”, creating protective “social bubbles” by forgoing public celebrations — festivals, marriages, birthdays and seeking timely e-consultations with remote medical personnel. An SBCC strategy would benefit from identifying such PD practices, amplifying them, and adapting, as necessary, to the local cultural context.Second, SBCC strategies should be turbocharged by implementing integrated 360-degree transmedia interventions on mass media, social media platforms, mobile-enabled interactive voice response (IVR) systems, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chatbots. Narrative-based SBCC interventions centred around TV dramas can engage audiences and demonstrate new models of behaviours to shift social norms. Consider the dramatisation of Janefal’s vaccination story: Amid a cauldron of rumours, myths, and misconceptions, a community coming together to create a task force, mapping residents, creating micro-plans, signing up residents, and collectively celebrating its triumphs. Social media platforms, IVR, and AI can extend and deepen audiences’ narrative engagement, connecting audiences with civil society partners and service delivery. Again, capacities exist within India to carry out such integrated, long-running SBCC interventions.Third, the pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity for India to invest in the experimentation and implementation of a wide spectrum of SBCC programmes that hold the potential to spur transformative social changes.Covid-19 response, recovery and rebuilding should spur a wide variety of SBCC initiatives geared to shift social norms associated with sanitation and hygiene, seeking teleconsultation for early treatment, and reducing the load on hospitals. Covid-19 has also brought sharper attention to leveraging technology-enabled platforms. The implications of such SBCC interventions can be game-changing.The potential exists for India to shift the narrative of how it has, thus far, handled its Covid-19 response.A decade ago, in 2011, India reported its last case of polio. India’s polio eradication programme represents a triumph of epic proportions among public health experts, SBCC scholars and practitioners. How the world will evaluate India’s Covid-19 response, only time will tell.Ajai Chowdhry is founder, HCL.

08-07-2021||Today's||Dilip Kumar’s tryst with life, death and the camera||“Hum ghar aai gyee, Munna, I am home Munna”, these final words uttered by Dilip Kumar in Ganga Jamuna, released in 1961, have been etched into the heart and soul of his fans, and remains one of the most iconic death scenes of Bollywood. Kumar’s fans were taken by surprise to see him as a playful village bumpkin who turns into the first angry young man of Indian cinema.But even before Ganga Jamuna, Dilip Kumar had an association with death.As the ill-fated, doomed lover of Devdas, released in 1955, Kumar gets down at Pandua Station and pleaded with the bullock cart driver: “Maanik pur chaloge, will you go to Maanikpur?” The bullock cart driver refuses and tells him to go in the morning as the night was dark, the road was rough, and the village was quiet far.But Devdas has to see his Paro, his sweetheart, before breathing his last.“Mere pas itna samay nahin hai Bhai, I don’t have so much time,” Kumar insists, aware that he was suffering from tuberculosis and had only a couple of hours left to live. As he sits in that bullock cart, he moves towards death at every passing moment, and finally dies at the Paro’s doorstep, early in the morning.The audience was left heartbroken in cinema halls seeing their hero die in such a painful manner.That was reel life.Also Read | Vyjayanthimala remembers Dilip Kumar, reveals Saira Banu called them ‘best team’The eternal moments of death got frozen in real life on the morning of July 7, 2021 at Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai when Dilip Kumar’s flirtations with death ended after a long illness of many years. Only this time, he was unable to feel the consternation of death as he was suffering from Alzheimer’s.In an industry where actors and stars work in thousands of films and still go into oblivion, Dilip Kumar’s trajectory was unique. He acted in just 62 films in his entire career spanning over 54 years, from Jwar Bhatta in 1944 till his last film, Qila, in 1998.Despite a limited body of work, what was it about Dilip Kumar that made him earn so much reverence? Why do we call him a thespian? Why is he known as an institute of acting ? What made him reach the zenith of his craft leaving an indelible mark on the history of Indian Cinema?These were the questions which triggered me to watch his films again and again, and begin writing a book decoding his craft. In my understanding, the magic of his enigmatic personality lies in his chosen path of a renegade actor who deviated from the theatrical stiffness of his predecessors to realistic method acting.Method acting is a technique in which an actor emotionally inhabits the role he plays on screen. Few people might know that years before the debut of Hollywood’s pioneering method actor Marlon Brando, Dilip Kumar had treaded on the path of method acting in Mela and Shaheed in 1948. In Devdas, he would spend his nights on the studio bench after pack-up to look as tired and worn out as a dejected lover on the next day while shooting.Dilip Kumar evolved himself into a brand of acting school of sorts and this is something even his contemporaries acknowledged without hesitation. While shooting for Premrog, Rishi Kapoor was unable to give a particular expression that his father-director Raj Kapoor wanted from him.After many retakes, Raj Kapoor screamed from behind the camera, “Chintu, mujhe yahan Yusuf Chahiye, Yusuf...I want Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) here, Yusuf.” Rishi Kapoor, who was called Chintu, understood what his father wanted and the shot was finally okayed. What a creative tribute from one legend to another, and a salute to Dilip Kumar’s acumen as an actor that earned him the tittles of thespian, tragedy king, Abhinnay Samrat (the emperor of acting) and Shahnshah e Jazbaat (the emperor of emotion).Apart from cinema, Dilip Kumar also conducted himself as a responsible Indian citizen. He organized many processions to raise funds for flood victims. During the India-China War in 1962, he not only helped in raising funds but also reached the border to entertain our soldiers along with Mohammed Rafi. During the India-Pakistan war in 1965, along with Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor, he raised funds for war widows. Apart from running an NGO for the blind, Dilip Kumar was an active supporter of film industry workers and junior artists.Dilip Kumar inspired generations after generations of aspiring actors and film buffs. Now that he has left us, there’s something we can give back. The legendary Dilip Kumar was a true Bharat Ratna. Let us honour him officially with the recognition, even if posthumously. Dilip Kumar would be pleased.Shakil Warsi is the author of Mughal-e-Azam: An Epic of Eternal Love and is presently working on a book on the cinema of Dilip KumarThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dilip-kumar-s-tryst-with-life-death-and-the-camera-101625740346260.html
08-07-2021||Today's||For sustained recovery, focus on vaccination, rural India and infra push||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic may have ebbed, but India cannot lower its guard. Such has been the severity of the pandemic that future historians will probably refer to modern India in terms of “pre-Covid” and “post-Covid” eras.Over the last 14 months, while the pandemic ravaged global economies, India was adversely impacted too, with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracting by 23.9% in the April-June quarter of last year. After five different stimulus packages, the Narendra Modi government has now announced a fresh round of relief measures, which will boost health care, support farmers, self-employed persons and small entrepreneurs and will re-energise the economy. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on June 28 announced a relief package of ₹6.3 lakh crore to support India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, including a ₹1.1 lakh crore loan guarantee for various Covid-19-affected sectors.Also Read | India needs big investment in health workforceAs India goes through Unlock 2.0, we need to ensure that we act and speak as Team India. With an end-of-the-year deadline to complete the universal vaccination process, and experts warning of the possibility of the third wave of the pandemic, India must decide on immediate priorities very carefully.A three-pronged strategy can ensure that Indian economic recovery is sustained.One, in its vaccination guidelines, the Centre rightly suggested to states that health care workers must be prioritised for vaccination, followed by those over 45 years, before opening it up to those above 18 years. The pace of vaccination has been encouraging.While keeping true to these guidelines, there’s a need to vaccinate the working population on priority, to shield it from the third wave. This will keep the economy in top gear. According to government estimates, around 48% of the people have some kind of employment. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, on the other hand, recently said that the “employment rate fell to 35.3% in May 2021 from 36.8% in April 2021”.Most industries and services enterprises in the organised sector are already proactively vaccinating their employees. Small businesses and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and those in rural India, on the other hand, need support. To vaccinate the working Indian population, the Centre, states, and even local governmental institutions and administrative bodies, will have to work together, in mission mode.Two, rural India has been affected by the second wave. It must get adequate attention.Three, infrastructure will be a major driver of the economy, as India seeks to regain the momentum lost in the post-Covid-19 era. The National Infrastructure Pipeline is already an important exercise. In the just-announced relief measures of ₹6.3 lakh crore, it’s believed that the additional spend in the current financial year would be in the range of ₹60,000 crore. In the current infra thrust, health care infra has got a welcome shot in the arm.For a Covid-hit economy, we need to double our focus on infra projects and enhance government spending. The banks must also be encouraged to lend more. That the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojna has been extended till March next year must be welcomed. More than ₹900 crore of benefits have been availed of, so far. More job-oriented programmes are needed. The increased infra spending will help achieve this.That there was no central lockdown in the second wave needs to be noticed, and applauded. Severe and prolonged lockdowns, as a philosophy, need to be discouraged. The Union government has rightly advised the states now to decide on localised restrictions “if the positivity rate in an area is more than 10% for more than a week, and if 60% of hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients”. This needs to be further decentralised to district levels. Any ground-level actions, say in the event of a third wave, should be necessitated only by local realities.Every crisis has a silver lining. The Covid-19 pandemic has indeed tested India’s resolve, resilience and patience. But the crisis has also helped India discover its true hidden potential — the might and potential of United India. Unlock 2.0 is the opportune moment to unleash that potential.Naveen Jindal is chairman, Jindal Steel & Power Limited and a former Member of Parliament The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/for-sustained-recovery-focus-on-vaccination-rural-india-and-infra-push-101625740345035.html
08-07-2021||Today's||Don’t turn the clock back on investment norms||Exactly three decades ago, India decided to embark on an economic path that it had eschewed since Independence. The sagacious leadership of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao coupled with the competence of his finance minister (FM) Manmohan Singh converted the massive balance of payments crisis into an opportunity to unleash major structural economic reforms. Global developments such as the disintegration of the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, and the rise of China and the East Asian economies knocked the bottom out of the Soviet-style planning that had long inspired Indian policymakers.As an integral element of these structural economic reforms, India adopted measures aimed at liberalising foreign investment, both direct and institutional, to overcome the problem of over-dependence on debt.Also Read | India needs big investment in health workforceThe economic liberalisation of foreign investment sowed the seeds for India’s decisive shift towards a liberalised international law regime on foreign investment. In the first four decades after Independence, India not only had a conservative attitude towards foreign investment in economic terms but also in terms of international law. India, in the 1960s and 1970s, steadfastly opposed international law on foreign investment, advocating that domestic law should predominantly govern matters of foreign investment protection, including dispute resolution.The adoption of a liberalised international legal regime on foreign investment came about dramatically. As journalist Shaji Vikraman has reported, towards the end of 1992, when FM Manmohan Singh, having announced the 1991 economic reforms, was in the United Kingdom (UK), he was asked about protection for foreign investments in India. India’s treatment of foreign investors under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act before the dawn of the 1991 reforms gave rise to these genuine concerns.On his return to India, Singh asked his officials at the department of economic affairs of the ministry of finance to start working on an international foreign investment treaty, popularly called the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) that would provide confidence to foreign investors willing to invest in India. This became critical for India to demonstrate to the world its seriousness about the economic reform process launched in 1991. In his 1993 and 1994 budget speeches, Singh signalled the role of BITs as an important means of attracting foreign investment to India.Finally, in 1994, India signed its first BIT with the UK. Later, India signed BITs with a large number of developed and developing countries. These BITs provided foreign investors fair and equitable treatment; just compensation for expropriation of foreign investment, that is, compensation representing the full market value of the investment affected, which was to be paid without undue delay; and recourse to international arbitration for settlement of disputes between foreign investors and host States.Thus, India started openly embracing those very international law principles on foreign investment that it had opposed in the decades following Independence.Now, the tide has turned. Stung by foreign investors suing India before BIT arbitration tribunals for State overreach, India made a hasty retreat from the international legal principles on foreign investment that it adopted in the 1990s. India unilaterally denounced several of its BITs and diluted investor protection features in its new model BIT.This protectionist attitude towards international law on foreign investment has undone the reform of the 1990s. It is coming in the way of signing new investment treaties with major global players such as the European Union. The absence of investment treaties will dampen investor sentiment in India. While foreign investment inflows have increased in 2020-21, this surge is largely driven by short-term portfolio investments and a few major acquisition deals involving select corporations such as the Reliance Group. What India really needs is investment in the job-creating manufacturing sector, which is at the heart of the government’s Atmanirbhar Abhiyan, self-reliance campaign.Empirically, it is proven that the collective presence of an overall investor protection system put in place by BITs has positively influenced foreign investment inflows to India. Thus, it is time to shed the protectionist mindset and, with suitable modifications, restore the 1990s reform that liberalised the international legal regime on foreign investment.Prabhash Ranjan will shortly be joining the Jindal Global Law School as a professor and vice-dean The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dont-turn-the-clock-back-on-investment-norms-101625740224977.html
08-07-2021||Today's||The Cabinet reshuffle marks a break from the past||For a politician who likes to be seen as a risk-taker, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s Cabinet reshuffles, earlier in Gandhinagar and now in Delhi, have paradoxically tended to be less disruptive and generally avoided a big bang approach. Which is why Wednesday’s Cabinet rejig marks a break from the past. By inducting as many as 43 ministers, old and new, but even more crucially, by forcing the exit of 12 ministers, including a few senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, the PM appears to have finally realised that the status quo on governance is no longer tenable in pandemic times.While the government’s media managers project the changes as an objective mid-term appraisal of ministerial performance, it is apparent that the shadow of Covid-19 loomed large around the decision to press the reset button. The axing of the health and the information and broadcasting ministers is a belated acknowledgment that the Modi government’s pandemic strategy, especially during the critical Covid-19 2.0 period, was sub-par on both the health and communication front.Also Watch | What drove Modi Cabinet reboot: Polls, appeasement or governance?Harsh Vardhan and Prakash Javadekar, both genial but lightweight politicians, are victims of the political and administrative chaos that ensued during a devastating summer of death and disease where the soft underbelly of complacent and ill-equipped State machinery was cruelly exposed. The two ministers were the inevitable fall guys amid growing demands for political accountability, although whether uniform standards of culpability were applied for all ministers, especially those in key economy-facing ministries, is a moot question.The case of another high-profile exit in Ravi Shankar Prasad is perhaps more curious. As law and information technology minister, a belligerent Prasad found himself jousting with an array of stakeholders, including global social media giants such as Twitter. The daily barrage of headline-grabbing soundbites suggested that the government was waging a “war” with the digital universe. The sparring may have been endorsed at the highest level, but it was also proving to be self-destructive for the government’s domestic and international image.In Prasad’s resignation then lies a message for Modi’s ministers. In this regime, there is a certain lakshman rekha that cannot be crossed. A minister has to be a quiet and efficient implementer of government policy; in a hyper-media whirl, he cannot become the news himself.Which is why Prasad’s replacement reflects the PM’s preferred ministerial prototype: Ashwini Vaishnav is a low-profile former IITian and ex-Indian Administrative Service officer with wide experience in project implementation who enjoys Modi’s confidence. Trust in a few key bureaucrats has always been critical to the PM’s tightly-controlled managerial style of governance, and this might explain why diligent, faceless bureaucrats have risen so rapidly within the power elite even as the more traditional politicians are gradually eased out.But the reshuffle hasn’t just seen a change in personnel but also an attempt to redraw ministerial boundaries. The new buzzword in the corridors of power is “synergy”, a single word substitute for the PM’s original one-line slogan of “minimum government, maximum governance”. With a 78-member council of ministers, this is no longer a minimum government. But, interestingly, the PM is attempting to create wider areas of ministerial responsibility and convergence; aligning education with skill development, for example, is an excellent move.Not all such ministerial streamlining makes sense just yet: Why, for example, is the minister for environment also expected to handle labour and employment? A focused minimum government approach calls for more than just inter-ministerial jugglery. Nor is there any clarity on the exact remit of the controversial new cooperation ministry to be headed by home minister Amit Shah.But this Cabinet reshuffle is clearly more than just about setting the house in order. It also marks a generational shift within the BJP. Only two ministers now survive from the Vajpayee-Advani era: Rajnath Singh and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, while a third from the old order, Nitin Gadkari, has lost the important micro, small and medium enterprises portfolio. By lowering the average age of the council of ministers to 58, the BJP is looking to freshen things up ahead of the 2024 elections. The new health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, a trusted Modi acolyte from Gujarat, is 49; the information and broadcasting minister, Anurag Thakur is 46, while several ministers of state also represent a younger demographic.With a strong presence of ministers from Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities across 25 states and Union Territories, the government is consciously projecting itself as a “rainbow” Cabinet, although the rainbow appears to still have only one token Muslim representative in its kaleidoscopic arrangement, mirroring the limitations of the new Modi-fied BJP.For all the hype, this remains a Prime Minister’s Office-centric government in reality. The shuffling of the pack has been done and some of the fresh faces in important ministries are seen as genuine doers. But a mid-term booster shot calls for more than just a change in optics. Will there be a new mindset that is ready to course-correct, delegate and empower, accept contrarian opinions and value expertise and experience? The jury is still out.Post-script: The first minister to take oath on Thursday was former Maharashtra chief minister, Narayan Rane. Once a die-hard Shiv Sainik who later switched to the Congress, Rane was repeatedly accused by BJP leaders in Maharashtra of being only involved in money-laundering and land-grabbing. Now, he is seen as one of the party’s prime weapons against the Shiv Sena, a reminder that for all the talk of ethical governance, realpolitik compulsions often continue to trump morality lessons.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and author The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-reshuffle-marks-a-break-from-the-past-101625737945005.html
08-07-2021||Today's||What Pakistan has done in its occupied territories of PoK, G-B||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s meeting with the leaders of the Gupkar Alliance on June 24 brought renewed attention on the status of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh, with the fundamental issue at stake being Kashmir’s relationship with the Centre and the quantum of autonomy. As this process takes it course, it is revealing to see how these questions are addressed in the case of Kashmir on the other side of the Line of Control (LoC), often forgotten in public discourse. Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) is only 15% of the total area illegally occupied by Pakistan since 1947. The Northern Areas or Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) comprise the remaining 85%. It is the main artery of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The Indus flows into Pakistan through G-B. It is, by far, the larger and strategically more important part of the territory. It has been under Pakistan’s direct control since 1947.Unlike PoK, G-B does not have a “constitution”. It is currently administered under the Gilgit-Baltistan Order of 2018. This is an executive fiat issued by Islamabad. In the case of PoK, it was also directly ruled by Islamabad on the basis of Rules of Business for more than three decades before it received its “constitution” in 1974. This is still described as an “interim” constitution, though there is nothing interim about Pakistan’s control on the territory. This was built into the provisions of the PoK constitution, which vested all key powers in the Council headed by Pakistan’s PM, leaving the elected assembly with undefined, residuary powers.Under the 13th amendment of the PoK constitution adopted in 2018, the Council was relegated to an advisory role. But instead of transferring its powers to the elected assembly, these have been assumed by Pakistan, which directly exercises legislative and executive authority over 32 items in PoK. Pakistan has effectively integrated the territory. This was a year before the abrogation of Article 370 by India, which Pakistan criticised vehemently.Under the Gilgit-Baltistan Order of 2018, the legislative powers on key subjects are vested in the PM of Pakistan, rather than the elected assembly. PM Imran Khan announced on November 1, 2020, that the territory will be given “provisional provincial status”. Pakistan’s Supreme Court had established its jurisdiction over the territory in 1999, though the territory does not form part of Pakistan under its constitution. Pakistan’s control goes beyond the constitutional scheme to economic control. PoK did not receive any economic returns for its chief economic resource, water, for 36 years. The payment it receives now as the “water usage” charge is one-seventh of the net hydel profit (NHP) paid to Punjab or Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. This is justified on the ground that Article 161 of Pakistan’s constitution allows payment of NHP to its “provinces”, while PoK does not fall under this category. The argument was used only to deny payment; it did not come in the way of exploiting the region’s natural resources.The State Subjects Rule dating back to the Maharaja’s time was abolished by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the case of the Northern Areas in 1974, and outsiders were allowed to buy property. In PoK, the rule has been progressively diluted. In the case of both territories, control over migration is vested in Pakistan. The Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, was extended to PoK in 1973. The “people” of the region have been absorbed in Pakistan, which makes a mockery of Pakistan’s claim that the territory is “azad” or free.While Gwadar port will receive $793 million under CPEC, the bulk of Chinese investment will take place in G-B ($ 16.129 billion) and PoK ($5.946 billion). Pakistan proposes to build five dams in G-B as part of the “Indus cascade”. This will affect the ecology and the ethnic balance of the only Shia majority region under Pakistan’s control. All of this not only shows Islamabad’s double standards, and the fact that it has effectively integrated territories that are not its own.DP Srivastava is a retired diplomat and the author of Forgotten Kashmir-The Other Side of the Line of Control The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/what-pakistan-has-done-in-its-occupied-territories-of-pok-gb-101625708783329.html
