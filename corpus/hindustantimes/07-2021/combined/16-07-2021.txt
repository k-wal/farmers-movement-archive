Reason: Assistant station master Aniruddh Kumar drank liquor heavily on duty and passed out in his chamber, leaving the rail movement to fate. “It has come to light that the assistant station master was drunk, since he was not in condition to perform his duties. He was suspended on the spot and another station master was arranged to allow the train movement,” said chief spokesman, North Central Railways, Shivam Mishra. On Friday morning, Kumar underwent medical examination for confirmation of working in an inebriated state at the railway hospital in Tundla, said station superintendent, Dibiyapur Vishambhar Dayal Pandey. Kanchausi is a home signal point and the trains failing to get the clearance halted at the outer one by one between 12.10 and 1.30 am, said a person familiar with the case. The trains included Magadh Express, Farakka Express, Vaishali Express, Sangam Express and several goods trains. The Phaphoond and Jhinjhank railway stations informed the rail traffic control-room about the trains stuck near Kanchausi and not moving ahead. The information caused a flutter in the rail traffic control, which swung into action and informed station superintendent Pandey, who tried to get in touch with Kumar but failed. He rushed to Kanchausi railway station and found him sleeping. Pandey poured two buckets of water on him to wake him up. Nothing worked, said another person. Pandey said while he was trying to get Kumar on his feet, he smelled liquor. “I informed about this to the rail traffic control and took charge, allowing the trains to proceed further,” he said. The train started moving at around 2 am. In the morning, station superintendent Phaphoond Arjun Singh reached Kanchausi to oversee the train movement. On his information, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) took Aniruddh Kumar to Tundla by Bhagalpur-New Delhi Express for medical examination. According to officials, apart from suspending him, NCR has served a charge-sheet and ordered elaborate inquiry into the case. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trains-forced-to-halt-as-drunk-assst-station-master-passes-out-101626460153594.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||ED attaches Anil Deshmukh’s Worli flat, properties in Uran||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached properties worth ₹4.20 crore of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The properties include the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader’s flat in Worli.“The attached assets are in the form of one residential flat valued at ₹1.54 crore located at Worli and 25 land parcels of book value ₹ 2.67 crore at Dhutum village in Uran of neighbouring Raigad district,” said an ED officer.The properties, according to ED officers, are held in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Aarti and a company named Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd.With regards to the Worli flat, ED officers said their investigation has revealed that the flat was purchased by the NCP leader in 2004 by paying entire consideration in cash and the same was registered in the name of Aarti Deshmukh, but the sale deed for the flat was registered in February 2020 after Deshmukh became home minister. According to ED officers, Deshmukhs acquired 50% ownership in M/s Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd including its assets, ie land and shops, “totally valued at approximately ₹5.34 crore (book value) by merely paying ₹17.95 lakh, that too after a substantial gap.”ED has initiated money laundering investigation against Deshmukh and his family members on the basis of a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for allegedly “attempting to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of his public duty for collection of funds to achieve the target of ₹100 crore per month from various bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai.”CBI had registered the FIR on April 21 followed by a detailed preliminary enquiry as ordered by the Bombay high court (HC) on April 5. The HC order came on a bunch of petitions including one filed by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh who had levelled allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. In his letter to the chief minister and others, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh not only interfered in policing matters but also summoned some Mumbai Police officers directly at his official bungalow and informed them that he had target of collecting ₹100 crore per month from Mumbai. Singh had further alleged that Deshmukh had even provided the officers with a list of bars in Mumbai, suggesting collection of ₹3-4 lakh per month from each of them.ED’s investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 has revealed that Deshmukh had, while acting as Maharashtra home minister, received illegal gratification of approximately ₹4.70 crore in cash from various orchestra bar owners. The amount was purportedly collected by dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Antilia explosives scare and murder of Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran.ED’s probe has further revealed that Deshmukh’s family allegedly routed about ₹4.18 crore of the tainted money through Delhi-based dummy companies as donations to Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, an educational trust at Nagpur which is controlled by Deshmukh family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-attaches-anil-deshmukh-s-worli-flat-properties-in-uran-101626460034136.html

Vaze has sought bail citing the federal agency’s failure to file a charge sheet against him in a stipulated time of 90 days from the date of his arrest. The court has posted the application for hearing on July 22.Court sources said Vaze has recently sent an application from jail directly to the special NIA court seeking bail.Vaze was arrested on March 13 and acting on a plea filed by NIA, the special court had on June 9, granted the federal agency two more months to file a charge sheet against the accused.The sources said Vaze has also questioned this grant of extension to NIA to file a charge sheet against him.NIA has responded to Vaze’s plea that since the extension has already been granted by the special court, Vaze’s plea was not maintainable.Vaze was arrested on March 13 after in connection with an explosives-laden Scorpio found near Antilia, south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25 and subsequent murder of the owner of the SUV, Thane based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the explosives case but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV and reported it stolen on February 17, 2021. Hiran himself was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it in early February.NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24.

16-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress-NCP bickering on as Praful Patel taunts Nana Patole||The bickering among Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies continued on Friday as senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Praful Patel slammed state Congress chief Nana Patole over his remarks. Patel said they give importance to what Maharashtra Congress in-charge HK Patil says as he is a direct representative of the Congress leadership and speaks facts. He added that they do not want to talk about what Patole has said as he keeps saying something or other on a daily basis.Patole had declared that the Congress would contest upcoming elections in the state on its own. He also alleged that he was put under surveillance by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and that his movements and chats were being closely watched.His remarks in the past two weeks have upset the NCP and Shiv Sena leadership. Following this, Patil along with state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan met Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar to control the damage and ensure their relations as ally was not strained.“I would prefer what HK Patil says as he is a direct representative of the (Congress) high command. Also, he speaks based on the factual situation… We don’t think it is right to counter the state Congress chief’s (Nana Patole) statements which he is making on a daily basis. Pawar saheb has already said whatever he had to say on this issue. HK Patil and Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan have also met Pawar and CM Thackeray, and you can understand the hint behind their meeting,” Patel told reporters in Nagpur on Friday.After Patole’s announcement that the Congress would contest the upcoming elections on its own, Patel had said that all were free to do whatever they want to. “This is a coalition but we have not tied anyone’s hands. People are free to do what they want to,” the former civil aviation minister said.He also stressed that the NCP chief is the founder of MVA and enjoys a different stature in Maharashtra politics, adding that the state government is running under the leadership of Pawar and Thackeray.Targeting the NCP, Patole on Wednesday said, “We have to be prepared so that we do not face betrayal like we had to in 2014.” He also justified his announcement about the Congress going solo in the next Assembly elections in 2024. His jibe at the NCP came in less than 24 hours after a group of senior Congress leaders including Patil, Chavan and Thorat met the NCP chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-ncp-bickering-on-as-praful-patel-taunts-nana-patole-101626459973533.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Centre to clarify if governor can exercise discretion in duties||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday sought presence of the Solicitor General of India to assist it in a case which seeks a declaration of the court that the inaction by Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in not nominating 12 members of Legislative council (MLC) whose names were suggested by the council of ministers was illegal. The court was prompted to seek assistance of the Centre after it was informed that as per the Constitution and the Government Business Rules, the governor was bound to take a decision on the list of candidates either way but he had failed to do so. The Centre is expected to clarify whether the governor is duty bound by the proposal or can exercise his discretion. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Nashik resident Ratan Soli Luth, was informed by senior counsel Rafiq Dada, for the state, that the governor could not use his discretion and had to accept the recommendation by the council of ministers to nominate 12 persons as MLCs in normal situation. Dada added that though the positions had fallen vacant in September 2020 and the recommendation of the council had been provided on November 6, 2020, the state was yet to receive a response from the governor. In an earlier hearing, the state government had stated in an affidavit that the governor had not respected the recommendation and caused a delay, depriving citizens of benefits of such persons for healthy democracy and maintain rich traditions.“The governor cannot just sit tight on the file and not do anything. There is a mandate of the law where he is required to act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. Is a complete inaction open to a governor? He has no discretion,” Dada submitted, adding that the failure of the governor directly affected constitutional democracy. He said the court was the only organ which could ensure that democracy functions properly by conducting a judicial review of the inaction of the governor.The bench observed that the petition could have some repercussions on other provisions of the Constitution, and therefore, it wanted the Central government to address the question as to whether any discretion was available to the governor not to nominate MLCs on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. HC also questioned as to whether in 75 years of independence of the country, there was a ruling through which any court had passed directions and taken judicial review on alleged inaction of the governor of a state on the proposal of council of ministers for nomination of legislators. The bench allowed the petitioner to make the Central government a party to the case and posted further hearing on July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-centre-to-clarify-if-governor-can-exercise-discretion-in-duties-101626459974152.html

The court granted three weeks to the Board to file its rejoinder to the reply. The matter was listed for further hearing on September 13.The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, contended that even after Unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz -- comprising the Bangley Wali Masjid, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel -- continues to be locked up.It has further contended that even if the premises is part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of enquiry.On April 15, the court had allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship.The court allowed namaz to be offered on “first floor above the basement” of the mosque, making it clear that it has to be “strictly in accordance” with the DDMA’s April 10 notification and other standard operating protocols.Several FIRs have been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the Markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the Covid-19 lockdown last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcpulls-up-centre-for-not-filing-reply-to-plea-seeking-to-de-seal-nizamuddin-markaz-101626459793573.html

He scored 99.20% and got the second-highest score in his school, Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar. However, an anxious Katkar, who was unable to log in, reached the school around 3pm and waited for another two and a half hours. “Our exams were postponed twice and the evaluation was done based on our previous test performances. More than CET and the results, I feel that it was unfair that despite working hard, we were assessed based on our last academic year’s performance as well,” said Katkar, who want to pursue science to study engineering. “I have started preparations for the forthcoming tests and admission process as well.”After facing uncertainty all through the academic year and the cancellation of SSC board exams, Friday’s results attracted mixed reactions from Class 10 students. Faced with a delay in getting their results, students, principals and parents were both anxious and worried about the ambiguity related to the students’ future given the current situation.For Reyansh Dutta, 15, including Class 9 marks in the evaluation was a disappointment. “There were no exams conducted in the final year of Class 9, and we were struggling to adjust with the new online class system in the initial few months of Class 10. I had worked very hard this year and was confident of scoring above 90% if the exams were conducted the regular way,” said Dutta who scored 84%.He was among the few who managed to check his score around 1pm before the website crashed.Parents also feel that students could have performed better if not for the uncertainties related to the evaluation process. “They (board) have included Class 9 marks as well, however, this batch did not appear for final exams in Class 9 due to the pandemic and lockdown. This is a bit unfair, but owing to the current scenario there was no other option,” said Shriram Samant, father of 15-year-old Chinmayee who scored 80% studying in Sane Guruji Vidyalaya English Medium School, Shivaji Park, Dadar. Samant added, “However, instead of postponing the exam schedule time and again, they could have taken a decision earlier and not make the students anxious and stressful,” Principals also expressed their displeasure with the manner in which this academic year progressed for the students as well as the school. Rupa Roy, Principal, Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar, said, “This academic year has been a huge disappointment for the children, starting with the pandemic, then struggling with online classes, followed by uncertainty about the exams, which was postponed twice and in the end, evaluation was based on both last year’s as well as this year’s performance.”Roy added, “The children have worked extra hard this year but despite that, evaluating last year’s performance as well, is unfair. Moreover, just when the students expected things to settle with the results, the website crashed, it just seems that their waiting period is endless. For 16-year-old’s all this is not less than a nightmare.”“Students are in a dilemma, the current situation has put students under stress as well. Facing all this at this age will surely make the students stronger and prepared to face adverse situations. These students have not appeared for a public exam, it is the onus of the school on how they are preparing the students for external exams as they have to appear for entrance tests for Class 11 admissions,” said Kshama Valanjoo, assistant Headmistress, VPM Vidyamandir, Dahisar. The delay in restoring the website led to many students rushing to their school to find out the results.Meanwhile, some schools are also making efforts to prepare the students for the CET exams to ensure they manage to get admissions to colleges of their choice. Balu Dhawale, Principal, Saraswati High School, Ghodbunder Road, Thane, said, “It is the onus of the school to prepare students accordingly, we had counselling as well as teaching conducted online to ensure that the students can cope with the current situation. Even after the results are out we continue to conduct online classes to prepare them for entrance exams. These are some ways to ensure that the students are prepared to cope with the circumstances put before them in current situations.”Students’ anxiety continues despite the announcement of results as they have yet to appear for their CET which will be the basis of their admissions. Moreover, there is no reference point for such an entrance exam for these students as they wait for the announcements related to their CET and admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ssc-results-delayed-evaluation-unfair-claim-students-101626459493500.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||What’s next? Students await clarity on CET||Results for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams were announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) on Friday afternoon. While students were still struggling to access individual results till late evening, more are now worried about what lies next. With the stress of the common entrance test (CET) scheduled to be held on or before August 21 looming over their heads, students, as well as schools and colleges, are waiting for an official notification from the government to clarify all doubts. “Past few weeks we’ve been studying hard to prepare for CET. But both the exam paper pattern and syllabus is so new to us that we aren’t sure which chapters to focus on and which topics to exclude. The past year has been a rollercoaster ride with several ups and downs and this journey still doesn’t end with our results,” said 16-year-old Riddhi Parikh, who scored 94.2%.In the last week of June, nearly a month after school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that admissions to the first-year junior college courses will be based on a CET following which a government resolution (GR) was released.According to the GR, an optional CET exam based solely on the SSC syllabus and consisting of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks will be conducted. This exam will be open to first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants from all boards. Those who don’t want to opt for the physical entrance exam will be marked according to their performance in the internal assessment of class 10 results, irrespective of the education board. “Students appearing for the optional CET exam will be given first preference during admissions to FYJC. After these admissions are completed, the remaining vacant seats in junior colleges will be allotted to those students who do not appear for the entrance exam,” said Varsha Gaikwad, state school education minister. The decision to conduct a CET exam for FYJC aspirants was taken to bring about uniformity and comparability in class admissions, Gaikwad had added. Earlier this year, all school education boards including the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) decided to scrap their Class 10 exams due to increasing Covid-19 cases. Instead, the boards decided to grade these students based on their internal exam performance for the current year and their performance in the previous academic year. Many, however, are still unsure if the CET exam based on the syllabus of a single education board is fair to all students. “Whenever admissions are based on anything except class 10 marks, chaos has followed. The CET exam might be a good way to gauge a student but it is unfair to students of other school education boards who will now have to study a new syllabus altogether to be able to score well in the exam. After the debacle of result announcement by the state board, will they be ready to conduct a CET exam for lakhs of students within the next five weeks?” asked the principal of a south Mumbai college on condition of anonymity.City junior colleges at present are also busy updating the internal marks of Class 12 students. “We have no time to think about class 11 admissions amidst all the work that is going into bringing out the Class 12 results. Teachers are reporting to duty almost every day to ensure results are announced soon,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. She added that to date, neither the school deputy director’s office nor the state board has not approached any college with information on how admissions to FYJC courses will be conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/whats-next-students-await-clarity-on-cet-101626459433551.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||CET syllabus: ICSE, CBSE students irked||Despite assurances from the state school education department that the reason for conducting a common entrance test (CET) for admission to first-year junior college (FYJC) is to bring parity among Class 10 students of various school education boards, those from non-state board schools echoed a different opinion. On Friday afternoon as Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students were struggling to access results, those from ICSE and CBSE boards are still awaiting their results from their respective boards as some clarity over the CET exam. “How can the state call this parity, when the syllabus for the CET exam is based only on state board curriculum? ICSE syllabus for subjects like social sciences, maths and science is very different from what is taught in state board schools, so how are our children supposed to compete with state board students when they haven’t studied the same curriculum?” asked Sharmin Poonawala, mother of a class 10 student from ICSE board. Last month, an ICSE student approached the Bombay high court questioning the state board’s decision to conduct a CET exam for class 11 admissions based on the state board syllabus only. In this petition, the student has stated that as per rules of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), a class 10 student of the board can drop subjects like Maths and Science and instead choose from a variety of additional subjects like Technical Drawing, Commercial Studies among others. “ICSE students don’t even study the same subjects as SSC students, and even the same subjects like History and Geography cover the different syllabus. How can the state board expect non-SSC board students to study and ace the subject for their CET exam? This is clear discrimination,” said the mother of another ICSE student. Recently, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) directed affiliated schools to reassess and re-evaluate the marks given to class 10 students this year. Avnita Bir, director principal, Podar Education, said, “The results this year and the evaluation process are very unusual, most of us schools have been asked to re-evaluate class 10 assessment by the board. This could be one reason that the SSC results are much better this year, and efforts are being taken by CBSE to ensure that the outcome is not skewed in any way because there are many students who want to shift to the state board. We don’t want results to be another cause of concern for the students.”Several CBSE and ICSE schools in the city believe that due to the uncertainty surrounding results and admissions to junior colleges, many students have already decided to continue their Class 11 and 12 education on the same board. “I doubt the high scores of SSC students or CET exam will impact students from non-SSC boards. Most of these students have already taken admission for Class 11 in their respective boards. Moreover, CBSE evaluation includes the last three year’s performance which is fair enough and an overall good evaluation process. This will ensure that the students are assessed based on their overall performance,” said Jyoti Nair, Principal, New Horizon Scholars School, Thane. Many parents said this ambiguity has left students more anxious, especially those waiting to bag a seat in Mumbai junior colleges. “My daughter dropped subjects like Maths and Science in class 9 and 10 in order to focus on subjects like economics so her overall class 10 score gets better and she finds a seat in the Arts stream at a college of her choice. By forcing such students to now suddenly either study maths and science or forgo their seat in the top colleges is unfair and biased,” said Anjana Purohit, mother of another ICSE student. “What’s worse is that ICSE and CBSE schools have already completed admissions to their class 11 batches, leaving students like my daughter feeling left in the lurch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cet-syllabus-icse-cbse-students-irked-101626459313506.html

The metro line project could not take off due to possible environmental damage that its construction would have caused.The BMRCL had applied to the forest department to fell over 2,000 trees alongside the proposed track. While on the other side, Bengaluru Parisara Samithi, a leading social service organisation had appealed to the high court questioning the need to cut so many trees for the metro line.The special bench headed by the Chief Justice of Karnataka Justice A S Okha and Justice Suraj Govind Raj took up the matter for hearing on Thursday.The bench ruled that the BMRCL must compensate for the damage done to the environment by planting as many as 4,000 trees. BMRCL should further nourish them and report to the court about the action taken on this matter.Senior advocate Uday Holla, who argued on behalf of BMRCL, stated that due to the halt in the construction, the BMRCL was going through losses and escalation of cost. He said the BMRCL has agreed to plant 3,500 trees as per the directions of the tree officer of the BBMP forest department.The court also advised the BMRCL and the tree officer to plant trees only endemic to the area after testing the soil. Soil testing would help in achieving full growth of the trees. The court has directed the Tree officer to give a report on this matter in two weeks.It also directed the deputy conservator of forests to cooperate with the tree officer in planting the trees and overseeing the survival of the trees, by taking proactive measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/plant-4000-trees-to-compensate-axing-of-trees-for-nagavara-gottigere-metro-line-karnataka-hc-to-bmrcl-101626455889283.html

The entire crew was on Friday quarantined in four hotels, after five members tested positive on their arrival in Lucknow the previous day, said officials. Those who tested positive were isolated from the other crew members. “The crew has been quarantined in the hotels they are staying and these have been sanitized,” said Dr Milind Vardhan, deputy chief medical officer. These hotels are located in Gomti Nagar, Chinhat, Charbagh and Hussainganj. “As per protocol, the members were tested on arrival at the production house on Thursday. Five of them comprising spot boys and loaders tested positive. Government officials got the entire team tested again, out of which 32 people (including actors) staying in a hotel in Gomti Nagar tested negative and the remaining reports are awaited,” informed line-producer Aroon Singh Dicky.

16-07-2021||Patna||16 die in Bihar after consuming spurious liquor; 5 detained||Sixteen people died in Bihar’s West Champaran district after allegedly consuming spurious liquor, police said. Eight of these deaths were reported on Friday while eight others died since Wednesday. The police on Friday picked up at least five people, including two women, for interrogation in connection with hooch deaths. The sale and consumption of liquor is banned in Bihar since April 2016. Kundan Kumar, district magistrate (West Champaran), said eight people died in three separate villages - Deurawa (4), Jogiya (3) and Bagahi (1) - over the past two-three days. A press release issued by the West Champaran district administration late on Friday evening said eight other deaths were reported from the same area on Friday. “In the course of the investigation, the family members of four deceased accepted the death occurred owing to the consumption of spurious liquor. However, family members of four other deceased denied liquor consumption. They, however, did not furnish any medical documents about any ailments either,” the release stated. Late Thursday evening, police registered a case in which two people, identified as Thug Sah and Suresh Sah, were made named as accused. “Accused Thug Sah’s son, Sumit, has been arrested, while two local chowkidars have been suspended,” said a press release, issued by the district administration. Bagahi superintendent of police Kiran Kumar Gorakh Jadhav, who is also currently in charge of Bettiah police, said, “Their interrogations are underway. We have also pressed a dog squad in the search operation and raids are being conducted. No seizure has been made as yet.” The DM, however, said families of the eight denied they had consumed liquor. “One of those who died in Bagaha village was on dialysis, other at Deurawa village died following a heart attack,” he said while describing the other deaths as suspicious. “Causes of other deaths could not be known immediately as the last rites on the bodies had been performed. The matter is being investigated further,” said the district magistrate. “We have deployed medical teams at Deurawa and Bagahi villages to facilitate treatment for anyone with any symptoms,” he said. Top district and police officials visited Deurawa village on Thursday evening after the reports of deaths. “We took statements of about 40 people, including the family members of those who died, but all of them denied consumption of liquor. However, one of the two persons undergoing treatment confessed to having been served liquor,” Lalan Mohan Prasad, deputy inspector general of police (DIG), Champaran range, said. However, villagers at Deurawa said sale and consumption liquor was rampant in their village. “My brother fell sick after consuming liquor which is being openly sold despite prohibition,” said Bhola, cousin of Mumtaz Ansari who confessed to having consumed liquor before falling sick. Meanwhile, the incident evoked a sharp reaction from opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). In a tweet, party supremo Lalu Prasad said, “In Bihar, thousands of people are dying every year from spurious liquor under good governance. Under the garb of prohibition, ruling party people are running a parallel illegal economy of ₹20,000 crores in Bihar. Lakhs of Dalits and poor are lodged in jails in the name of prohibition. Police have become corrupt and tyrannical.” Birendra Gupta, CPI-ML (L) legislator from Sikta assembly constituency, termed the deaths as state-sponsored and demanded compensation of ₹4 lakh for the families of the deceased. He also accused the district administration of hushing up the matter. “The family members of the deceased are under pressure...they earlier accepted that the deaths occurred due to consumption of illicit liquor,” said Gupta, who visited the families of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/16-die-in-bihar-after-consuming-spurious-liquor-5-detained-101626453674858.html

Haque was shifted from Munger to state police headquarters on June 19 and is currently waiting for a posting.According to sources, Harishankar Rai, a former additional superintendent of police in Munger and currently posted at Jehanabad, had alleged that a person claiming to be close to Haque approached him and demanded a bribe while promising to help him in a departmental inquiry initiated by the state police headquarters for his alleged failure to file a charge sheet against two accused in the case of recovery of 22 AK-47 rifles smuggled from the Central Ordnance Depot (COD) in Jabalpur in September 2018. Rai also provided an audio clip to back his claim. On June 17, two days before his transfer, Haque had recommended departmental proceedings against Rai for his alleged failure to file a charge sheet in the case that led to the two accused being granted bail. On Friday, the EoU summoned several police officers posted in Munger, including assistant sub-inspector Mohammad Irafan who was earlier posted in the DIG office, in connection with the probe, officials said.Irafan, who has since been transferred to Madhepura, is under the scanner, officials said.

16-07-2021||Pune||PMC floats unseasonal tender of removal of hyacinth from river and lakes||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has floated two tenders to remove hyacinth from two lakes and Mula-Mutha river in the monsoon. Normally, hyacinth removal work is done in the pre-monsoon season. During the monsoon, hyacinth flows along with water. Now, civic activists have raised questions about this untimely tender for the removal of hyacinth. Every year in the month of February to May, residents along Mula-Mutha face the problem of hyacinth. Residents complain of an increase in mosquitoes and bad odour. Earlier, the PMC made provision of around ₹54 lakh to remove hyacinth through lakes and Mula-Mutha. However, the PMC has allocated a budget of around ₹2 crore to remove hyacinth from Mula-Mutha and two lakes. The tender was also floated before the monsoon despite the peak of the problem being in summer. However, the PMC has floated unseasonal tenders of removal of hyacinth in the month of monsoon season when hyacinth flows along with water. Shreedhar Yeolekar, executive engineer, sewerage and maintenance and repair department said, “We have floated a tender to remove hyacinth from two lakes (Pashan and Katraj), Mula and Mutha rivers. The tender is ₹50 lakh for lakes and ₹1 crore for the rivers.” He said, “Actually, the removal of hyacinth starts from December onwards. However, we started the hyacinth removal process from April onwards because earlier the work was carried out by the health department. From this budget (2021-22), the work has been handed over to the drainage department. So, it takes time to float tenders. Now onwards, the drainage department will tackle hyacinth problems. This tender has a period up to March-2022.” One of the senior officials of the PMC sewerage and maintenance and repair department said, “Last year, the health department was fully engaged to handle the Covid-19 pandemic and hyacinth problem was not addressed well. However, we removed around 70 per cent of hyacinth so far during the April to March period. Now, there is a break of monsoon. The problem has arisen once again as water is steady. Normally, water flows in monsoon season and hyacinth flows along with water.” Kaka Kulkarni, a civic activist said, “The PMC doesn’t have a fool proof plan to clear hyacinth. Every year, people register complaints and the PMC starts work. It is a long pending problem. PMC should have to make time bound problems to avoid hyacinth problems. It is really surprising that PMC floated tender in monsoon season when hyacinth problem is not an issue.” Pune city faces more hyacinth problems as compared to Khadki cantonment and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). There are two confluences of rivers Mula-Mutha at Sanagamwadi area and Mula-Pavana river comes together at Sangvi. Therefore, hyacinth flows from Mula and Pavana comes to Pune jurisdiction. Of the 15 ward offices, Mula-Mutha river is passing through the seventh ward offices area. However, Aundh and Warje are the most affected areas of water hyacinth. Bopodi, Mundwa residents have faced maximum problems. Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) pushes hyacinth in the PMC area. Bopodi is adjacent to the PCMC limit. So, they face more as compared to other ward offices. Normally, PMC was using JCB to remove hyacinth from Mula-Mutha Rivers. Since 2013, PMC has been using Spider machines. The machine is mounted on a truck. It revolves around 360 degrees. It picks up the hyacinth from the water surface and clean surface||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-floats-unseasonal-tender-of-removal-of-hyacinth-from-river-and-lakes-101626450373177.html

I would like to congratulate Neog for a people-friendly tax-free budget that also focuses on our key election promises,” said chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. Presenting a tax-free budget, Ajanta Neog, a former Congress minister who joined BJP just ahead of the assembly polls this year, also indicated how the government planned to fulfil the party’s poll promise of waiving off microfinance loans and creating 100,000 jobs. The minister mentioned that Assam would now introduce the use of sex-sorted artificial insemination to increase births of female calves in cattle and buffalo farms in order to benefit dairy farmers. “It would control the birth of scrub bulls as 80% to 90% of all births would be female calves. It shall help meet the ever-increasing demand for milk in the state,” said Neog. This year, the government proposed to cover 50,000 cattle and buffaloes with the use of 125,000 doses of sex-sorted semen procured from reputed sources across the country. “With a 30% conception rate, at least 12,000 female calves are expected to be born in the first year itself. The scheme will be continued by inseminating 50,000 animals annually for the next four years. Due to this, milk production will get a massive boost and will have a positive impact on the economy,” she said. The government also proposed to buy 1500 Murrah buffaloes, support 10 dairy entrepreneurs and provide seed money to 200 dairy cooperative societies with a budget outlay of ₹4 crore. On Monday, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tabled the Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021 which sought to ban the transport of cattle within the state from other states to Assam and the other way round. It also proposed a ban on the sale of beef in areas where non-beef eating communities are in majority and within a radius of 5 kilometres from temples and other Hindu religious institutions. Friday’s budget earmarked a sum of ₹7,500 crore to fulfil the BJP’s election promise of providing relief to around 2.6 million borrowers who had taken loans from microfinance institutions. Neog also gave details of how the government proposed to provide 100,000 jobs promised by the BJP in its election manifesto. Most of the jobs would get created in the police (nearly 28,000), education (28,000), health (9,000) and animal husbandry and veterinary (7000) departments. The government also announced an increase of monthly financial benefit provided to women from ₹830 to ₹1,000 as part of the Orunodoi, the biggest flagship beneficiary scheme of the state that covers over 2 million households. It was also decided to increase the number of beneficiary households under the scheme by another 636,000. “We have nearly 6.5 million households in the state and Orunodoi would cover 2.6 million or nearly 40% of them. I have earmarked ₹1,800 crore for the scheme this year,” Neog said. The budget earmarked ₹100 crore for the newly created department of indigenous faith and culture which will seek to preserve and propagate the unique languages, cultures, religious customs and rituals, attires, food habits, folk beliefs and traditions of indigenous communities and ethnic groups. Thirteen new roads as part of Asom Mala, repair of 1,000 kilometres of the nearly 4500 kilometre-long embankments along rivers meant to prevent floods, setting up of 1,000 new models ‘Anganwadi Kendras’ are part of the budget plans along with mobile phones to nearly 800,000 needy students to help with their studies. The budget also announced the formation of a new district at Tamulpur, support to children who lost their parents to Covid-19 and also to women who lost their husbands to the disease. Setting up of 5 new medical colleges and 10 commando battalions are also included in the budget. Neog announced a financial assistance of ₹1 lakh each to the next of kin of all those killed due to Covid19. Till Friday, the state had recorded 4961 deaths due to the disease. Assam’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2015-16 at variable prices was ₹227, 959 crore. It increased to ₹351,318 crore during 2019-20. The percentage growth during the period was 11.22%. Of the ₹99,418 crore budget outlay in 2019-20, ₹82,488 crore was spent, which was an expenditure of 83%. The budget estimate of 2021-22 shows a receipt of ₹107,317 crore under the consolidated fund of the state. After adding receipt of ₹182,253 crore under the public account and ₹200 crore from the contingency fund, the aggregate receipts amount to ₹289,770 crore.The aggregate expenditure for the year is estimated at ₹289,367 crore. Though the estimated transactions in the year are expected to result in a surplus of ₹403 crore, due to an opening deficit of ₹969 crore at the start of the year, the budget deficit is expected to be ₹566 crore at the end of the year. Neog informed that during 2020-21, the state collected ₹14,645 crore in taxes as against ₹14,967 crore during the previous year. During the first quarter of the current fiscal, the state had collected ₹3501 crore against ₹1920 crore during the same period last year. “We are totally disappointed with the budget as it neglects the sufferings of millions affected by Covid and the poor state of the economy,” said former minister and senior Congress MLA Rockybul Hussain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cows-buffaloes-in-focus-in-budget-speech-of-assam-s-first-woman-finance-minister-101626449894444.html

16-07-2021||Dehradun||‘Petrol costlier than desi ghee, clear loot of common man’s money’: Sachin Pilot||Senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister, Sachin Pilot launched a scathing attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Centre on rising fuel prices in the country saying the prices of petrol and diesel are now “more than desi ghee.”Pilot’s comments came during his press conference on Friday in presence of Uttarakhand state president Pritam Singh and other party leaders at Congress state headquarters in Dehradun.Attacking BJP, Pilot said, “After BJP came to power in 2014, there are many issues due to which the people of the country are suffering but one of the major ones is the skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel. Their price is now more than desi ghee as claimed by an elderly while having a conversation with me in Rajasthan.”“It is beyond imagination that the prices of petrol have crossed ₹100 in more than 250 cities in the country. This year alone, so far, the government has increased the price of petrol a total of 66 times. As per the government’s own figures, the excise on petrol has increased by 250% while 800% on diesel in the last seven years which has got them a revenue of ₹25lakh crores. This is nothing but a direct attack on the pockets of common man,” he said.The senior Congress leader also compared the prices of petrol during the UPA rule in 2014.“In 2014, when the crude oil price was US $105, the price of petrol was ₹71. But now, when the crude oil price has come down to about US $45, the petrol price is more than ₹100. It is beyond understanding why the BJP government is not passing on the benefit of low crude oil prices to the public by reducing the petrol prices and is looting them by increasing it. This government is just taking from the public and not giving it anything,” said Pilot.He also accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of reducing the domestic production of crude oil.“They talk of Atmanirbhar India but have reduced the domestic production of country’s total petroleum consumption from 24% during our rule in 2014 to 18% today. The oil major ONGC, which was a cash surplus company at our time, is now cash strapped because it was forced by this government to buy out loss-making Gujarat Petroleum Corporation which was on the brink of insolvency,” said Pilot.He also attacked the “sad state of the country’s economy.”“Today, there is job loss and unemployment everywhere in the country. In the last two months alone, 2 crore jobs have been lost against this government’s promise of generating 2 crore new jobs. Also, because of this government’s faulty economic policies, 23 crore people in the country have slipped below the poverty line,” said Pilot.“But whenever we demand answers from it on these issues, it only talks of India-Pakistan, mandir-masjid or gives slogans which are of no use,” he said.Later during his address to media on the Uttarakhand elections, Pilot said that the party is ready to fight it “unitedly and is confident of winning with a thumping majority.”“The ruling BJP, despite getting a clear mandate from the public, has created political instability in Uttarakhand by changing two CMs and having a third one in four months. The people of the state are feeling duped and waiting to give their full support to Congress in the 2022 elections. Till then, the party will raise the issues faced by the public,” said Pilot.On the factionalism in the party’s Uttarakhand unit, he said, “There is no tussle for power in the party but that’s a healthy competition showing able and efficient leadership here. As per the party’s tradition, if the party wins the polls in 2022, the central leadership will choose the face of CM without any issues.”The state BJP, meanwhile, refuted Pilot’s allegation against the government. “Pilot is dissatisfied with his central leadership and is just doing his duty as party leader in whichever state he is being sent to,” said Madan Kaushik, party state president.“Also, before giving a lecture on fuel prices, he should have asked his government to slash the VAT of petrol and diesel in Rajasthan where it is maximum in the country. Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, both ruled by the BJP, have the lowest VAT,” he added.Kaushik also said, “The prices of petrol and diesel have risen because of price hike in the international market amid Covid-19 pandemic which has affected economies of all the countries including India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/petrol-costlier-than-desi-ghee-clear-loot-of-common-man-s-money-sachin-pilot-101626447913888.html

Alongside, the controversial Electricity (Amendment) Bill, seeking to open up the distribution sector for multiple players enabling consumers to choose their service provider may also be tabled during the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament. Powermen in UP are against many provisions of the Bill. The new scheme announced in the Union Budget-2021-22 was cleared by the Cabinet on June 30. To remain effective for five years till 2024-25, the conditional revamped distribution reform scheme aims to improve operational efficiencies of state power distribution companies by helping them strengthen their infrastructure. “We have asked states to submit their DPRs for the works they want to get done under the new scheme latest by October this year,” union secretary, power, Alok Kumar, said over phone. He said UP would be a major beneficiary of the new initiative. “This scheme also focuses on three things — installation of prepaid smart meters in all the 500 cities covered under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), segregating agriculture feeders from domestic feeders and putting up energy meters on all the distribution transformers,” disclosed Kumar. These measures, he said, would go a long way in improving discoms’ financial position by plugging in pilferages, reducing distribution losses and enhancing revenue collection, and in turn, helping them provide better services to consumers. In UP, 61 cities with a population above one lakh have been identified for the AMRUT scheme. And all of them would have prepaid smart meters under the centre’s distribution reform project. Smaller towns in this category include Akbarpur, Amroha, Ayodhya, Ballia, Banda, Baraut, Basti, Badaun, Chandausi, Etah, Kasganj, Etawah, Fatehpur, Firozabad, Sitapur and Hardoi. In the meantime, the central government is also gearing up make important amendments to the Electricity Act, 2003, to pave the way for the entry of more players, including private suppliers, into the field of power distribution. Kumar said the Electricity (Amendment) Bill had been sent the cabinet secretariat that may refer the same to the cabinet for approval. “Subject to the cabinet’s nod, the Bill may be tabled during the coming monsoon session,” he indicated. UP’s power engineers and employees are against the government bringing the Bill without taking the main stakeholders into confidence and have decided to join a nationwide one-day strike called by the All-India Power Engineers’ Federation (AIPEF) on August 10. “We have served a notice on the union power ministry with regard to the one-day strike,” said Shailendra Dubey, AIPEF chairman, here on Friday. He said UP’s power engineers and employees would also join the strike. The proposed amendments, he claimed, aimed to benefit private companies at the expense of the interests of consumers and employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/distribution-reform-scheme-centre-tells-up-to-submit-dpr-by-oct-101626446473007.html

16-07-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: A Tale of Three Cities||Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata — three cities that glitter like a tiara across India’s forehead; each equally eulogised, criticised, glorified and vilified. Each city singularly different, unabashedly divergent and a world unto itself. One, celebrated as the country’s business and film capital; another, the seat of its administration and political power; and the third, a repository of its intellectual and cultural ethos. But beyond their stereotyping and mythology, behind their facades and fences, what are they really like? Surely, there’s no better way to get under the skin of a city than to dine as a guest in one of its celebrated homes. For it is only here, ensconced within the four walls of your host’s private residence, that you are afforded a peek into their city’s heart and can get a measure of its manners and modes, its customs and canons, what makes it tick and what gets its goat. “The first question you get asked by people you’ve just been introduced to at a Delhi dinner is: Where do you live?” says a long-time resident of the Capital. “In Delhi, location is everything. A Delhiwala can gauge what work you do and how much you’re worth in two seconds flat — just by knowing where you live. On the other hand, in Kolkata, the first questions I’m asked are usually to find out which authors and filmmakers I admire and which political ideology I adhere to…” And what about Mumbai, I prompt the long-time Capital resident, what are the first questions you get asked here? “In Mumbai, no one really bothers about where you live or what books you read — all they want to know is what you do,” she guffaws. **************************** “Even the art on the walls of each of these cities is so very different,” says a young corporate honcho, whose work takes him frequently to all three cities. “In Delhi, it is wall-to-wall Hussains and humongous works by Subodh Gupta and Ravindra Reddy — after all they have the space for them. In Mumbai, you’re more likely to see the ‘progressives’ on the walls like Raza and Souza, while older collectors display their Shiavax Chawdas and Aras with pride. And of course, the grand old homes in Kolkata feature works primarily by the Bengali masters and Ganesh Pyne,” he says, adding, “But that’s not all, even what you see on the bookshelves is so very different in all three places.” How so? “Well, firstly in Delhi, there are two kinds of people,” says the corporate honcho, “Those who display handsome, leather-bound collections of volumes, which you know have never been opened even once; then there are the other homes — mostly in Lutyen’s Delhi — where you will almost certainly see well-thumbed copies of William Dalrymple’s City of Djinns, Tharoor’s The Great Indian Novel and Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography by Frank Moraes.” And Mumbai? “In Mumbai, you’re more likely to encounter copies of Shantaram, Sacred Games, Maximum City and A Brief History of Time. Meanwhile in Kolkata, as to be expected, Tagore’s collected works take pride of place, along with books by Amit Chaudhuri, Amitav Ghosh and Siddhartha Mukherjee…” **************************** But of course, it’s not only what’s on the walls and shelves that tell the tales of these three cities and their individual traits, but also what transpires over the course of the evening: What is spoken about and is not can convey so much about a city’s ethos. As to be expected, here too there are striking differences. A media maven, who finds himself in one or the other of these three every four months or so, says he follows simple ground rules: “I never begin a conversation about politics in Delhi, if I don’t have lots of time. In Mumbai, I avoid talking about business or the stock exchange if I’m party-hopping; and in Kolkata, I never enter a discussion about football or Mamata Banerjee, if I want a peaceful evening ahead.” Ah yes, what about the sensitivities in each city, I ask the media maven: What does an outsider have to remember never to say at dinner? “That’s simple,” he replies, “The rule of thumb in Delhi is don’t criticise the ruling regime — unless you’re among really close friends. In Mumbai, it’s best not to criticise Sachin Tendulkar or Lata Mangeshkar; and in Kolkata, you’d be better off not saying a word against Sourav Ganguly and Satyajit Ray.” And what do people like to show off about over dinner in these three cities, I ask the media maven. “I guess in Delhi, it’s about owning a farmhouse, or a politician; in Kolkata, people take great pride in telling you about their priceless collections of shawls, or first editions of Tagore’s Gitanjali; and in Mumbai, it’s all about owning a boat and a getaway home in Alibag — though these days, among the younger lot, it’s also about their latest three-star Michelin experience,” he says. **************************** Which brings us to the most important part of at-home dining — the food on the table and the drinks on offer. “It’s still scotch, preferably Johnny Walker Blue Label, with kebabs, butter chicken tandoori naan and kali daal, in Delhi — unless Ritu Dalmia is catering,” says the long-time Capital resident. “In Mumbai, it could be anything from finger foods like Japanese sushi to Gujarati sev puri and khandvi, to a tossed green salad and a charcuterie and cheese board, accompanied by a choice of new-world wines and Bloody Mary or Margaritas. In Kolkata, the table will groan with homemade Bengali specialties like machher jhol, hilsa curry and often a platter of the city’s famous Nizam’s rolls, Arsalan’s biryani or Chinese dishes from Tangra.” What about dress codes, how seriously should one take them, we ask the Delhi resident. “That’s particularly revealing,” she says, “In Delhi, smart casual could mean either showing up in a Modi jacket or in heavy-duty designer brands like Gucci-Pucci and Dior. In Mumbai, generally it’s casual chic and anything goes — jeans, capris, Hawaiian shirts, flip flops or even Kohlapuri chappals. Of course, in Kolkata, a crisp dhoti-kurta with a perfectly crimpled hand finish is de rigueur…”**************************** Anything else you can tell us about these cities, we ask our three friends who appear to be so well versed in their ways. “Yes. What time you arrive for the dinner says a lot about you in Delhi,” says the corporate honcho. “In Delhi, an 8.30pm invitation means that your main guest will show up three hours later, mumbling ‘sorry, ministerji called’,” he smiles. “In Mumbai, it seems to be all about being fashionably late,” says the Capital’s long-time resident, adding, “Here, the words Midnight’s Children take on a new meaning, as no self-respecting guest arrives before 10.30pm and the dinner goes on till the wee hours.” “Try coming even half-an-hour late in Kolkata and you’re sure to receive a frosty look from your hosts and what’s worse — find the ilish curry almost finished,” says the media maven. “Also, you might never get invited again.” **************************** So, there you have it, gentle reader: The ins and outs of at-home dining in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, from people in the know. As we said at the very beginning, each city singularly different, unabashedly divergent and a world unto itself…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-a-tale-of-three-cities-101626444073778.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||Victims of Covid-19 vaccine fraud will be vaccinated soon, BMC tells Bombay HC||A separate drive will be undertaken to inoculate more than 2,000 persons in Mumbai who became the victims of bogus Covid-19 vaccination camps, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) told the Bombay High Court on Friday. Senior advocate Anil Sakhre, the civic body's lawyer, said that of 2,053 people who were duped at these privately-organized camps, 1,636 were checked. "1,636 people reached out to us and we checked them. They were not found to have any side effects or health problems. Police report says saline water was given to them instead of a vaccine," he told the HC. "We have asked the Central Government to de-register the victims from the CoWin portal and re-register them. We will have a drive soon for vaccinating them," he said. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer Siddharth Chandrashekhar through advocate Anita Castellino. The PIL sought greater access to vaccine doses and resolution of the problems faced by people while booking slots on the CoWin portal. On July 2, the BMC had told the court that it had formulated draft guidelines to prevent fake vaccination camps. A racket which organized bogus vaccination at housing societies, private firms and educational institutions in the name of reputed hospitals came to light last month and several people were arrested. The court had asked the Maharashtra government to inform about the status of the police probe. Chief Public Prosecutor Aruna Pai said a charge sheet will be filed within two weeks in the first FIR which is related to the duping of a housing society in suburban Kandivali. "The corporation is expected to keep a vigil on all such drives in future. It must also ensure that vaccination for victims is not delayed," the HC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/victims-of-covid-19-vaccine-fraud-will-be-vaccinated-soon-bmc-tells-bombay-hc-101626440334992.html
16-07-2021||Other||Global village idiot: The truth about faith||PUNE “They are afraid of change, but their boss has faith in you. Have no fear and complete what you started. When they see the benefits to them, they will stop seeing threats, and they will stand with you too.”This was the advice my spiritual guide gave me many years ago when I was faced with a peculiar problem related to my first consulting project - the entire team had voted to invite a consultant, but they all worked against the project in the background. Left to my own devices and that of my immediate circle of friends and advisors, I would have eventually quit the assignment since the incessant politics was not worth it.“Your body can heal itself. But your mind must let it.”This advice came from my physician, Dr Anant Gokhale, who I met many years ago. I had just met the good doctor having moved to Pune in 1996, a practitioner of medicine who rarely prescribed medicines to me. I had long working hours and a degenerative health condition and injuries had left me with a daily dose of medicines to stay functional. Left to my own devices, I would have kept working and taking prescription medicines, and eventually have let the body’s ailments overcome my spirit.What was my spiritual guide’s advice, really? To look at nothing, but the goal. To ignore all emotional voices. To perceive only the path to achievement of the goal. To understand that if I want to achieve anything in life, I have to rise above all that would stand in the way, including my ego, which always interprets any criticism or opposition as an insult, triggering thought processes that keep me up all day and all night addressing negative energies.What was the advice of my physician? To listen to what my body says and to trust the advice it offered.For a logical mind, to learn the required lessons in order to accept such advice - truly accept it and practice it - was a tall order. I was in my mid-20s then, and still many experiences, failures, and comebacks-from-failures away from internalising such a lesson. I would say I was at least a decade away from the learning.In both cases, I simply took the advice and followed it without question. I never rationalised it or thought it through or analysed it, or allowed any other cognitive barrier to stand in the way. I just implemented the advice.That is Faith.Even later, when there were further doubts, I just ignored all my usual thoughts and just kept on trudging on. Over the subsequent years, I had occasion to seek advice from my guide and my physician on several matters - personal, family, work, corporate, health - and their advice was always consistent, eerily similar: take the right path first time every time and then, be carefree.Today, on a day to day basis, I (still) go through my very generous dose of self-doubt, suspicion, persecution, physical hardships, and sundry other distractions. (Like everybody else). And I still put in the hard work to have Faith. Because you can’t take it for granted that you have learnt to have Faith. Faith is that belief in something that you can’t see, perceive, know, or feel. Faith is that which is beyond what logic reveals to us, that knowledge which is beyond what education and experience teaches us, that relationship to a future that is beyond what the past and present are capable of revealing, that place where even Trust does not dare to tread.As a result of having Faith, I have found myself believing in people rather than not believing them. That in turn means that I don’t doubt them or their intentions. Which means I am reposing Trust in their character: And that leads them to live up to that Trust in themselves.From the time that I started having such Faith, I have come to learn that most people just wanted to be trusted and believed, but that day-to-day human interactions make it quite difficult for people to trust one another. Day-to-day logical processes lead us to build walls that exclude most opportunities and people. For instance, if someone breaks my trust and I stop trusting people, then the loss is mine, for I have excluded all of humanity from reaching me; however, if I exclude the person (or people) who broke the trust and continue to trust everyone else, then I include all of humanity in my world and therefore, increase my chances of a better life. But for this to happen, I have to go beyond the mechanism of Trust (a logical process based on evidence and reason). Faith is different. Because when someone places their Faith in me, it is without reason and I seem to feel like living up to that Faith for it assigns a value to me that I always wanted, but maybe had never perceived I deserved. Someone else’s Faith in me says that I am dependable, that I am important, that I matter and I don’t have to prove it. That is a liberation of sorts.After two decades of following that advice, I aver that Faith can move mountains. For I can honestly say that had I followed the path of reason alone, I would have been more alone than ever, having vetoed most ideas on some grounds or the other, shut out most people, let my health run aground, and isolated myself from most opportunities to change.Faith makes me see that which reason cannot sanction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/global-village-idiot-the-truth-about-faith-101626441552894.html

He further noted that Indore, which was previously one of the worst-affected districts due to the pandemic, has recorded only one case in the 24-hour span for the first time in 16 months.Dr Malakar attributed the decline in the number of cases to the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive in the district and also the weakening of the impact of the second wave of infections, PTI reported.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday last unveiled a population policy aimed at stabilising the state’s population.

A tech-savvy person, Fatima tried marketing her products on Facebook and Instagram. The strategy worked. She has over the last eight months began getting orders for her products from as far as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.Fatima said she initially mainly catered to local markets and now she is even getting bulk orders from far off places. “I am now trying to complete the formalities related to GST (Goods and Services Tax) etc so that I can supply these products to different states,” said Fatima, who learnt the art after getting married from her mother-in-law, Aisha Begum.“Four women of the household, including me, are making these jewellery items,” said Aisha Begum, who has taught the art to many women in the region.Also Read | Court notice to Champat Rai, three others over Ayodhya land dealFatima said that despite the pandemic, the women involved in the craft were earning up to ₹500 a day for around six-hour work. “This is a traditional art passed on from one generation to another.

Now, the aim is to find buyers abroad,” she Fatima, whose family has traditionally been involved in making baskets, coasters and bags.Around 500 women in villages such as Mahewa, Dandi and Badoka near Prayagraj are involved in making these products.

CM Patnaik proposed that the vaccination for 12-18 years be expedited during a virtual meeting with PM Modi on Friday.Patnaik’s request for early vaccination came on the back of Zydus Cadila concluding its clinical trials for a DNA vaccine for people in the 12 to 18 age group. Last month, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) chief Dr NK Arora said children above 12 years can be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease in August once the clinical trials are over subject to regulatory approvals.During the meeting, Patnaik also demanded that 95 per cent of vaccine allocation for Odisha should be given to the state government and the rest 5 per cent to the private hospitals.“Odisha has been performing very well in vaccination and our wastage is among the lowest in the country. However, due to the low presence of private hospitals in the state, lifting of the vaccines from the 25% quota has been less,” he said. Due to vaccine shortage, Odisha’s pace of vaccination has been inconsistent with some days the vaccination figure dropping below 5,000 while on others over 2 lakh people getting vaccinated.Regarding the high Test Positivity Ration in coastal districts, Khurda and Cuttack, Patnaik said the TPR is high in coastal districts as they were affected by cyclone Yaas. He said Covid appropriate behaviours got compromised during cyclone Yaas in those districts.The PM advised Odisha and other states to move forward with the strategy of ‘test, track, treat and tika’ while urging the states to go for micro-containment zones to prevent the spread of the virus.Odisha on Thursday extended lockdown in 10 of the 30 districts including Khurda till August 1 as the Covid-19 infections had not come down. The state is reporting more than 60 deaths daily since last week though the state government clarified that all the deaths may not be recent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-cm-demands-early-vaccination-for-12-18-age-group-101626435673243.html

The official added the L-G has been endorsing the police panel. “But the Delhi government wants to engage its own panel of prosecutors on the sensitive matter to ensure unbiased hearings.”The official said the Cabinet’s decision will be conveyed to the office of the L-G. The Delhi Police report to the Union home ministry through the L-G.Later in a press briefing, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia confirmed the development. He said, “In today’s Cabinet meeting, we have decided that Delhi government will appoint its own panel of lawyers. The L-G had earlier dismissed the Delhi government’s recommendations on appointing such a panel. It is unfortunate that the central government is intervening in routine affairs of Delhi’s governance through the L-G . Appointing prosecution in Delhi comes under the elected government’s domain, going by Supreme Court’s directions. The L-G, however, has a veto power which can be used in rarest of the rare cases. Such routine use of the veto power is unconstitutional, anti-democratic and goes against the spirit of Supreme Court’s directions.”In a tweet, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “To support the farmers of the country is the duty of every Indian. We have not done anyone any favour. We have just fulfilled our responsibility towards farmers of the nation. Farmers are not criminal, they are not terrorists. They provide us food.”Baijal’s move to reject the idea of having the government-appointed prosecutors argue the cases related to the January 26 violence has become the latest source of disagreement between the two sides.Also Read | Domestic flights at Delhi airport’s Terminal 2 might resume from July 22Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office confirmed the development on Thursday and said the Cabinet would meet on Friday to take up the issue.“The L-G has dismissed the team of special public prosecutors appointed by the Delhi government with regard to the cases concerning the farmers’ agitation. The L-G has directed that the prosecutors suggested by the Delhi Police be approved. So, we have called a Cabinet meeting regarding this matter. The Delhi government had set up a panel of lawyers to ensure unbiased hearing in the agitation of farmers, who have been protesting against three contentious farm laws. Delhi’s home minister Satyendar Jain dismissed the list of lawyers suggested by the Delhi Police,” Kejriwal’s office said in a statement on Thursday.An official in the L-G’s office reacted to the statement saying the matter pertained to the violence, and disrespect to the national flag on January 26 and not to the farmer protest. “It has nothing to do with ‘farmers protest’ as is being deliberately made out. Individuals with predetermined agenda and vested interests deliberately carried out acts on January 26, 2021 in full media presence that were not only an affront to national morale but aimed at bringing shame to India internationally.”On January 26, protesting farmers clashed with police during the rally and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.Also Read | Rights activists caution against child labour and trafficking during pandemicThe statement from the chief minister’s office on Thursday said the L-G was “pressuring” the government to approve lawyers chosen by the police. “...Jain sent details of Delhi government’s panel to the L-G. The L-G has not approved it even though the work of Delhi government’s lawyers has earlier been appreciated by all, including the L-G.”On February 26, the police sent a proposal to the Delhi home department for the appointment of 11 law officers to represent the state in the cases. The government responded saying an existing team of prosecutors will argue them.On July 1, Baijal met Jain, but the matter remained unresolved. On July 2, Baijal wrote to Kejriwal, requesting him to convene a meeting of his council of ministers over the matter.Referring to the meeting, the official in the L-G’s office said, “Apart from earlier disagreement on file, the L-G in the said meeting on July 1, 2021, with the home minister, clearly and categorically expressed his disagreement at the minister turning down the valid request by the Delhi Police for appointment of special prosecutors. The same was reiterated and clearly conveyed in a subsequent letter from L-G to the CM, requesting him convene a meeting of the council of ministers to consider and decide the said disagreement at the earliest....”The government and the L-G also disagreed last year over the appointment of lawyers to argue the 2020 northeast Delhi riots cases. In 2018, differences of opinion also surfaced over the appointment of prosecutors in the case of alleged assault on former Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash. In those cases, the L-G’s decision prevailed since the matter was finally referred to the President, who approved the former’s decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govtappointed-prosecutors-to-deal-with-cases-related-to-tractor-rally-violence-delhi-cabinet-101626431173387.html
16-07-2021||Jaipur||Increasing big cat population at Ranthambore Tiger Reserve a concern||The increasing tiger population at Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) in Sawai Madhopur district has become a concern for the Rajasthan government with territorial fights and man-animal conflict due to dispersal out of the Reserve area, officials said.Two days back, tigress Arrrowhead (T-84) was spotted with three cubs. The big cat population in RTR’s has reached 79, including 28 cubs and sub-adults living in an area of 1,334 square kilometres, making it the third most congested habitats of felines in India after the Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam.The state has three tiger reserves with over 103 big cats – 79 at RTR , 23 at Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) in Alwar, and one left at Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in Kota.In a recent development, after the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change get the permission, tigress Ridhi will be relocated to Sariska Tiger Reserve as she and her sister Siddhi have injured each other number of times claiming a territory. Five months back in January, two-and-half-year-old tigress Ridhi had received 14 stitches on the tongue after getting injured in a territorial fight with her sibling Siddhi.In wake of the growing population and infights, the CM has directed the officials to form a panel of experts to suggest shifting tigers.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the meeting of the State Wildlife Board held on Thursday, directed the officials to form a panel of experts. The panel will suggest shifting the increasing number of tigers to other sanctuary areas; and ways to develop Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve and the newly formed Ramgarh Vishdhari Tiger Reserve in Bundi, said an official release.Gehlot said that the state government is working on a plan to develop new tiger reserves in the state to provide safe shelter to the tigers in line with their increasing population in the state. “It is a matter of happiness that the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Bundi region has recently been approved by the NTCA as a Tiger Reserve. Now, it is our endeavour to promote the conservation of tigers and other wildlife in Kumbhalgarh Sanctuary and other forest areas,” he said.RTR Field Director TC Verma said, “The big cat population is rising in the Reserve and they need space. Not just one but we have asked to permit to shift more.”RTR is the source area to re-populate other Reserves in the state, since the inception of project tiger in 1973, then the Reserve had 11 tigers.In the last five years, five tigers were relocated from RTR – four to Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in 2018 and one to Sariska Tiger Reserve in 2019.Of the five relocated, MT-4 is the lone survivor at MHTR as the rest, MT-2 and MT-3, along with their two cubs, died last year in the month of July and August; while MT-1 cannot be traced. Similarly, 7-year-old ST-16 which was shifted to Sariska Tiger Reserve, Alwar in April 2019, died two months after the shifting allegedly by an overdose of tranquillizer injected to treat a wound.Retired IFS, Sunayan Sharma said looking to the increasing population relocation of tigers should be the priority, or else territorial fights and man-animal conflict will continue. “The kind of management done here is not scientific management as carrying capacity should is the guiding principle. Relocation and habitat improvement of tigers should be done simultaneously,” he said.He said tigers were relocated in past, some died but that does not mean that the relocation process should be stopped. Tigers should be sent again to MHTR, and people should be held accountable. If relocation is stopped the population will continue to increase, he said.Sharma said old tiger habitats should be revived and developed such as Ramgarh Vishdhari, MHTR, and Raoli Todgarh in Udaipur – this will help in tiger and environment conservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/increasing-big-cat-population-at-ranthambore-tiger-reserve-a-concern-cm-calls-for-expert-panel-101626430455464.html

16-07-2021||Delhi||LSR student and some young volunteers: Driven to educate one and all||When one hears that the pandemic caused someone to drop out of school or college, due to lack of funds, it pinches the soul. That’s what was experienced by Arpita Chowdhury, a second-year student of BA (Hons) English at Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Delhi University (DU). She realised the extent of the digital divide when she came in touch with a few students, who she had mentored in the past. “In absence of any support, they might have had to leave their education in between. This thought made me start the initiative named #EducationForAll, to ensure a sustainable and inclusive atmosphere for all students, even those from the marginalised background,” says Chowdhury. “I had the means to receive good education, and it was an emotional turmoil to see other youngsters being forced to quit midway due to lack of resources,” recalls the 20- year-old, who is currently teaching five students from tribal families, hailing from villages of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. “To run this campaign, two of my friends are supporting me, and we attempt to ensure that during such difficult times these young adults are able to continue their education, and pursue their dreams. These youngsters are enrolled in a government schools, but had expressed desire for additional help since online classes weren’t enough. So we asked them to move back to Delhi, and we’ve raised funds for their education and living facilities in east Delhi’s Pandav Nagar,” she adds. To teach these youngsters from economically weaker background, there are about 30 student volunteers available remotely from across India, including DU. “These teachers are enrolled on a bi-monthly basis,” says Aarushi Raj, project coordinator of the initiative, and a student at DU’s Kamala Nehru College, adding, “We’ve reached out to over 500 people, using social media, to collect resources such as books, stationery, and even funds for internet provision. Many students have been unable to pursue their education smoothly, due to poor internet connectivity and lack of devices to attend online classes. We are trying to make a little difference in their lives, and hope to include more students under this initiative in the near future.” It’s not just academics but their all round development – through workshops and webinars – that this initiative focusses on. It also provides the underprivileged students with access to career coaching as well as psychologist. And the students are more than grateful for all the help. “I always wanted to continue my education, which seemed almost impossible amid the pandemic. Now, with the help of this initiative, I believe I have gained more knowledge and feel confident about myself. Arpita didi is helping me pursue my dream of becoming a mechanical engineer,” says Lodro Munda, a class XII student from Jharkhand, who is currently enrolled in a Delhi school.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lsr-student-and-some-young-volunteers-driven-to-educate-one-and-all-101626429138073.html
16-07-2021||Ranchi||State Information Commission defunct for 14 months in Congress-ruled Jharkhand||Chandramohan Paswan, a resident of Hazaribag district in Jharkhand, was in Ranchi for some work this week. He took out time to visit the Jharkhand State Information Commission office on Wednesday to enquire about the status of the appeal he filed seeking information related to the allotment of a gas agency in Bermo town in Bokaro district.Much to Paswan’s surprise, he was told by clerical staff in the commission that the next date of hearing in his case was yet to be fixed as the state government is yet to appoint an information commissioner.“It has been so long now that I don’t even remember the exact date I had sought information from the Bokaro SDM office. Probably it was in 2017. Then I had filed my second appeal here. Every time I come to Ranchi, I visit the office to check the status but the situation remains the same,” said Paswan. As a result, Paswan is not the only applicant facing such hardships. Officials in the information commission said around 12,000 appeals are waiting for disposal. The state information commission is lying defunct since information commissioner Himanshu Shekhar Chaudhary retired after completing his term on May 8 2020. The state has a provision of six commissioners including a chief information commissioner. However, all six posts are lying vacant since May last year.“There were around 8,000 appeals under process when the last commissioner retired. Since May last year, we have received around 4,000 new appeals. We make file entries for all the applications. Beyond that, only the commissioners take a call whether they reject or admit the appeal for further hearing,” said a staff at the commission, not willing to be named.Not only the commissioners, but the post of secretary is also vacant now which has a direct bearing on over a dozen of contractual staff working at the commission which wears a deserted look as its core work has come to a standstill.“Our salary has been withheld for the past two months as Abhishek Tiwary, who was the secretary, got transferred. He had the salary disbursal powers for the contractual staff. We are eagerly waiting for someone to be posted here,” said a home guard on duty at the commission.The office has 10 home guards working on contract besides half a dozen staff in the project monitoring unit at the commission, staff members at the office said.In January last year, the Personnel Administrative Reforms and Rajbhasa department of the Hemant Soren-led three-party coalition government, where the Congress is the second largest ally besides the RJD, invited applications for filling the post of commissioners. Officials said around 300 applications were received against the advertisement. However, there is no forward movement on the appointment issue since inviting applications. Vandana Dadel, the incumbent secretary in the department refused to comment on the issue. “I won’t like to comment anything on the matter now,” she said when asked if anything has moved on that front.The Congress party takes credit for bringing the Right to Information Act but its Jharkhand unit president and finance minister, Rameshwar Oraon, could not give a definitive date till when the appointments would be made. “We had initiated the process but the mandatory clause of the Leader of Opposition being in the three-member selection committee delayed the process as the matter of the LoP is being heard in assembly Speaker’s court. We had taken legal opinion and it has been finalized that the senior-most member of the main opposition party could be taken on board. The process is on. We expect it to be done soon,” said Oraon.BJP, the principal opposition, appointed Babulal Marandi as its legislature party leader after he merged his party JVM(P) into the BJP within months after the 2019 assembly elections. Two of his JVM(P) legislators joined the Congress. The assembly speaker has not granted LoP status to Marandi to date as the split and merger of the JVM(P) is now being heard in his court under the anti-defection law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-information-commission-defunct-for-14-months-in-congress-ruled-jharkhand-101626428773070.html
16-07-2021||Bhopal||Four dead, 10 trapped inside well in MP’s Vidisha||Ten people are still feared trapped inside a well in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha district, about 100 kms north of Bhopal, police said on Friday. Four bodies have been recovered, and 23 people of Lalpathar village have been rescued. Rescue operation has been on for the past 16 hours after about 40 people, who had gathered around a 40-feet-deep well to watch the rescue of a 10-year-old boy, fell into it when its boundary wall caved in under their weight, police said late on Thursday. Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Teams of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are trying to rescue others but the operation has slowed down due to mudslide inside the well. Three JCB machines are being used to pull out mud from the well.” According to villagers of Lalpathar, the rescue operation is getting delayed due to a strategic error. “The teams dug a parallel space for pumping out water from the well but it didn’t work due to mudslide inside the well. The expert team didn’t analyse the quality of the soil before digging parallel space,” said Devendra Kumar, a local resident. A tractor which was being used to pump out water also fell into the well due to mudslide. Four police personnel who were sitting on the tractor sustained injuries, said Sanjay Sahu, additional superintendent of police, Vidisha. Villagers blamed the sarpanch and local administration for the accident.“The well is the only source of water for 700 families of the village. A large number of people came here for fetching water. The safety wall of the well was weak and villagers informed the sarpanch and panchayat secretary about it. Even the boy fell into the well as a part of it caved in,” said Anita, who lives near the well. Sarpanch, panchayat secretary and collector couldn’t be contacted for response. Bhopal additional director general of police A Sai Manohar said, “We can’t comment anything on this incident. We are now concentrating on rescue operation only.” Meanwhile, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has ordered a high-level inquiry in the matter and also announced an ex gratia of ₹5 lakh for the next kin of the deceased and ₹50,000 to those injured in the accident. Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia expressed his grief. “Deeply saddened by the news of many people falling in the tragic accident that took place in Ganjbasoda, Vidisha, I pray to god for everyone’s safety,” he said in his tweet. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi also expressed condolence to the family members of those who lost their lives in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/four-dead-10-trapped-inside-well-in-mp-s-vidisha-101626428473241.html

Like many people in Ganjam venturing out to other states in search of work, Mohapatra thought he would earn a livelihood and return home a couple of months later.On Thursday afternoon, Mohapatra, now a frail man in his seventies, returned home after four decades. He cannot walk without a walking stick; his wife and daughter are no more. “Though everyone in the family and his childhood friends are jubilant, there is a sense of loss. My uncle looks very frail. We had to get a car to take him home from the railway station,” said Mohapatra’s nephew Dhruba Charan Rana.Rana said when Mohapatra did not return a few months after he left his village, the family began searching for him starting from Assam to Mumbai. “Some said he might have gone to Bhubaneswar or Cuttack. We searched everywhere, but stopped looking out for him a few years later,” said Rana.Also Read | Odisha chit fund scam: CBI arrests brothers of firm’s managing directorMohapatra would perhaps have never been able to come home, had it not been for Sanjay Shinde, who runs an NGO called Roti Bank in Burhanpur town of Madhya Pradesh, and Kamal Rathi, a Cuttack-based businessman.When Mohapatra initially reached Mumbai, he started working for a civil contractor. The contractor reportedly asked him to leave after his work came to an end, but did not pay him. From Mumbai, Mohapatra boarded a train thinking that it was headed for Berhampur, the railhead near his village. Instead, he reached Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh, thanks to his issue with pronunciation.“Once he got down at Burhanpur station, the railway police arrested him as he did not have a ticket. He was put in a lock-up, but later released after the police realised that he was innocent. But his lack of fluency in Hindi ensured that he could not go back home,” said Shinde.Mohapatra did odd jobs, such as washing dishes at a hotel, working as a security guard or on construction sites. As age caught up, he could not work. He did not have a place to stay and started living in under-construction buildings while trying to do menial jobs. However, a family in Burhanpur would provide him food every now and then.Shinde, who runs Roti Bank, that feeds the homeless and hungry in Burhanpur, got to know about the “old man from Odisha” from his WhatsApp group in January last year.When Shinde met Mohapatra, he couldn’t make out anything that the latter said, but could decipher that he hailed from a place called Tikarpada in Odisha and wanted to go back there before he died. “I tried to make him talk to some Odia people who stayed in Burhanpur, but nothing much came out of it,” said Shinde.Eager to help Mohapatra reach home, Shinde asked an acquaintance, if he knew anyone in Odisha. It was then that his acquaintance’s nephew Kamal Rathi got in touch with Shinde and started searching for Tikarpada after watching some video clips of Mohapatra talking about his village.Rathi works with Indiacares, a group of volunteers comprising Odisha-based IPS officer Arun Bothra as well as students and other professionals that helped Covid-19 patients during the first wave of pandemic last year.Rathi watched the video clips of Mohapatra many times, but could not decipher what Mohapatra wanted to say. “He spoke the names of many villages and some of his family members. But he was away from Odisha for more than 40 years, without contact with other Odia people and his language did not seem to have the accent of Berhampur town, but was a mix of Odia and Marathi with a Malva accent. His diction was difficult to decipher. The only name that registered with me was Tikarpada,” said Rathi.Rathi then started looking for places near Berhampur town with names that sounded similar to Tikarpada on Google Maps. After searching for some days, he chanced upon a village called Sahadeb Tikarpara in Digapahandi block. It was 50km away from Berhampur railway station. “I thought this could be Mohapatra’s village,” he said.The next job was to find out if his family was still there in the village. “I asked for help from IPS officer Arun Bothra, now transport commissioner. He then spoke to superintendent of police of Ganjam, Brijesh Rai who sent a police team to the village. The police team contacted the sarpanch of the village who led them to the family,” said Rathi.Soon a video call was arranged and Mohapatra’s family recognised him. On Wednesday, Mohapatra’s nephew Dhruba Charan Rana reached Burhanpur after Rathi booked their train tickets.“I thought I would never see my uncle and almost given up on him. My grandparents had died longing for my uncle’s return. I was too overwhelmed with emotion when I saw him,” said Rana.At Burhanpur, the sub divisional magistrate and the local Maheswari Samaj organised a farewell ceremony for Mohapatra. He was shaved and given new outfits and shoes before boarding the Udhna -Khurda Road special train back to Berhampur station.On Thursday afternoon, soon after he reached his home, there was a flurry of visitors. “My uncle was tired, but happy,” said Rana. “When he left, he was around 27 years old and their daughter barely one. It would have been a happier reunion had his wife and daughter been there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-man-missing-for-40-years-returns-home-with-help-from-good-samaritans-101626428052878.html

With the Covid-19 protocol in place, doctors in personal protective equipment (PPE) performed the delicate surgery, which involved connecting minuscule veins under a high-tech microscope.The boy was playing badminton with his friends when the shuttlecock landed on a tree on May 28 at Boisar in Maharashtra’s Palghar district. While removing it, his right thumb got stuck in a wire and was severed.“...he was completely traumatised from the accident. We immediately called our family physician, who instructed us to rush to a hospital and preserve the thumb in a plastic bag with ice,” said the boy’s father.Also Read | Mumbai receives July’s second-heaviest rainfall in 10 yearsThe boy underwent a rapid antigen test for Covid-19, which came negative. But considering the efficiency rate of the test, doctors chose to conduct the operation with PPE. “In such cases, it is essential to operate...at the earliest as the cells in the cut-off portion start dying. So, we performed the six-hour-long surgery and the entire procedure under a microscope wearing PPE,” said Dr Sushil Nehete, a plastic, and reconstructive microsurgeon. “It was quite challenging as we had to connect the tiny veins under the microscope with face shields. So, we had to be extra cautious but also had to act fast to save the thumb.”The surgeons joined vessels to restore blood supply. Nerves linked to sensation, and tendons needed to bend and extend fingers were also joined after fixing the bone with a metal wire. “The impact of the injury was so severe that he required a piece of the vein to repair the artery. Each and every structure of the thumb was repaired. This surgery aims to restore the normal form and function of the thumb to a maximum extent,” said Nehete.Doctors said with regular physiotherapy, the boy’s thumb will be fully functional.Dr Leena Jain, a plastic and reconstructive microsurgeon who was part of the medical team that conducted the surgery, said it is possible to re-attach or reconstruct detached fingers if people manage to preserve them and reach the hospital on time for surgery. “This patient was fortunate enough to reach the hospital within 3.5 hours after the injury and wisely brought his amputated part in a well-preserved condition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-reattach-boy-s-thumb-in-6-hr-surgery-101626426972949.html

The court is of the considered view that improvement in the system can be gauged by the faith of people towards the system.

The forum represents more than 350 pujas in the city, including prominent ones, some of which are patronised by ministers and senior leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress. This year Durga Puja will be celebrated in the second week of October. Also Read | Kolkata Metro to resume ops today; Covid curbs to continue till July 30In 2020, the week-long festival was celebrated in a low-key fashion due to the pandemic. The Calcutta high court had banned the entry of visitors inside the pandals, virtually declaring them “no entry zones” to check any gathering, which could have increased the coronavirus spread. “We have also urged the organisers to scale down their spending on the pandals, lighting, idols and other paraphernalia, and instead use the funds fo public service. The pandal should be kept as simple and open as possible with minimum interior work, so that citizens may see the pandal, decoration and idol from outside,” he added. Other Covid-19 restrictions, such as maintaining social distance during puja, wearing masks and sanitisation, will also be followed. Just like last year, no sliced fruits will be offered as bhog (to the idol). Instead only whole fruits will be offered. Last year, over 37,000 community pujas were organised across the state, including over 2,500 pujas in Kolkata. Around 1,700 pujas were organised by women in the state. The list, however, doesn’t include pujas held inside housing societies and hommes. The Mamata Banerjee administration had provided ₹50,000 to each puja organiser as grant in 2020. The court, however, directed the organisers to use the fund to purchase masks and sanitiser which could be distributed to pandal-hoppers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/durga-puja-organisers-in-kolkata-prepare-guidelines-for-festivities-amid-pandemic-101626416832690.html

This marks the heaviest shower of the season so far, and the second-largest quantum of daily rainfall in July in at least the last 10 years. The city had recorded 375.2mm of rain on July 2, 2019, as per India Meteorological Department (IMD) data.However, IMD’s Regional Meteorological Centre’s archives indicate that Friday morning’s shower was the highest quantum of daily rainfall received in July in 14 years, since 2007 -- when the city got 256.6mm of rain in 24 hours on July 8. IMD officials later confirmed to Hindustan Times that this was an erroneous entry.

16-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Chai of hard labour||Will it rain today? That’s the lazy chatter going on. Anybody can come here to have chai, but the tea shop is for labourers, asserts the tea stall owner. This afternoon the unnamed stall is teeming with half a dozen men. Each one of them is holding a plastic glass of chai.“All my customers are mazdoor (labourers),” repeats Muhammed Sabir. The lane that runs parallel to Asaf Ali Road, in Old Delhi, is a smorgasbord of small shops, eateries, and houses, and home to many groups of labourers living on the footpath or in tiny warehouses filled with construction material. Most of these labourers cook their own meals, but often have chai breaks in the area’s tea stalls. This shack is always teeming with folks.The tea things are arranged on the shuttered grills of a building’s characterless back-wall, while the customers sit atop a mound of cement sacks that have solidified into a rock-like hard surface—presumably— over the course of several seasons. “I only make chai, but there are ready-made things to eat,” says Mr Sabir, pointing to glass jars filled with fens and rusks. At the moment, all the customers happen to be Bihar natives. Rahman is from Madhubani, while Bacchu Singh, Salim Akhtar, Muhammed Khwaja Alam and Asit Yadav are from Purnia. The talk veers towards the forthcoming marriage of shy Rahman, who becomes so conscious that he turns his gaze towards his chappals. Some naughty jokes follow at his expense.The tea seller, too, was a labourer. He arrived in Delhi from Madhubani, in Bihar, more than 30 years ago, and “I opened this stall some 10 years ago with the ₹10,000 I had managed to save.” Labourer Bacchu Singh interjects, saying, “I feel apnapan (personal) in this shop. You always see your own folks here. And the chai gives asli taazgi (real energy), it’s a labour (sic) chai.” The rest make similar murmurs. This brotherly consensus becomes a reason for another round of chai; a metal tray is passed around from hand to hand. The shop opens daily from 5am to 8pm. A single serving of chai costs ₹5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-chai-of-hard-labour-101626395796960.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||Water shortage will ease soon, says Chadha||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha on Thursday inspected the Haiderpur treatment plant to check its water level after Haryana released supplies in the Yamuna on Tuesday.Chadha said once the full volume of water reaches the plants, the utility will again be able to achieve the original optimum production of 945MGD (million gallons per day). “Areas that are still getting thin supply will also have supply restored,” he said.“It takes around three days for water to reach all water treatment plants (WTPs) across Delhi, and another day or two for it to reach all households. We are monitoring the speed at which water is flowing in at the Haiderpur WTP,” he said in a statement.The Haiderpur plant is Asia’s second-largest plant, which filters and treats over 200MGD water, he said. Haryana releases raw water in the river Yamuna, which is treated at the WTPs and supplied to households.“Two major water channels of Delhi — CLC (Carrier Lined Channel) and DSB (Delhi Sub-Branch) have started receiving Yamuna water in good proportions and it will have a direct impact on increasing water treatment and production capacity,” the senior AAP leader said.On Sunday, DJB filed a plea in the Supreme Court seeking directions to Haryana to release the share of water Delhi is legally entitled to. On Tuesday, DJB said Haryana has released 16,000 cusecs of water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-shortage-will-ease-soon-says-chadha-101626394203859.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi likely to receive heavy showers over the weekend, says Met||The national capital received little rainfall on Thursday, two days after the southwest monsoon arrived in the city after running a 16-day delay. However, the weather office said a good spell of showers is in sight, and issued an ‘orange’ alert for Sunday, predicting heavy rains across Delhi.“Rainfall activity is expected to start from Saturday night and intensify on Sunday morning. This is because the monsoon trough line, which at present is from Gujarat to the Bay of Bengal, will shift to the northern plains, resulting in intense rainfall and thunder in Delhi and its satellite towns, including Noida and Gurugram,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre. He added the showers will lead to lower temperatures.An orange alert is issued when there is a forecast of rain and thundershowers, along with heavy rainfall in isolated pockets, accompanied by gusty winds of 30-40 kmph.On Thursday, the Safdarjung observatory, considered to be representative of the city, received only “traces” (rainfall up to 2.4mm) of rain. The maximum temperature was 36.6 degrees Celsius, two notches above the season’s normal, and the minimum was four degrees below normal at 23.4 °C. The Lodhi Road weather station, too, recorded only trace rainfall.IMD officials said the Capital is likely to receive steady rainfall between July 19 and July 21. “This period is likely to have good cloud cover, light to moderate rain or thundershowers with gusty winds. This will lead to a drop of almost 4-5 degrees in the maximum temperature,” said a senior IMD official.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 54.6mm of rain, with some areas receiving more than 100mm rain.The southwest monsoon arrived in Delhi on Tuesday, after a string of incorrect predictions by the IMD. This is the most delayed onset of monsoon in the Capital since 2002, when monsoon rains arrived on July 19. According to the weather office, monsoon usually sets in Delhi by June 27.Independent forecasters, too, said good rainfall is likely in the region over the weekend.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet, a private weather forecaster, said Delhi is likely to have continuous and “typical” monsoon rains from July 18 to 20. “The monsoon trough will start shifting from central parts of the country to the northwest from July 17. It is likely to result in moderate to heavy rainfall over Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, west Uttar Pradesh and parts of east and north Rajasthan on July 18. The showers will continue on and off thereafter till at least July 20,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/heavy-showers-likely-on-weekend-says-met-101626388753384.html
16-07-2021||Chandigarh||Now, expect Chandigarh traffic police at your doorstep for pending e-challans||The Chandigarh Traffic Police have decided they will now visit the houses of serial traffic offenders to clear their pending challan.Ever since moving to e-challans, there have been reports that many people didn’t clear their pending dues even though the challans were sent to their mobile numbers and through letters to their residences.As per the traffic police, two teams have been formed of two members each. The traffic cops will first target the habitual offenders, who have the most number of pending challans against them. The routine offenders will be covered in due course. The cops will also provide counselling to the offenders and make them aware about the traffic rules and violations.The teams will take the e-challan machines with them when they visit the offenders. They will not accept cash and will wear a body camera, which will remain switched on to ensure that the residents don’t face any harassment and to rule out the possibility of bribing.67% e-challans issued since March 2020 pendingWhile officials didn’t have fresh data at hand, around 1.05 lakh e-challans were issued between March 2020 and June 2021. Out of this, around 71,000 or around 67% of the e-challans are pending.Many e-challans can be paid on the spot, but for violations like speeding, the offender has to go to the Traffic Lines in Sector 29 to clear the e-challan, which is why many people choose to keep the challan pending. However, with an e-challan pending against a vehicle, it is not possible to sell the vehicle or get its insurance and/or registration certificate renewed.Speaking about the initiative, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration) Palak Goel said, “The step has been taken to ensure that pending e-challans are cleared. It will make it easier for people, too, to pay them, when we go to their residence.”It still remains to be seen what will be done in case the offender is not present at the residence or has shifted. There are some non-compoundable offences like speeding, jumping a red light and using a mobile phone while driving for which the fine isn’t collected by the traffic police but by the courts, so it remains to be seen whether these challans would also be cleared this way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-expect-chandigarh-traffic-police-at-your-doorstep-for-pending-echallans-101626381190693.html

16-07-2021||Chandigarh||Finally, Chandigarh MC decides on technology to upgrade waste processing plant||After more than a year of debates, presentations and study tours, the MC General House on Thursday finally decided on the technology for upgrading the solid waste processing plant in Sector 25 (Dadumajra).The new plant will use the “waste to energy” technology instead of “waste to refused derived fuel”.The next step will be preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) and the tender document. MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We will be writing to Punjab Engineering College, IIT Ropar and Thapar University, inviting their bids for preparation of DPR and the tender document (request for proposal). We will go for the lowest bidder.”The DPR will include the cost estimates, the exact technology model, project time and funding model.“We are expecting the DPR to be ready by this month-end. We plan to the present the DPR before the House in its August meeting. The tender document is likely to be floated in September and we expect the work to be allotted in October,” Yadav said.For using the power generated from the new plant, MC will tie up with the power department. The final modalities of the share of electricity and its monetisation will be decided at a later stage.Notably, the meeting to decide on the technology came after UT adviser Dharam Pal recently warned MC of the administration stepping in, if MC delayed the matter further.The city produces 550-600 metric tonnes of waste daily. Of this, around 200 MT is dry waste, 150 MT is wet (kitchen) waste, mixed waste is 75MT and horticulture waste runs into 100 to 125 MT. However, the plant’s current waste processing capacity is only 70-80 MT.In June last year, the civic body had taken over the plant from the Jaypee Group, due to its inability to process the waste completely.But since then, MC has neither improved the plant’s working nor upgraded the technology and most of the daily waste is still being dumped at the Dadumajra landfill. West waste plant’s capacity to be expanded Yadav said MC will also expand the capacity of the wet waste processing plant up to 300 MT per day. “Even though the company running the plant has been claiming that 300 MT wet waste could be processed every day, in practice it isn’t more than 70 MT. The DPR will also include this aspect of waste processing,” he added.The corporation also decided to set up another plant for the horticulture waste, for which 30 vehicles will be rented to collect and dispose of the waste.Meeting theatrics During the meeting, amid high drama, Congress councillor and leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla tore a water bill and a bank cheque. Babla had earlier said that he had spent some amount during a study tour and in response, BJP councillor and former mayor Asha Jaswal handed him a cheque for ₹8,000. Stating that he asked reimbursement from MC and not from her, Babla ripped up the cheque. Protesting against hefty water bills, he also rote a water bill.Following repeated interruptions by Congress councillors, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma asked them to leave the House on their own.THE ROAD AHEADAugust-end: Preparation of detailed project report and request for proposalSeptember: Floating of tenders October: Allotment of work||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finally-chandigarh-mc-decides-on-technology-to-upgrade-waste-processing-plant-101626380050254.html

16-07-2021||Chandigarh||No afternoon water supply in Chandigarh from July 16||Even as it moves forward with its plans to supply 24X7 water supply in the city, the municipal corporation on Thursday decided to shut down the afternoon water supply from July 16. However, it will provide additional half-an-hour supply in morning and evening. The morning supply will last from 3.30am to 9am and the evening supply from 5.30pm to 9pm.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “With the onset of monsoon, summer has ended and demand for afternoon supply is not very high. We are doing this on a trial basis. If residents don’t experience any problems, we will continue it.” With the decision, MC also expects to save in crores. “We are spending around ₹14 crore annually on the afternoon supply. It is much less expensive to increase the duration of the morning and evening supply,” said Yadav. With no hike in water tariff between 2011 and 2020, MC earned only ₹87 crore against an expenditure of ₹215 crore last year.With the September 2020 water tariff hike, it expected to add ₹60 crore in receipts from the supply. However, with the UT administration putting a stay on the hiked water tariff, the gap between its cost of supplying water and its recovery is likely to widen up to ₹90 crore. Notably, on Wednesday, the UT administration had turned down MC’s request for allocation of ₹90 crore as special grant, mainly in lieu of losses due to reduction in water tariff and to carry out developmental works. In response to MC’s demand, made around a month back, the UT stated that it had no funds to provide the grant sought and that more funds can only be sought from the government under revised estimates for 2021-2022. “Now, with the afternoon water supply being shut, MC should ensure that there is no hike in water tariff after March next year. MC will save a lot by not pumping water in the afternoon. It should also ensure adequate water pressure in all localities of the city,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-afternoon-water-supply-in-chandigarh-from-july-16-101626379690272.html

By afternoon, members the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee from Khanauri, Patran, Bhawanigarh, Nakodar, Kartarpur, Qadian and Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Tarn Taran also joined them.They said instead of offering them the market rate, the government is giving them peanuts for acquiring the land.An SKM delegation visited the deputy commissioner’s office and submitted a memorandum demanding stalling of the acquisition process. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, an SKM member, said, “We are not against development but the government should offer farmers the market rates. It is an open secret that there is always a variation between the actual land price and the registry rates. The government is offering ₹15-25 lakh per acre. It is peanuts,” said Lakhowal. They will not allow the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to acquire an inch of land till their demands are met, he added. Gurcharan Singh Hawas, a member of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, said it was a symbolic protest. “We will block all the highways in Ludhiana and will not lift the dharna till our demands are met,” said Hawas.District revenue officer Joginder Singh said, “We received a representation from the farmer unions and have forwarded it to the government for consideration.

Vibrio cholerae bacteria had been found in 16 out of 18 stool samples tested. Health teams had also collected 55 water samples from the villages and reports will be out in a couple of days, she added.While the health department denied any other death, two admitted youths, Akshay, 17, and Roshan Kumar, 21, claimed their friend, Saurabh, 20, also died due to the disease.Congress leader Om Parkash claimed the water contamination started after a new pipeline was laid near the park in Abheypur. “Around 10 days ago, we complained to the HUDA officials concerned. They even visited the area, but left after saying that everything is fine.”For a village with nearly 50,000 people living in over 500 houses, only 12 water tankers were provided till Thursday, he said.A HUDA official, not wishing to be named, said, “On July 13, we got a call from the area councillor regarding filthy water. We visited the area, but did not find any fault. We got another call regarding black water being supplied to a house. We inspected the site on Thursday and found the sewage mixing with the water supply pipe. Similar problem was found at another house, near a manhole.”When contacted, Amit Rathi, executive engineer, HUDA, said, “Contamination was found at two houses and the supply there had been disconnected.”‘Cannot live here anymore’Father of nine-year-old Arpit, Anil Kumar, said he had decided to leave the village that took the life of his elder son: “I have bought tickets to drop my four-year-old son and wife in Uttar Pradesh. Then I will search for some other place to live. I cannot live here anymore.”He alleged that his son was discharged even though he hadn’t recovered fully. “Who listens to a poor man? I begged them to look after my child, but they sent him home after giving some medicines. My child died, not because of filthy water, but due to medical negligence,” he lamented.At the civil hospital, wards were full with people mostly from Abheypur and some from Budhanpur. “Water is so filthy and smells so bad that you cannot stand near it. We are getting sewage water in our homes,” alleged Rajesh, one of the patients.Sarawati, mother of a 16-year-old patient, claimed they had been getting contaminated water for over two months, but it had worsened over the last 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cholera-outbreak-confirmed-in-two-panchkula-villages-cases-mount-to-179-101626379270033.html

Vigilance senior superintendent of police (SSP) Parampal Singh said one Barinderpal Singh of Tarn Taran town had lodged a complaint that Pritpal and Malkiat were demanding ₹3.5 lakh for getting his relative recruited as a helper in the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). A trap was laid and Pritpal and Malkiat were apprehended while accepting ₹50,000 as first instalment of the bribe by a team led by Tarn Taran DSP Harjinder Singh. He added, “Malkiat confessed that accused Sukhwant, who operated from Ludhiana, was to be given ₹3 lakh from the total bribe amount for the recruitment. Malkiat has also told us that he had already got recruited four persons in the BSF through Dominic in 2019.

He assured them that their issues related to the unauthorized use of electricity (UUE) cases, will be resolved within seven days.Grewal said the assessment will be made for the period during which such unauthorized use has taken place. The period of UUE will be determined from the data downloaded from electronic metres. The penalty will be charged from the industrialists for the actual duration for which they were using more power and not for the entire year, he added.This move has brought relief to the traders as heavy penalties had been imposed on several businessmen in the last year for using more load in their factories than the sanctioned load. The traders had also protested outside the PSPCL office at Ferozepur Road from June 15 to 18, demanding the authorities to waive off the penalties and withdraw the UUE cases. Continuing with their series of protests, the city traders also burnt effigies of the PSPCL chief outside the subdivision offices.Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association president Jaswinder Singh Thukral said, “For the last two months, the traders have been upset due to penalties imposed on them. Many of them were already reeling under losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This move by the PSPCL has provided relief for the industrialists and we have decided not to hold any protest now.” During the interaction, DS Chawla, president of United Cycles Part Association, has suggested that for the new industrial connections, the condition of LT line length should be increased from 250m to 350m due to space constraints.FICO president Gurmit Singh Kular suggested that the maximum load of the SP category should be increased to 50KW and the maximum load of the MS category should be increased to 200KW.Grewal assured that these suggestions will be considered and would be conveyed to the appropriate decision-making bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pspcl-assures-resolution-of-unauthorised-use-of-electricity-cases-101626378550201.html

16-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ban no deterrent as use of plastic carry bags goes on unabated in Ludhiana||While the Ludhiana civic body has failed to enforce a complete ban on plastic carry bags in the last five years, the general House of municipal corporation (MC) approved another resolution to ban single-use plastic during the meeting that was on Wednesday held at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan. The move has come at a time when the civic body is struggling to impose a blanket ban on plastic carry bags, which was introduced by the state government in April 2016, and the use and trade of plastic carry bags is going on unabated. Despite tall claims that continuous drives are being conducted to ensure compliance with the order regarding trade and use of carry bags, no visible change can be seen at the ground level as carry bags are being used by shopkeepers, street vendors and residents. One of the MC officials, who wished to remain anonymous, said even as the matter has been highlighted during the MC House meetings in the past too, the civic body has been facing problems in enforcing the ban on plastic carry bags due to “political interference”. Plastic carry bags are sold by traders in different areas of the city, including Kesar Ganj Mandi, Field Ganj, Giaspura, and Jawahar Nagar camp area among others, and the officials are also aware of the same, he added. “The drives are organised only when pressure is mounted by the local bodies department and this time too, the resolution has been approved to ban single-use plastic just to complete a formality under the Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge. The focus will be on banning the use of plastic carry bags only, while the authorities are finalising a list of other items to be banned,” the official claimed. Meanwhile, the authorities said that a complete ban on the use of plastic carry bags will be imposed this time and use of other items such as disposable spoons and straws will also be prohibited in a phased manner. The matter was also raised during the general House meeting with councillors and mayor Balkar Sandhu highlighting the need to ban the carry bags as apart from polluting the environment, such carry bags also tend to choke the sewer lines if disposed irresponsibly. The mayor said, “A separate team of officials will soon be formed only to enforce the ban on plastic carry bags and the councillors have assured their cooperation during the general House meeting. We need to deal with solid waste and this step will help us in tackling the garbage situation in the city on a daily basis. Hefty challans will also be levied on the violators as per the norms.”6,226 penalised since July 2019: MC Ashwani Sahota, nodal officer for MC’s health branch, said the civic body has issued 6,226 challans against the trade and use of plastic carry bags since July 2019. “While 6,157 kg of carry bags have been confiscated, fine of 10.9 lakh has been slapped on the violators,” he added. Sahota said that regular drives are being conducted to impose the ban and over 100 challans have been issued in the month of July this year. Ban not a solution, management is: Industry Expressing disapproval at the decision taken by the MC to ban single-use plastic, the representatives of plastic industry stated that the move will “destroy their business” which is already reeling under losses amid the Covid pandemic. They urged the civic body to work on solid waste management rather than clamping a complete ban on plastic bags without providing an alternative in the market. The general secretary of Kesar Ganj Plastic Merchant Association, Puneet Makhija, said that most of the traders in the city are now dealing in packaging material and carry bags are being supplied from other states. “It is not possible to ban plastic bags as there is no other alternative. The government should work on managing the solid waste and the industry will help the authorities in the same. Efforts should be made to recycle the waste. At least the state government should allow plastic carry bags having width above 50 micron on the lines of the central government. We are ready to install dustbins in the city, but the government is adamant to ban the plastic,” said Makhija. Similarly, president of Plastic Manufacturers and Traders Association, Punjab, Gurdeep Singh Batra said that there are 1,600 manufacturers and traders dealing with plastic carry bags and lakhs of workers are engaged in the sector. “Despite repeated requests, the government is determined to ban the carry bags without providing an alternative. How will a shopkeeper or street vendor sell the items without carry bags? The government does not have any answer to this question. We will again approach the civic body and the government to reconsider the decision, otherwise the sector will be destroyed and residents will also face inconvenience,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ban-no-deterrent-as-use-of-plastic-carry-bags-goes-on-unabated-in-ludhiana-101626378369844.html

16-07-2021||Chandigarh||Double land compensation: HC judge recuses from PIL||A Punjab and Haryana high court judge on Wednesday recused himself from hearing public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into double compensation a Punjab cabinet minister and his family got for the acquisition of land in Ferozepur. The plea filed by three residents of Rupnagar, including lawyer Dinesh Chadha, levels allegations of “illegal and fraudulent acts” by Punjab sports minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi and his family members in connivance with the officials for getting double compensation. It further alleges that due to the influence of the minister, the Congress government is diluting the whole matter by giving it a civil tone in order to shield corrupt elements who have “abused” power. The plea was taken up by the bench of chief justices RS Jha and Arun Palli but the latter recused from hearing it while fixing the next date of hearing for July 23. The case involved a matter of grave public concern whereby a present cabinet minister in Punjab government managed and manipulated the government machinery in taking compensation again and again for the same land. It was done in the garb of dual acquisition proceedings by concealing the fact of earlier acquisition proceedings,” the PIL alleges. The land at Mohanki Attar village had been acquired for the Ferozepur-Fazilka-Guru Har Sahai road. The family received ₹1.8 crore compensation in 2014 for the land after re-acquisition in 2012, which, as per record, had also been acquired in 1962 for ₹7,384. The land comprised 55 kanal and 6 marla belonging to Sodhi and 38 kanal of his nephew Jasdeep Sodhi. The plea alleges that the entire fraud has been unearthed as per the state government’s own high power committee report but the government officials are sitting as “puppets and helpless creatures in the hand of mighty and powerful, least they themselves will be facing the wrath in case they dare to take any criminal action against the minister concerned and his family members”, hence a CBI probe is warranted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/double-land-compensation-hc-judge-recuses-from-pil-101626378189811.html

The victim, Subhash Chand, 70, was a resident of Rulehar village. The body of his only son, Shiv Prasad, 30, had been dug out of the debris on July 13. Kangra superintendent of police Vimukt Ranjan said rescue teams sent by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Himachal Pradesh Police, Public Works Department (PWD) and Revenue department were involved in the search operation. While five people were successfully rescued, nine others were found dead over the last four days. Rescue operations should have been carried out on war footing: BaliHitting out at the state government, senior Congress leader and former minister GS Bali alleged that the BJP regime had failed to carry out rescue operations in areas ravaged by landslide and heavy rainfall in Kangra. “Rajol and Boh village were completely devastated in the landslide caused by the heavy downpour. Nine people have lost their lives. The NDRF team has reached the area, but the government has provided them with one machine to excavate the debris. Rescue operations should have been carried out on war footing,” said Bali addressing a press conference. He urged the high court to take sou motto cognisance of encroachment on river banks and rivulets in the state, which was also responsible for the extent of devastation caused by the natural calamity. Bali also said that the government’s decision to purchase 250 new buses had burdened the Himachal Pradesh Road Transport Corporation, which was already on the brink of bankruptcy. He promised that should the Congress come to power in the state, the party will create 2.5 lakh jobs in Himachal. “Back door channels are being used to recruit people. No guidelines on reservation, qualification or economic distribution are being followed,” he said. He also asked the government of the criteria, on which vacancies were being filled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-flashflood-one-more-body-found-in-kangra-s-boh-valley-101626377949916.html
16-07-2021||Lucknow||Ram temple to open for devotees from end of 2023: Trust general secretary||The Ram temple in Ayodhya will open to devotees for worshipping the child deity, or Ram lalla, by the end of 2023 and the entire 70-acre campus will be completed by the end of 2025, said office-bearers of the trust overseeing the high-profile project on Thursday.The announcement came after a meeting of the 15-member Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust with engineers and architects. The meeting was chaired by trust chief Nripendra Misra, who wrapped up a two-day visit to Ayodhya.“By the end of 2023, the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram temple will be opened for devotees to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla,” said Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust.“Construction work on the 70-acre temple complex will be completed by the end of 2025. Then the entire temple campus will be opened for devotees,” added Rai.The foundation of the temple was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5 last year in a glitzy ceremony but work stalled in January after water was found under the proposed temple site. Currently, engineers are working on the foundation of the temple and it is likely to be completed by September 15. The second phase of the work is likely to start in November.The construction committee has decided to keep the Ram Janmabhoomi campus eco-friendly. “The temple complex will have provision of rainwater harvesting so that water collected on the campus does not choke drains outside the temple. All existing trees in the temple complex will be preserved so that they provide natural cooling to devotees,” said Rai.Security of the complex was discussed at the meeting on Thursday and it was decided that instead of cement, industrial fly ash will be used in the construction of the temple. It will be procured from Unchahar Thermal Power Plant in Rae Bareli.Sandstone from Mirzapur and Jodhpur, marble from Makrana in Rajasthan and pink stone from Bansi Paharpur in Rajasthan will be used in the construction. “On completion of one year of Bhumi Pujan of Ram temple on August 5 this year, we are planning a media visit at the construction site,” said Rai.According to the temple’s master plan, the campus will also have a museum, record room, research centre, auditorium, cow shed, a centre for tourists, administrative building, yagya shala and other facilities.Construction of the temple, a decades-long demand of Hindu groups, was cleared by the Supreme Court in 2019 in its landmark verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. Before that, devotees were allowed to offer prayers to the child deity under a makeshift shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ram-temple-sanctum-sanctorum-to-be-open-for-devotees-by-end-of-2023-101626377829230.html

From then till the role of PM, he (Yoshihide) has been personally involved in this project continuously. Every countryman is grateful to him for his affinity towards India,” said PM Modi and added that he was thankful to Japan government, PM Yoshihide, and the people of Japan for this gift of the convention centre. “There is one more person in today’s event, whom I cannot forget to name. Another friend of mine from Japan, Shinzo Abe. I remember, when Shinzo Abeji came to Kashi as Prime Minister, I had a discussion with him on the idea of Rudraksh,” Modi said.He said that thereafter, this idea was conceived, and Abe instructed his officials to work on the idea. The planning was done and today this grand building was adding to the glory of Kashi, he said. “This building has the spark of modernity and cultural radiance, it also has connect of India-Japan relationship and also scope for the future. During his Japan visit, he talked of this affinity in people-to-people connect in India-Japan relations,” Modi added.

Now that Kashi is being adorned with so many development projects in the last seven years, how could this adornment be completed without Rudraksh?

16-07-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi asks doctors in Varanasi to motivate people, increase vaccination||Praising the preparations made in Varanasi for dealing with the possible third wave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday told the doctors here to increase vaccination as it was an effective means of fighting Covid-19.Asking the doctors to dispel myths, he said they should create awareness, motivate people and take steps for doing away with vaccine hesitancy.He also asked the doctors to document their experiences of dealing with the first and second waves for research in the near future.After inaugurating several projects in the city, PM Modi inspected the new 100-bed mother and child health wing at Sir Sundar Lal Hospital, Institute of Medical Sciences-Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU) and watched a presentation on the preparations for dealing with the possible third wave of Covid-19. Varanasi district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma gave the presentation. Later, Modi held a meeting with 18 doctors at the hospital and interacted with four of them, including IMS-BHU director Prof BR Mittal, chief medical officer (Varanasi) Dr VB Singh, Indian Medical Association vice-president Ashok Rai, and IMS-BHU Trauma Centre in-charge Prof Saurabh Singh. PM Modi thanked the medical fraternity for Covid-19 management during the second wave. He asked about the preparations for dealing with the third wave, including the availability of modern equipment, labs, oxygen, beds, medicines and research equipment. Experts informed the PM that a 100-bed Covid-19 ward for children has already been created by SSL Hospital, BHU and it has all the necessary equipment. Later, the prime minister asked the doctors about vaccine hesitancy in the region. According to a medical expert, who was part of 18-member team, a doctor told PM Modi that after the second wave, vaccine hesitancy decreased to some extent and a large number of people were turning up for vaccination at present.IMA vice-president Dr Ashok Rai, a child specialist, appealed to PM to make available Covid-19 vaccine for children soon after it is approved.Chief medical officer Dr VB Singh said that 23% population (over 10 lakh people) of the population had been vaccinated in Varanasi district from January 16 to July 14.About 8.21 lakh people received the first dose and 1.96 lakh people got the second one, he said.

16-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ten pregnant women take Covid-19 vaccines on day one||Only 10 pregnant women turned up to take the Covid-19 jabs on Thursday, the first day of vaccination rollout for them in Mumbai. While eight were administered the dose in public centres, two received the shots in private centres. Medical experts and civic officials said the lukewarm response was due to low awareness among pregnant women, and that gynaecologists should take the lead in disseminating information about risks and benefits. In Mumbai, gynaecology departments of both public and private hospitals have already started spreading awareness among pregnant women registered under them. “We have trained healthcare workers in spreading awareness,” said a civic official. Eight pregnant women had already taken the jab in private centres before the drive was rolled out in the city on Thursday, taking the total number of vaccinated pregnant women to 18. On July 2, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare approved Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women, underlining that the benefits of vaccination outweigh their potential risks. The centre’s guidelines say that pregnant women can take the jab at any point during the pregnancy. A guidance document released by the centre said that pregnant women who develop Covid-19 are more likely to require intensive care than their non-pregnant counterparts, and the infection during pregnancy may result in rapid deterioration of their health and might affect the foetus. These threats prompted medical experts to demand vaccination for pregnant women. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) was instrumental in pushing the centre to rollout vaccines for pregnant women as well as lactating mothers. Vaccination for lactating women started in May. Since then, 3,646 lactating mothers have been vaccinated in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ten-pregnant-women-take-covid-19-vaccines-on-day-one-101626376569055.html

The central government needs to encourage those states who are carrying out vaccinations on a large scale,” he added.Although Maharashtra leads the nation with its record of administering 38,262,360 doses, the erratic supply has ensured that many of its centres are forced to remain shut due to shortage of vaccines.Tope said that currently 300,000-350,000 doses are being administered daily, but the state wants to vaccinate at least 1,000,000 daily. “Our minimum capacity is 10 lakh (1 million) and we can go up to 15 lakh (1.5 million) daily,” he added. He said that Maharashtra legislature has already passed a resolution demanding 30 million doses monthly.Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clini,c said vaccination is the need of the hour. “Covid-19 virus is here to stay and vaccination is necessary to reduce the severity of the virus. Mass vaccinations will also help in unlocking the restrictions and play a major role to revive the economy,” said Dr Mandot.Mumbai on Thursday recorded 528 new cases with 13 deaths, with its death toll reaching 15667.The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,189,257.There were 214,935 tests done on Thursday, while the number of recoveries clocked 7,391.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 107,205 while the total number of deaths has now reached 126,560.Pune tops with 17,401 patients, followed by Thane with 15,653 active patients and Sangli with 11,346.

Punjab Roadways Bathinda depot general manager Raman Sharma said the transport department received funds on Saturday and the renovation work has started.New flooring on 1-lakh square feet, sewerage system and construction of public conveniences blocks are key works to be undertaken. The renovation is expected to be completed by October, said Sharma.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who represents the Bathinda Urban segment, wants better infrastructure at the existing bus stand as the new ISBT project has not seen any development since the Congress government came to power, said officials not wanting to be named.Senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal laid the foundation stone of the modern ISBT project ahead of the assembly elections in 2016. Officials attribute the delay in the ambitious ISBT project to the non-approval by the army authorities. “The ISBT project comes under the purview of the Bathinda military station and after it objected to the seven-storey complex, the plan was changed to a four-storey building. It has been more than a year and the Bathinda district administration is still waiting for the approval from the army authorities,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-ac-isbt-nowhere-in-sight-old-bus-stand-to-get-rs-1-cr-facelift-101626374830566.html
16-07-2021||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege case: HC reserves order on petition against handwriting samples||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday reserved its order on a plea from an accused in a 2015 sacrilege case, against the special investigation team (SIT) taking the handwriting samples.Last week, the high court had restrained the Punjab Police’s SIT probing the sacrilege cases from submitting chargesheet (challan) against the accused, Sukhjinder Singh, in a desecration incident wherein derogatory posters were pasted near the gurdwaras of Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in Faridkot district on the intervening night of September 24 and 25 in 2015. The HC bench of Justice HNS Gill reserved the order after it was apprised by the Punjab Police that the accused himself had agreed for handwriting samples before a court.Earlier, the high court had acted on the plea of Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, a Dera Sacha Sauda follower, who had demanded that the SIT be stopped from re-examining his handwriting samples for matching them with those on the posters. Sukhjinder had argued that the SIT is competent only to further investigate the matter and not reinvestigate it.Sukhjinder is among four accused in the case, besides Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh and Baljeet Singh. On June 1 this year, the SIT collected samples of Sukhjinder to match them with the writing on the derogatory posters claiming that one of the posters was written by him. The SIT led by then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra in 2018 had claimed that the handwriting of the accused dera followers had matched with the ones on the posters. But the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019 said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the CFSL in Delhi did not match with the ones on the posters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-case-hc-reserves-order-on-petition-against-handwriting-samples-101626374649470.html
16-07-2021||Chandigarh||Irrigation scam: HC directs Punjab to look into allegations of ‘shoddy’ probe||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Punjab government to look into the allegations of a “shoddy” probe into the 2017 multi-crore irrigation scam, reported during the previous SAD government regime between 2012 and 2017. The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli disposed of public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Harmit Singh and two others from Bathinda, demanding a CBI probe. “In the circumstances and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the petition is disposed of with a direction that the authorities shall look into the grievances/concerns that are being raised by the petitioners and take the necessary measures/decision on the petitioners’ representation..,” the bench said, adding that petitioners can bring additional facts and material in the notice of the authorities and file a representation before the appropriate authority on allegations of money laundering. The FIR was registered on August 17, 2017, under Prevention of Corruption Act against a contractor and senior officers of the Punjab government for alleged misuse of public funds and causing financial loss to the state exchequer. According to the vigilance bureau, during the previous Akali government regime, higher officials connived with a contractor and indulged in allocation of works worth ₹1,000 crore that too on the rates more than 50% of the departmental rates. The court was told that though the authorities have taken cognisance of the matter and have conducted investigation, necessary sanction for prosecution has not been granted and in such circumstances, either the authorities should proceed in the matter or the same be handed over to the CBI for further investigation.So far 14 challans have been presented before the trial court. Two ex-ministers, three IAS officers and two personal assistants of both the ex-ministers are involved in the scam, it was claimed, adding that same was disclosed by the contractor, Gurinder Singh, to the police. In October 2018, the Enforcement Directorate too took note of the scam. “The statement (of contractor) includes very cogent evidence, which was required to be investigated, but for the reasons best known to the investigating agency, said aspect has not been probed,” the court was told. Senior advocate Baltej Singh Sidhu had told court that in December 2019 that the chief director, vigilance bureau, wrote to the secretary, department of vigilance, Punjab, seeking permission for registration of inquiry against the officers and politicians.The vigilance department in June 2020 wrote to the department of personnel and principal secretary, parliamentary affairs to grant necessary approval but to date, there is neither sanction nor is there any headway, he said before the court, adding that despite nod from the chief minister for probe, it has not been completed. Hence, either the state be directed to complete the probe under the high court’s supervision in a time-bound manner or it be referred to the CBI. The plea also wanted money laundering probe in a time-bound manner. As the Punjab government told court that matter shall be examined by the authorities and necessary action, including grant of sanction, will be taken by the respondent authorities expeditiously, the court disposed of the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/irrigation-scam-hc-directs-punjab-to-look-into-allegations-of-shoddy-probe-101626374529690.html

The state told the court that the extension granted by the sessions judge was justified as even though the activist and lawyer was booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act stipulated the need for a special judge at the time of the trial and not pre-trial, and the sessions judge had passed the extension order in 2018 before NIA took over the case last year. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state argued that the contentions of Bharadwaj’s lawyer was not maintainable as there had not been any lapses on the part of Pune Police in approaching the additional sessions judge who granted extension to the custody of Bharadwaj and also authorised the charge sheet. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, was hearing the application for default bail of Bharadwaj, who was arrested after her name cropped up in the electronic devices of another accused Rona Wilson. After her arrest in November 2018, Pune Police had filed for extending the period of her custody to enable them to file the charge sheet. Additional sessions judge KD Vadane had not only granted the extension but had also authorised the charge sheet in 2018 and 2019. Bharadwaj’s counsel, Dr Yug Choudhry, while arguing for her default bail, had submitted that as per the provisions of law, only special judges could preside over and hear cases under NIA and UAPA Acts. Hence, the orders passed by sessions judge Vadane were not valid, and Bharadwaj’s detention and that of eight other accused was illegal. Dr Choudhry had based his assertions on the right to information (RTI) queries from HC registry which had stated that judge Vadane was not a special judge when he had passed orders in the case of Bharadwaj and other Elgar Parishad accused. While refuting the claims, Kumbhakoni submitted that the orders by sessions judge Vadane were justified and there was no illegality as averred. He referred to sections 13 and 14 of NIA Act which clarified that trials had to be conducted by special courts. He further submitted that the special court would come into the picture only during the trial and when the case was being investigated by NIA and not when the state was the investigating agency. When HC questioned why a special court was constituted, Kumbhakoni submitted that they were set up for trials or when NIA returned the investigation to the state after previously taking over it. He added that the definition of courts under UAPA and NIA Acts were very clear as also which court could hear which case. Hence, the orders by sessions judge Vadane did not suffer from any illegality as it was provided for by the legislation. The state will continue its arguments and is expected to reply to another query of the court as to why Pune Police had not approached the magistrate court, which was also permitted under the said Acts. The next hearing has been posted for July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-illegality-in-elgar-parishad-case-accused-sudha-bharadwaj-s-detention-maharashtra-govt-to-hc-101626374408963.html

According to Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) insiders, both the leaders are said to have discussed critical issues such as forming a strategy for the upcoming Parliament session to resolve the reservation crisis of the Maratha and Other Backward Classes (OBC) communities. The monsoon session of the Parliament is set to start from July 19.“We want the issues to be raised properly in the Parliament and compel the Centre to take appropriate steps to resolve them. Both the leaders may have discussed the issue in today’s meeting,” said a senior minister, who did not wish to be named.In separate verdicts, the Supreme Court had struck down reservations in jobs and education for the Marathas and the political quota to OBCs in local bodies, which has created a political crisis for MVA. On July 5, the state had passed two resolutions seeking Centre’s intervention in the reservation crisis. MVA has asked for the empirical data of OBCs for restoration of political reservation and also demanded an amendment to remove 50% quota cap put by Indra Sawhney ruling.Pawar and Thackeray’s meeting assume significance, considering a series of damaging statements made by Nana Patole – the state chief of their ally Congress – in the past two weeks. Recently, Patole had declared that the Congress will contest the upcoming elections in the state on its own. Later, he alleged that he was put under surveillance by CM and deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and that his movements and chats were being closely watched. On Thursday, Patole also said he would organise a rally in Baramati to protest against the Central government in support of the OBC community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-parliament-session-maharashtra-cm-pawar-meet-to-discusses-critical-issues-101626374289296.html

Two people, including a woman, have been arrested and reward of ₹1 lakh announced on the arrest of absconding gang leader Badan Singh, who mostly operates in Rajasthan. Additional director general (ADG), Agra zone, Rajeev Krishna briefed the media on Thursday afternoon about the successful police operation undertaken jointly with Rajasthan police at Dholpur on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. Badan Singh had asked for a ransom of ₹5 crore for the doctor’s release but aggressive combing by Agra police, led by SP city Rohan Pramod Botre in the ravines of Chambal in Dholpur district of Rajasthan foiled his plan and the doctor was rescued. It may be recalled that Dr Umakant Gupta, a surgeon who owns a nursing home in trans-Yamuna area of Agra, had left for a round of his nursing home at 8 pm but did not return till late, according to his wife, also a doctor. The worried family initially lodged a case of missing at Itimad-ud-daula police station but later an FIR of kidnapping was lodged by the doctor’s son. “A woman came for treatment of her brother a month ago. Her brother was treated but she continued to interact on one pretext or another and asked for a job. She again called me to meet at Bhagwan Talkies on Tuesday night and got into my car. She told me that I was in trouble as the car was followed by miscreants and asked me to drive on,” revealed Dr Umakant Gupta (60) after his rescue. The doctor was asked to drive till Rohta on the outskirts of Agra and there, the woman got down and four unknown men got into the car. The doctor was told to go to the back seat. The kidnappers drove the car to Dholpur and from there took the doctor on a motor cycle to a remote place where they told him that they had kidnapped him for a ransom of ₹5 crore, although they had made no call to his family. The doctor was then taken to the ravines of Chambal near Dholpur and was kept in a farm area with four to five armed kidnappers on guard. “The kidnappers were discussing about hot chase by police and decided to leave me lying in the field,” said the doctor, adding that he was threatened that he would be transferred to another gang. The police team on search operation reached the spot and rescued the doctor. Two of the accused, including the woman making calls to the doctor and another person identified as Pawan Singh, who drove the car from Rohta, were arrested as police worked out the kidnapping case within 30 hours, revealed ADG Agra zone Rajeev Krishna. The doctor’s family, including wife Dr Vidya Gupta and sons Abhishek and Abhilash Gupta were much relieved on his recovery. Tracing the last location of the doctor’s mobile to Saiyyan, a town on way to Dholpur, assisted the police in assessing that he was taken towards Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, the bordering states of UP. Constable Dalchand from Dholpur police was instrumental in the arrest of the two as he was the one who recovered the doctor’s car. The constable arrested the driver Pawan and took the car to Dholpur police station. Later, the woman involved was also arrested and revealed how the doctor was kidnapped through her. ADG Rajeev Krishna informed that a reward of ₹1 lakh had been announced on main accused Badan Singh, the gang leader and Rs. 25,000 on other members of the gang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kidnapped-agra-surgeon-rescued-within-30-hours-101626374108821.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||Ex-employee steals sensitive data, blackmails firm||Rubberwala Housing and Infrastructure Ltd, a city-based construction company, has lodged a police complaint against a former employee, alleging that he has stolen important data from the company and is demanding ₹48.52 lakh by threatening to hand over the “sensitive company information” to income tax, Enforcement Directorate (ED), Goods and Services Tax (GST) and civic authorities.The accused, Ankit Goyal, in his messages to company officials claimed he was demanding the money as compensation for alleged mental harassment that he underwent while in the company’s employment. Goyal was booked by Agripada police on Tuesday after the company’s human resource and admin executive Amit Ranganekar, 39, lodged a complaint.As per the complaint, Goyal was hired by the company in July 2019 as an account executive, but he resigned and left the company in October 2020 without completing exit formalities.According to the first information report (FIR), the complainant received messages from Goyal in April this year saying that he had sensitive data of the firm with him and if the company fails to clear his full-and-final settlement and issue him a relieving letter, he would share the same with probing agencies. He allegedly also claimed he would use the data to prove money laundering and tax evasion to the tune of ₹20 crore.However, after the full and final settlement was settled and the relieving letter was issued, the accused kept on threatening the firm saying he wanted the company to pay him compensation in two bitcoins (worth ₹48.52 lakh) for alleged mental harassment.“Based on the complaint from the company, we have registered a case under sections 381 (theft by an employee), 385 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66B (dishonestly receiving stolen information or device) of the Information Technology Act and will soon detect the case,” said senior inspector Shriram Koregaonkar.“The accused levelled false and baseless allegations against us, hence we decided to take the path of justice. Police is investigating the case and we are hopeful that truth will triumph,” said a spokesperson for the firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/exemployee-steals-sensitive-data-blackmails-firm-101626373989525.html

16-07-2021||Mumbai||ED remand of Ekanth Khadse’s son-in-law extended till July 19||A special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court on Thursday extended Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) custody of Girish Chaudhari, son-in-law of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse, till July 19. Chaudhari has been arrested by the central agency in the money laundering case registered by it in connection with the Bhosari land deal.ED had, on Thursday, produced Chaudhari before the special court as his earlier custody remand ended, and sought six days’ extension of his custody. The agency on August 28, 2019 booked Khadse, his wife Mandakini, Chaudhari and the owner of the land in Bhosari, Abbas Rasulbhai Ukani, in a money laundering case. ED’s case information report is based on a first information report (FIR) registered by Maharashtra anti-corruption bureau (ACB) against the Khadse family in 2017. ACB had later closed the case, but ED continued its investigation into the alleged financial irregularities in the land deal.The case pertains to the purchase of a 1.31-hectare plot at Bhosari village in Haveli taluka of Pune district on April 28, 2016 by Chaudhari and Mandakini for ₹3.75 crore against the market value of ₹31 crore. ACB had alleged that Khadse and the other two had caused loss of ₹61.25 crore to the state exchequer by dealing with the land.In its remand application seeking extension in Chaudhari’s custody, ED stated that the piece of land was acquired by Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) in 1971, which then developed and allotted it for different industries.ED further added that in his statement given to the agency, Avinash Hadgal, regional officer of MIDC, stated that, “The notification under 32(1) of MIDC Act is already issued on November 11, 1971 in respect of the said land and the said land vests with MIDC. That the land is already in possession of MIDC and further allotted to 14 plot holders and one open space.”“Chaudhari and Mandakini Khadse have wrongly purchased the land from Ukani which rightly belonged to MIDC by way of acquisition; that Chaudhari and Mandakini are not entitled to hold the subject land and hence, the sale is void,” read ED’s application.It was further alleged that Chaudhari had purchased the land after securing finance of ₹2 crore from a company named Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited. ED recorded statement of Benchmark Buildcon’s former director Manjunath Omkar on Tuesday. In his statement, Omkar said he was offered ₹15,000 salary per month for becoming the director, and he has never seen any work being carried by Benchmark Buildcon and that it was just a paper company.“The source of funds for purchase the said land is not genuine and it has been routed through various companies. These companies which are used by Chaudhari to channel funds for the purchase of the said land are nothing but shell companies used for layering of funds,” ED said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-remand-of-ekanth-khadse-s-son-in-law-extended-till-july-19-101626373988829.html

16-07-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka arrives in Lucknow today; has tough task of Congress revival in UP||As Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra arrives here on her long-pending visit today, she may have little time to perform the gigantic task of giving her party a major push to make it a strong contender for power in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Though Priyanka is credited with bringing her party into focus as and when she undertakes tours to various regions, the state Congress has not been able to take any advantage of the impetus her visits give to the party.This will be after a gap of about one and a half years that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters here. So her visit has raised the hopes of partymen. “We are hopeful that her visit will help in gearing up the party organisation for the 2022 UP assembly elections,” said a senior party leader.“Priyanka is the only leader who toured different districts to meet anti-CAA protestors. She also took up the cause of rape victims in Unnao and Mainpuri. She went to meet the boatmen beaten up by the police in Prayagraj. She also went to meet families of victims of Sonbhadra’s Umbha massacre. Her actions brought the state Congress into focus,” said the leader.Also Read | Captain to lead poll campaign, buzz persists over Sidhu’s roleThe political observers feel that her brief visits will in no way strengthen or gear up the party organization. “Priyanka should give more time to Uttar Pradesh now. The Congress is weak in Uttar Pradesh and brief visits will not help. Infighting in her party is one of the reasons for the prevailing situation. She needs to focus on strengthening the party organisation. She has the qualities and she can do it,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of the department, political science, Lucknow University.“There is nothing unusual in Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to Lucknow. Leaders of all political parties tour the state before elections. Her visits to the state in the past to take up different issue brought her party into media focus. The Congress, however, was not able to take advantage of this due to poor party infrastructure,” said professor Badri Narayan, drector, GB Pant Social Science Institute, Prayagraj.Meanwhile, the UPCC is gearing up to accord a grand welcome to Priyanka as she arrives here. A number of welcome and flower showering points have been put up on the route from the Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport, Lucknow to Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters here. She will land at the airport at about 1PM and proceed straight to the GPO Park here. She will garland the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the GPO Park and will then reach the UPCC headquarters to meet the partymen and representatives of farmers there.On the second day of her visit,, Priyanka proposes to meet block level presidents of her party from Rae Bareli and Amethi. She will also meet students appearing in different competitive exams and holding protests for delay in recruitments. She will meet former MPs, former legislators and office-bearers of her party’s frontal organisations, different cells and departments.Will she also meet disgruntled leaders who have been sidelined or expelled from the party? “We have no information about any meeting with the party’s old timers. Priyanka is surrounded by a coterie of advisers and this is only causing damage instead of helping the Congress,” said former minister Satyadev Tripathi who along with other old timers was expelled from the Congress on the charges of indiscipline in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cong-revival-priyanka-faces-tough-task-with-little-time-in-hand-101626373628876.html
16-07-2021||Pune||Truant monsoon leaves Pune with deficient rainfall in July||PUNE Despite a revival of the Southwest Monsoon forecast for Maharashtra, Pune, and many parts of the state are now recording deficient rainfall received so far in JulyAs per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune district is reporting a deficiency of 64 per cent rainfall received in July this monsoon season. Along with the district, Madhya (central) Maharashtra has also reported a rainfall deficiency of 40 per cent in July.Some districts which are drought prone, however, have reported excess rainfall in July. As per IMD, Ahmednagar, Beed, Osmanabad, Latur, Solapur, Nanded, Parbhani Jalna and Aurangabad have reported a “large excess” of rainfall in July. According to IMD, rainfall in excess of 50 per cent falls in the category of “large excess”. Pune district, Satara, Thane, Palghar, Nashik and Nandurbar now have a “large deficit” of rainfall for July. Large deficient, as per the weather department is considered when rainfall has been lower than between 60 per cent to 90 per cent of the normal.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune said that Pune district has seen less rainfall due to various reasons.“First the district is on the leeward side. Secondly, the westerly winds are not strengthening and the offshore trough is absent. The strength of the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal has reduced. And there is, as of now, no strong system to increase rainfall activity,” said Kashyapi.He added that from July 16, rainfall activity is likely to increase in the district.“Including Pune district, many parts of the State are also likely to witness better rainfall till July end,” said Kashyapi.On Thursday, Pune city reported no rainfall.The districts of Kolhapur, Sangli, Dhule, Jalgaon, Buldhana, Gondia and Amravati have deficient rainfall - between 20 per cent to 59 per cent lower than normal in July.Hingoli, Ratnagiri and Sindhdurg have reported excess rainfall in July.

16-07-2021||Pune||State’s directive defied: PMC votes to prepare DP for merged villages||PUNE Even as the state government has empowered the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to prepare the Development Plan (DP) for 23 villages merged recently into the civic limits, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday, went against state’s decision and initiated a process to prepare the DP for the villages.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Thursday, called a special general body meeting and approved the proposal by vote, despite opposition from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Congress and the Shiv Sena.As the PMC has now passed the resolution, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP will need to take a call on it. Sources from the administration confirmed that the state government may have the final say, since the rules suggest the government can prepare the draft fo-r undeveloped areas, something the BJP members, including Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, have confronted, claiming most villages merged in the municipal limits are partially developed. In such a scenario, the Urban Development Department under MVA government can reject the PMC plan and will continue with the state’s notification, despite the PMC passing a resolution in the GB.BJP leader, and leader of the house, Ganesh Bidkar said, “The state government has encroached upon the municipal corporation’s power. We have decided to fight the legal battle. Let them do whatever they want. It is in the corporation’s power to create the development plan.”A development plan is a long-term planning document that gives a conceptual layout for proposed future growth and development. It covers buildings, social settings and surrounding environments. The plan includes analysis, recommendations, and proposals for a site’s population, economy, housing, transportation, community facilities, and land use. The plan could be renewed every 20 years Meanwhile, former Mayor and NCP president Prashant Jagtap has said that the Pune Municipal Corporation’s resolution is challenging the state government’s power and insulting the state’s decision. “The state government will reject the civic body’s resolution. There are chances that the state government can ask for clarification from the corporation for the same,” said Jagtap.He also claimed that when PMC was discussing the DP for old city limits of 2017, the state government intervened and approved it. “Then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis pulled the DP when the GB was going on. Though we (NCP) were ruling in the PMC at that time, we respected the state government’s decision and adjourned the general body meeting. This time even as the state government has appointed PMRDA as a special planning authority, BJP conducted the general body meeting and approved the resolution by calling for a vote.”Earlier on Wednesday, the BJP took objection to the Maharashtra government’’s decision to appoint the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) as a special planning authority for 23 villages recently merged in the city limits, after the state issued an order to this effect 23 areas (villages) merged in PMC Mhalunge, Sus, Kirkatwadi, Pisoli, Kondhwe-Dhawade, Kopre, Nanded, Khadakwasla, Mundhwa, Manjari, Narhe, Mantarwadi, Holkarwadi, Handewadi, Wadachiwadi, Shewalewadi, Mangdewadi, Vadgaonsheri, Nandoshi, Bhilarewadi, Jambhulwadi, Gujar-Nimbalkarwadi and Kolewadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/states-directive-defied-pmc-s-special-gb-votes-to-prepare-dp-for-merged-villages-101626373149509.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||BMC to develop app to map all parking spaces in Mumbai’s 3 wards on pilot basis||Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday gave a green light for the implementation of a decentralised parking plan in three administrative wards – D ward (Malabar Hill and Peddar Road), K-West ward (Andheri West and Vile Parle West) and S ward (Powai and Bhandup). Under this plan, the Mumbai Parking Authority (MPA) – a separate body constituted by BMC – will develop a dedicated mobile application on which vehicle owners can find parking lots.The application will also allow housing societies and commercial complexes to make available to the public the parking lots in their premises. MPA officials said it would take at least two months before the project takes off. Prachi Merchant, an MPA member, said, “We are focusing on creating a central database of identifying all parking spaces in a ward. An application programme interface (API) will be created at the ward level as a pilot. All the data on the parking spaces will be put on a mobile app and motorists would be able to check the slots available for them to park in case they visit that area. All agencies, housing societies and commercial complexes having parking lots can put in their slots here. We’ve taken up three wards for now and based on the learnings and findings from here, will take the project ahead.”BMC in a statement said, “Apart from implementation of the ward-level parking pilot project, it was agreed that the lowest amount of the current parking pricing policy be implemented in the ward plans to ensure it is inclusive and takes into consideration concepts like ‘livelihood discounts’ for yellow plate vehicles wherein vehicle such as autos/taxis/cabs will be charged subsidised rates for parking.” The statement added, “New concept for valet parking is to be introduced, [there’ll be] consideration for abandoned, deep sleep and towed vehicles, while cycles and essential transport vehicles will be exempted from charges.” Meanwhile, the civic corporation said a 10,000-square metre plot in M-East ward and two scrapyards in H-East ward are in the process of gaining possession for scrapping junked vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-develop-app-to-map-all-parking-spaces-in-mumbai-s-3-wards-as-pilot-101626373148835.html
16-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA starts process to avoid secret voting for speaker poll||In an effort to avoid a political slugfest over the appointment of the Speaker in the Maharashtra assembly and prevent the possibility of cross-voting, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government has initiated the process of changing the method of electing the person who will occupy the constitutional post.The Rules Committee of the state legislature held a meeting on the second day of the monsoon session held last week and proposed that the Speaker be voted through a voice vote or a headcount on the assembly floor instead of secret ballot, which is the method currently employed, HT has learnt.Four out of 11 members of the committee, which comprises both Opposition leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and from the ruling coalition parties (the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress) met on July 6 and proposed the change.“The quorum for the meeting is three. Four members were present for the meeting, including Congress’s Prithviraj Chavan, Shiv Sena’s Subhash Desai and NCP’s Ajit Pawar, where the proposal was moved for a change in the rule,” an official of the parliamentary affairs department said on condition of anonymity. The meeting was chaired by deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal – a move that was made possible after the state legislature approved his chairmanship the previous day.“Using the powers in Article 180 of the Constitution, the state legislature changed the rule in order to appoint the deputy speaker as the executive chairman of the Rules Committee. The estimate committee had proposed the amendment and the decision of appointing deputy speaker as executive chairman of the committee was taken on July 5,” an official from the state legislature said.No BJP member of the committee was present in the meeting. One of the committee members, Girish Mahajan, was among the 12 Opposition legislators who had been suspended for misbehaviour with the presiding officer inside the Assembly, the previous day.The proposal will be put before Assembly during its next session – in December -- and members would be given 10 days (the time span can be amended by the government) to submit suggestions. The decision on the final proposal would be taken in the house with a voice vote.The much-anticipated election was expected to take place during the two-day monsoon session. As per the power-sharing pact between the three allies, the post would be held by a Congress legislator. It has been vacant since Nana Patole resigned to take charge of the state Congress unit in February. Ruling party leaders said that Prithviraj Chavan, Sangram Thopte, Suresh Warpudkar and Amin Patel are among the probable candidates for the post.Political experts contend that the move from secret ballot to a voice vote will help prevent cross voting by any of the ruling party MLAs. In an open voting methodology like head count or voice vote, legislators face disqualification if they vote against the whip issued by the party. The election would have been a bellwether of the strength of the government as it would have indicated how many members of the legislative assembly (MLA) support of the ruling party – or, in this case, the MVA coalition.“The election to the post of Speaker is held by secret voting, making it difficult to avert the cross voting. Rule 6 of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly mandates secret ballot for the post of the Speaker. Though it won’t be a problem getting the Speaker elected with a majority, it will be important to maintain the number of votes polled during the confidence vote. A drop in number is a moral defeat and will give a reason to the Opposition to corner the government,” a senior Shiv Sena leader said on condition of anonymity.The MVA government had won a floor test in 2019 by polling 169 votes in 288-member House. Besides the strength of 154 MLAs from three parties the ruling alliance, 15 MLAs from smaller parties and independents also supported the government. The BJP, which had 105 MLAs, was supported by nine MLAs from smaller allies and independents. “The proposal will have to be formally read out in the Assembly. The condition of 10 days can be modified and brought down, like it’s done in case of discussions on budgetary demands. Once amended the election can be held by voice vote, by raising hands or head count on the floor of the house,” said another official of the parliamentary affairs department.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said the process adopted by the MVA government was invalid. “The deputy speaker does not have the powers to hold the meeting of Rules Committee which is headed by the Speaker. If any such decision has been taken, it’s an invalid decision. Besides, the main question is why the ruling parties are worried about holding the election by secret ballot? This shows that everything within the alliance is not well. There is trust deficit among the ruling parties and no faith on their own MLAs,” he said.Anant Kalse, former principal secretary, state legislature however, cited Article 180 as being clear on the validity of the deputy speaker as standing in for the Speaker. “Even Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and legislative councils have adopted this process and there was nothing wrong if we go for it. We are not worried about the majority as the number of MLAs from three ruling parties itself is well above the half way mark,” Congress’s legislative party leader and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-more-secret-ballot-for-post-of-maharashtra-speaker-101626372729449.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||Bail for 4 held for role in blast outside Israel embassy||A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to four students from Ladakh arrested in connection with a blast outside the Israel embassy in the city, saying there is no evidence to suggest that any of the accused posted objectionable material against India.The four students — Nazir Hussain (26), Zulfikar Ali Wazir (25), Aiaz Hussain (28) and Muzammil Hussain (25) — were arrested from Kargil last month in connection with the minor IED blast in the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi on January 29. There were no casualties. Some cars were damaged in the explosion that took place about 150 metres away from the embassy on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road.Chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma said nothing incriminating has been put forth by the investigating officer to suggest that the accused people have links with any terrorist organisation and that they are a threat to the society.The court said the accused’s antecedents are “blemish free”, as it asked them to surrender their passports and not leave the country without permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bail-for-four-students-arrested-in-connection-with-blast-outside-israel-embassy-101626371708619.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||‘I saw a girl being chased, but did not realise she was my daughter’||She held at least a dozen taekwondo medals and would have defended herself, had she been not attacked by her stalker with an axe from behind, the family of a 15-year-old girl who was murdered on Monday in south Delhi’s Moti Bagh area, said on Thursday.The girl was hacked to death a day before her 16th birthday by a 21-year-old man, identified by the police as Pradeep, who was stalking her for the past eight months.The girl’s mother was witness to the attack. However, since she was standing at a distance from the spot where the attacker dealt the blows on the girl’s forehead, she did not know at that moment that it was her daughter who was under attack.“Pradeep must be hanged,” said the girl’s 40-year-old mother at the south Delhi hutment where she lives with her husband and three other children.She said her daughter was practising the martial art particularly hard, and stayed vigilant ever since Pradeep started stalking her.“I was drying clothes outside my house when I saw a girl being chased on the other side of the park. She fell down and it looked like the man who was chasing her hit her a few times and ran away. Till that time, I was not aware that it was my daughter who was being killed right before my eyes. She may even have called for help, screamed, but I could not save her,” she said, breaking down.The girl’s father, who does odd jobs in nearby buildings, said that a few days before his daughter was killed, she told him that if Pradeep ever tried to harm her, he should ensure that he was punished.He said Pradeep stopped stalking his daughter around two months ago, when he confronted him. It led to a fight with Pradeep and his friends near the south Moti Bagh market, where the family ran a roadside fruit shop.“I thought the matter was settled. A few weeks ago, I saw him sitting with the society’s security guard, but I ignored him. I did not file a police complaint back then because I did not think things would come to this. Apparently, he was holding a grudge against us and settled the score by killing my daughter,” he said.The man said he used to drop his daughter to the shop every day before going ahead with his work. But on July 12, she walked alone. “She left early that day... I will regret this for the rest of my life,” the father said.The victim’s 12-year-old sister was planning a surprise birthday party for her. She said they asked for ₹1,500 from her father to buy a bag, a pair of sneakers and jeans.Senior Delhi Police personnel said that Pradeep was arrested from his sister’s house in Palwal in neighbouring Haryana, a day after he killed the girl.“He bought the axe from a market in RK Puram around a month before the attack,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest), Ingit Pratap Singh.The rented room where Pradeep lived with his parents has been locked since his arrest.Residents of Pradeep’s neighbourhood remember him as an “unemployed” man who was often whiling away time with boys from the locality.“He probably used to work somewhere till a year ago, but lost his job during the Covid lockdown. He was a wastrel, but we never thought that he would go to the extent of killing someone,” said a local shop-owner, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/minor-girl-hacked-to-death-by-stalker-in-south-delhi-i-saw-a-girl-being-chased-but-did-not-realise-she-was-my-daughter-101626371350021.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||Can’t risk it, schools to stay shut for now: CM||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that schools in the national capital will not reopen at the moment, since trends across the world point towards a resurgence of Covid-19, and added that his government will “not take any risks” till the vaccination process is complete for everyone.“Internationally, there is a trend of resurgence of Covid-19 through a third wave. So until the vaccination process is not completed for everyone, we cannot risk the lives of children,” said Kejriwal while speaking on in the sidelines of an event to launch the pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programme for children.Schools in the national capital have mostly been shut since March last year due to the pandemic, and classes and other teaching and learning activities have broadly shifted online in that time. Though the Delhi government allowed in-person lessons in January this year for students due to appear in the Class 10 and 12 board exams, as well for remedial and practical lessons for students in classes 9 to 12, this was cut short as the fourth wave of infections began to spread in the city.Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents’ Association, welcomed the chief minister’s announcement. “Most were wary of sending their children to school if offline classes resumed as cases are on the rise in Kerala and other states again,” she said.Principals of several private schools also said that parents have been worried about their children’s well-being. “Parents are okay with private schools functioning online for now because they are scared for their children. No school or teacher will want children to fall sick or to risk their health. While human contact and offline classes make a difference, we cannot go ahead till parents and students are confident about returning to classes,” she said.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has in the past urged the Centre to allow children to be vaccinated against Covid-19.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on June 9 said the Centre must procure as many Covid-19 vaccines as possible to keep children safe, especially in the backdrop of a potential third wave.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on May 27 asked the Centre to procure Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to inoculate children in the country.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “The government should not allow any gatherings at this point. They should not act in haste when it comes to taking a call on reopening of schools, colleges and educational institutions.”DU may start PG course registries from July 26Delhi University is likely to start the online registration for admissions to postgraduate and research courses from July 26, university officials said on Thursday. The decision was taken during a meeting of the admission committee officials.However, no decision was taken on the schedule for admissions to undergraduate courses, officials said.The university conducts an entrance test for admissions for all postgraduate (PG), M.Phil, and PhD courses.A senior official who attended the admission committee meeting said, “The online registration process for PG and research courses is likely to begin from July 26. The admission committee recommended starting registrations for the nine undergraduate entrance test-based courses as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-risks-schools-in-city-will-not-reopen-arvind-kejriwal-101626371288699.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||LG okays ‘walk plans’ for areas around 6 Metro stations in city||To make city roads pedestrian-friendly, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is preparing “walk plans” for areas around Metro stations. The Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC), chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, approved six walk plans on Thursday to be implemented by the civic agencies.The plans that were approved were INA market, ITO junction, Hauz Khas-IIT Delhi Metro station, both campuses of Delhi University, and Kamla Nagar and Lajpat Nagar markets.DDA officials said the six areas were taken up on account of their high pedestrian movement.“These plans aim at improving walking infrastructure customized to specific needs of the respective areas,” Baijal later tweeted.A senior DDA official, on condition of anonymity, said, “The walk plans include dedicated pavements for pedestrian, cycle lanes and street furniture, among other amenities. The idea is to provide pedestrians hassle-free access to Metro stations. The plan will be implemented in a 500m radius of the six Metro stations by the civic agencies. We consulted with traffic police while drawing up these plans.”The DDA plans to make 27 such walk plans, of which 15 have been finalised (including the six approved on Thursday).The plans are part of the walkability policy, which was approved in 2019, and focuses on integrating walkability into various policies and projects in the national capital, to make streets more pedestrian-friendly. htc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddas-walk-plans-for-six-metro-station-vicinities-approved-by-transport-body-101626371228613.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt says facing a ‘full-scale assault’ over new excise rules||The state government on Thursday told the Delhi high court that it is under a “full-scale assault” for its new excise policy, which was made public earlier this month, and aims to introduce sweeping changes in the city’s liquor business, clean up malpractices, and improve user experience.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, while hearing a plea against the new policy, were informed by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi that most of the apprehensions raised in several writ petitions were “fanciful”.“There is a full-scale assault on us [the Delhi government] by filing writ petitions… We are plugging the leaks, minimising corruption and also giving enough and fair competition. There have been eight more writ petitions since the court heard the first petition in this regard,” Singhvi told the court.He said the pleas have been filed by people who are “well-versed” with the liquor trade and are now acting “innocent”.The court did not pass any order on the plea by Ashiana Towers and Promoters Private Limited and Rajiv Motors Private Limited, who alleged that the policy is illegal, unfair, arbitrary and in violation of the Delhi Excise Act of 2009.Advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, appearing for the two companies, said the rules divide the city into 32 zones but allow only 16 players in the market, thus “creating a monopoly”.To this the bench said, “Control is for public welfare and not for you to run your business. It is for the public at large. It is not meant for you to run your business or put you in difficulty.”The court also issued notice to and sought a reply from the Delhi government on a petition by Anita Chaudhary, who holds a wholesale liquor licence in Uttar Pradesh.Advocate Sanchar Anand, appearing for Chaudhary, argued that the policy is beyond the state government’s rule-making powers under the Delhi Excise Act and violates Article 14 of the Constitution.Meanwhile, BJP leader Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma also moved the high court on Thursday challenging the home delivery of liquor in the national capital, claiming that the policy suffers from many infirmities as it fails to take into account ground realities, practical implications and implications such as a potential increase in cases of domestic violence.The bench first issued a notice, but later withdrew its order when they saw that Verma had added Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the memo of parties.The bench posted the matter for hearing on August 6.Verma’s counsel Balaji Srinivasan said they added AAP in the plea because the party, during the elections, promised they would reduce the price of liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/facing-full-scale-assault-on-excise-policy-delhi-govt-on-clutch-of-petitions-against-new-norms-101626371229248.html

A recipient of India’s second-highest civilian award, Padma Vibhushan, Bahuguna’s work revolved around people’s rights over forests in the Himalayas.“Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday unveiled a commemorative stone, portrait, and took part in a tree plantation drive at the Delhi Legislative Assembly in memory of the revered environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna who is world-renowned for spearheading the Chipko Movement. On the occasion, the CM appealed to the central government to honour Sunderlal Bahuguna with the Bharat Ratna award...” said a statement issued by Kejriwal’s office.“His fight and struggle along with his dedication to giving back to the society will not just be remembered but it will continue to motivate and inspire generations and generations of citizens of not just Uttarakhand... but the entire country,” it said.Uttarakhand is one of the states in which the Aam Aadmi Party will be contesting assembly polls in 2022.Kejriwal also presented a cheque of ₹1 lakh to Bahuguna’s family. The event at the Delhi legislative assembly was also attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and speaker Ram Niwas Goel, said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-sunderlal-bahuguna-founding-member-of-chipko-movement-101626371170465.html
16-07-2021||Delhi||State vs Centre as LG dismisses Delhi govt lawyers in R-Day cases||The latest tussle between the Centre and the Delhi government has intensified with Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal dismissing the public prosecutors appointed by the Delhi government to argue cases related to violence during a January 26 rally taken out by farmers protesting against three controversial new farm laws.The office of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, which confirmed this development on Thursday, said the Delhi Cabinet will meet on Friday to take up the issue.“The LG has dismissed the team of special public prosecutors appointed by the Delhi government with regard to the cases concerning the farmers agitation. The LG has directed that the prosecutors suggested by the Delhi Police be approved. So, we have called a Cabinet meeting regarding this matter. The Delhi government had set up a panel of lawyers to ensure unbiased hearing in the agitation of farmers, who have been protesting against three contentious farm laws. Delhi’s home minister Satyendar Jain dismissed the list of lawyers suggested by the Delhi Police,” the CM’s office said in a statement on Thursday.Delhi Police reports to the Union home ministry through the LG.A senior official in the LG’s office said the matter pertained to the violence, and disrespect to the national flag on January 26, 2021; and not farmers protest.“It has nothing to do with ‘farmers protest’ as is being deliberately made out. Individuals with predetermined agenda and vested interests deliberately carried out acts on January 26, 2021 in full media presence that were not only an affront to national morale but aimed at bringing shame to India internationally,” the official said.But the CM’s office said in its statement that the LG was “pressuring” the Delhi government into approving lawyers chosen by the Delhi Police. “Delhi’s home minister Satyendar Jain sent details of Delhi government’s panel to the LG. The LG has not approved it even though the work of Delhi government’s lawyers has earlier been appreciated by all, including the LG,” the statement said.Last week, Raghav Chadha, the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national spokesperson, alleged that the LG’s and the police’s request was part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “vengeful attempts to harass and defame innocent farmers”.“No complaint against the Delhi government’s lawyers has been received. Still, the LG wants to replace them with BJP’s lawyers to teach the farmers a lesson,” Chadha said.On February 26, Delhi Police sent a proposal to the state government’s home department seeking the appointment of 11 law officers to represent the state in all cases related to the farmers’ agitation. The Delhi government responded that it wanted its existing team of prosecutors to argue the cases.On July 1, Baijal and Jain held a meeting in which the matter could not be resolved. On July 2, Baijal wrote a letter to Kejriwal, requesting him to convene a meeting of the council of ministers to decide upon the disagreement in a week.Referring to the meeting, the official in the LG’s office said, “Apart from earlier disagreement on file, the LG in the said meeting on July 1, 2021, with the home minister, clearly and categorically expressed his disagreement at the minister turning down the valid request by the Delhi Police for appointment of special prosecutors. The same was reiterated and clearly conveyed in a subsequent letter from LG to the CM, requesting him convene a meeting of the council of ministers to consider and decide the said disagreement at the earliest. The Cabinet, if at all, is doing just that.”The Delhi government and the LG had a similar disagreement last year over the appointment of state lawyers to argue the north-east Delhi riots cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-vs-centre-as-lg-dismissesdelhi-govt-lawyers-in-r-day-cases-101626371168541.html
16-07-2021||Noida||7 held for robbing, killing cab driver in Jhansi||The Noida police on Thursday arrested seven persons for allegedly robbing and murdering a cab driver in Jhansi on May 26, 2021. The victim, identified as Harvesh Singh (35), was a native of Kasganj and worked as a driver with a private cab aggregator in Noida.Four of the seven suspects — identified as Rahul, Abid, Sonu and Shivam — had booked the cab on May 26, but when the cab driver arrived to pick them up, they cancelled the ride. “They instead convinced him to do an offline booking from Ghaziabad to Jhansi for ₹10/km. After they reached their destination in Jhansi, the four men robbed the driver of his cellphone, wallet and car, and killed him. Police found the victim’s body from Jhansi five days later,” said a senior police official, requesting anonymity.Deputy commissioner of police (zone 2), Harish Chander, said on Thursday, “The driver’s family had filed a missing person complaint on May 29. After the driver’s body was found, his brother filed a murder complaint against unidentified persons at a police station in Jhansi on July 11, alleging that the victim was killed on the pretext of booking a cab. The case was then transferred to us (the Noida police), and we launched a probe.”Police started tracing the suspects with the help of details of the cancelled cab ride, and arrested Rahul from Noida Sector 62, Abid Khan, Sonu and Shivam from Ghaziabad, and Sudama Dutt Sharma, Shamshuddin, Mohammad Umeed from Delhi, on Thursday. During interrogation, Rahul, Abid, Sonu and Shivam — all natives of Jhansi — confessed that they had booked the cab and robbed the driver of the belongings before killing him. They had a debt and needed a quick money fix. They do not have any criminal history, said the police.“Rahul sold the car to Sudama Dutt Sharma, Shamshuddin, Mohammad Umeed for ₹50,000, who later sold parts of the vehicle, and the car body as scrap. We could only recover the engine of the car from their possession,” said another police official, requesting anonymity.A case has been registered against the seven suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (destruction of evidence), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) and 413 (habitually dealing in stolen property) at a police station in Noida.The suspects were produced before a magistrate on Thursday and sent to a 14-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/7-held-for-robbing-killing-cab-driver-in-jhansi-101626369848997.html
16-07-2021||Chandigarh||Kapurthala: 130-yr-old Durbar Hall to be restored by Sept-end||Delayed amid the pandemic, the restoration of 130-year-old Durbar Hall — an Indo-Saracenic monument built by Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala — is set to be completed by the end of September this year. Funded by the Asian Development Bank, the ₹8.5-crore project for interior and exterior restoration and conservation of the historical building at Kapurthala is being carried out by the Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion Board. Once the work is complete, the Durbar Hall will be thrown open to the public, said project manager AR Mishra.Indo-Saracenic architecture was a revivalist architectural style mostly used by British architects in India in the later 19th century, especially in public and government buildings in the British Raj, and the palaces of rulers of the princely states. It drew stylistic and decorative elements from native Indo-Islamic architecture, especially Mughal architecture.The Durbar Hall was also built in line with the Sikh tradition: it had grand interiors for public functions and was used by the Maharaja to hold his durbar (court) twice a year. Its construction began in 1882 and was completed in eight years. The Maharaja’s birthday celebrations and state rituals and ceremonies were also held in the hall. In 1947, the complex became government property and was converted into a courts and administrative complex.Around 60 workers under the supervision of technical experts of thetourism department’s conservation wingare engaged in the restoration project. The work started in 2019 and was expected to be completed within 18 months, but was stalled as the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic delayed the shifting of government departments from the historic building, said officials.Mishra said renovation of the main part of Durbar Hall, also known as Palace of Justice, has been completed at a cost of nearly ₹3.5 crore. The works included restoration ofthe ornate ceiling and wooden flooring. “Once the restoration work gets completed, which is expected by September end, Punjab Infrastructure and Development Board will take over the building’s further preservation, likely under public-private partnership,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kapurthala-historical-durbar-hall-to-be-restored-by-septend-101626366609457.html

We also recovered some sensitive documents related to the army from the 41-year-old spy, Habib-ur-Rehman. The army headquarters have authenticated the seized documents as classified and informed us that they contained highly secret information related to the army,” said Praveer Ranjan, special commissioner of police (crime).A case under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) has been registered. Ranjan said Rehman is a contractor who supplied fruits and vegetables to the army base at Pokhran. During his visits to Sindh, Pakistan, to meet his relatives there, Rehman came in contact with agents of Pakistan ISI, the special commissioner said.“Paramjeet was earlier posted at the Pokhran base camp. During his posting, Rehman asked him to supply sensitive documents to him.

16-07-2021||World||Russia says US mission in Afghanistan has failed||Russia on Friday said that the United States had failed in its mission in Afghanistan and blamed the withdrawal of foreign forces for the war-torn country's rapidly deteriorating stability.Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan have capitalised on the last stages of the withdrawal of foreign troops to launch offensives, capturing a swath of districts and border crossings, and encircling provincial capitals.The White House had tried to paint the drawdown of foreign troops in "the most positive colours", Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday."But everyone understands that the mission failed," he told reporters at a conference in Uzbekistan attended by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.Lavrov earlier blamed the "hasty withdrawal" of US and NATO troops worsening security in Afghanistan and warned of instability spreading to neighbouring countries."In recent days we have unfortunately seen a rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan," he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies."In light of the hasty withdrawal of the US and NATO troops, there is huge uncertainty around the future of the political and military situation in this country," he told reporters.Russia hosted Taliban representatives in Moscow last week, where the insurgent group claimed to have control over about 85 percent of Afghanistan.Moscow is closely watching the Taliban's advance and concerned about the potential for instability reaching neighbouring ex-Soviet Central Asian countries where Russia maintains military bases.Lavrov said the crisis had increased the threat of terrorism and worsened problems surrounding drug trafficking, which he said had reached "an unprecedented level"."It's clear that, in this situation, there is a real risk of instability spreading to neighbouring countries," he said in Tashkent, according to Russian news agency TASS.Earlier this week, ex-Soviet Tajikistan said nearly 350 Afghan refugees had crossed its border fleeing Taliban advances.Tajikistan's President Emomali Rakhmon conducted inspections at border guard posts on Friday, having earlier called up 20,000 reservists to bolster defences along the country's shared border with Afghanistan.Russia's defence ministry said this week it was staging military drills in Tajikistan where it has a base aimed at buttressing border security with Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-us-mission-in-afghanistan-has-failed-101626455095142.html

Some suggest that priority should be given to hundreds of millions in the global south who have not even gotten their first jab yet.Why three?Earlier this month, manufacturers Pfizer/BioNTech said they would ask US and European authorities for permission to provide a third dose of their vaccine.They said this was aimed at ensuring stronger immunity in individuals than that bestowed by two doses.The developers said that two doses of their vaccine protected against severe Covid-19 for at least six months.But faced with emerging variants, they said they anticipated some decline in efficacy over time.The White House's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci, speaking on CNBC on Tuesday, said Pfizer/BioNTech's third-dose application was "an appropriate preparation (for) the eventuality that you might need a booster"."But when you translate that into, 'We will need a booster, everyone's going to get a booster,' that is not appropriate," Fauci said.He added that there were still too many people who are not fully vaccinated with two doses, let alone three.What do authorities say?There is currently no sign that medical agencies will recommend a third dose for everyone who has already received two.The European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Control says it is still too early to tell if a third dose is needed."There is not yet enough data from vaccination campaigns and ongoing studies to understand how long protection from the vaccines will last, also considering the spread of variants," they said in a joint statement.Didier Houssin, director of the World Health Organization's emergency committee, said he didn't believe there was enough evidence to justify recommending a third dose at this point.He also warned that talk of a third dose could "aggravate concerns over access to vaccines" at a time where most countries have only a tiny percentage of people fully inoculated.Hungary's President Viktor Orban on Friday said that some citizens would be able to access a third injection from the start of August.Hungary has largely gone it alone in terms of vaccines, widely using Chinese and Russian shots instead of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson makes approved for use in the EU.Useful for vulnerable people?Although mass third dose campaigns don't appear to be on the horizon, several countries have already started giving third doses to certain people.These include individuals who have a weakened immune system, including those who have undergone organ transplants, or suffer from cancer or renal problems.Among these, the bodies natural immune response to pathogens is suppressed, which means the immune response provoked by vaccines can be less powerful.Along with France, Israel this week began giving third doses to certain people."Recent data showed that the immune response provoked by two doses were insufficient among severely immunosuppressed individuals," France's vaccine committee said in May.For its part, Israel justified its decision by pointing to "a large number of cases in recent weeks" as well as the risk posed to immunocompromised patients.Or the elderly?France went a step further on Monday in announcing that a "booster campaign" would start from September for people fully vaccinated early in the year.The vaccination council said earlier this month that it was starting its third dose drive with over 80s."Scientific data to support this proposal are still limited, but taking into account studies showing a fall in antibody levels in this population, and the potentially serious impact on the care system, it appears reasonable," the council said.It added that it was possible younger people would eventually have access to a third shot, depending on how the pandemic progresses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-doses-better-than-two-debate-over-third-covid-shot-intensifies-101626454449420.html
16-07-2021||World||Experts warn UK over 'murderous' end to Covid-19 curbs||The UK government's plan to scrap day-to-day pandemic restrictions in England next week has no basis in science and amounts to premeditated murder for thousands of people, scientists warned on Friday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week it was "highly probable" the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is over as he pressed ahead with Monday's reopening, despite the Delta variant spreading out of control.The step is justified by two-thirds of all UK adults now being fully vaccinated, he said, but England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned that infection rates are on track to reach "quite scary" levels.After convening for an emergency discussion about the UK plan, international scientists including advisers to other governments had brutal words for Johnson."I've written that I believe that the strategy of herd immunity is actually murderous," US scientist William Haseltine said."It is knowledge that you are doing something that will result in thousands, and in some cases tens of thousands of people dying. It is a disaster as a policy," he added.The UK government denies it is pursuing a policy of "herd immunity" by letting the Delta variant let rip, but concedes that daily infection rates could triple to 100,000 in the weeks ahead, adding to strains on hospitals."I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast," Whitty said on Thursday, urging the public "to take things incredibly slowly" as restrictions ease.From Monday -- dubbed "Freedom Day" by some media -- the government will lift most restrictions on public gatherings in England and allow businesses such as nightclubs to reopen.Mandates covering face masks and work from home will be lifted as Johnson promotes a new approach of personal responsibility, although he has also urged people not to "throw caution to the winds".'Pingdemic'The devolved governments of Scotland and Wales set their own health policy and will keep in place a legal requirement to wear face coverings in enclosed spaces such as shops and on public transport. Northern Ireland looks set to follow them.The foreign scientists attending Friday's online meeting warned that England was falling out of step not just with its neighbours in the UK but with the rest of the world.The meeting was organised by the authors of a protest letter published by medical journal The Lancet last week that originally carried 122 signatories.Another 1,400 scientists have since added their names."In New Zealand we've always looked to the UK for leadership," said Michael Baker, professor of public health at the University of Otago in Dunedin."You have a remarkable depth of scientific knowledge. You've done remarkably well in vaccine development and roll-out. Remarkable clinical trials that we're drawing on," he said."And that's why it just seems so remarkable that you're not following even basic public health principles here."Professor Chiou Shu-Ti, former head of Taiwan's Health Promotion Administration, said she was "very concerned" that younger age groups and clinically vulnerable people were left exposed by the UK plan."In our culture there is a saying that it is unethical to take the umbrella away from people while it's still raining," Chiou said."And it's actually raining very hard. So I hope the politicians can take that into consideration, to keep the umbrella there for those people not having a raincoat."The surge in infections sweeping Britain led to more than 530,000 people being instructed to self-isolate by a government-run app in the week to July 7, the highest total since January, according to latest data.Some companies such as carmaker Nissan have been losing staff en masse after they were pinged by the app -- in a brewing crisis described by media as a "pingdemic".Butchers, another industry hit hard, have even warned of national meat shortages unless the app is made less sensitive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-warn-uk-over-murderous-end-to-covid-19-curbs-101626454152155.html
16-07-2021||World||'Reputational, legal damages': US warns firms of risk of doing business in Hong Kong||The Biden administration issued a blanket warning Friday to US firms about the risks of doing business in Hong Kong as China continues to clamp down on political and economic freedoms in the territory.Four Cabinet agencies — the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce and Homeland Security — released the nine-page advisory that alerts companies about the shifting legal landscape in Hong Kong and the possibility that engaging with Hong Kong business could incur reputational and legal damages.At the same time, Treasury announced sanctions against seven Chinese officials for violating the terms of the 2020 Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which calls for asset freezes and other penalties against those who participate in the crackdown.President Joe Biden had previewed the new advisory on Thursday, telling reporters at the White House that the business environment in Hong Kong is “deteriorating” and could worsen.“Businesses, individuals, and other persons, including academic institutions, research service providers, and investors that operate in Hong Kong, or have exposure to sanctioned individuals or entities, should be aware of changes to Hong Kong’s laws and regulations,” said the notice, which is titled “Risks and Considerations for Businesses Operating in Hong Kong.”“This new legal landscape ... could adversely affect businesses and individuals operating in Hong Kong. As a result of these changes, they should be aware of potential reputational, regulatory, financial, and, in certain instances, legal risks associated with their Hong Kong operations,” it said.Secretary of State Antony Blinken highlighted the advisory in a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the passage of China's new national security law that he said had a profoundly negative effect on Hong Kong.Blinken said the risks to business include "potential electronic surveillance and lack of data privacy, reduced access to information, and potential retaliation against companies for their compliance with US sanctions.”“The business advisory outlines these emerging risks to inform US individuals and businesses and recommends increased awareness and due diligence," he saidThe American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, meanwhile, responded to the advisory by acknowledging the business environment “is more complex and challenging” but saying that it would continue its work.“We are here to support our members to navigate those challenges and risks while also capturing the opportunities of doing business in this region,” it said in a statement. It added that “Hong Kong remains a critical and vibrant facilitator of trade and financial flow between the East and West.”The United States under both the Trump and Biden administrations has determined that since the passage of the national security law, Hong Kong no longer enjoys the significant autonomy from mainland China that Beijing had pledged to respect for 50 years when it assumed control of the former British colony in 1997.As such, Hong Kong no longer enjoys preferential US trade and commercial privileges and certain officials in Hong Kong have been hit with US sanctions for their actions in cracking down on democracy.China is one of the rare areas in which the Biden administration has largely hewed to Trump's policies.Friday's warning came on the heels of a similar advisory issued earlier this week reminding American companies about potential sanctions liability if they engage in business with Chinese entities that operate in the western Xinjiang region, where China is accused of widespread repression of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities.The seven officials targeted for sanctions are Chen Dong, He Jing, Lu Xinning, Qiu Hong, Tan Tieniu, Yang Jianping and Yin Zonghua. All seven serve as deputy directors of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, an agency the US accuses of repeatedly undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reputational-legal-damages-us-warns-firms-of-risk-of-doing-business-in-hong-kong-101626451081410.html
16-07-2021||World||UK's plan to remove Covid restrictions threat to world, warn 1,200 scientists||UK Prime Minister’s Boris Johnson’s plan to lift almost all restrictions from Monday amid a raging pandemic is a threat to the world and could lead to the emergence of deadly variants capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity, international experts have warned. Speaking at an emergency summit, scientists and physicians raised concern over the UK’s decision to kick off the final phase of the four-step roadmap out of lockdown while the country is witnessing a worrying surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant.Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University, expressed shock at Boris Johnson’s statement that suggested proceeding with the reopening. Gurdasani said that the government is implicitly accepting that the National Health Service (NHS) will come under immense pressure with thousands of hospitalisations and around 100-200 deaths per day during the peak of the pandemic.“We only have 51% of our population now fully vaccinated. Opening up at this point in time, fully acknowledging that a delay in the plan by four weeks stage 3 allowed us to vaccinate many more people, makes absolutely no sense,” said Gurdasani, adding that millions of people will get infected and hundreds of thousands will get Long Covid.Government advisers from around the world sounded alarm bells about the reopening plan, saying any variant that becomes dominant in the UK will likely spread in the rest of the world, given the country’s position as a global travel hub. “The UK policy doesn’t just affect us. It affects everybody and everybody has a stake in what we do,” Christina Pagel, the director of University College London’s clinical operational research unit, told the virtual meeting.The experts wondered why the UK government was not following even basic public health principles. “We cannot understand why this is happening in spite of the scientific knowledge that you have,” said José Martin-Moreno of the University of Valencia, a senior adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO).The summit meeting was held after hundreds of scientists, doctors, nurses and other professionals signed a letter published in The Lancet medical journal, condemning the government’s “dangerous and unethical experiment.” The letter has now been signed by more than 1,200 scientists.On Thursday, the UK reported more than 48,000 Covid-19 cases, the highest in six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-plan-to-remove-covid-restrictions-threat-to-world-warns-1-200-scientists-101626451727971.html
16-07-2021||World||Afghan Prez slams Pakistan for not doing enough for political solution||With Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and world leaders in the audience, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani used a regional conference in Tashkent on Friday to launch a blistering attack on Islamabad for failing to prevent foreign terrorists sneaking into Afghanistan and not doing enough to pressure the Taliban to join peace talks.Ghani used his address at the conference, hosted by Uzbekistan to foster connectivity between Central and South Asia, to criticise Pakistan for failing to deliver on its commitments to influence the Taliban to participate in negotiations and to prevent the cross-border movement of jihadi fighters.The president’s remarks reflected the Afghan government’s frustration over the Taliban’s refusal to begin talks to find a political settlement while it conducts a massive campaign to capture territory amid the rapid drawdown of US and NATO forces. Afghan officials have repeatedly blamed Pakistan for not putting pressure on Taliban leaders present on Pakistani soil to launch peace talks.Khan, who addressed the conference after Ghani, responded to the allegations by saying he was “disappointed” by the Afghan leader’s comments and that no country had “tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan”.Ghani told the audience, which included US deputy national security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, that intelligence estimates indicated the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month as well as support from their affiliates and the trans-national organisations” for the Taliban.“There’s a consensus among credible international observers that [the Taliban have] not taken any steps to sever their relationship with terrorist organisations,” he said.Contrary to the “repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force, will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organisations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of the assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and state,” he said.Ghani said Afghanistan is not asking for sympathy but for a clear definition of interest. “Embracing regional connectivity and support for a political pathway to walk back the Taliban and their supporters from the brink of descent to hell is a win-win approach. To plunge Afghanistan into all-out war is to plunge the region into radical uncertainty,” he said.“Pakistan, therefore, needs to be engaged coherently and urgently from the perspective of regional interest,” he added.While Afghanistan is grappling with a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and a severe drought, the Taliban unleashed a destructive wave of attacks across the country by deploying more than 5,000 prisoners released under the terms of the peace deal the group signed with the US last year, Ghani said.This was contrary to the Taliban’s commitment to the US to pursue a political solution, and the group had embarked on a systematic campaign of destruction and looting of public assets, car bomb attacks, assassinations, targeted killing of women and civil society leaders and summary execution of prisoners of war, he said. “These practices are forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee to cities and secure provinces. The only choice offered by the Taliban is that of submission and surrender,” he added.Ghani made it clear that while his government is committed to peace, the Afghan security forces will continue the fight. “We are prepared to face the Taliban and their supporters for as long as it takes, until they realise that a political solution is the only way forward,” he said.He added, “We, therefore, call on the Taliban to engage with the government of Afghanistan to end the war and the destructive recent onslaught. Also, we call on Pakistan to use its influence and leverage for peace and cessation of hostilities.”Khan said in his address that Pakistan’s foremost priority is stability in Afghanistan as it is “petrified” about the possible influx of more refugees at a time when it is supporting three million Afghan refugees.“Let me just say that the country that is going to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan...the last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict,” he said.“I can assure you that no country has tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan. We have made every effort short of taking military action against Taliban in Pakistan...to get them on the dialogue table and to have a peaceful settlement there.”Khan added, “To blame Pakistan for what is going on in Afghanistan, I feel, is extremely unfair...and I feel really disappointed that we have been blamed for what is going on in Afghanistan.”Khan also questioned whether the Taliban would compromise at a time when the US has set a date for the exit of its troops. “Why would they listen to us when they are sensing victory?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-ghani-slams-pakistan-for-not-doing-enough-for-political-solution-101626451515124.html

Extending India’s condolences to their families, the foreign secretary called on member states to undertake all measures mandated by the Security Council to ensure the protection of humanitarian workers.To ensure accountability for serious violations, Shringla said the UN body must assist national authorities to strengthen their legal frameworks for protecting humanitarian workers and also consider sanctioning violation such as attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel.But, he cautioned, “such measures should have wider regional and international support, in the absence of which, there may be further deterioration of the humanitarian crisis and shrinking of the humanitarian space”. As it was happening in Syria, where, he added, it had a “worsening impact of such measures on humanitarian operations on the ground”.The foreign secretary went on to reiterate India’s commitment to “working with the international community to address global humanitarian challenges in an effective and comprehensive manner”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avoid-politicisation-of-humanitarian-work-india-tells-unsc-101626450674033.html

16-07-2021||World||WHO chief says push to discount Covid lab leak theory 'premature'; China reacts||Undermining the World Health Organization’s own March report on the origin of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the head of the UN health agency on Thursday said that the push to discount the lab leak theory was “premature.” Speaking to reporters in Geneva, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged the possibility of coronavirus leaking in a laboratory accident.“I was a lab technician myself, I’m an immunologist, and I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen,” Ghebreyesus said. “It’s common.”Researchers have been trying to identify the origin of Sars-Cov-2 since its first outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan. But they have not been able to arrive at a definitive conclusion, given the challenge faced by investigators to access raw data, according to the WHO chief, during their probe earlier this year in China.The lab leak theory has been floating around from the initial days of the pandemic but was largely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. The hypothesis gained momentum after top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he was not totally convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally.” Fauci’s remark was followed by US President Joe Biden ordering intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to probe the possibility of a Chinese laboratory link.Also Read | ‘Will look into WHO proposal’: China on next phase of probe into coronavirus originAmid growing international pressure for another investigation, Ghebreyesus has asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origins of the coronavirus. He told reporters that the UN health agency is “asking actually China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for at the early days of the pandemic.”“We need information, direct information on what the situation of this lab was before and at the start of the pandemic,” he said, adding that China's cooperation was critical. “If we get full information, we can exclude (the lab connection).”Responding to the WHO’s changed stance on Covid origins, China has denied that international experts were not given adequate access for investigation. Citing the report published in March, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the investigators "agreed that the hypothesis that a lab leak led to the outbreak is extremely unlikely."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-says-push-to-discount-covid-lab-leak-theory-premature-china-reacts-101626439000113.html
16-07-2021||World||Hong Kong national security police raids student union office||Hong Kong’s national security police on Friday raided the office of a university student union after student leaders last week commemorated a man who killed himself after stabbing a police officer, local media reports said.Police raided the office at the University of Hong Kong and cordoned off the area around it, the South China Morning Post newspaper said. No union members were in the office at the time.It was not clear if anything was seized or if any arrests were made. Police did not immediately comment.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam earlier this week urged the university and police to take action after student leaders passed a motion expressing “deep sadness” and appreciating the “sacrifice” of the man who attacked the police officer.The man, identified as Leung Kin-fai, was described by police as a “lone wolf” domestic terrorist who was politically radicalized. On July 1, Leung stabbed a police officer with a knife before turning the weapon on himself.Leaders of the student union later apologized for passing the motion and stepped down from their posts.Despite the apology, the university issued a statement saying it no longer recognized the student union and would investigate the incident and “take action against the students concerned.”Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong last year after months of anti-government protests in 2019 that included violent clashes between student-led protesters and police.Over a hundred pro-democracy activists have been arrested under the law, which outlaws subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign collusion to interfere in the city’s affairs.Critics say the law has been used to stifle dissent in Hong Kong and restricts freedoms promised to the former British colony for 50 years that are not found on the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-national-security-police-raids-student-union-office-101626428443613.html
16-07-2021||World||Flooding in Europe: Death toll reaches 103 in Germany, at least 126 dead in Europe||The death toll from devastating floods in Europe soared to at least 126 on Friday, most in western Germany where emergency responders were frantically searching for missing people.Unsuspecting residents were caught completely off guard by the torrent dubbed the "flood of death" by Germany's top-selling daily Bild.Streets and houses were submerged by water in some areas, while cars were left overturned on soaked streets after flood waters passed. Some districts were completely cut off from the outside world."Everything was under water within 15 minutes," Agron Berischa, a 21-year-old decorator from Bad Neuenahr in Rhineland-Palatinate state, told AFP."Our flat, our office, our neighbours' houses, everywhere was under water."Residents were shocked by the damage as floodwaters continued to rise overnight."We rushed home and found ourselves waist-deep in water. And overnight another 50 centimetres were added," said Christoph Buecken in Eschweiler in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).Adding to the devastation, several more people were feared dead in a landslide in northern Germany on Friday triggered by floods.Hundreds were unaccounted for in the country, while the death toll in Belgium jumped to 23 with more than 21,000 people left without electricity in one region.Luxembourg and the Netherlands were also hammered by heavy rains, inundating many areas and forcing thousands to be evacuated in the city of Maastricht.Fearing the worstIn Germany's hard-hit Ahrweiler district in Rhineland-Palatinate, several houses collapsed completely, drawing comparisons to the aftermath of a tsunami.At least 24 people were confirmed dead in Euskirchen, one of the worst-affected towns just to the north."I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days," Chancellor Angela Merkel said late Thursday from Washington, where she met with President Joe Biden."My empathy and my heart go out to all of those who in this catastrophe lost their loved ones, or who are still worrying about the fate of people still missing."The number of casualties in Rhineland-Palatinate has reached 60, bringing the national toll to at least 103, authorities said Friday.In Ahrweiler, around 1,300 people were unaccounted for, although local authorities told Bild the high number was likely due to damaged phone networks.Regional interior minister Roger Lewentz told local media that up to 60 people were believed to be missing, "and when you haven't heard from people for such a long time... you have to fear the worst"."The number of victims will likely keep rising in the coming days," he added.Billions in damageSeveral people were dead and missing after a landslide in Erftstadt-Blessem in NRW, local officials said Friday."Houses were largely swept away by the water and some collapsed," the Cologne local authority said on Twitter, while a spokeswoman for the local government told AFP there were "confirmed" deaths.Gerd Landsberg, head of the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, said the cost of the damage was likely to run into "billions of euros".In Belgium, the army has been sent to four of the country's 10 provinces to help with rescue and evacuations.The swollen Meuse river "is going to look very dangerous for Liege", a nearby city of 200,000 people, warned Wallonia regional president Elio Di Rupo.In Switzerland, lakes and rivers were also swelling after heavy overnight rainfall. In Lucerne in particular, Lake Lucerne had begun to flood the city centre.Some parts of western Europe received up to two months' worth of rainfall in two days on soil that was already near saturation, according to the World Meteorological Organization.Climate change?The severe storms have put climate change back at the centre of Germany's election campaign ahead of a September 26 poll marking the end of Merkel's 16 years in power.Speaking in Berlin on Friday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Germany would "only be able to curb extreme weather situations if we engage in a determined fight against climate change".The country "must prepare much better" in future, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said, adding that "this extreme weather is a consequence of climate change".Because a warmer atmosphere holds more water, climate change increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.In urban areas with poor drainage and buildings located in flood zones, the damage can be severe.North Rhine-Westphalia premier Armin Laschet, the conservative running to succeed Merkel, called for "speeding up" global efforts to fight climate change, underlining the link between global warming and extreme weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flooding-in-europe-death-toll-reaches-103-in-germany-at-least-118-dead-in-europe-101626433061121.html

All parties should respect the opinion of the scientists and should refrain from politicizing it.”Ghebreyesus urged China to cooperate in the second phase of investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and insisted that, “We owe it to the millions who suffered and died.” The WHO chief asked China to be “transparent, open and cooperate” as the lack of raw data, especially from the early days of the outbreak, is hindering the probe.Also Read: 'Should set aside LAC standoff to revive ties': ChinaZhao, however, defended China’s attempts at cooperation, stating that raw data was shared with the expert team that was dispatched to study the origin, and that the experts were in agreement with the country’s stance. “China showed the expert team the raw data that should be considered,” Zhao said. “The experts clearly stated on multiple occasions that they acquired a large amount of data and information, and fully understood that some information related to personal privacy cannot be copied or taken away,” he added.The Group of Seven countries, also known as the G7, have been calling on China to allow a “timely, transparent, expert-led and science-based” study into the virus’s beginnings. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison became the latest representative to join the group’s call. US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has however cautioned that the world may never find out the precise origin of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-look-into-who-proposal-china-on-next-phase-of-probe-into-coronavirus-origin-101626431560857.html
16-07-2021||World||Russian plane that went missing found, survivors seen: Officials||Russian officials hailed a "miracle" on Friday after a passenger plane made an emergency landing in a Siberian field and all 18 people on board emerged, suffering only cuts and bruises.The An-28 plane, operated by Siberian Light Aviation (SiLA), was flying from the town of Kedrovy to Tomsk when communication was lost, Governor Sergei Zhvachkin's office said.The emergencies ministry announced later that the plane had been found, apparently after making a "hard landing", and that survivors had been spotted.The aviation agency said the plane had been found 155 kilometres (96 miles) from the airstrip in Tomsk.Zhvachkin's office announced that everyone on board, including three crew, were alive and that medics had "recorded mainly bruises and abrasions"."We all believed in a miracle. And thanks to the professionalism of the pilots, it came true: everyone is alive," the governor said.Images circling on social media showed the plane flipped upside down with dirt inside the cabin and its nose destroyed.Zhvachkin said that all of the passengers and crew would be taken to the regional capital Tomsk, where they would be examined by doctors.The Interfax news agency cited a local official as saying that six passengers refused to take a helicopter from the crash site to Tomsk and would be travelling instead by minibus.Soviet-era planesThe incident comes just 10 days after the crash of an An-26 plane in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, killing all 28 people on board.Antonov planes were manufactured during the Soviet era and are still used throughout the former USSR for civilian and military transport. They have been involved in a number of accidents in recent years.News agency TASS reported that the An-28 plane had passed all safety checks but cited a SiLA executive as saying that the flight had been delayed by 10 hours because of bad weather.The An-28 is a twin-engine light turboprop plane with a usual capacity of 17 passengers.A local transport source told the Interfax news agency that the plane was built in 1989 and used by Russian airline Aeroflot and in ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan before going into service with SiLA in 2014.Russia, once notorious for plane accidents, has improved its air traffic safety record in recent years.But poor aircraft maintenance and lax safety standards persist.In May 2019 a Sukhoi Superjet belonging to the flag carrier airline Aeroflot crash-landed and caught fire on the runway of a Moscow airport, killing 41 people.In February 2018, a Saratov Airlines An-148 aircraft crashed near Moscow shortly after take-off, killing all 71 people on board. An investigation later concluded that the accident was caused by human error.Flying in Russia can also be dangerous in the vast country's isolated regions with difficult weather conditions such as the Arctic and the Far East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-plane-with-at-least-13-onboard-goes-missing-near-siberia-reports-101626432529770.html

However, we are not, by any means, out of the woods yet on this. We shouldn't also underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast," Professor Whitty, who is also the chief medical adviser (CMA) to the UK government, said on Thursday at a webinar hosted by the Science Museum, London.The senior physician also had a word of caution as the UK approaches July 19 "Freedom Day," when all legal restrictions related to Covid-19 induced lockdown will be lifted. "I expect most people to continue using precautions like face masks in closed spaces even if these are no longer a legal requirement for next week. People are saying that even if they themselves are relatively low-risk, they will modify their behaviour as people around them are at high-risk," Professor Whitty remarked.Also Read | 'Will move away from legal restrictions': UK PM Johnson confirms ending Covid measuresThe warning from the medic, who appears alongside prime minister Boris Johnson during the latter's briefing on coronavirus, comes at a time when there has been a major upswing in the UK's daily Covid-19 cases even as the government confirmed earlier this week that all legal restrictions related to the Covid-19 lockdown will end on July 19.

16-07-2021||World||Russia outlaws media portal that said Vladimir Putin fathered secret child||Russia has outlawed an investigative media portal for publishing a report last year that alleged President Vladimir Putin had secretly fathered a daughter outside his marriage. The country’s prosecutor general declared the portal, Proekt Media, an “undesirable organization,” as it “posed a threat to the foundations of constitutional order and security of the Russian Federation,” according to a report in Bloomberg.The article, published by Proekt, had claimed that the daughter of a multi-millionaire woman who is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya bears a close resemblance to Putin. The bank is under the control of Yury Kovalchuk, a billionaire close to Putin. The report was dismissed by the Kremlin as “tabloid fodder”. Putin was married to Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya till 2014 and the couple have two daughters.The media outlet has also published investigative pieces exposing alleged corruption and abuses by top officials and tycoons close to Putin.Russian authorities have designated its editor, Roman Badanin, and several of its reporters as “foreign agents”. Badanin and several journalists working for the portal were also subjected to raids in June under a 2017 defamation case, just as Proekt was getting ready to publish an investigative report on interior minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev and his wealth.The Russian government has outlawed more than 30 groups under a 2015 law that made membership in “undesirable” organisations a criminal offence. Besides Proekt, two popular independent outlets -- Meduza and VTimes -- have been designated as “foreign agents” in recent months. Last month, a Moscow court outlawed organisations founded by Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny for allegedly being extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-outlaws-media-portal-that-said-vladimir-putin-fathered-secret-child-101626430853812.html
16-07-2021||World||Delta variant cases among fully vaccinated people cause worry in Australia||The highly contagious Delta variant has caused the biggest threat to Australia’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) response in months as the number of fully vaccinated people catching the infection is rising. A nurse at Westmead Hospital in New South Wales and a worker at the Brisbane international airport are reported to have Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated against the disease, according to The Guardian.Australia reported 103 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Friday and the bulk of it came from Sydney, taking the total caseload in the ongoing outbreak, which began a month ago, to more than 1,000. The latest Covid-19 outbreak in Australia has claimed two lives and 75 patients have been hospitalised, reported Associated Press.While the number is still low as compared to the rest of the world, the resurgence is a sharp turnaround for a country that was successful in keeping small flare-ups in check for months. The state of Victoria has announced some form of lockdown conditions for Sydney, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in the country."I can't stress to the community my absolute concern that we need to work harder at reducing mobility and reduce our interactions with others," New South Wales Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said.Experts have warned of more breakthrough infections with the rapid spread of the Delta variant, saying the vaccines aren’t perfect. Hassan Vally, an associate professor in epidemiology at La Trobe University in Australia, said that vaccination and PPE aren’t fail-safe even though they reduce the risk of infection, The Guardian reported.Critics have blamed the resurgence on low vaccination rates, frequent changes in vaccine guidance leading to hesitancy, and lax quarantine at the international border. Less than 10% of the Australian population has been fully vaccinated, which is below many developed nations. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has blamed the low vaccination rate on supply shortages of Pfizer’s vaccine and the restrictions on AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine due to the blood clot scare.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-cases-among-fully-vaccinated-people-cause-worry-in-australia-101626430400129.html

Khan was responding to a question on whether “talks and terror can go hand in hand”."We can tell India that we [Pakistan] have been waiting for a long time to coexist as civilised neighbours...but what to do? the ideology of RSS has come in between," said Khan, while evading a question on whether Pakistan has no control over the Taliban anymore.Khan was in Tashkent for the Central-South Asia conference to discuss the “challenges and opportunities in Uzbekistan.” About 250 participants and 40 delegates from different countries are supposed to take part in the two-day conference.

On Thursday, Afghanistan vice president Amrullah Saleh accused Pakistan Air Force of providing air support to the Taliban militants in the border areas of Chaman and Spin Boldak, a claim rejected by Islamabad."Pakistan air force has issued (an) official warning to the Afghan Army and Air Force that any move to dislodge the Taliban from Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force. Pak air force is now providing close air support to Taliban in certain areas," Saleh tweeted.Responding to the accusation, Pakistan foreign office said in a statement that such statements undermine their “sincere efforts” to play their part in the peace talks. Last week, the Pakistani military said that Islamabad is a facilitator of the Afghan peace process and not a guarantor. "Of course other stakeholders have been a part of this, but Pakistan has played a key role," said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director-general Babar Iftikhar in an interview with ARY News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-evades-question-on-taliban-blames-rss-ideology-for-no-talks-with-india-101626429101615.html

At the time we thought that statins may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection through their known anti-inflammatory effects and binding capabilities, which may potentially stop the progression of the virus."The ACE2 receptor, or the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is the regulatory target of statins, and helps control blood pressure. Last year, it was discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily uses the ACE2 receptor to enter lung cells.For their study, which was published in the journal PLOS One, the research team used data from the American Heart Association's Covid-19 Cardiovascular Registry. Then, they applied their original findings to 10,541 patients across the United States, who were hospitalised with the coronavirus disease. The study was conducted across 104 hospitals from January to September 2020.Elaborating on the research, Daniels said, "We performed more advanced analyses as we attempted to control for comorbidities, socioeconomic status and hospital factors. The study confirmed our prior findings that statins reduce risk of death among patients hospitalised for Covid-19." She also said that most of the benefits appeared to be among patients with good medical reasons for taking the drug.Daniels further cautioned that just like any other observational study, it cannot be said with certainty that the reduced death risk due to Covid-19, found associated with statins, is due to statins themselves. However, she hoped that the findings act as an incentive for patients to continue using the drug.Statins reduce blood cholesterol levels by blocking liver enzymes which make cholesterol. They are such widely prescribed that according to the US Centers for Disease Control, 93% of patients using a cholesterol-reducing drug use a statin.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patients-taking-cholesterol-reducing-drug-at-lower-risk-of-death-due-to-covid-19-study-101626424920060.html

The remaining five who tested positive for the variant are Filipinos who came back from the United Kingdom (UK), the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar. One person succumbed to the variant after being rushed to a hospital in the capital city of Manali on June 28, Vergeire added.Also Read| ‘Early stages’ of Covid-19 third wave, amid Delta surge: WHOAuthorities in the Philippines are currently struggling to arrest the spread of the variant as it has led to a recent spike in daily cases and deaths. The country on Thursday recorded 5,221 new cases while 82 more people succumbed to the viral disease, taking the caseload and death toll to 1,490,665 and 26,314 respectively. On Wednesday, 3,806 cases and 140 deaths were reported. The Philippines currently has the second-highest Covid-19 caseload across South Asia.Apart from the Delta variant, the Philippines also has its own variant of Covid-19 called P.3, which was downgraded by WHO from a variant of interest to an alert for further monitoring, according to a report by GMA news online on Tuesday. The P.3 variant, first identified in the country in mid- February this year, has infected 166 people, the GMA news online report added.With regard to vaccination, the Philippines has administered 13,442,299 doses, which are sufficient for just 6.2 per cent of its population based on a two-dose regimen, data compiled by Reuters showed on Friday. The country will receive 3.2 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine during this month from the United States.The Delta variant, which was first detected in India in October last year, has wreaked havoc across the globe with more than 111 countries reporting cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday the spread of the variant is leading to an increase in cases and deaths due to the Covid-19. “We expect it (Delta variant) to soon be the dominant Covid-19 strain circulating worldwide if it isn’t already,” Ghebreyesus added.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-reports-first-locally-transmitted-cases-of-delta-variant-101626416991179.html

Young Afghans are reportedly engaging with the Islamist military organisation on the audio-based app Clubhouse to argue with its members and pitch counter-offensive tactics."Some say the Taliban have changed, but I wanted to hear from them, in their own voice, if they really have," said Sodaba, a 22-year-old man from Kabul. Women's rights are one of the several things he is concerned about in the evolving landscape of his country, and Sodaba wants to hear the Taliban's views on it, straight from its members. He told the news agency AFP that he wanted to know if the Islamic fundamentalist group still held its "strict beliefs, especially on women".The Clubhouse audio app allows users to dip into "rooms", either to listen or virtually put their hand up to speak in discussions, which according to the platform's guidelines cannot be recorded nor comments quoted. Scores of youngsters in Afghanistan are now populating the platform with an intent to engage the Taliban in discussions.Some of the popular topics include the Taliban's view of the afterlife, how to have a happy relationship, and Persian poetry. Many have wanted to weigh in on the reasons behind the quick fall of rural districts to the militants, with dozens waiting for their turn to speak.In a country riddled by insurgency, a platform for engaging with the Taliban in political discussions attracts the most listeners. The members of the Taliban sometimes moderate the chatrooms, and things may get heated up very fast as the proponents and critics clash on ideas, including war, human rights, and the role of women in society.A few users are fearful that the Taliban is violating Clubhouse policies by recording conversations that can be used for future retribution. "The Taliban called me rude and cut my mic after I spoke the truth about them," a user by the name of Haanya Saheba Malik tweeted. She later told AFP that the Taliban openly declared "those of us calling for human rights infidels and deserving of death."Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid denied that threats were being made. The group, which has adopted an increasingly professional approach to public relations and social media, calls Clubhouse a "good platform to talk to and find understanding with those who oppose".The approach is a marked shift from the past when the Taliban rarely engaged in open discussion. However, such changes are only gradual in an ever-shifting technological landscape, with nearly half of Afghanistan's 37 million residents now having access to the internet and 13 million using social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-youth-debate-taliban-over-poetry-and-human-rights-on-clubhouse-101626411885107.html

16-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada reviews Covaxin for emergency-use authorisation||Canadian health authorities have placed Covaxin, Indian company Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, under review for possible emergency-use authorization (EUA).The confirmation came in the form of an updated list of vaccines, antivirals and other Covid-19-related treatment listed by Health Canada. Among the latest entries is the candidate proposed by Vaccigen, the Canadian affiliate of Ocugen, the US biopharma company that has entered into an agreement with Bharat Biotech for manufacturing and distributing Covaxin in North America.The date listed by Health Canada for the application was June 30. While Covaxin was not specifically named, its medical ingredients were described as a “whole virion inactivated coronavirus” meant for human use.Whether Canada requires an additional vaccine is a separate debate, since it has placed orders for up to 404 million doses from various manufacturers, including 180 million doses from the four vaccines that currently have EUA in the country – the ones developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson.However, a decision to approve Covaxin is likely to depend less on domestic demand and more on an effort to standardise Covid-19 vaccines globally.In a media briefing on Thursday, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, Howard Njoo, said they were “looking more now at international collaboration, and international consistency”, according to a report in the outlet iPolitics.Ocugen had commenced discussions with Health Canada with regard to the authorisation of Covaxin in June. On Thursday, it released a statement saying “it had initiated a rolling submission to Health Canada”. That process was recommended and accepted by Canada’s interim order relating to Covid-19 drugs, and “transitioned to a new drug submission for Covid-19, which permits companies to submit safety and efficacy data, and information, as they become available. Often referred to as a rolling review, this allows Health Canada to start its review right away, as information continues to come in, to accelerate the overall review process”.Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, CEO and co-founder of Ocugen, said, “We thank Health Canada for their upcoming review of Covaxin and look forward to working with them so that we can offer the possibility of another safe and effective option to be used in their fight against Covid-19 and its Delta variant.”The Canadian review comes as Bharat Biotech has also submitted Phase 3 trial data to the World Health Organization (WHO) for its authorisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-reviews-covaxin-for-emergency-use-authorisation-101626412572505.html

The official death toll in the disaster is estimated at somewhere around 45, while news agencies independently reporting on the floods indicated that the actual number might be several counts higher.In Germany's Cologne area alone, at least 20 to 30 people are estimated to have lost their lives in the floods, while 28 more reportedly died in the Ahrweiler district in Rhineland-Palatinate, according to the Die Welt daily, which cited local police records on the floods. As many as 50 to 70 people are estimated missing following the floods, said interior minister Roger Lewentz.Among the German villages worst hit by the flood was Schuld, where several homes collapsed and dozens of people remained unaccounted for. Some villages were reduced to rubble as old brick and timber houses couldn't withstand the sudden rush of water, often carrying trees and other debris as it gushed through narrow streets. Even rescue operations took a hit, reported the Associated Press, due to blocked roads and internet outages across the Eifel, a volcanic region of rolling hills and small valleys.The floods in Germany also affected neighbouring Belgium, where the Vesdre River spilt over its banks and sent water churning through the streets of Pepinster, near Liege, where a rescue operation by firefighters went wrong when a small boat capsized and three elderly people disappeared. “Unfortunately, they were quickly engulfed,” said Mayor Philippe Godin. “I fear they are dead.”The Meuse River in Liege, a city with a population of 200,000, also overflowed its banks and authorities urged people to shift to higher ground. In Verviers, too, several bodies -- victims of the flood -- were found, but the prosecutor's office could not come up with an exact death toll in the incident.The full extent of the damage was still unclear, with many villages cut off by floods and landslides that made roads impassable. Many of the dead were only discovered after floodwaters receded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-ravage-germany-and-belgium-over-60-dead-dozens-missing-across-europe-101626407268012.html

Moreover, Canada should be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September, he added.Also Read | Why Indians are choosing Canada over US, experts testify before US lawmakersTrudeau spoke with leaders of Canada’s provinces and his office released a readout of the call. He noted that if Canada’s current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue the border can open.“Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September,” the readout said. “He noted the ongoing discussions with the United States on reopening plans, and indicated that we could expect to start allowing fully vaccinated US citizens and permanent residents into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel.”Trudeau noted Canada continues to lead G20 countries in vaccination rates with approximately 80% of eligible Canadians vaccinated with their first dose and over 50% of eligible Canadians fully vaccinated. He said case numbers and severe illnesses continue to decline across the country as vaccination rates continue to increase.In the early days of the pandemic, the US and Canadian governments closed the more than 5,500-mile (8,800-kilometer) border to nonessential traffic. With increasing vaccination rates and dropping infection rates, some were annoyed the two governments hadn’t laid out detailed plans to fully reopen the border.Canada began easing its restrictions earlier this month, allowing fully vaccinated Canadians or permanent legal residents to return to Canada without quarantining. But among the requirements are a negative test for the virus before returning, and another once they get back.Also Read | Canada says no to Covid-19 test report from India, wants flyers to take 'third country' routePressure has been mounting on Canada to continue to ease the restrictions at the border, which have been in effect since March of last year.Providing exemptions for travel into Canada amid the pandemic is politically sensitive and Trudeau is expected to call a federal election next month.Trudeau said his ministers would share more details on the border early next week.Commercial traffic has gone back and forth normally between the two countries since the start of the pandemic. Canadians are able to fly into the United States with a negative Covid-19 test.The US Travel Association estimates that each month the border is closed costs $1.5 billion. Canadian officials say Canada had about 22 million foreign visitors in 2019 — about 15 million of them from the United States.Canadian officials have said they would like 75% of eligible Canadian residents to be fully vaccinated before loosening border restrictions for tourists and business travelers. The Canadian government expects to have enough vaccines delivered for 80% of eligible Canadians to be fully vaccinated by the end of July. The US only allowed for exports of vaccines into Canada in early May.Major League Baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win an exemption to allow for home games to be played in Toronto starting July 30. Allowing unvaccinated players into the country remains a sticking point but protocols will be put in place. The Blue Jays played home games during the shortened 2020 season in Buffalo, New York, and started this season in Dunedin, Florida, before moving to Buffalo.The Canadian government didn’t allow the team to play at home in Toronto because of the risk of spreading Covid-19, citing frequent travel required in the US during a baseball season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-likely-to-allow-entry-to-fully-vaccinated-travellers-by-early-september-101626403589428.html
16-07-2021||World||EU sets Uyghur and Hong Kong conditions for investment agreement||The members of the European Parliament have underlined the conditions to be met before the legislature gives its consent to the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). The conditions have been listed in a draft report prepared by foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament, which calls for using the CAI as a leverage instrument to improve the protection of human rights and support for civil society in China.The pre-ratification commitments listed in the report include a timetable for China's ratification and implementation of key labour laws and concrete measures towards putting an end to human rights violations against the Uyghur minority in the country. It also demands a recommitment by China to uphold its international commitments to Hong Kong.Also Read | Xi Jinping warns foreign foes not to mess with ChinaThe resolution also supports for the United Nations (UN) to carry out legal investigations into alleged genocide and crimes against humanity taking place in Xinjiang and a unilateral ban on the import of products from forced labour and child labour or any other form of modern slavery.The European leaders have urged stronger cooperation with other democratic players such as Japan, India, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. They have called for combining the strength of global liberal democracies in order to respond to China’s changing role and growing influence in multilateral organisations.The resolution presented by the leaders strongly demands the bloc to revisit strategy to deal with China, in view of its strong economic growth and ambitious foreign policy agenda. The members condemned the Chinese ruling dispensation for its poor track record of human rights.Calling for a more assertive strategy against China, the members of the 27-nation bloc have proposed a new EU-China policy in the draft report based on six pillars: Opening dialogue on global challenges; engagement on human rights issues through economic leverage; analysis of the threats and challenges; building partnerships with like-minded partners; fostering open strategic autonomy and defending core European interests and values.The members also called for dialogues on human rights to be held regularly and a solid benchmarking of the progress made in bilateral talks. They also demanded opening of a channel to talk to China on possible ways to ensure better global preparedness to respond to pandemics.The European Parliament members also sought China's cooperation in an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Talking about the trade frictions, the European leaders demanded lifting the counter-sanctions imposed by the Chinese government on EU entities and individuals, who Beijing accused of "severely harming its sovereignty and interests and maliciously spreading lies and disinformation". The sanctions were imposed in March against 10 individuals and four entities in response to similar action by the EU against a Chinese entity and individuals over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.The draft report will now be submitted to a vote in the European Parliament as a whole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sets-uyghur-and-hong-kong-conditions-for-investment-agreement-101626401920345.html

Nine new Covid-19 deaths were reported on Wednesday.More than 1,500 new infections were reported on Thursday, and the county has become a place of "substantial" transmission, based on criteria set by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Los Angeles County health officer, Dr. Muntu Davis, said in remarks provided to reporters.Other California counties and other states are also grappling with a spike in coronavirus cases, led by a mutation of the coronavirus known as the Delta variant and predominantly affecting people who are unvaccinated.Also on Thursday, Sacramento and Fresno Counties in California recommended that masks be worn indoors even by people who are vaccinated. Austin, Texas, on Thursday urged people who are not vaccinated or are otherwise high-risk to avoid travel, indoor gatherings, dining out and shopping, and to wear masks.Earlier this week, Yolo County in California also recommended indoor masking, and in Springfield, Missouri, children and teachers have been required to wear masks during summer school."Everyone, including those who are vaccinated, should be aware of high-risk situations including being indoors, in crowds, and around unvaccinated and unmasked individuals and consider wearing a face covering in these settings,” said Fresno County Public Health physician Dr. John Zweifler.Data from the CDC show high levels of coronavirus transmission in numerous states, including Missouri, Mississippi, Florida, Nevada and Utah.Across the country, health officials urged residents who have not yet done so to become vaccinated. Vaccines are approved and available for all people as young as 12 years old. In Los Angeles County, just 0.09% of new cases were among people who had been vaccinated, officials said.“Our best protection against Covid-19 continues to be the vaccine," said Sacramento County Public Health Officer Olivia Kasirye. "We urge all eligible residents to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves, and their family and friends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-us-los-angeles-county-to-reimpose-mask-mandate-amid-rise-in-cases-101626398001944.html

Dr. Rajendra K V, deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, called an emergency meeting with health department officials of the district earlier in the day. He instructed the officials to screen as many people as possible entering Karnataka from Kerala for fever and other symptoms that the Zika virus manifests.More precautionary measures have been directed by Dr. Rajendra to curb the spread of the Zika virus. Those having symptoms similar to that of chikungunya and dengue would be asked to go to the nearest hospital and report the symptoms. The health department would check the travel history of the people with symptoms of Zika and record it in the medical records office.Zika virus is a vector-borne disease and is carried usually by the day-biting mosquito called Aedes Aegypti. They breed in freshly collected water, said the socio medical health workers.The administration asked the health department to inform and instruct the people to control breeding of mosquitoes in and around their houses.Dr. Rajendra informed that many hundreds of people travel everyday to Mangaluru, Puttur and Sullia cities across the border of both the states. He raised concerns over the chances of them carrying the virus into the state.Mangaluru gets around 1,200 to 1,600 people everyday from Kasargod, Kannur and other places for various businesses, health, work and education related works. Similarly, there is a heavy inflow of visitors from Kerala to districts like Chamarajanagar and Mysuru on a daily basis.Deputy commissioners of these districts are also likely to announce a vigil on the border area for controlling the spread of Zika virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-steps-up-vigilance-on-borders-with-kerala-over-the-surge-in-zika-virus-101626456704638.html
16-07-2021||India||Heavy rains likely in Tamil Nadu's western districts||The western districts of Tamil Nadu such as the Nilgiris and Coimbatore are likely to receive heavy rainfall on Friday and Saturday, Tamil daily Dina Thanthi reported quoting Regional Meteorological Center at Chennai. With the southeest monsoon turning vigorous in neighboring Karnataka and Kerala, Tamil Nadu has been receiving widespread rainfall this month.Regional Meteorological Center, Chennai, warned that heavy rain is likely in isolated places over the Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts on Friday while Tiruvallur, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tiruvannamalai, Kallakurichi, Ranipet, Ariyalur, Perambalur and Cuddalore districts may receive rainfall on Saturday. Moderate to light rains are likely to occur in other districts of Tamil Nadu, the weather bulletin noted.Meanwhile, the incessant rains resulted in landslides in some areas of the Nilgiris district on Thursday. Landslides were reported in Valavayal and Billukadai villages near Oveli town panchayat in the district. Town panchayat and highway officials have cleared the landslide and repaired the damaged roads. The fire and rescue department in the district said that they are fully prepared for the disaster mitigation works.The Nilgiris district has been receiving torrential rainfall ever since the southwest monsoon started. Ooty, Manjoor, and Gudalur areas in the district reported very heavy rains for the last week. The local weather turned very chilly in the hill stations following heavy rains in the district.

16-07-2021||India||‘Connectivity projects must be transparent and not create debt burdens’: Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday said connectivity efforts must be consultative, transparent and promote economic activity instead of creating debt burdens, an indirect reference to concerns about China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Jaishankar made the remarks while addressing a regional conference hosted by Uzbekistan on fostering connectivity between Central and South Asia. While he didn’t name any country, his speech left little doubt that the concerns he was referring to largely related to the BRI, which India has steadfastly refused to join.He also highlighted connectivity efforts undertaken by India, such as “practical steps to operationalise the Chabahar port in Iran” since 2016, and plans to include the port on the Gulf of Oman in the framework of the International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC).“Connectivity efforts must be based on economic viability and financial responsibility. They should promote economic activity and not create debt burdens,” Jaishankar said. “Ecological and environmental standards, as also skill and technology transfers, are musts. Connectivity must be consultative, transparent and participatory,” he said, adding that “building connectivity is an act of trust and must, at the minimum, conform to international law”. Jaishankar further said, “Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity are the most basic principles of international relations.”India has for long opposed the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship project of the BRI, because a crucial part of it runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Indian officials also say that projects under BRI around the world are skewed to benefit Chinese firms and do not provide a level playing field for Indian companies. Concerns related to BRI projects leading to debt traps have increased since Sri Lanka handed over the strategic Hambantota port and 15,000 acres around it to the Chinese side in 2017 after failing to repay huge loans advanced for the development of the facility.Referring to India’s development of facilities at Chabahar, which has emerged as a key transport hub for shipping goods to Afghanistan, Jaishankar said the Iranian port provides a secure, viable and unhindered access to the sea for Central Asian countries. “Its efficacy is now clearly proven. We have proposed to include the Chabahar port in the framework of INSTC. The formation of the India-Uzbekistan-Iran-Afghanistan quadrilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port is a welcome development,” he said.Noting that development is closely linked to peace and security, he said, “reliable connectivity within and through Afghanistan” requires confidence in that country’s governance. Economic growth is driven by connectivity, commerce and contacts and the contemporary challenge is that politics, vested interests and instability can be impediments to regional cooperation, he said. “The real issues are of mindsets, not of disputes. Blocking connectivity in practice while professing support in principle benefits no one,” he said. “A one-sided view of trade rights and obligations can never work. No serious connectivity can ever be a one-way street,” he added.Connectivity is also important for post-Covid economic recovery, but there is a widespread realisation of the need for more resilient and reliable supply chains, Jaishankar said. “All of us need more and multiple options. And this applies to the domain of connectivity most of all,” he said.Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, who addressed the conference after Jaishankar, contended that unsettled disputes between Pakistan and India are a major challenge to connectivity initiatives. “The whole area opens up if Pakistan and India [settle their disputes]. Our main issue is Kashmir, if we can resolve that issue, just imagine the impact. The huge market of India on one side, China on the other side, connectivity between Central Asia [and] Pakistan, the whole area changes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/connectivity-projects-must-be-transparent-and-not-create-debt-burdens-jaishankar-101626457275561.html

He won the Pulitzer Prize for photography and was embedded with the Afghan Forces in Kandahar. Sharing one of his pictures below. Sincere condolences. RIP," Thakur said in a tweet.Several media groups like the Foreign Correspondents Club (FCC) of South Asia and the Press Club of India (PCI) expressed shock at Siddiqui's death and remembered him as a courageous and "fiercely talented" photojournalist. Siddiqui was a member of the FCC."The Press Club of India is shocked at the passing of @Reuters' @PulitzerPrizes winning photojournalist @dansiddiqui at Kandahar where he fell to the bullets of the Taliban. True journalism needs courage and Danish's body of work is a testament to that. We are at a loss of words," it said in a tweet.The FCC, a group of over 500 journalists and photojournalists covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Afghanistan and Tibet, said it was a devastating loss for Siddiqui's family and the Delhi journalist community."Danish Siddiqui was a fiercely talented photojournalist whose pictures eloquently and forcefully told the story of South Asia. It is a devastating loss for his family, friends, colleagues and the Delhi journalist community, among whom he was universally admired."More often than not, the singular image that defined the biggest news of the day, resonant for its humanity and artistry, was taken by Danish. He will be remembered for his intelligence, compassion and bravery, and his body of work will live on forever. The governing committee of the FCC takes this sad opportunity to draw attention to the enormous risks journalists take to deliver essential information to the world," it said in a statement.Siddiqui, in his early 40s, was killed during clashes in Spin Boldak district in Kandahar, Tolo News quoted sources as saying. It said fierce fighting is going on in Kandahar, especially in Spin Boldak, for the last few days.The Indian journalist was covering the situation in Kandahar.Siddiqui's alma mater, Jamia Millia Islamia's AJK Mass Communication Research Centre (MCRC), mourned his death and remembered him as one of the "brightest stars" of the institute."It is absolutely devastating news and we are still processing it. Danish was one of the brightest stars in MCRC's hall of fame. His passing will be deeply mourned.

He took a class last month as well," said Professor Shohini Ghosh, director of AJK MCRC, who taught Siddiqui during his postgraduate course in the institute between 2005 and 2007.Siddiqui was based in Mumbai.

16-07-2021||India||Yediyurappa meets PM, fuels speculation amid looming political uncertainty||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi which he said was mostly regarding the development works in Karnataka.Yediyurappa is on a two-day visit to the capital where he is expected to meet senior ministers of the Union government and the national leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).After landing in Delhi, Yediyurappa said that he would meet the prime minister and other newly sworn-in central ministers from Karnataka and discuss with them the development works of the state including the construction of the contentious Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project.At around 7.30 pm, the chief minister spoke to reporters again. On a specific question on any discussion on leadership change, Yediyurappa said, “I don’t know, you tell me,” ducking to give a straight answer.The chief minister’s visit comes at a time amid swirling rumours of the BJP looking at the possibility of a leadership change. Yediyurappa’s camp has rejected this speculation.Before meeting with the Prime Minister, Yediyurappa told reporters that he would meet Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and other prominent leaders of the party. There is also speculation that Yediyurappa would seek the BJP leadership’s approval for a cabinet reshuffle to accommodate the rebels to quell any dissent.It remains to be seen how the BJP high command intends to handle the rebels and Yediyurappa, who is credited with having built the party in Karnataka over the last four decades. His unceremonious exit in 2012 had removed the BJP from power in the only state in the south of the country where the saffron outfit has been able to gain a firm foothold in recent decades.People aware of the developments said that the chief minister’s line that he was meeting the Prime Minister to tiappraise him of the Mekedatu project and developmental works cannot be taken at face value.“In my experience, a chief minister would meet the minister in charge, the party leadership and others but not the prime minister directly,” said the BJP legislator from Karnataka, requesting anonymity. He added that there may be no telling as to when the BJP will replace Yediyurappa but this meeting in Delhi is definitely the “step” towards it.“They will start tightening everything from now,” he added.Interestingly Yediyurappa was accompanied by his two sons, BY Vijayendra, BY Raghavendra; grandson Shashidhar Maradi; BJP MLC Leher Singh and two others. People aware of the developments asked why the chief minister chose not to take any officials with him if the agenda was indeed to seek support for developmental works.Though it remains to be seen if and when Yediyurappa will be asked to step down, his critics insist that his continuation threatens to dent the party’s chances in the 2023 assembly elections.Another person aware of the developments said that the visit to Delhi is most likely to set the terms of a replacement if the two sides do reach a deal amicably.“There is no leadership change in Karnataka and Yediyurappa will continue. Yediyurappa is visiting Delhi to meet the Prime Minister and home minister, party president and other central ministers, especially the irrigation minister. Cauvery river issue is a major issue,” R Ashok, Karnataka’s minister for revenue and a person regarded as a member of Yediyurappa’s inner circle said on Friday.Just two days ago, Union Jal Shakti minister, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat visited Karnataka and met with Yediyurappa and all senior ministers of Karnataka where he said that justice will be done to the southern state in the Mekedatu issue.Yediyurappa has made it clear that he would like to remain in power till 2023 and, people aware of the developments said that the 78-year-old is hoping to place his two sons in prominent roles in the government and the party.Vijayendra is the state BJP vice president and Raghavendra is the member of parliament from Shivamogga, the chief minister’s home district.Yediyurappa has at least once before said that Vijayendra will contest the 2023 assembly elections to show that he would be the “heir apparent” of the Lingayat community and the BJP in Karnataka.Raghavendra was considered among the BJP leaders who could be inducted into PM Modi’s council of ministers but PM Modi picked Shobha Karandlaje, another close associate of Yediyurappa, which was a strategy to keep the damage to a minimum if the chief minister does choose to do a repeat of his 2012 exit.Adding to the similarities from a decade ago, Yediyurappa and his family continue to see rising charges of corruption. There have been at least three major cases against the chief minister and his family in the last month and several more against ministers and legislators of his party.Yediyurappa has sought to take refuge behind the Lingayat community, believed to be the single largest group in the state who have backed the former since the turn of the century.However, leaders such as the party’s Basanagouda Yatnal, among others, have had some success to bracket Yediyurappa as a person from one of the sub-sects of the Lingayats and not of the entire community.“There is no reason to complain because they have made all concessions for Yediyurappa.

16-07-2021||India||‘Covid-19 pandemic exposed gaping loopholes in boasts’: Chidambaram||Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday sought an answer whether the Indian democracy has risen to the challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic and protected the lives and livelihood of its people. Chidambaram’s comments came during his visit to Jaipur where he took part in a seminar on ‘Global Pandemic and Challenges before the Democracy’ organised by the Rajasthan chapter of Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) in Rajasthan Assembly. He said that the pandemic may be contained by universal vaccination or the disease may be cured by the discovery of medicines but an answer to a question needed to be continuously searched. “Did Indian democracy rise to the challenge of the pandemic and protect the lives and livelihood and the wellbeing of its people, especially the poor and the children,” Chidambaram said. He said that every political system boasts that it is best suited to address the needs of the people. “What the pandemic has done is expose the gaping loopholes in the boasts. From monarchies to dynastic rulers to military dictatorships to one-party governments to so-called ‘elected’ autocrats to presidents in a presidential system to the prime minister in a parliamentary democracy, every kind of government is riddled with weaknesses. A democratic government faces the added challenge of its shortcomings laid bare every day and being criticised every hour,” he said. “In a true Parliamentary democracy system, the prime minister is responsible every day to the Parliament and to the people. However, in a corroded diminished democracy, the rulers will find diverse ways to evade accountability,” he said. Chidambaram said that faced with any adversity, the weaknesses would have been exposed in due course but the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses brutally with no scope of excuses or a cover-up. The former finance minister highlighted seven challenges, including perils of centralisation in not placing orders for supply of vaccines, design, and execution of vaccination programme, resources and allocation thereof, widening of disparity among people. He said that the elimination of poverty and reducing inequalities are accepted goals among democratic countries. According to a study, 23 crore people were pushed into poverty in the last two years. He said that deprivation of school education has been the most devastating impact of the pandemic. Indian democratic governments at the Centre and the states have found no answer to this catastrophe and stand by as helpless spectators, he added. He said that rule of law requires multiple institutional support and when government institutions fail and bend before the executive or collaborate with rulers, they aid the executive to subvert the rule of law. When this happens, the energies of the rulers will be focused on self-preservation and not fighting the pandemic. The Rajya Sabha MP said that it is a challenge to make the Legislative branch work to mitigate the suffering of the people. He said that challenges to democracy are not at the national level alone. The pandemic has thrown an unusual phenomenon of vaccine nationalism. “What I make is mine, what I can afford to buy is mine,” is vaccine nationalism, he said. Chidambaram said that countries are not allowing the use of other vaccines in order to promote their vaccine. Vaccine nationalism has thrown a spanner in the wheel of global cooperation in the fight against the pandemic. Chief guest of the concluding session of the seminar and Rajya Sabha MP, Dr Vinay Prabhakar Sahasrabuddhe, said democracy is not just a matter of voting or discussion, but innovation that emerges from discussions. He said that India did not restrict freedom of ideological expression even during the pandemic, rather social media and the internet were used for the ‘test, track and treat’ policy. The media was given complete freedom even during the pandemic in the country. Assembly speaker CP Joshi said, at present, in this era of the Covid epidemic, policy decisions should be taken to reduce social inequality, strengthen economic policy and increase per capita income. He said that along with us, other countries of the world also adopted curative measures to fight this disease. No one took preventive measures. He called for the need to strengthen the preventive measures and for this, every person should discharge the duties. Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria said that this pandemic has affected the whole world and this period is most difficult for democratic countries. He said that the epidemic does not see pros and cons, religious beliefs, rich and poor. “In this difficult time, it is most important to strengthen the democratic structure with education, economic activities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-exposed-gaping-loopholes-in-boasts-chidambaram-101626444675000.html

It was a letter from the Animal Welfare Board that has been referred to concerned departments (on preventing cruelty towards animals). The letter has been interpreted in a wrong way by people... there is no ban on any sacrifice on the occasion of Eid....” said GL Sharma, director (planning), animal, sheep husbandry, and fisheries department. Muslims sacrifice livestock to commemorate Prophet Abraham’s test of faith on Eid al-Adha. A portion of the meat of the sacrificed animals is distributed among the poor over the three-day-long festival.Slaughtering cows and beef-eating is illegal or restricted across many states in India.In a communique on Thursday night, Sharma said a large number of sacrificial animals were likely to be slaughtered in Jammu & Kashmir during the festival scheduled from July 21-23. It added the Animal Welfare Board of India has requested for implementation of all precautionary measures. “...strictly implement the Animal Welfare Laws viz Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960; Transport of Animal Welfare Rules, 1978; Transport of Animals (Amendment) Rules, 2001; Slaughter House Rules, 2001; Municipal Laws & Food Safety & Standards Authority of India directions for slaughtering of animals (under which camels cannot be slaughtered) during the festival,” he said.Also Read | 78 militants neutralised by security forces this year in Kashmir: Top copSharma directed officials to take all preventive measures as per the provisions of laws cited to “stop the illegal killing of animals”. It said stringent action should be taken against the offenders violating animal welfare laws.Sharma’s clarification came as the letter provoked outrage and religious groups called it interference in religious affairs.The Muttahida Majlis-e-Ulema (MMU), an amalgam of religious bodies, issued a statement denouncing the purported ban “under the garb of prevention of cruelty”. “...why are Muslims being restricted by the government in performing their religious obligation,” the statement said.MMU said the government should desist from issuing such arbitrary orders that are unacceptable to the Muslims as “they directly infringe upon their religious freedom and personal law” and cause “great anguish”. MMU urged the government to immediately revoke the order keeping in view religious obligations and the spirit of the festival. The statement said the amalgam will convene a meeting of its key constituents and leading religious leaders to discuss the issue on Sunday.Farooq Ahmad, a businessman, said the letter is part of the efforts to dissuade people from sacrificing animals on Eid. “These efforts were also made in the past which failed. The order should be revoked as this can create misunderstanding among the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-ban-on-animal-sacrifice-in-j-k-clarifies-admin-ahead-of-eid-101626442213689.html
16-07-2021||India||SC directs states to reveal criteria for release of prisoners, no surrender for now||The Supreme Court on Friday directed that prisoners granted bail or parole as a measure to decongest jails need not surrender till further orders as the threat of the Covid-19 third wave looms large.The order was passed by a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana while dealing with a suo motu petition on containing the spread of Covid-19 in prisons. The bench also directed states to inform within a week on the criteria adopted by the various state high powered committees (HPC) to release prisoners. On May 7, when the country was in the grip of the second wave of the pandemic, the Supreme Court had said that prisoners granted bail or parole last year on the recommendation of the HPC should be released forthwith on bail on the same terms and conditions. Those on parole got a 90-day extension under the same order.The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and AS Bopanna, found an absence of any information on whether its order was complied with. The court was in the dark over whether the HPCs, constituted by a court order of March 23, 2020, had considered age and co-morbidities of prisoners to recommend release.The bench said, “There is no uniformity in the criteria to be applied. Tripura and Haryana are considering the age factors while other states have not taken into account age or co-morbidity. There is no information on how our orders are being implemented.”Since the HPC in every state/UT comprises the chairperson of state legal service authority, the chief secretary and the Director-General of Police, the court directed the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and all the states to file a report or affidavit with regard to “criteria or norms followed for release of prisoners” and “whether age or co-morbidity condition of the prisoner is being considered” in recommending release.This report has to be filed by next Friday as the Court will hear the matter next on August 3.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the court that several lawyers informed him about prisoners released on the recommendation of HPC being asked to surrender. The bench observed, “For the time being, prisoners already released shouldn’t be asked to surrender till further orders.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre supported this view. Mehta said, “The government has no objection if the release of prisoners is extended till this court finally decides.” He even supported the direction calling for criteria adopted by HPCs to release prisoners.The HPCs formed by the states and Union territories had recommended the release of those prisoners charged with crimes punishable with seven years or less sentence. The top court had left it open to the committees to consider the sentence undergone, severity of the offence, and stage of trial as relevant criteria to aid their decision.The court allowed HPCs to even consider fresh cases for release based on standard operation protocol prepared by the NALSA. On June 1 this year, as a further step to decongest prisons, the bench allowed Probation Boards to process applications for early release of prisoners based on good conduct.After the court took up suo motu the cause of prisoners in jail last year, nearly 50,000 prisoners came to be released on bail or parole. By January-February this year, when the Covid-19 wave dipped, the released prisoners were asked to surrender.Nearly 90 per cent surrendered when the court on May 7 felt that the situation had again become grim. The court said, “India has more than four lakh prison inmates. Some of the prisons in India are overburdened and are housing inmates beyond optimal capacity…decongestion is a matter concerning the health and right to life of both the prison inmates and the police personnel working there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-directs-states-to-reveal-criteria-for-release-of-prisoners-no-surrender-for-now-101626442034740.html
16-07-2021||India||Highest vaccine coverage for kids: Govt slams reports of disruption due to Covid||India has achieved 99 per cent coverage of DTP3 (three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines) in the first quarter of the year (January to March) as measured by the Health Management Information System, the Union health ministry said on Friday. The government said this is the highest DTP3 coverage so far, adding this was a result of the commitment of the Centre and public health workforce.The ministry also slammed media reports alleging lakhs of children missing their routine vaccinations due to disruptions caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease leading to increased risk of future outbreaks and deaths. It said such claims are not based on facts and do not reflect the true picture.The Centre’s statement came a day after the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) said India has the highest number of under-vaccinated or unvaccinated children worldwide at 3.5 million, an increase of 1.4 million from 2019, amid the pandemic. It also noted that over 3 million of “zero-dose children” in 2020 lived in India.The government said it is clarified that since the outbreak of the pandemic, the health ministry has been focused on maintaining essential services, including immunisation under UIP.“The ministry along with all states and Union territories and development partners have worked towards mitigating the negative impacts of Covid-19 and taken urgent actions to ensure that children receive life-saving vaccines under Universal Immunization Programme (UIP),” the ministry said.When asked about the availability of Zydus Cadila’s vaccine against the viral disease for children, the ministry said the Drugs Controller General of India is examining the matter. “More data is needed. The scientific process has to be completed.

16-07-2021||India||‘Banks can’t deny educational loans to student citing parents’ liabilities’: Kerala HC||The Kerala High Court on Thursday ruled that banks can’t deny educational loans to students citing liabilities of their parents and directed a national bank (Indian Bank) to disburse the loan applied by a meritorious student.While giving direction to the bank, the court observed that the very purpose of an educational loan is to ensure that a meritorious student can’t be deprived of an opportunity to higher education on the ground that he/she doesn’t have enough resources for the same. The petitioner, a second-year student of Bachelor of Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery, approached the court after her loan request was turned down by the bank. In her petition, she contended that she secured admission through the centralised seat allotment process of the state in 2019 on the basis of her rank in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test.She said since her family could not raise the full amount of the course she and her father approached the banks for an educational loan of ₹7,50,000 for which no collateral security is needed as per the educational loan scheme. But the bank denied her loan saying that it was not satisfied with the economic background of her parents and the amount can’t be disbursed. Doing a small-time business, her father’s shop was closed due to the pandemic restrictions and he was not earning enough income due to this, the bank reportedly told her, she mentioned it in her plea. The court said such an attitude will defeat the very purpose of the educational loan scheme. “The object of all educational loans formulated by banks in accordance with RBI guidelines is to ensure that a meritorious student shall not be deprived of the opportunity to pursue higher education merely on the ground that he/she doesn’t have sources for the same,” it observed. If the contentions of the bank are accepted it would defeat the object and purpose of the scheme, the single bench of Justice PB Suresh Kumar observed. Later, the court held that its contentions were not acceptable and directed the bank to disburse the loan to the meritorious student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-can-t-deny-educational-loans-to-student-citing-parents-liabilities-kerala-hc-101626440353336.html
16-07-2021||India||From reality to abstract: Remembering KV Subbanna||Died on 16th July 2005.He was born on 20th February 1932 in the Shimoga district of Karnataka. His family was a big supporter of art and artists that too of any and all forms. Subbanna had shown a strong sense of interest in drama since his childhood days. His father, fond of the same decided to set up a dramatic society namely Neelanakantheshwara Natya Sangha in 1949. It was set up in the Heggodu village that was near Sagar Taluk. This turned out to be one of the biggest establishments by Subbanna later.He completed his graduation from the Maharaja College of Mysore. Post his graduation he came under the influence of Shantaveri Gopala Gowda, who was a leader of the socialist movement. This inspired him to dive deep into socialist philosophy which he later practiced throughout his life. He was also made the first secretary of Lal Bahadur College that is situated in Sagar. However, the desire to expand his career in theatre and drama came after he joined the Rare Taste Club. Being a part of this club made him appreciate the many artistic works of creative personalities. He also got familiar with the works of Satyajit Ray.After this, Subbanna started working hard on the society his father established and turned it into the world-renowned theatrical group called Neenasam.Neenasam was a by-product of community effort alone and Subbanna's broad taste led him to work more and create something unique out of it. All the activities under Neenasam were an attempt to revive folklore, forgotten plays, and skits, putting up performances, and enacting many old-time classics. It slowly turned into a cultural movement by K.V Subbanna. The members together would also arrange many workshops and seminars related to theatre from time to time, all over Karnataka.It was Subbanna's strong belief in the democracy and community spirit of India that made him work tirelessly to achieve and showcase the true essence of histrionics. All thanks to Neenasam, Heggodu was always filled with activities and shows. People would eagerly wait for the new productions and not once were they disappointed. Subbanna was hence successful in rebuilding the forgotten folk-lore and Sanskrit plays.His consistent efforts in making Neenasam a prominent learning centre for theatre helped him bag many awards one being the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature, and Creative Communication Arts. (1991)Apart from that, he was also awarded the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1994. Although he was known for his contribution towards Neenasam, K.V Subbanna was also famous for his writing, translations, and publishing. He had a publishing house named Akshara Prakasna which used to publish theatrical works of literature famous in Kannada. One of its finest works up until now was the translation of the book Natyashastra by Bharata.His various works on dramas and plays won him the Sahitya Academy Award in 2003, and the Padma Shri in 2004. Despite all the success, Subbanna always remained humble and curious when it came to working. Many writers, playwrights, poets, and dramatists acclaimed him to be a person who not only revived cultural methods of literature but also a very talented man. He sadly passed away on 17th July 2005 but Neenasam still moves forward as a legacy he left behind.This was story was first published on This Day.app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-reality-to-abstract-remembering-kv-subbanna-101626439238187.html
16-07-2021||India||2 vaccine doses gave 95% protection from death against Covid-19's Delta variant: Centre||The Union health ministry of Friday cited a large-scale, real-life study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research and said that two doses of Covid-19 vaccines, irrespective of Covishield and Covaxin, were successful to extend 95 per cent protection from death. The study was conducted during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, which was driven by the Delta variant, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said.The study was done on 1,17,525 police personnel in Tamil Nadu. Among them, 17,059 received no vaccine and 20 succumbed to the infection. A total of 32,792 police personnel received only one dose and this group recorded seven deaths. Only four deaths were recorded in the third group of 67,673 people, who were vaccinated with both doses.Next 100 days crucial, says Union health ministry amid Covid 3rd wave fears"If we examine the findings, we see that one dose gave 82 per cent protection from death while two doses gave 95 per cent protection from Covid-19 death. This study was done on a high-risk population at a time when the pandemic was at its peak. And we all know that Delta was driving the peak of the second wave," Dr Paul said reiterating that vaccines are proving to be effective against Delta variant too.Delta has emerged as the latest threat in front of the world as it is believed to be driving the third wave of the pandemic, the effect of which is already being felt in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand etc.First reported in India in October 2020, Delta has now spread in over 111 countries. Scientists have found further mutations of this variant in India, which has been named Delta Plus, another variant of concern. But government's experts have recently asserted that Delta Plus is unlikely to be as transmissible and severe as Delta is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-vaccine-doses-gave-95-protection-from-death-against-covid-19-s-delta-variant-centre-101626438914786.html
16-07-2021||India||Chief ministers of southern states ask for more Covid-19 vaccines to beat third wave||Chief ministers of the southern states, during their interaction with prime minister Narendra Modi, asked to increase vaccine supply to ensure maximum protection to people before the third wave of Covid-19 strikes.Interacting with the PM through video-conferencing on Friday, the chief ministers briefed him about the steps being taken to check control of the coronavirus disease even though the cases were on the rise.In a video interaction with chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala, where many districts have been reporting a high number of cases, Modi said the country stands at a point in its battle with the pandemic where apprehensions about a third wave are being continuously expressed.These states accounted for 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases last week and 84 per cent of deaths, he noted in his closing remarks, specifically mentioning the rise in infections in Kerala and Maharashtra as a matter of grave concern for the country. A similar trend was witnessed in January and February before the second wave started, he said. “It’s very important that states with a rising number of cases take proactive measures to rule out any possibility of a third wave,” Modi said.The PM emphasised effective trace, tract and vaccination methodology and asked states to strengthen micro-containment zone strategy, which has helped some states, such as Assam, to control Covid, without lockdown. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Covid-19 situation in the state is under control. He said in Kerala, the second wave started very late and at one point its test positivity rate went up to 30 per cent but now it is around 10 per cent. The CM said the state’s mortality rate remained the lowest in the country at 0. 48 per cent.On vaccination, he said the state has given the first dose to 11.7 million people and 4.41 million people have got both doses of the total population of 3.46crore. The wastage of vaccines is almost nil, he said. He sought six million more doses to cover a major portion of the population. Kerala has been accounting for the highest number of Covid-19 cases among all states since June 15. On Thursday, it reported 13,773 new cases, almost one-fourth of the national total of 41,806. Its test positivity rate was 10.95 per cent whereas the national average was below 3 per cent. The virus has shown no sign of abating in Kerala with new daily cases hovering around 10,000 since March.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said the state managed reasonably well in fighting against the pandemic despite the lack of modern medical facilities similar to Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. He said the newly setup village/ward secretariats system has played a key role in the effective containment of Covid-19 and said 12 fever surveys have helped in containing the spread of the virus.The CM said of 17,71,580 doses that were given to private hospitals, only 4,20,209 doses have been used in the month of June. He requested the PM to allot remaining stock in private hospitals to the government so that it would help increase the vaccination process.Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa urged the PM to provide at least 1.5 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the state every month and said the Covid-19 cases in Karnataka have declined to 1,900 a day and in Bengaluru to about 400 cases a day.Stating that Karnataka has so far received 2.62 crore vaccines, the chief minister requested the PM to provide 1.5 crore doses with a targeted 5 lakh doses every day, a government statement said. Yediyurappa also told Modi that the district authorities have been authorised to impose sanctions depending on the positivity rate of Covid-19, the number of cases and the opinion of the Technical Advisory Committee. He also informed the PM about steps being taken to deal with the anticipated third wave.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin sought one crore vaccine doses as a special case and urged the PM to exempt all goods needed for Covid management from Goods and Services Tax. He also said the Centre should reconsider its decision to conduct national level exams like the NEET as it may lead to virus spread.The demand for vaccines has tremendously increased in Tamil Nadu, Stalin said.“However, when compared with other states, the allocation for our state is very less. To handle this tough situation, I had requested a special allocation of one crore vaccine doses. I look forward to your support in this important issue,” he told Modi.On July 13, Stalin said that till July 8, 2021, Tamil Nadu received only 29,18,110 vaccine doses from the Centre for people in the 18-44 years age bracket and 1,30,08,440 for the above 45 years category. The allocation was very inadequate and the state did not receive vaccines proportionate to its population.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chief-ministers-of-southern-states-ask-for-more-covid-19-vaccines-to-beat-third-wave-101626439035345.html

The principles of politics, secularism, and tolerance are being followed because of the dominance of the Hindu population. And whatever needs to be done to ensure their majority should be done,” VHP general secretary Milind Parande told journalists ahead of a meeting of the organisation’s governing council and board of trustees from Saturday.The comments came in the backdrop of plans in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam for introducing population control laws. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday last unveiled a population policy aimed at stabilising the state’s population. This came after a draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill was made public.Also Watch | Asaduddin Owaisi reacts to Yogi’s population policy for UP, cites ConstitutionParande said Hindu families should think about having at least two kids. He added even China has reversed its single-child norm though it still continues to remain the most populous country.Parande said “love jihad”, political violence in West Bengal, and freeing of temples, and monasteries from government control will be taken up at the meeting of the VHP, which is an affiliate of the ruling BJP’s ideological fountainhead, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He referred to the controversy over the alleged irregularities in land purchases related to the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and said it was created by those against its construction. “And they are doing so in view of the (assembly) elections coming up.” He said the trust overseeing the construction has responded with proof to the controversy. “...people have faith in the Trust. But these people are trying to create an impediment in the construction of the temple.”He said the Catholic Bishops Association in Kerala has also raised concerns about men deceiving women by concealing their religious identity and has written to the Union home minister about it. “In the last few years, many Christian women have been forced to convert. In Britain, too, there are about 1,500 cases of women who have become victims of love jihad and the groups that were busted were of Pakistani Muslims.”Hindu groups use the “love jihad” term to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.In response to a question whether the VHP perceives a threat to Hinduism from Islam or any other faith, he said, “There is no threat, but they are indulging in some wrongdoings. Nobody can destroy the Hindu faith. But some unconstitutional activities are taking place.” He said conversions amounted to an attack on Hinduism. “This (conversion) is being carried out by the missionaries as well as Islamic sects who divide the world into believers and non-believers.”The VHP reiterated its support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and said it has been pursuing the issue of fast-tracking citizenship under the legislation for Hindu refugees from neighbouring countries. “We have helped over 6,000 Pakistani Hindus...get citizenship... In Gujarat and Rajasthan, we took up the problem the refugees were facing in getting vaccinations...”Parande said the VHP has asked the government and human rights organisations to take note of alleged forced conversions of Hindus in Pakistan. He maintained the organisation will do whatever it takes to create awareness about the need to have a dispensation in power that believes in protecting Hindu rights. Parande said anyone who does not protect the rights of the Hindus should not be in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vhp-to-discuss-ram-temple-construction-population-policy-at-upcoming-meeting-101626436753361.html

The next hearing is set for July 30.Meanwhile, after talking to the Speaker and submitting a 68-page document to back his demand, Adhikari told the media that the BJP is planning to move court. “No law of the land is followed in Bengal. There the audio and video evidence, Twitter posts as well as statements made by people which prove that anti-defection law is applicable against Roy. Despite that, he was made chairman of the public accounts committee (PAC). The Speaker is not following established laws. We are planning to move court,” said Adhikari.

Roy is still a BJP legislator. He was made chairman of the PAC of the Bengal assembly on July 9 before the budget session came to an end. In protest, six BJP MLAs who were made chairpersons of other standing committees resigned. On Friday, the Speaker selected TMC MLAs for these posts. On June 18, Adhikari submitted a petition to the Speaker, saying Roy, the legislator from Kishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district, should be disqualified under anti-defection law. Only the Speaker can take the decision on disqualifying a member. The Constitution does not specify any time frame for the process which involves inquiry, hearings and setting up of a committee.

While one will connect Gandhinagar Capital with PM's Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, the other is a Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) service which will link Gandhinagar Capital with Varetha. PM Modi described the Gandhinagar Capital-Varanasi weekly superfast express as a service which will connect the land of Lord Somnath (Gujarat) with the land of Lord Vishwanath (Uttar Pradesh). "Major railway stations across the country are being modernised, stations in tier-2 and 3 cities are being equipped with wifi services and unmanned railway crossings have been completely removed from broad gauge lunes," he further remarked, stressing that Indian Railways needed new reforms for the 21st century, instead of continuing with the ones from the 20th century.PM Modi described the Gujarat Science City as a project which combines recreation and creativity for children. "My little friends will especially enjoy the Aquatics Gallery, which is among top aquariums in Asia. Robotics Gallery will encourage youngsters to work in the field of robotics and create curiousity among children," adding that new reforms were required in Railways in the 21st century," the prime minister said.He also revealed that when he shared pictures of Science City on his Twitter handle on Thursday, people were shocked that these pictures were from Gujarat, and not from a foreign nation.Union home minister Amit Shah, who, like PM Modi, hails from Gujarat and is the Lok Sabha MP from Gandhinagar; newly-appointed railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani also addressed the gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-inaugurates-key-projects-in-gujarat-101626433494178.html

"Leaving North and South American regions of WHO, all other WHO regions are moving from good to bad and bad to worse. The world is moving towards a third wave and this is a fact. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too has asked us to take this as a red flag... the PM has given us the target to stall the third wave and it is possible," Dr Paul said during the press briefing of the Union health ministry.Mask usage will go down in August-September, Centre warns citing projectionSpain has seen a 64% hike in weekly Covid-19 cases while the Netherlands has recorded a 300% spike in Covid-19 cases. The situation was stable in Thailand for a long time but now it is also reporting a spike. Africa too has clocked a 50% increase in Covid-19 cases, the ministry said. Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh too are now seeing an unprecedented spike, the ministry said.'We are far away from herd immunity': Dr Paul"Our population is still vulnerable. We have not reached herd immunity-- not even through infection; Not that we want to achieve herd immunity through natural infection. We are making continuous progress in vaccination. At least 50 per cent of our vulnerable population is vaccinated. So we are still vulnerable. But the situation as of now is under control and we will have to maintain this situation," Dr Paul said adding that the next 100 days will be crucial to understand whether the 3rd wave has arrived in India or not. "Waves are a post-facto evaluation of how we are managing the situation. The intensity of the waves is more important than the number of the wave. So it does not matter whether it is the 3rd wave or the 4th wave, as this is the natural interaction between virus and human being," Health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-has-given-us-a-target-to-stall-3rd-wave-and-it-s-possible-govt-expert-101626433587373.html

The special drive was conducted by the government at all government arts and science colleges on Thursday, according to a report in Tamil daily Dinakaran.However, the drive was hit by shortage with over 600 people being forced to return without receiving the vaccines. Some people have started travelling to neighbouring districts to get the doses. With the monsoon at its peak, locals have also urged the authorities to provide adequate facilities at these vaccination centres. Tokens could be provided to people who reach the vaccination centers as early as 7am, they said. The shortage of vaccines for those scheduled to receive their second dose is more prevalent in some districts like Tirunelveli.Meanwhile, another Tamil daily, Dinamalar, reported the state has received another consignment of 6,93,210 doses of Covaxin and Covishield vaccines from the central government. The allotment came days after chief minister MK Stalin wrote to the Centre appealing for one crore vaccine doses as compensatory allocation to the state. State health minister Ma Subramanian also met his Union counterpart Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday and made the demand in person.Later during the day, 91,580 doses of Covaxin arrived from Hyderabad in a flight. The Covishield consignment numbering 6,01,630 doses was sent from Serum Institute in a flight from Pune to Chennai. The vaccine doses were collected by the state health officials and were taken to the state government godown at Teynampet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-brave-rains-in-tamil-nadu-for-covid-vaccines-but-shortage-hits-drive-101626433507656.html

With the resumption of activities, mask usage is declining, joint secretary of the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said during the weekly press meet of the ministry.In a graph, which projected the decline in mask usage, it was revealed that mask usage spiked during March-April and reached its peak in May, which witnessed the peak of the second wave, but now the trend has been on a steady decline in June and July. As projected, the usage of masks will decline further, against which the government warned."We have to guard against this decline projected in this analysis," Lav Agarwal said.Earlier, the ministry cited four reasons why people avoid masks and said that people are refusing to wear masks complaining of breathing problems, discomfort, while many believe that masks do not help in the prevention of Covid-19 and also mask is not required if social distancing is maintained.Amid the growing apprehension of a third wave in India, which has already set its footprints in other countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday interacted with the chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala, the states which are still reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases. "It's very important that states with a rising number of cases take proactive measures to rule out any possibility of a third wave," PM Modi said adding that a similar trend was witnessed in January and February before the second wave started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-usage-will-go-down-in-august-september-centre-warns-citing-projection-101626432526159.html

The train services were suspended after the second wave of coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic started raging in both the states. Tamil Nadu announced a statewide lockdown from May 10, while Karnataka also announced similar curbs as cases started peaking during that time.With the situation improving, both the states are in the process of easing restrictions and resuming MEMU services are part of the unlocking measures. Post-lockdown, the MEMU train departed from Krantivira Sangoli Rayanna (KSR) Bengaluru city junction at 9.25 am on Thursday and reached Hosur at 11 am. The 16-coach MEMU can transport as many as 1,500 passengers at a time and charges ₹20 to commute between Bengaluru and Hosur.

Reinfections and breakthrough infections are not uncommon; as several such cases have been reported during the second wave of the pandemic. While natural immunity which develops after getting the infection once is likely to protect for 10 to 11 months, studies are on to find out how long vaccine-induced immunity stays.For this study, ICMR collected 677 clinical samples of individuals who have been partially or fully vaccinated but have again contracted the infection.Here are the top 10 findings:1. Majority (Over 86 per cent)of the breakthrough infections have been caused by the Delta variant.2. Only 9.8 per cent of such cases (breakthrough) required hospitalisation.3. Fataity was observed in only 0.4 per cent of cases.4. The study found that Alpha was predominant behind reinfection in the northern region.5. Delta and Kappa mainly caused breakthrough infections in the southern, western, eastern and north-western regions.6. Around 71% of these breakthrough infections were symptomatic and 29% was asymptomatic. The symptoms included fever, nausea, cough, sore throat etc. A smaller proportion reported a loss of smell and taste. Only 6 per cent reported breathlessness.7. Vaccine has effectively reduced Covid-19 severity and the number of hospitalisation, the study confirmed.8. Vaccine alone, however, may not be a protection against contracting the infection as out of the 677 patients whose samples were studied, 85 got infected after taking the first dose. The rest 592 received both the doses and then got infected.9. Though this is not a study on the effect of the vaccines, it has been noted that among these 677, 604 received Covishield, 71 Covaxin and two received China's Sinopharm vaccine.10. The study also noted that between March and June, there was "high community transmission" of the Delta variant of the infection, followed by Alpha and Kappa variants.The samples were collected from 17 states and Union territories, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Puducherry, New Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-major-reason-for-covid-breakthrough-infection-10-findings-of-icmr-study-101626423383435.html

This would mean that 10 to 20 years later, the cattle breed will be only cows, and no bulls," Sarma said.The use of sex-sorted semen allows the sex of the offspring to be pre-determined.According to a report in PTI, Sarma invoked figures of Hindu mythology to suggest that historically cows have been more in number than bulls because of the benefits one can derive from them. "If we look at Hindu parampara or ancient history, there is reference only to female cattle, like Kamdhenu, and how we were benefited with milk. That means there must have been something which ensured that cows were more in number than bulls," the chief minister said.Also Read: Assam’s cow protection law move raises concerns in MeghalayaSarma also announced plans to construct cow shelters in tea garden areas to house seized cattle safely. He said the cow dung collected from the seized cattle can be used as fertilisers in the tea gardens.The chief minister made these comments during a discussion on a special mention brought by All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) legislator Aminul Islam.Sarma had tabled the Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, in the state assembly on the first day of the Budget session. The legislation seeks to ban the transport of cattle from any place within Assam to places outside the state “where slaughter of cattle is not regulated by law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-kamdhenu-assam-to-use-sex-sorted-semen-to-breed-only-cows-no-bulls-101626420168204.html

Dr Rajendra KV, the deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, alerted the medical corps of the district during an emergency meeting held in his office. He instructed the officials to screen as many people as possible entering Karnataka from Kerala for fever and other symptoms that the Zika virus manifests, according to the newspaper.More precautionary measures have been directed by Rajendra to curb the spreading of Zika virus. Those having symptoms similar to that of Chikungunya and Dengue should also be asked to go to the nearest hospital and report the symptoms, he said. The senior official said that the health department will also have to record the travel history of those with symptoms of Zika. Simple diagnosis like blood tests must be conducted on people with symptoms of the disease, he also said.The health department has been directed to inform and instruct people to control breeding of mosquitoes in and around their houses. Things like old tyres, empty discarded vessels or anything that is capable of gathering rain water or wastewater should be cleared. Zika is a vector borne disease and is carried usually by the day biting mosquito called Aedes Aegypti. They breed in freshly collected water, said the socio medical health workers.Dr. Rajendra said hundreds of people travel every day to Mangaluru, Puttur and Sullia cacross the border of both the states and that there are chances of them carrying the virus into Karnataka.Mangaluru gets around 1200 to 1600 visitors every day from Kasargod, Kannur and other places for business, health, work and education related works.

16-07-2021||India||UK’s largest warship enters Indian Ocean, to conduct exercises with Indian Navy||The UK’s largest warship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its strike task group has sailed into the Indian Ocean region, where it will conduct joint exercises with the Indian Navy as part of Britain’s efforts to enhance its profile in the Indo-Pacific. Britain has described the maiden voyage of HMS Queen Elizabeth and its task group as the country’s most ambitious naval deployment for two decades, and the warships will also sail to the South China Sea for military drills with the US Navy and Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force. UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Friday the carrier group’s deployment “marks the start of a new era of defence cooperation with allies in India and the Indo-Pacific”. He added, “By visiting 40 countries and working alongside our partners, the UK is standing up for democratic values, seizing new trading opportunities and tackling the shared threats we face together.” “This deployment will provide tangible reassurance and security to the UK’s friends and a credible deterrence to those who seek to undermine global security,” the British high commission said in a statement. The carrier group entered the Indian Ocean region after a series of engagements and operations in the Mediterranean. The 65,000-tonne carrier will participate in the Konkan exercise with warships of the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal. The drills are expected to be conducted around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with the involvement of Indian destroyers, submarines and P8I anti-submarine warfare aircraft. On its way back to the UK later in the year, the carrier group is expected to join another tri-services exercise with the Indian military in the Arabian Sea in October. All three services are expected to participate in this three-day war game. Britain said HMS Queen Elizabeth’s deployment represents the country’s commitment to deeper diplomatic, economic and security ties with India and in the Indo-Pacific region, and also demonstrates the UK’s support for freedom of passage through vital trading routes and for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific. Defence secretary Ben Wallace said: “The UK carrier strike group deployment is a major moment for UK defence as we develop this cutting edge capability across the globe. The group is sailing the Indian Ocean and will shortly conduct exercises with the Indian Navy, building on our already strong partnership with an important ally and friend.” The deployment reflects the UK’s commitment to strengthening existing alliances and forging new partnerships with like-minded countries to face the challenges of the 21st century, he added. The carrier group sailed into the Indian Ocean shortly after the UK’s posted its first international liaison officer at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) in Gurugram. The US, Australia, France and Japan also have a presence at the centre, which tracks shipping and monitors threats such as maritime terrorism and piracy in regional waters. Lieutenant Commander Stephen Smith, who was posted at the centre last month, works with India’s armed forces and liaison officers from the other nations to enhance maritime domain awareness in the region. As part of its maiden operational deployment, the UK carrier group will sail more than 26,000 nautical miles and engage with 40 countries from the Mediterranean to the Indo-Pacific and back again. The carrier group’s presence in Indian waters will give the Indian military an opportunity to assess first-hand the capabilities of its fifth generation F-35B Lightning multi-role aircraft, which are jointly manned by the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and US Marine Corps. The carrier group also serves as the spearhead of the UK’s joint expeditionary capability and a cornerstone of the country’s conventional military deterrent. The group includes six Royal Navy ships and a submarine, a US Navy destroyer, a frigate from the Netherlands and 32 aircraft, and is manned by 3,700 sailors, aviators and marines from the combined forces of the UK, US and the Netherlands. HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest surface vessel constructed in the UK. Taller than the Niagara Falls, her propellers generate the power of 50 high-speed trains. Among the countries with which the UK carrier group will have engagements in the region are Singapore, South Korea and Japan, and these interactions will build on other efforts by Britain to enhance its profile in the Indo-Pacific. These efforts include seeking Asean dialogue partner status, negotiations to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and trade talks with Australia, New Zealand and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uks-largest-warship-enters-indian-ocean-to-conduct-exercises-with-indian-navy-101626419172785.html
16-07-2021||India||DMK MP Kanimozhi recommends lowering penalties on fishermen||Dravida Munnetra Kazhgam MP K Kanimozhi recommended lowering the penalties imposed on fishermen, during a virtual meeting with union fisheries minister Parshottam Rupala. The union minister held a meeting with the Members of Parliament from coastal areas to get their views on the Indian Marine Fisheries Bill, 2021.“The penalties proposed under Schedule II of the bill for Indian fishing vessels are too high for fishermen to bear. Since it is their livelihood, the higher penalty will impact them severely and, in some cases, it may force them to give up fishing. Hence, the penalties may be reduced to a lower amount,” Kanimozhi recommended in the meeting.The lowering of penalties was one of nine recommendations made by the Thoothukudi MP. She recommended a transfer of rule-making power from the Central government to respective state governments.

This will lead to unnecessary harassment of fishermen at the hands of authorised officers,” a press note from the MP read.The Indian Marine Fisheries Bill 2021 is one of the 23 bills the Modi government intends to table in the upcoming monsoon Parliamentary session, scheduled to commence on Monday. This bill will repeal the Maritime Zones of India (Regulation of Fishing by Foreign Vessels) Act, 1981. It shall also provide for the sustainable development of fisheries resources in the exclusive Economic Zone of India and promote the livelihoods of small-scale and artisanal fishers and related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-mp-kanimozhi-recommends-lowering-penalties-on-fishermen-101626417012789.html

The government will have to reply by Monday on which date the case will again be heard.A bench led by Justice RF Nariman, which took a suo moto cognisance of the case based on "alarming newspaper report", noted that the matter concerns everyone and goes at the very heart of Article 21. "The health of citizens of India and right to life is paramount. All other sentiments -- be in religious-- are subservient to this basic fundamental right," the bench noted.The bench also mentioned the fear of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and as the Uttar Pradesh government defended the decision of holding the yatra for a few people, the bench said, "Either we can pass orders, or give you an opportunity to reconsider holding yatra physically at all."The Uttar Pradesh government told the Apex Court that the yatra will be symbolic and only a few people will take part in it, while the solicitor general said the state government can make arrangements to make gangajal available for the devotees.The Kanwar Yatra became a contentious issue this year after the Uttarakhand government cancelled the yatra in view of the possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the second year that the yatra remains suspended. However, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to go on with a symbolic procession of the pilgrims starting from July 25.Kanwar Yatra is a procession of devotees of Shiva who walk barefoot with pitchers hanging from Kanwars (slings) on their shoulders. They get water from the Ganga River from sacred places mostly falling in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Then they carry the water back to their native places. The water is used for worshipping Shiv Lingams.After the Uttarakhand government cancelled the yatra and the Uttar Pradesh governmenyt did not, the Supreme Court took a cognisance of the issue. The Indian Medical Association's Uttarakhand chapter had written to Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami requesting him to suspend the annual yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-complete-ban-sc-asks-up-govt-to-reconsider-kanwar-yatra-decision-101626416281697.html

However, considering religious sentiments, the governments should develop a system to make the sacred water available via tankers at designated locations, it said according to a report by news agency ANI.The Centre said the state governments must also ensure that distribution of water from the Ganga among devotees and rituals by such devotees in the nearby Shiv temples take place while mandatorily ensuring social distancing norms, wearing of masks and adhering to all steps required to contain the spread of the viral disease.The Supreme Court had sought responses from the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government on the matter as it took suo motu cognisance of the Yogi Adityanath administration’s decision to allow the Kanwar yatra from July 25 amid the pandemic.A bench, headed by Justice RF Nariman, had referred to a statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that not even a bit of compromise can be made on containment of the pandemic and said citizens were perplexed about the fact that the UP government has given a go-ahead to the the annual pilgrimage.The Centre further informed the court that tankers be available at identified and designated locations so that nearby devotees can collect such Ganga Jal and do 'abhishek' at their nearest Shiv temples.Recently, the Uttarakhand government had cancelled the yatra, citing an imminent third wave of the coronavirus disease that has claimed thousands of lives across the country.UP’s Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh said on Thursday his government will look into the directions issued by the Supreme Court over the Kanwar Yatra and will ensure that Covid protocols are followed during the annual pilgrimage.Every year, thousands of 'Kanwariyas' (mostly young devotees of Lord Shiva) from the northern states travel on foot or by other means to collect water from the River Ganga at Haridwar and Rishikesh to offer at Shiva temples in their areas as part of the yatra during the Hindu month of 'Saavan' (July and August).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-mustn-t-allow-kanwar-yatra-but-make-ganga-jal-available-centre-in-sc-101626415427832.html

16-07-2021||India||'Covid 3rd wave can be bigger than second if...': What AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said||Amid apprehension of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, regarding which several mathematical predictions, projections are going around, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that there might be many scenarios of the possible third wave if it comes. If all restrictions are lifted and a variant is able to escape immunity, then the next wave can be bigger than the second wave, Dr Guleria said, citing one possibility as projected by an IIT mathematical model.If there is a balance between restrictions and reopening, with some restriction remaining in place, the impact will not be as huge as it was during the second wave, provided the virus also remains stable, Dr Guleria said."One such model from an IIT shows that if all restrictions are lifted and if a virus (variant) is also able to escape immunity then the next wave can be bigger than the second wave. If some restrictions are kept and the virus also remains stable then cases will not be much and if we keep more restrictions then cases will further reduce," he said.Explaining what may strengthen the third wave, Dr Guleria listed three factors including waning immunity, the emergence of a more transmissible variant, and lockdown relaxations as the possible reasons. In the case of waning immunity, individuals who have been exposed to the virus before again come to the susceptible state if they remain unvaccinated, once the natural immunity subsides.'Vaccines can be tweaked'Dr Guleria said that as evident for the third wave in other countries, vaccines are working, as the rate of hospitalisation has come down. He also said that available vaccines can be tweaked after detailed studies, if new variants emerge.Covid 3rd wave in IndiaThe overall Covid-19 situation in India is improving steadily with daily news infections falling, but a spike is being observed in pockets -- like in the northeastern states and in Kerala. Maharashtra's Covid-19 graph has hit a plateau. The jury is still out on whether these are the early signs of a third wave, while the government has been repeatedly cautioning people against crowding.

The sub-lineages, AY.1 and AY.2, of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) are declining globally, with near-zero cases in the last week of June in the UK and the US where they were most frequently detected, according to the summary of the cumulative data based on whole genome sequencing of Covid-19 positive cases released by the department of biotechnology, government of India, on July 9. Also Read | India reports 38,949 new Covid-19 cases, 542 more fatalities“They also continue to be below 1% in available sequences from June in India. It is likely that neither AY.1 nor AY.2 is more transmissible than Delta. There are no indications of rising trend in the four clusters (in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon in Maharashtra, Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and Chennai in Tamil Nadu),” said the bulletin. A new sub-lineage AY.3 has been identified, which has primarily been detected in the US with single reclassified cases in UK and India. However, there are no known significant properties of this mutation, but since it is a Delta variant of concern sub-lineage, Insacog will continue to monitor it. Meanwhile, scientists have found that the proportion of known variants of concern that are in circulation in India remain unchanged from the preceding week. Delta is the dominant lineage for new cases across all parts of India in recent samples and remains the most rapidly rising lineage globally. New data points to efficacy of vaccination against severe disease by the Delta variant. Among other known variants, alpha variant prevalence has declined further in India and globally. Beta is also at very low levels in India at this time. Gamma and Lambda are not seen in over 10,000 community samples sequenced by Insacog since May. “In summary, Delta variant and its sub-lineages are the only VOC in India at this time. Continuing outbreaks across India are attributable to Delta, susceptible population, and opportunities for transmission. Public health measures to reduce transmission and vaccination remain critical,” said the bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-sub-lineages-unlikely-to-be-more-contagious-than-delta-itself-insacog-101626412032416.html

Tamil Nadu transport minister RS Rajakannappan said that 7.8 million women availed themselves of this free travel in three days, reported Tamil Daily Dinamalar. On average 2.8 million women are travelling free every day, Rajakannappan said.The DMK government after taking charge announced the free bus travel scheme for women in the ordinary buses operated by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC). Rajakannappan said the scheme has been received well among the people and that the department is also considering bus services wherever necessary.Giving details of the women passengers, the minister said that 7.8 million women travelled free from July 12 to July 15. In addition to that, as many as 5,741 transwomen, 51,615 differently-abled people, and 8,396 of their companions travelled free in the transport corporation buses. Under the ‘Nirbhaya scheme’, the state government is planning to install CCTV cameras in 2,500 state government buses soon for which ₹70 crore fund has been set aside. Out of the sanctioned fund, the department has received ₹41 crore and the project is underway, Rajakannappan said.The transport minister said that the skyrocketing fuel price is bleeding the transport corporation which is running under the loss of ₹33,000 crore already. Diesel price was ₹68 per litre in 2018 and inflating fuel prices worsened the financial situation of the transport corporations. The objective of the government is not to profit but to provide affordable bus services to people. The fare when compared to other states is very low in Tamil Nadu and bus services are aimed at the last leg connectivity, he said.The bus services to the Union territory of Puducherry resumed after the lockdown norms eased in the state. Karnataka government’s request for resuming bus services is under consideration, Rajakannappan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-7-8-million-women-availed-of-free-bus-travel-in-3-days-101626408935369.html

In past, she was mostly seen moving in a wheelchair because of multiple injuries that she alleged was inflicted on her when she was in jail.This year too, Sadhvi Pragya's health deteriorated following which she was airlifted to Mumbai. But of late, she has been seen moving without wheelchair. As seen in the videos earlier shared by Narendra Saluja, she played basketball as she went to attend a meeting at a stadium in Bhopal, and also danced at the wedding that she arranged at her place for two sisters whom she considers her daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sadhvi-pragya-gets-vaccinated-at-home-congress-asks-this-question-101626407556577.html

Next year’s assembly elections in UP are also crucial for the party in view of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where it is seeking to come to power in the Centre for a third straight term.In the 2017 assembly elections in UP, the BJP won 325 of the 403 seats, the Samajwadi Party and its allies, which included the Congress party, won 54 seats while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won only 19 seats.This time, the SP and the BSP have ruled out forging any major alliance. On the other hand, Congress has also decided to fight the elections alone and is looking to make a comeback in Uttar Pradesh after more than three decades.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-to-chair-up-bjp-working-committee-meeting-today-2022-polls-top-agenda-101626403205838.html

Officials have already been instructed to enforce appropriate behaviour in the temple premises, including the use of masks, sanitisers and proper social distancing in accordance with the Covid-19 safety guidance issued by the central and state governments.Lord Ayappa temple in Kerala's Sabarimala would be opened for its monthly puja rituals from July 17 to 21, said officials familiar with the matter. Although the temple kept opening for a couple of days every month for monthly rituals even during the Covid-19 necessitated lockdown, devotees were not permitted for a darshan at the hill shrine.The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), the top body in the southern state which manages over 1,200 temples, ensured that shrines under its management would not permit devotees in its premises during the lockdown period. However, daily rituals were conducted without fail, according to TDB authorities in the know.The Sabarimala temple has imposed a number of conditions for devotees wishing to attend the monthly rituals on its premises from Friday onwards. No more than 5,000 devotees, who have booked their slots through the online queue, will be allowed for the darshan. Moreover, only those pilgrims who can produce their negative RT-PCR Covid-19 test reports issued within the past 48 hours will be able to enter the temple premises, said TDB officials.Sabarimala temple will be closed once again as soon as the monthly puja rituals end on July 21.Kerala reported as many as 13,773 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday and a high test positivity rate (TPR) of 10.95, according to the data released by the state's health ministry. The state also reported 87 deaths, taking total fatalities to 15,025 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-temple-to-open-for-monthly-rituals-from-today-but-conditions-apply-101626396965725.html

Details here||Schools in Haryana will be gradually resuming offline classes for students from today (Friday, July 16), according to an order issued by the state government last week. While students of classes 9 to 12 will be able to attend their classes from Friday itself, the schools for classes 6 to 8 will be resuming from July 23, the chief minister's office (CMO) in Haryana announced earlier.Also Read | Haryana: Colleges, universities to reopen for doubt clearing classesThe decision to resume offline classes for students in standards 1 to 5 has not yet been taken, although state education minister Kanwar Pal said that the government is mulling over its options for the same.Haryana schools will be reopening from July 16 as per government orders, the CMO made the announcement last Friday on its official Twitter handle. The tweet read, “Haryana government has decided to open all the schools in the state for classes 9 to 12 from July 16 and for classes 6 to 8 from July 23.”हरियाणा सरकार ने प्रदेश के सभी स्कूलों को कक्षा 9 से 12 के लिए 16 जुलाई से तथा कक्षा 6 से 8 के लिए 23 जुलाई से खोलने का निर्णय लिया है।Schools in Haryana, following their reopening, have been instructed to strictly adhere to all coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related protocols. Officials must enforce appropriate behaviour in the school premises, including the use of face masks, sanitisers, and maintaining social distancing, according to the guidelines issued by the Union education ministry and the Union ministry of home affairs.Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal, while announcing the reopening of schools in the state, had said that the decision to attend offline classes is completely voluntary and depends on the parents if they want to send their children for the classes. Meanwhile, offline classes will continue as usual for those who do not want to physically attend their classes. Students who do not attend the offline classes will not be marked 'absent', the minister clarified.Meanwhile, Congress has upped its attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the state over its decision to reopen the schools. Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Selja Kumari indicated that resuming offline classes is irresponsible ahead of a potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government, on the other hand, has said that if a dire situation arises, the decision to stop the classes will be taken immediately since the lives of students are of paramount importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-schools-to-resume-offline-classes-for-classes-9-12-from-today-details-here-101626394697513.html
16-07-2021||India||Covid-19 third wave likely by August-end, will be less severe than second: ICMR||Covid-19 third wave may hit India at the end of August and will not be as deadly as the second one, a top doctor has told a television news channel. "There would be a nationwide third wave but that does not mean that it would be as high or as intense as the second wave," Dr Samiran Panda, the head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, told NDTV.Samiran Panda also listed four things that could lead to the third wave of Covid-19, including a drop in the immunity among people against the coronavirus disease acquired in the first and second waves of the pandemic. "If that goes down, it could lead to a third wave," Panda told NDTV.He also said that there could be a variant of the coronavirus that can bypass the acquired immunity and if the new variant doesn't do that it can circulate fast in the population. The Covid-19 third wave could also be brought about by the premature easing of Covid-19 curbs by states, Panda said.Also read | PM Modi to meet chief ministers of six states today, review Covid-19 situation"I'm not expecting any more public health havoc from the Delta variant," Panda told NDTV when asked if Delta Plus could bring on the third wave.Panda's comments come as Dr Randeep Guleria, All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) director, said on Thursday that a possible third wave of Covid-19 can be precipitated by waning immunity among people, the emergence of a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus and relaxations by governments in lockdown curbs.Also read | Strong immune response in mixed jab: StudiesDr Guleria said that several studies and models have been conducted to project the possible third wave's trajectory under different scenarios. "One such model from an IIT shows that if all restrictions are lifted and if a virus (variant) is also able to escape immunity then the next wave can be bigger than the second wave. If some restrictions are kept and the virus also remains stable then cases will not be much and if we keep more restrictions then cases will further reduce," he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Indian Medical Association said earlier this week the third wave is "inevitable and imminent" and urged state governments to disallow large gatherings as these could become “potential super spreader” events.“However, it is painful to note that in this crucial time, when everyone needs to work for the mitigation of the third wave, in many parts of the country, both governments and the public are complacent and engaged in mass gatherings without following Covid protocols,” IMA said in a statement on July 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-third-wave-likely-by-august-end-will-be-less-severe-than-second-icmr-101626393998676.html

These states -- Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, and Maharashtra -- have seen a marked rise in Covid-19 cases across several districts in the recent past.Also Read | At Covid-19 review meet with northeast states, PM Modi shows concern over tourist rushThe Prime Minister's interaction with the chief ministers of these six states will come close in the heels of a similar virtual meet of his with the chief ministers of northeastern territories earlier on Tuesday. There, Prime Minister Modi had expressed his concerns over the influx of unmasked tourists at hill stations and marketplaces, calling for greater emphasis on micro-containment zones."The number of Covid-19 cases is rising," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, addressing the chief ministers present at the meet, "We need to take strict action to curb the situation at the micro-level."Prime Minister Modi also said that officials need to keep an eye out for the various Covid-19 variants which are currently being studied by experts. "We need to keep an eye on each Covid-19 variant. Timely prevention and treatment are very important in such a dynamic situation," he had said.The Prime Minister's meet on Friday is expected to focus on the overall Covid-19 situation and review the vaccination progress in six states -- Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, and Maharashtra. As many as 73.4% of the new Covid-19 cases in India have been reported from these states, barring Kerala, the central government said earlier this week.

"The Covishield allocation for July is 2.5 million doses while we require at least 2.83 million doses for the second dose this month," Odisha health secretary PK Mohapatra had said, adding that the vaccination drive would only start after the next consignment of the Covishield doses arrived.Tamil Nadu, too, reported facing an incessant vaccine shortage earlier last week. On Saturday, 18 districts had no vaccines left. By Sunday night, five-lakh doses of Covishield were sent, patching the situation up for a while.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-chief-ministers-of-six-states-today-review-covid-19-situation-101626392955953.html

It is incumbent upon the international community and the Security Council, in particular, to continue to provide support to Libya in this critical phase,” he saidShringla will participate in two high-level events in UNSC to be held under the current French Presidency.

16-07-2021||India||Bengaluru institute where Stan Swamy spent 16 years remembers activist’s legacy||At the Indian Social Institute in Bengaluru where Father Stan Swamy spent 16 years of his life working, a large gathering congregated on Thursday to share stories of the soft-spoken man, who raised his voice for the voiceless. Father Stan Swamy, a tribal rights activist arrested in the Elgar Parishad case last year, passed away at a private hospital in Mumbai on July 5.He was arrested on October 8, 2020 by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which alleged that the priest had Maoist connections and was working for frontal organisations of the banned CPI (Maoist). He was charged under the UAPA and was sent to Taloja jail. In his defence, Swamy said evidence against him was fabricated and that he never conspired to foment violence.An urn containing the ashes of the activist was kept at the centre, standing next to it, his friends and family shared stories of anguish and made calls for action.“Whenever we were in Ranchi, thatha would call my mother and tell her to keep idly batter ready. He wouldn’t spend more than two days with us, but when he stayed, he used to tell us endlessly about struggles of the adivasis (tribals) he was working with,” said Sheeba, Stan Swamy’s grandniece.Recollecting her last meeting with Stan Swamy, she said that she had asked him to stay back in Bengaluru when he had come for a visit. “When he had come in 2019, he told us about what was going on in the case. We asked why he can’t take the backseat and stay back in here, away from all problems. He said he wants to be with his people,” Sheeba added.Dr Joseph Xavier, the current director of the institute said that Stan Swamy believed in standing for truth and justice, even at the cost of pain. “Stan has created the wave. People are not questioning the government,” Dr Xavier said.“He lived and died for what he believed in,” said Bengaluru archbishop Peter Machado. “Stan, although dead, may come alive in us. . Even though he wanted to free those who were jailed unjustly, he was made prisoner. But he freed several minds.”Salil Shetty, a human rights activist, who was the Secretary-General of Amnesty International, quoted Brazilian Catholic archbishop Hélder Câmara: “If you feed the poor, you are a saint. But if you ask why the poor are hungry, you are communist.” Shetty said Fr Stan was neither a saint nor a communist. “He was a patriot. He was much more patriotic than the people who called him a traitor,” he added.Why did the Indian state treat Fr Stan so cruelly? The answer is in the dignity Fr Stan showed during his interrogation, said Babu Mathew is former Registrar and faculty at National Law School of India University.“In my reflection, whether guilty or not, they (government agencies) expect everyone to cringe before them. When they interrogated Fr Stan for 15 hours, he didn’t cringe before them. That’s why he was kept in judicial custody without ever being questioned again. He was denied medicines, warm clothes and even bail,” said Mathew.“Fr Stan was a good social analyst. He was not a Maoist, he was a Gandhian and organic intellectual,” Mathew said. “He took used RTI (Right to Information) and approached the courts for the adivasis. In one instance, translated a Supreme Court order which said whoever owns the land, owns what is underneath it and circulated among the Adivasi. How is Maoist activity,” he asked.Arvind Narrain who is a founding member of the Alternative Law Forum pointed out that how Stan Swamy’s case, the government and the judiciary violated his right to live. Mathew made a call for the best minds in society to fight and prove Fr Stan’s innocence.In a short tribute, Shujayathulla E, facilitator of programs at Indian Social Institute shared a short anecdote. “We were supposed to attend a protest, by the time we reached there the protest was over. Then we were told that a group of students were protesting the Mayura circle, so we went there. As we reached, they started playing the state anthem. As I didn’t hear the announcement and started walking, Fr Stan stopped me and asked me to wait until the anthem is over,” she said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-institute-where-stan-swamy-spent-16-years-remembers-activist-s-legacy-101626374530333.html
16-07-2021||India||Anti-cattle slaughter law: K’taka approves setting up of gaushalas in every district||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Thursday approved setting up of gaushala’s or cow shelters across the state as part of the anti-cattle slaughter law. “The cabinet has approved to put up gaushala’s in every district,” Basvaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs said in Bengaluru on Thursday. In the first phase an amount of ₹15 crore will be earmarked for the project which, the minister said, will be increased in subsequent phases. In February, when the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill-2020 was passed amid huge commotion and opposition in the upper house of the state legislature, Bommai had stated that the government will increase capacity of its existing 184 cattle shelters from around 50,000 currently to 200,000. He added that more such schemes will be announced in the upcoming budget that takes away the burden of maintaining non-milching and other cattle. The development comes even as the Karnataka high court continues to hear multiple petitions, challenging the bill that proposes to almost entirely stop cattle slaughter in a state where farmers have seen a sharp decline in income due to falling prices of produce and are dealing with the extremes in weather, alternating between floods and droughts in the calamity-prone state. The Yediyurappa government introduced the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill-2020, now an act, which was subsequently passed in the legislative council in February this year. The anti-cattle slaughter act is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) attempt to bring in legislation in line with its core-ideology, according to at least two legislators aware of the developments. The Yediyurappa government had already promulgated the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance that widens existing provisions for punishment on killing of cattle. The bill also has a provision to safeguard those “acting in good faith” which activists fear would give rise to vigilantism. The new laws penalise people who slaughter cattle below the age of 13-years with a jail term of 3-5 years and fines ranging from ₹50,000- ₹10 lakhs. In a statement on June 9 last month, the chief minister’s office (CMO), stated that cattle that are too old to work can continue to produce fuel, manure and biogas as a way to counter arguments against the viability of retaining old and ailing cattle. Between 2015-16 till 2019-20, the government said that nearly 1.3 million cattle like bulls and bullocks had been killed for various reasons including meat. The government has argued that the cattle population has dropped drastically in the last eight years. According to the 19th livestock census in 2012, there were 9516,484 to 8469,004 in 2019 (20th livestock census). It had also added that the population of the indigenous cattle is 1,254,206 (Hallikar and Amritmahal) and both male and female are used for drought purposes. Beef produced in Karnataka is sent to neighbouring Kerala and Goa among other places and the ban resulted in an acute shortage in these states. Karnataka exported around $2.5 million worth of beef in 2019-20 to UAE, Qatar and other countries, according to government data. Leather exports from Karnataka account for around $8.25 million, Hindustan Times reported in February this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticattle-slaughter-law-k-taka-approves-setting-up-of-gaushalas-in-every-district-101626374469068.html

16-07-2021||India||Crime branch detains 38 foreigners for staying illegally in Bengaluru||Bengaluru: After a city-wide crackdown against rowdies, Bengaluru police on Thursday morning raided the homes of foreigners living in Bengaluru. According to the Central Crime Branch (CCB) raids were conducted in several parts of the city and were based on specific inputs. During the raids, 38 foreigners were detained for not having valid documents and seven were detained on charges of overstaying. “The officials also found marijuana and 90 ecstasy pills from two foreigners. They have been arrested,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). 65 homes were searched by a team of six ACPs, 20 police inspectors and over 100 police constables, read a statement from the CCB. The raids come after Bengaluru police had announced that it will book house owners if tenants were found involved in narcotics cases. The top brass of the city police had issued directions to all police stations, after several instances of landlords not verifying documents of foreign nationals before renting out their property had come to the fore. “In many cases, this is done with the knowledge that they were staying illegally, in order to get more rent,” said a senior CCB official. As many as 70 foreign nationals were arrested in 2020 under Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS) in comparison to 44 in 2018 and 38 in 2019. The number of arrested persons in 2020 under the NDPS Act increased by 200% last year. According to the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), Bengaluru, there are more than 800 foreigners overstaying in the city. In a recent case, after two Nigerian nationals were arrested for possession of 55 grams of cocaine worth ₹4.7 lakh, police tracked down the owner of their house in Ramamurthy Nagar. A notice was issued to them asking for information about the duo’s visa and passport details collected while renting out the premises. 15 more landlords in east Bengaluru have been issued similar notices, said SD Sharanappa, deputy commissioner of police, east. In 2019, the Karnataka government had constructed a detention centre in the outskirts of Bengaluru after home minister Basavaraj Bommai told the Karnataka assembly that a survey of illegal foreigners will be conducted and those found violating the norms, would be lodged here before deportation. Located in Sondekoppa village near Nelamangala in Bengaluru Rural district, this is the first detention centre to be opened in the state. The facility has detained 30-40 people till now. However, a police officer said the police department wants to deport them at the earliest than filing charge sheets against them. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior police officer said that filing a case would require those overstaying, especially those caught for drug trafficking, to remain in the city. “If a charge sheet is filed and they are sent to court, they have to remain in the city till the case is over. In case they come out of bail, they would continue to indulge in criminal activities. So, we have been proposing to deport them at the earliest after dropping charges and blacklisting them from entering the country again,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crime-branch-detains-38-foreigners-for-staying-illegally-in-bengaluru-101626374228821.html
16-07-2021||India||Kerala’s Covid-19 woes continue, 13k new cases||Kerala has again bucked the national trend, reporting 13,773 new cases on Thursday with a high test positivity rate (TPR) of 10.95, according to the data released by the state health ministry. The state also reported 87 deaths, taking total fatalities to 15,025. In last 24 hours, the country reported 41,806 new cases with a TPR below 3 per cent. The state has been contributing the highest number of cases since June 15. In last one week, average cases in the state were 12,000 and TPR 10.2, almost one-third of the total caseload of the country, statistics show. The state’s contribution to the national numbers has risen steadily even as the national numbers started to slide two months ago. The state’s different virus pattern and slow progression rate have baffled medical experts. “It has to be studied well. We need an in-depth scientific study,” said public health expert Dr N M Arun. Among the infected are 57 health workers. Though most of them had two doses of vaccine, many workers are getting infected for the second and third time. Malappuram district topped with 1,917 cases. In last 24 hours, 125, 742 samples were tested. What really worries experts is that the virus wave shows no sign of downward trend and curve refuses to flatten. During the first wave, it came down quickly but in the second wave recovery is prolonging, data shows. But state health minister Veena George said slow progression was expected and there is no need to panic. “We have noticed that many are getting infected in their homes these days. Home quarantine is allowed for those who have private washrooms. But in many cases, they use common family facilities, infecting other members also,” she said, adding that many patients prefer home isolation and it is another reason for rise in cases.Health workers admitted that in rural areas many jump home quarantine and infect family members easily. But it is true there are no signs of overcrowding or panic in hospitals. Some of the temporary first line treatment centres were closed down for want of patients and there is no shortage of oxygen also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-woes-continue-13k-new-cases-101626373928810.html

The board exams for class XII were cancelled owing to the pandemic and Tamil Nadu has constituted a committee to evaluate and decide on class 12 marks. Before NEET entered Tamil Nadu in 2017, medical college admissions were based on class 12 marks.This meeting comes a day after the AK Rajan committee submitted its report to chief minister M K Stalin after studying the impact of NEET on socially and economically backward medical aspirants. More than 80,000 persons had submitted their opinions and most of them were against NEET, Rajan had said. On July 13, the Madras high court dismissed a plea filed by the BJP challenging the formation of the committee. Abolishing NEET is one of the election promises of the DMK and it is supported by other regional parties. Subramanian in his letter said that NEET deprives opportunities for rural students. “Majority of them study in their mother tongue and do not have resources/access to the coaching institutions,” he said. Subramanian also met union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya seeking additional vaccines, to start operations at vaccine facilities at Chengalpet and Nilgiris districts and asked for more funds. “They immediately granted ₹800 crore,” he told reporters in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-health-minister-meets-pradhan-over-demand-to-scrap-neet-101626373808811.html
16-07-2021||India||Move to drop charges in Kerala House fracas ‘incomprehensible’: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that Kerala government’s decision to drop criminal proceedings against a group of members MLAs, who threw furniture and destroyed public property during a House proceeding in March 2015, was “incomprehensible”.The observations of the top court came while hearing separate appeals filed by the Kerala government and the accused MLAs against a March 12 order by the Kerala high court refusing to drop charges against the legislators. The bench reserved orders after hearing all sides.Taking this to be a serious issue where a state government was seen defending the actions by the MLAs accused of criminal trespass, mischief, and destruction of public property, a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said, “We have to consider if the withdrawal of prosecution request (filed by the public prosecutor) was in the interest of public interest where MLAs have thrown furniture and desecrated the sanctum sanctorum of the House.”Expressing its strong reservation on the conduct of the MLAs, who threw microphones, broke furniture and disrupted presentation of the budget, the bench remarked, “This is not their personal property. It is public property, and they are custodians of it in the public trust. It is incomprehensible what is the public interest being pleaded.” The incident in question took place on March 13, 2015.Appearing for the state, senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said that the action fell within the domain of the House, over which the court cannot adjudicate. The bench said: “We do not doubt your freedom of speech in the House. But suppose an MLA empties a revolver in the assembly, will you still say that the House is supreme?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scslams-kerala-govt-for-appeal-to-close-assembly-ruckus-case-101626373508793.html
16-07-2021||India||UP recorded 36% jump in exports in 2020-21: State MSMEs minister||Uttar Pradesh reported a 36% jump in exports to ₹1.21 lakh crore in 2020-21 compared to ₹88,967 crore in 2017-18 because of the government’s policies such as one-district-one-product (ODOP) and robustness of small industries, Sidharth Nath Singh, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) minister of the state, said on Thursday.The MSME sector is the “backbone for employment generation and industrial growth in UP”, and due to its excellent performance the state could achieve positive growth in exports even during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Singh told reporters on Thursday.Despite a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown since March 25 last year, UP achieved 0.65% growth in exports in FY-21 even as the top three performers – Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu -- saw 0.38%, 6.08% and 9.09% contraction, respectively, according to the central government data. UP was the fifth largest contributor in India’s export basket for the previous fiscal year after Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.Singh said export growth is part of a conscious effort of the Yogi Adityanath government, which conceived the policy of ODOP to boost its rural economy immediately after it came to power in 2017. “We launched it in January 2018. Now, it has caught attention nationally. The Union finance minister had mentioned it in the budget... Under this we focused on promoting traditional industries specific to particular districts,” he said.He gave the example of “kalanamak chawal” (black rice). “Kalanamak chawal is basically sticky rice... The cultivation of this crop was towards extinction. We encourage it in Siddharthnagar. And, I’m happy to inform, despite the Covid pandemic, buyers from Japan and Singapore are engaging with our farmers to export it,” he said.While inaugurating a highway project in Varanasi on November 30 last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said “black rice was introduced two years ago in Chandauli to increase the income of the farmers. Last year, a farmer committee was formed and around 400 farmers were given this rice to grow in the kharif season. While normal rice sells for ₹35-40 a kg, this black rice was sold for up to ₹300 a kg. For the first time, this rice has been exported to Australia, that too at the rate of around ₹800 per kg.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-recorded-36-jump-in-exports-in-2020-21-state-msmes-minister-101626373029629.html
16-07-2021||India||Strong immune response in mixed jab: Studies||A second shot of a messengerRNA (mRNA) based coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine administered to those vaccinated with first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine induces a strong immune response, researchers have found in two separate studies, one of which was released on Thursday .On Thursday, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a study conducted at the University Hospital of Northern Sweden in CoVacc, with Umea University, Sweden, serving as trial sponsor, which showed that an AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) shot followed by a Moderna (mRNA-1273) one generated more immunity than two doses of the former. The study was conducted on 88 health care workers.The second study, published in late June in Lancet, was conducted at five university hospitals in Spain and showed the effectiveness and safety of a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccine on those who received one dose of the AstraZeneca one. The study covered 676 individualsThe studies are important as they show the advantages of mixed vaccine regimen, something that countries could use to their advantage while planning second doses, and, so-called booster doses (a third dose) that may be required a year or so after people receive both doses.“BNT162b2 given as a second dose in individuals prime vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S induced a robust immune response, with an acceptable and manageable reactogenicity profile,” said the study paper, which assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 administered as second dose in participants primed with ChAdOx1-S.In the Moderna study, researchers found antibody levels up to 125 times higher when the second dose was mRNA-1273 as compared to five times higher when it was also AstraZeneca.“We conclude that the mRNA-1273 vaccine can efficiently stimulate the SARS-CoV-2–specific B-cell memory that has been generated by a prime dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 9 to 12 weeks earlier and that it may provide better protection against the B.1.351 variant than a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 boost...”Experts say it is time to think about booster doses. “We need to start thinking about this now as at some point we would need a booster dose. It would depend on how the pandemic pans out...,” said Dr Navin Kumar, head, clinical microbiology and infection control, Manipal Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-immune-response-in-mixed-jab-studies-101626372968694.html
16-07-2021||India||2 million accounts blocked in one month: WhatsApp in report||WhatsApp blocked at least two million accounts in India from May 15 to June 15, a compliance report released by the Facebook-owned messaging platform said.The accounts were blocked using automated technology. The platform blocks around eight million accounts a month around the world.In the period between May 15 and June 15, the company received 345 complaints from India, where it has 530 million users. These included 70 cases of account support, wherein users reported problems regarding their accounts, but took action against none; 204 cases appealing the fact that their accounts were blocked (it acted against 63); and 20 issues of other support. There were also 43 cases of product support, referring to product services such as payments offered by the company, involving eight safety issues that were flagged. Overall, of the 345 complaints WhatsApp received, it acted against 63 accounts from May 15 to June 15.The company has challenged the traceability clause of the social media and intermediary guidelines, which also mandate it to publish a monthly grievance compliance report. This is the first such report WhatsApp has published for India. WhatsApp is now the fourth company after Google, Facebook and Twitter to publish the report and appoint officers in keeping with the new guidelines.“We are an industry leader among end-to-end encrypted messaging services in preventing and combating abuse,” WhatsApp said in its report. “In addition to our safety features and controls, we employ a team of engineers, data scientists, analysts, researchers, and experts in law enforcement, online safety, and technology developments to oversee these efforts. We enable users to block contacts and to report problematic content and contacts to us from inside the app. We pay close attention to user feedback and engage with specialists in stemming misinformation, promoting cybersecurity, and preserving election integrity.”A person familiar with WhatsApp’s compliance efforts said on condition of anonymity that automated take down of accounts happens using a range of behavioral signals, such as mass broadcasts and without breaking end to end encryption. “Even though WhatsApp is an encrypted platform, it takes action against accounts based on automated tools as it is committed to ensuring safety of its users,” the person said.Kazim Rizvi, founder, policy think tank, The Dialogue, said, “...WhatsApp utilises AI technology to detect behaviour of users. For instance, if 100 messages are sent to unknown contacts within 15 seconds of registration, the platform may block the user. The technology keeps learning from such instances of blocking and then prevents abuse by blocking users if it can predict the same through signals and patterns. For instance, behavioural cues like bulk registration along with data points like IP Address help in detecting instances at registration itself. It is important to note that platforms cannot take down content due to end-to-end encryption and can only ban accounts.”Facebook, which published a compliance report last week, said in a more detailed report published Thursday that it received 646 grievances from India between May 15 and June 15 through the newly created grievance channel, with the highest number of complaints being about accounts being hacked.A person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that while number of complaints were far lower on the grievance redressal channel as opposed to reports filed on the platform, the route provides an opportunity for people who do not have a Facebook account to flag content.Instagram, also owned by Facebook, said it received 36 complaints, of which 25 were regarding nudity. “Of these incoming reports, we provided tools for users to resolve the issues in 10 cases. These include pre-established channels to report content for specific violations, self-remediation flows where they can download their data, avenues to address account hacked issues etc,” the report stated.Instagram took action against two million links across nine categories in the period between May 15 and June 15.In Facebook’s first report released last week, it said it removed a little over 30 million pieces of content ( posts, profiles, pages) between May 15 and June 15 in India. The links taken down related to content that was violent and graphic, contained adult nudity and sexual activity, and were about suicide and self-injury. The report released on Friday is an interim disclosure and the company said it will publish details on July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-million-accounts-blocked-in-one-month-whatsapp-in-report-101626372908647.html
16-07-2021||India||Lok Sabha secretariat issues notice to three MPs under defection law||The Lok Sabha secretariat on Thursday evening issued notices to two Trinamool Congress (TMC) MPs and a YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) MP under the anti-defection law after their respective parties sought their removal from the House, people familiar with the matter said. Sisir Adhikari, senior TMC MP and father of BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, and Sunil Kumar Mondal, Trinamool’s two-term MP, have been served notice months after the party filed a complaint under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution for anti-party activities.K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju, who has taken on Andhra Pradesh chief minister and party chief Jagan Mohan Reddy, has also been issued notice.According to the Lok Sabha secretariat, the three MPs have been told to send their reply within 15 days of receiving the notice.People familiar with the matter said while TMC leaders filed for disqualification of the two MPs a few months ago but now, ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament, the process of evaluating the alleged anti-defection cases have started.Sudip Bandyopadhyay, leader of the TMC in Lok Sabha, sought Sunil Kumar Mondal’s disqualification, on January 4 this year. The request to remove Sisir Adhikari was sent on May 17, a fortnight after his eldest son Suvendu defeated chief minister Mamata Banerjee from the Nandigram seat by 1,958 votes.Sunil Mondal, TMC Lok Sabha member from East Burdwan seat, joined the BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah in December last year.Sisir Adhikari, the MP from Contai in East Midnapore district, did not formally pick up the BJP flag but shared the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the election campaign.Section 2A of the Constitution’s Tenth Schedule provides for disqualification of MPs and MLAs “if he (a lawmaker) has voluntarily given up his membership of such political party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-secretariat-issues-notice-to-3-mps-under-defection-law-101626372849374.html
16-07-2021||India||SC suo motu takes up delay in releasing prisoners after bail||The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the delay by jail authorities in releasing convicts after they have been granted bail by superior courts, and a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana will hear the matter on Friday.The apex court was faced with a situation on July 8, when the top court ordered prison authorities of the Central Jail in Agra to release 13 convicts who were found to be juveniles at the time of commission of crimes. These convicts spent 14 to 22 years in jail despite Juvenile Justice Boards giving clear findings that were not adults when the crimes were committed.It took four days for the jail authorities to execute the release of the convicts. When this delay was brought to the notice of the top court on July 13 by advocate Rishi Malhotra, appearing for the convicts, a bench of justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian decided to take up the matter on the administrative side to issue necessary directions.The same day, the suo motu case was registered under the title “In Reference: Delay in Release of Convicts After Grant of Bail”. A three-judge bench comprising the CJI and justices L Nageswara Rao and AS Bopanna will hear the matter.Commenting on the suo moto proceedings, Malhotra suggested that, to cut delay, the Registry of the Supreme Court can e-mail the bail order to the superintendent of the concerned jail.“The superintendent of jail can always verify by calling up the Supreme Court, and can ascertain the veracity of the bail order from the Supreme Court’s website. This will not only save time but would be expeditious keeping in view that bail orders should not be detained for more than one day,” he said.The 13 convicts approached the Supreme Court last month on the grounds that their detention was “illegal”, citing the Juvenile Justice Board orders passed at various intervals between February 2017 and March 2021 declaring them to be below 18 at the time of committing the crime.As per procedures under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act 2000, Once a person accused of a crime is found to be a juvenile at the time of commission of that crime, the regular court will require sending the matter to the Juvenile Justice Board for trial of the case.Juvenile offenders can be given a maximum sentence of three years and this period has to be undergone in an observation/juvenile home.The petitioners relied on a public interest litigation taken up by in 2012 in which the Allahabad high court was told about a significant number of prisoners lodged in jails across Uttar Pradesh who were juveniles at the time of committing the crimes. The high court called for a report from Director General (Prisons), who confirmed this fact.In May 2012, the high court ordered an enquiry by Juvenile Justice Boards, which resulted in the orders being passed with regard to the 13 convicts.Leading criminal lawyer and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said the problem with delayed release of persons granted bail has increased over the years and needs redress.“There are cases in which the investigating agency raises objection to bail bonds on the grounds that they need to verify the address and particulars in the bail bond. As a consequence, the accused continues to remain in jail. The Code of Criminal Procedure does provide for verification of bail bonds but that cannot become a matter of course to deny a person’s liberty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-suo-motu-takes-up-delay-in-releasing-prisoners-after-bail-101626372728765.html
16-07-2021||India||Ram Temple to open for devotees from end of 2023: Trust gen secretary||The Ram temple in Ayodhya will open to devotees for worshipping the child deity, or Ram lalla, by the end of 2023 and the entire 70-acre campus will be completed by the end of 2025, said office-bearers of the trust overseeing the high-profile project on Thursday.The announcement came after a meeting of the 15-member Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust with engineers and architects. The meeting was chaired by trust chief Nripendra Misra, who wrapped up a two-day visit to Ayodhya.“By the end of 2023, the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram temple will be opened for devotees to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla,” said Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust.“Construction work on the 70-acre temple complex will be completed by the end of 2025. Then the entire temple campus will be opened for devotees,” added Rai.The foundation of the temple was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5 last year in a glitzy ceremony but work stalled in January after water was found under the proposed temple site. Currently, engineers are working on the foundation of the temple and it is likely to be completed by September 15. The second phase of the work is likely to start in November.The construction committee has decided to keep the Ram Janmabhoomi campus eco-friendly.“The temple complex will have provision of rainwater harvesting so that water collected on the campus does not choke drains outside the temple. All existing trees in the temple complex will be preserved so that they provide natural cooling to devotees,” said Rai.Security of the complex was discussed at the meeting on Thursday and it was decided that instead of cement, industrial fly ash will be used in the construction of the temple. It will be procured from Unchahar Thermal Power Plant in Rae Bareli.Sandstone from Mirzapur,sandstone from Jodhpur, marble from Makrana in Rajasthan, pink stone from Bansi Paharpur in Rajasthan will be used in the construction.“On completion of one year of Bhumi Pujan of Ram temple on August 5 this year, we are planning a media visit at the construction site,” said Rai.According to the temple’s master plan, the campus will also have a museum, record room, research centre, auditorium, cow shed, a centre for tourists, administrative building, yagya shala and other facilities.Construction of the temple, a decades-long demand of Hindu groups, was cleared by the Supreme Court in 2019 in its landmark verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. Before that, devotees were allowed to offer prayers to the child deity under a makeshift shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-to-open-for-devotees-from-end-of-2023-trust-gen-secy-101626372488664.html

The meeting is being attended by key leaders such as Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi are also in Tashkent for the conference but people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there were no plans for the Indian side to meet them. Meanwhile, the meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan said in a joint statement that the “activity of international terrorist organisations remains a key factor of instability” in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-holds-talks-with-afghan-president-affirms-india-s-support-101626372428687.html
16-07-2021||India||'Should set aside LAC standoff to revive ties': China||China has said the overall situation in the border areas with India has de-escalated and both countries should set aside the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to expand bilateral cooperation, reflecting the differences between the two sides on the issue.The Chinese position was articulated on Thursday in a statement on the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Dushanbe. After the meeting on Wednesday, Jaishankar said both sides should speedily resolve the remaining issues on the LAC since the standoff was negatively impacting bilateral ties.According to the Chinese foreign ministry’s statement, Wang said that after his meeting with Jaishankar in Moscow last year, frontier troops of both countries disengaged in Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake areas, and the “overall situation in the border area was de-escalated”.Reiterating Beijing’s contention that the Chinese side wasn’t responsible for the standoff, Wang said: “The two sides must place the border issue in an appropriate position in bilateral relations, expand the positive momentum of bilateral cooperation and create favourable conditions for resolving differences through negotiation.”China’s stance is contrary to the position taken by the Indian side, as Jaishankar had said that normalisation of ties depends on restoring peace in the areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-set-aside-lac-standoff-to-revive-ties-china-101626372369285.html
16-07-2021||India||PM Modi backs UP model on Covid, governance||Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday for its handling of Covid-19, boosting investment, and improving law and order, saying that the manner in which the state controlled the second wave of the pandemic was “unprecedented”.Modi visited his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi, inaugurated a convention centre built with Japanese assistance, laid the foundation of development projects worth ₹1,583 crore and hailed Indo-Japan ties.The PM said Uttar Pradesh’s population -- roughly 200 million -- was more than a dozen big countries but the way it controlled the second wave and stopped its spread was: “unprecedented”.“And this (Covid) is the biggest problem the world is facing in 100 years. It is the biggest pandemic, and hence efforts made by Uttar Pradesh to tackle the corona are commendable,” said Modi. “But Kashi along with UP faced such a big problem with full strength. Even during difficult times, Kashi has shown it does not stop, nor does it get tired,” he added, appealing to the audience to not be careless and follow Covid-19 protocols.The Prime Minister also appreciated the Yogi Adityanath-led government for a “development-oriented approach” and bringing in the rule of law in the state. He said Uttar Pradesh emerged as the leading investment destination of the country due to the environment created by the government.“UP, which was considered difficult to do business in a few years ago, is becoming a favourite place for Make in India today...Today, Yogiji is himself working hard and personally reviewing all development schemes,” the PM said at a public gathering at IIT-BHU grounds in Varanasi.The PM’s endorsement is a boost for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government that was battling criticism from opposition parties and its own lawmakers over its handling of the second wave.At the peak of the surge in April and May, several cities in the state reported shortages of oxygen, hospital beds and critical drugs, and many bodies were later found buried on the banks of the Ganga or floating in the river -- though the government disputed that these were Covid patients and said the administration made all arrangements for patients and their kin.The Congress took a swipe at Modi, saying Varanasi wanted good governance, not speeches. The party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the city was “left to fend for itself” during the second wave of Covid-19.The state goes to the polls in early 2022.“Under PM Modi’s governance, Kashi has made a new identity in country and world. New Kashi is reaching new heights in development. This smart Kashi has become a model for the country and the world. PM Modi’s vision and inspiration are pushing people to new heights,” said Adiyanath.The chief minister said projects worth ₹10,300 crore were completed in the last seven years and projects worth another ₹10,200 crore were in progress in Varanasi.The state government also came in for praise for the state’s law and order situation.In his speech, Modi hailed the Varanasi International Cooperation and Convention Centre, Rudraksh, and said the ₹186 crore-project had the shine of modernity and aura of culture.“I want to congratulate everyone, the people of Kashi for this achievement, especially India’s ‘param mitra’ (close friend) Japan, the people of Japan, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Japanese ambassador to India Suzuki Satoshi,” he said.“There is one more person in today’s event, whom I cannot forget to name. Another friend of mine from Japan - Shinzo Abe. I remember, when Shinzo Abe came to Kashi as Prime Minister, I had discussed with him the idea of Rudraksh,” Modi said.“Prime Minister Suga was the chief cabinet secretary at that time. Since then till the role of PM, he has been personally involved in this project continuously,” the PM added.In a video message played at the ceremony, Suga congratulated India and said the two countries hared the same fundamental values “The Varanasi International Cooperation and Convention Centre (VICCC), Rudraksh, will be used as a stage to showcase Japan-India cooperation by hosting international conferences, cultural and art events. The centre will become a new symbol of friendship between Japan and India,” he said.In his speech, Modi said that Kashi was emerging as a major medical hub for the “Purvanchal” (eastern region) and praised the inauguration of 14 oxygen plants at various city hospitals. He reiterated that the cleanliness of the Ganga and beautification of Varanasi were the top priorities for his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-backs-up-modelon-covid-governance-101626372368674.html
16-07-2021||India||Captain to lead poll campaign, buzz persists over Sidhu’s role||A much-awaited (and still awaited late Thursday night) announcement, lots of speculation, and meetings of the two rival factions -- these were the passages of play on a tense Thursday that was expected to see a resolution of a crisis in the Congress’s fractious Punjab unit.As such, the day ended only with clarity on current chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s role. “Captain Amarinder Singh will continue as the chief minister. The party will fight the elections under him,” said Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs .Rawat is also one of three members of a committee set up to resolve the crisis in the party in Punjab where elections are due early next year, and where opposition to the incumbent CM has coalesced and grown around Navjot Singh Sidhu, a cricketer and television personality who has emerged a vocal critic of Singh.Congress president Sonia Gandhi was to decide on Sidhu’s role, and there has been talk, a lot of it (including on Thursday) that he will be the next Punjab Congress chief. Specifically queried about Sidhu’s likely appointment as the new state unit chief of the Congress in Punjab, Rawat said the final approval of the party president is awaited. Rawat has previously termed Sidhu the future of the state. An announcement is expected as early as Friday.Rawat’s comments intensified speculation about Sidhu replacing Sunil Jakhar as the state chief and the likely appointment of two other party leaders, a Hindu and a Dalit, as working presidents to balance the caste equations.This was one of the recommendations of the committee. The names of Vijay Inder Singla and Santokh Chaudhary are doing the rounds for the post of working presidents.“The broad contours of the formula for revamp of the state Congress seem to have decided and the central leadership is trying to bring senior leaders on board before making a formal announcement to avoid a situation,” two state leaders said on condition of anonymity. The chief minister’s camp is closely watching the developments. Though there were reports that Captain Amarinder called up the Congress president to convey his displeasure and offered to resign, his media adviser Raveen Thukral denied these. “Media reports of CM@capt_amarinder resigning are humbug. He has neither quit nor offered to do so. He’ll lead @INCPunjab to victory in 2022 Assembly polls as he did in 2017. Urge media to stop speculating & spreading misinformation,” he tweeted.The chief minister is opposed to Sidhu being named party chief in the state.Meanwhile, the battle lines in the faction-ridden state unit became clearer with the two sides holding separate meetings. Sidhu held a meeting with some ministers and MLAs at cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s residence. Besides the two, cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Charanjit Singh Channi, MLAs Pargat Singh, Kulbir Singh Zira, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon and Barindermeet Singh Pahra were also present. “There were 9-10 ministers and MLAs. Since Sidhu happened to be here, we decided to meet. It was not a planned meeting,” one of them said on condition of anonymity.Singh also met at least 15-16 ministers, MPs and MLAs at his Siswan farmhouse. Those who met him include cabinet ministers Sunder Sham Arora, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, OP Soni and Aruna Chaudhary, MPs Gurjit Singh Aujla and Jasbir Singh Gill and MLAs Fatehjang Singh Bajwa, Raminder Singh Awla and Harpartap Singh Ajnala, according to sources. An aide of the chief minister termed the meeting “routine”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/captain-to-lead-poll-campaign-buzz-persists-over-sidhu-s-role-101626369848486.html
16-07-2021||India||SC: Does India need a colonial sedition law?||The Supreme Court on Thursday rued the “enormous power of misuse” of the sedition law in India and asked the Union government why it should not scrap a colonial law that was once used by the British government to oppress the freedom movements and leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak.The government’s top law officer, attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, on his part, submitted that the entire section need not be struck down, and the court could lay down strict guidelines so that provision meets its legal purpose.The court observed that indiscriminate use of Section 124A (sedition) in the Indian Penal Code is like a saw in the hands of a carpenter who cuts the entire forest instead of a tree.“Unfortunately, continuance of this law after 75 years...This government has been scrapping many obsolete laws. We don’t know why they are not looking into this law? Continuance of this law is a serious threat on functioning of institutions and individuals’ liberty,” remarked a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana.Putting the central government to notice on a clutch of petitions that have pressed for striking down Section 124A, the court emphasised that it was concerned about “misuse of the law and lack of accountability of executive and the investigating agencies”.The court’s comments come amid a sharp increase in the number of sedition cases filed. Between 2016 and 2019, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of such cases rose by 160% to 93. But in 2019, the conviction rate in such cases was a mere 3.3%, which means just two of the accused were convicted.“There is no dispute that it is a colonial law and was used by the British to suppress freedom and was used against Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Is this law still needed after 75 years of Independence? Do you have to keep it in the statute book?” the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, asked the A-G.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Union government, sought time to place the formal response on record, saying that the work of the court may get reduced once the Centre has submitted its affidavit in the matter.The penal provision is punishable with a jail term ranging between three years to life term, with or without fine.On Wednesday, the bench requested the A-G to assist it in adjudicating a petition, filed by former army officer SG Vombatkere, that was argued by advocate PB Suresh. This petition questioned the constitutional validity of Section 124A, and sought a directive to quash all proceedings under Section 124A pending with the police and courts across the country.On Thursday, as the matter commenced, Venugopal pointed out that there were at least two other cases on the validity of 124A pending before the other benches of the Supreme Court, and hence, the CJI’s bench could hear all these matters together. At this point, senior counsel Shyam Divan submitted that the Editors Guild of India has also filed a petition for striking down the sedition law, and their petition should also be clubbed.Agreeing to hear all these matters together, the bench began by asking the AG if it was necessary to retain section 124A of the IPC in the statute book, given the fact that the law had its origin during the colonial era and that the conviction rate in these cases has been dismal.“If you see history of charging this section, conviction rate is very low. The enormous power of misuse of this section can be compared with a carpenter given a saw. Instead of cutting a tree, he cuts the entire forest,” observed the bench.It cited Section 66A in the Information Technology Act, which was still being used to book and arrest people for social media posts despite the top court having scrapped the provision in 2015 for being arbitrary and disproportionately excessive.“Take the 66A IT Act, thousands of cases were registered even after it having been struck down. If the police want to fix somebody, it can invoke 124A also. Everybody is a little scared when this section can be invoked. these are all issues which needs to be looked into...If a political party wants to suppress the dissenting voices, they can use this law to book others,” said the bench, adding it will examine all these cases on Section 124A after two weeks.The other petition challenging Section 124A is being heard by a bench headed by justice Uday U Lalit. It has been filed by two journalists – Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla working in Manipur and Chhattisgarh. On July 12, the A-G and the Union government sought time to file their submissions before that bench and the case was hence adjourned to July 27.On June 3, a bench, headed by justice Lalit quashed a sedition case after ruling that every citizen has a right to criticize the government’s policies so long as it does not incite people to violence or creates public disorder. The bench underlined a 1962 constitution bench judgment in the Kedar Nath Singh case to assert that a journalist could not be prosecuted under Section 124A for “disapprobation of actions of the Government and its functionaries”,Another bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, said in May that it is time to define contours of Section 124A of IPC to lay down what is sedition and what is not. The bench had said it while restraining the Andhra Pradesh government from taking any adverse steps against two Telugu news channels that were booked under Section 124A.On Monday, at a public event, justice Chandrachud again emphasised that criminal laws, including anti-terror legislation, should not be used for muzzling dissent and that courts must act as the “first line of defence” against deprivation of liberty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-does-india-need-a-colonial-sedition-law-101626369489813.html
16-07-2021||India||NHRC calls for CBI probe into Bengal poll violence||Incidents of post-poll violence in West Bengal should be federally probed and trials held outside the state, the National Human Rights Commission recommended to the Calcutta high court, slamming the state government and ruling party and calling the clashes a “death knell” for democracy. The seven-member panel, set up on the high court’s order in June to look into clashes in the state after election results on May 2, submitted its report to the high court on Tuesday. It said that at least 1,934 police complaints were lodged in the state between May 2 and June 20, including 29 complaints of murder, 12 of rape and sexual assault and 940 of loot and arson. Out of the 9,304 people named as accused, less than 3% are currently in jail, found the panel.“The situation in the state of West Bengal is a manifestation of law of ruler, instead of rule of law...This was retributive violence by supporters of the ruling party against supporters of the main opposition party,” said the 50-page report. “It is indeed ironical that, in the land of Rabindranath Tagore...thousands of its citizens have been subjected to murder, rape, displacement and intimidation, etc. in the last couple of months,” it added.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee hit back at the panel, saying the report was misleading and facts distorted. “How many commissions and central agencies did the PM send to Uttar Pradesh?...they are misleading people and distorting facts,” Banerjee said. Violence broke out in various parts of the state hours after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) trounced the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to secure a third consecutive term on May 2. BJP leaders alleged that they were thrashed and threatened by TMC members, their houses ransacked and offices vandalised.The TMC denied the charges and said that the BJP was trying to exaggerate isolated clashes.On June 18, the high court -- hearing a bunch of public interest litigation -- asked NHRC to probe the violence. Three days later, it rejected the state government’s review petition and said the administration’s conduct didn’t inspire confidence.The NHRC committee visited at least 311 spots and found that in 60% of the places FIRs were not registered. “Out of the 9304 accused cited in the FIRs only 1354 (14%) have been arrested and, out of these arrested, 1086 (80%) are already on bail. Thus, overall speaking, less than 3% of the accused are in jail, while 97% are out in the open, making a mockery of the whole system,” the report stated, adding that police didn’t have the courage to take action against goons belonging to the ruling dispensation. “Hence it is recommended that all heinous crimes, including murder, unnatural deaths, rape and grievous hurt, and complaints carrying these allegations should be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). . . Trial of all the above cases investigated by the CBI should be held outside the state,” the report recommended. It also suggested a court-monitored special investigation team with a special public prosecutor, trial in fast track courts, deployment of central forces, and reforms in police. “This may well be death knell for democracy in this great nation. It is high time that the rot is stemmed and this trend is reversed in the interest of having a vibrant democracy in this nation,” the committee said.The panel recommended constituting a committee headed by a retired judge to monitor the implementation of the orders of the high court. The committee should have independent officers as observers in each of the affected districts.“If the above mentioned worrisome trend is not arrested, where the entire might of the government machinery has been used for furthering the political objectives of the party in power, the disease may spread to other states also,” it noted.The committee held a “pernicious politico- bureaucratic-criminal nexus” responsible for the violence and said many displaced people were scared to return and sexual assault victims scared to speak out due to palpable fear. “The local police has been grossly derelict, if not complicit, in this violence..loss of faith in state administration among victims is very evident,” the report noted.Banerjee said the panel was trying to malign the state after the BJP’s poll loss. “How many commissions and central agencies did the PM send to Uttar Pradesh? Majority of the incidents (violence) took place when law and order was with the Election Commission. They are misleading people and distorting facts,” Banerjee said . She also said. “We will submit our opinion through an affidavit to the court when our turn comes. I am sorry to say that instead of giving the report to the court they (NHRC) have leaked the reports. They should have respected the court. How can they disrespect the court? The matter is being heard by the court. We are the government and the court is yet to hear us. Before that how can they leak the reports? It is their political vendetta.” The BJP attacked the ruling TMC. “Any report which results in the embarrassment of the TMC is tagged as political vendetta. The NHRC team was assisted the by state police and state government officials when they were visiting the spots. The NHRC team was taken to the spots where violence was comparatively less. But still the report nails the government. So the NHRC report is just the tip of an iceberg. The report shows where democracy in the state. The TMC has not faith on any constitutional body,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrcreport-slams-bengal-govt-over-post-poll-violence-101626349447741.html
16-07-2021||India||It was a difficult decision to stop kanwar yatra: Uttarakhand CM Dhami||The Supreme Court on Wednesday cited Uttarakhand’s move to suspend the kanwar yatra and said it was a “little disturbed” by Uttar Pradesh’s decision to allow the pilgrimage despite widespread fears of a third wave of Covid-19. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, 45, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the yatra for which around 30 million pilgrims walk to fetch the Ganga waters for temples back home. Edited excerpts:Was it a difficult decision to stop the yatra?The yatra is a matter of great faith and devotion for us. Crores of Kanwariyas come to carry water from the Ganga (in Haridwar). For us, it is a very difficult decision. The pilgrims come to Uttarakhand from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan... Haridwar is the centre of the yatra. For us, people’s lives and saving them is of primary concern. For that, we have taken a tough decision with God as our witness. We are sure that God will not be pleased if because of our laxity, lives are lost. That is why we have stopped (the yatra).Did you consult experts?The new variant of the Coronavirus has been found in Gadarpur of Uddham Singh Nagar district in our state. We kept that in mind and sought advice from all kinds of people. Our officers consulted their peers in Uttar Pradesh too and noted how infection rates continue to grow. Keeping all this in mind and since we are the host of the entire yatra, we did not want Uttarakhand to be the Covid hotspot... People know that we would have loved to have the yatra...Did you speak to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath about it?I called him and briefed him about the situation here. It is not that he has taken a different line from me. He is a revered figure for me.Adityanath faces polls next year and so do you. What impact will this have on the polls?I think people understand where we are coming from. If you believe in God as I do, you know that human life is more precious. God will not approve of this. I spoke to all, and we were all agreed. There are many yatras to be experienced in life.Uttarakhand has had three chief ministers in just a matter of months. Did you know that you would have to take such a tough decision so soon after taking over?I live in the present and I never thought that I would be chief minister. My party has given me the work, the Prime Minister and others considered me worthy. So, I do not worry about the past or regret it and neither do I fear the future. Whatever challenge I face, I will just fulfil my oath.How are you handling the tourists’ rush?People are tired of staying at home for so long. They are now dying to get out. All the things that people missed out on, they want to make up for it. I appeal to all to do it slowly and in a measured manner. One government cannot do it by itself. It has to be a community effort.Do you have enough vaccines?We have vaccinated 50% of our population with both doses. Our aim is to vaccinate all in the next four months. We have appealed to the Centre to double our allocation and if that is done, we will have total coverage.Elections are around the corner. Do not you think the frequent changes will work against the Bhartiya Janata Party?No. Responsibilities are given and taken. We have done lots of work in the last 4.5 years and I am working to further thatThe Kumbh was allowed despite the second Covid-19 wave. Would that have an impact?They must have decided according to the situation at that time. Those who took fake Covid certificates (to attend Kumbh) are facing investigation. ...such incidents should not happen again. Humans are always learning, and I am doing that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-was-a-difficult-decision-to-stop-kanwar-yatra-uttarakhand-cm-pushkar-singh-dhami-101626348427617.html
16-07-2021||India||MP government to move Supreme Court for 27% OBC reservation in state||The Madhya Pradesh state government will soon move the Supreme Court against the MP high court stay on 27% reservation for other backward classes (OBC), said a minister on Thursday. The then Kamal Nath-led Congress government had increased the OBC reservation from 14% to 27% in March 2019. The high court stayed the decision in March itself. On Tuesday, it ordered a continuation of its interim stay to release the list of candidates selected through various exams with 14% OBC reservation, and keep 13% seats vacant till the final order is issued in the case. The decision to approach the apex court was taken at a meeting of OBC welfare committee on Wednesday, headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.Horticulture minister Bharat Singh Kushwaha said, “The CM has clearly said that the state government will move the Supreme Court for 27% reservation for OBCs as MP has 51% OBC population and it is necessary to give reservation to the community members in this proportion.” Also Read | Punjab Police bust another weapon supply module in MP, two arrested“The OBC community has been demanding an increase in quota. At the meeting, it was decided to move Supreme Court against the high court stay,” said Bhagat Singh Yadav, president, BJP OBC morcha. The state government swung into action on OBC quota issue after former chief minister Kamal Nath and other Congress leaders attacked it for failing to pursue the matter effectively in court. In a series of tweets, Nath said, “Some petitions were filed in the high court against reservation, but due to lack of proper presentation by the BJP-led state government, the increased reservation could not be implemented till now. If the government supports the strong side, then the backward classes of Madhya Pradesh will get the benefit of 27% reservation.” MP advocate general Purushendra Kaurav said, “I won’t comment on the decision at the meeting.” The increase in quota for OBC violates Supreme Court reservation cap of 50%. In MP, the total reservation will gone up to 73% with 27% OBC quota. The state has 10% reservation for economically weaker section (EWS) people in upper castes, 20% reservation for scheduled tribes and 16% reservation for scheduled castes. The MP high court is hearing at least 70 petitions in connection to the reservation in jobs and educational institutes, officials said. One of the lawyers representing some petitioners, Aditya Singhvi, said, “They can move the Supreme Court but they will lose the case there too. The Supreme Court’s larger bench on May 5, 2021, gave a clear judgment in connection with Maratha reservation that population ratio can’t be a basis of increasing reservation in any state.” “Approaching SC is a political gimmick, nothing else,” he added. According to the 2011 census, OBCs constitute 50.09% of the total 72.62 million population of Madhya Pradesh. Out of 52 districts, 36 have over 50% OBC population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-government-to-move-supreme-court-for-27-obc-reservation-in-state-101626348187763.html
16-07-2021||India||India eases drone norms in boost for future tech||The Union civil aviation ministry on Thursday released the draft of the national drone policy, making it significantly easier for people and companies to own and operate drones, while also streamlining a labyrinthine certification process for manufacturers, importers and users, in a move that aims to boost future tech.Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia underlined the key highlights of the new policy in a series of tweets on Thursday. The document has been now been put up for public inputs till August 5, following which it will be notified. The rules will replace the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules (UAS), 2021, which came into force in March. “In a major fillip to the drone industry, I am happy to present the Draft Drone Rules 2021 that mark a stark shift from the earlier UAS Rules. 10 key takeaways: Several approvals abolished & processes made easier; number of forms reduced from 25 to 5; coverage of drones increased from 300 kg to 500 kg; fee reduced to nominal levels; yellow zone reduced from 45 km to 12 km from the airport perimeter; no flight permission required up to 400 ft in green zones...,” Scindia wrote.Drones have been in the spotlight since such a device was used to target an Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Jammu with explosives last month. Officials in defence have since said they are working on anti-drone technologies. Typical consumer drones usually have some inbuilt safeguards, which mean not all are unsafe. Drones now form a significant new consumer tech category, particularly among hobbyists and visual artists, and are being tested for a range of practical as well as industrial uses such as automated package deliveries by e-commerce companies.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of top ministers to discuss the policy regarding drones, which has been long awaited. The existing regulation, notified in March 2021, was seen to have a labyrinthine approval process.According to the draft rules, seen by HT, many of the approvals previously required, such as unique authorisation number, unique prototype identification number, certificate of conformance, certificate of maintenance, import clearance, operator permit, authorisation of R&D organisation, and student remote pilot licence, have been abolished. The draft rules also propose to reduce fee to nominal levels and not linking the fee with the size of the drone.Building on its attempt to make rules easier, the rules state no pilot licence will be required for micro drones (for non-commercial use), nano drones and for research and development (R&D) organisations. There will no longer be a ban on the use of drones by foreign-owned companies registered in India and no security clearance will be required before any registration or licence is issued.The government plans to open what is known as the Digital Sky platform, which manufacturers will be able to use for certification process, and from where interactive airspace maps with green, yellow, and red zones can be accessed. Digital Sky will also serve as a unified platform for users to obtain the mandatory registration number and remote pilot license, and people will need to check the service to determine if any restrictions are in place before they fly a drone at a location. The platform will be under India’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).“The central government may, within 30 days of the date of notification of these rules, publish on the digital sky platform, an airspace map for drone operations segregating the entire airspace of India into red, yellow and green zones, with a horizontal resolution equal or finer than 10 metre,” the draft rules state.The zones pertain to what is known as geo-fencing, which prohibit or limit the use of drones at some places, like close to an airport or over sensitive military and VIP locations. The yellow zone has been reduced from 45 km to 12 km from an airport’s perimeter, and the new rules suggest no flight permission will be required for operations up to 400 feet in green zones and up to 200 feet in the area between 8-12 km from an airport perimeter.“Green zone” refer to the airspace from the ground up to a vertical distance of 400 feet (120 metre) above ground level (AGL) that has not been designated as a red zone or yellow zone in the airspace map for drone operations; and the airspace from the ground up to a vertical distance of 200 feet (60 metre) AGL in the area located between a lateral distance of 8 kilometre and 12 kilometre from the perimeter of an operational airport, the draft rules say. In red zones, drone operations shall be permitted only under exceptional circumstances by the central government, the rules add. To fly in the yellow zone, a drone pilot will require permission from the air traffic control authority.“The airspace map for drone operations shall be designed to be programmatically accessible through a machine readable Application Programming Interface (API) and interactive so that drone pilots will be able to plot their proposed flight plan and easily identify the zone(s) within which it falls so as to assess whether or not they need to make an application for prior approval,” it said. This will allow for automatic drones to be automatically updated with geo-fencing details of where they can and cannot be flown. Some companies build such failsafe fences into their products, typically earmarking no-fly zones around airports and other sensitive locations.Discussions on a draft policy on drones have been on for over two years. The policy document uploaded on Thursday says integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) presents several challenges, technically and operationally. Integrating UAS within the current air traffic management systems need additional hardware on board, it added.The objective of the policy is to enable more types of unmanned aircraft operational scenarios, increase the ease of compliance for the unmanned aviation industry, and ensure safety and security.Industry representatives welcomed the rules. “The ministry of civil aviation’s decision to liberalise the drone policy even after the recent drone incidents in Jammu showcases the government’s bold approach to promote the use of the drone and focus on the development of counter-drone technology to address the threat posed by rogue drones. We appreciate the ministry’s initiative and will continue to extend our support towards making India global drone hub.” said Smit Shah, director, Drone Federation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-draft-national-drone-policy-relaxes-existing-rules-101626333666685.html
16-07-2021||India||Five more cases of Zika infection push Kerala tally to 28||Five more people tested positive for the Zika virus in Kerala on Thursday, taking the total number of cases of the vector-borne disease to 28 in the state, which is currently also the largest Covid-19 hot spot in India.“Of the 28 cases, 20 have turned negative. Among eight active cases, three are pregnant women. Special teams have been constituted to monitor their health,” state health minister Veena George said on Thursday after an emergency review meeting in the state capital. The latest Zika cases were reported from Thiruvananthapuram city and in neighbouring Parassala and Vizinjam areas. An alert has been sounded in all 14 districts of the state and a state-wide vector control drive has also been launched, the minister said. “Almost every household will have to ensure that there is no stagnant water collection in their house or periphery. Fogging and drying are in full swing. We will overcome this,” George said, underscoring that strict vigilance is needed but there is no need to panic yet. The first Zika case was reported from Parassala in Thiruvananthapuram district last week after a 24-year-old pregnant woman tested positive for the virus. Later, she gave birth and both the mother and infant are stable. However, Zika cases in Kerala have now risen from to 28 within a week. The state health department said on Wednesday a cluster of infections was identified near a locality in Thiruvananthapuram after they found large-scale presence of Aedes mosquitoes, the main carrier of the virus. The minister said the state has set up five testing labs and a control room to handle the Zika outbreak. Earlier, it used to send samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune. The central government too has rushed a team of experts to the state. Controlling the Zika outbreak is of even greater significance to Kerala, which is currently the biggest coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country right now. The state has been adding the most number of daily cases in the country – an average of 13,245 new infections every day in the past seven days – and has thus been responsible for a third of all infections reported in the country in the past week. Health experts say that unlike Covid-19, Zika is not a major threat and can be controlled with effective vector control programmes. The virus is spread mostly through mosquitoes and the fatality rate among patients is very low. Only one in five patients normally develop symptoms. However, the Zika virus can affect foetal development in pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-more-zika-cases-detected-in-kerala-total-28-now-101626327725947.html
16-07-2021||India||Choksi returns to Antigua after bail||Diamantaire Mehul Choksi on Thursday returned to Antigua and Barbuda, where he is a citizen, three days after a court in Dominica granted him bail on medical grounds. He mysteriously went missing from Antigua on May 23 and was found in Dominica, around 200 km away, the next day.Choksi’s family and legal team blamed India, which has sought his deportation to face trial in the ₹13,578 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, and Antigua and Barbuda for abducting him. India even sent a special jet with a team of eight officers to Dominica in the expectation of the country deporting him.Choksi, 62, spent 52 days in Dominica, where he was charged with “illegal entry”. The Dominica high court on Monday allowed his plea to return to Antigua “strictly for medical treatment” and ordered him to return once he is fit to travel. Indian investigators feel Choksi will now never return to Dominica.Choksi landed at Antigua’s VC Bird International Airport in an air ambulance around 3.30 pm Wednesday Caribbean time (Thursday early morning India time). He was received by the island’s ministry of foreign affairs officials, people familiar with the matter said. Choksi carried the Dominican court order and did not face any problems with immigration authorities, they added.Choksi’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said his client has returned home safely. “He faced no issues while entering Antigua. He is receiving medical treatment and his family is feeling relieved. ...torture during kidnapping has caused him a lot of psychological and physical harm. All is well that ends well. After tasting success in Dominica, now the legal team is gearing up for a long-drawn fight in Antigua.”Antigua and Barbuda government said on Wednesday evening that while Choksi has returned from Dominica, the Royal Police Force of the island will continue to investigate his claim of kidnapping. It added that the extradition case brought against him and the case of revocation of his Antiguan citizenship will also continue. The decisions were taken by the cabinet led by Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Choksi is facing two cases - extradition and revocation of citizenship (which he acquired in November 2017) - in the Antigua high court.An Indian team flew to Dominica on May 28 hoping to get Choksi deported. But Choksi’s lawyers filed a habeas corpus in the Dominica high court alleging abduction and torture.India told Dominica in June that Choksi was the mastermind of the PNB fraud and owed ₹7080 crore ($952 million). It also argued that he remained an Indian citizen because the appropriate authority did not accept his application relinquishing Indian citizenship, and sought to have him deported to India, but the matter was adjourned sine die.HT reported on July 15, citing unnamed officials in investigation agencies that Choksi’s return to Antigua could delay his potential extradition to India. The high court, while granting Choksi bail, said the illegal entry proceedings against Choksi will remain adjourned till he is fit to stand trial. Choksi’s arrival in Dominica on May 24 triggered a political controversy with the country’s main opposition party accusing the governments of Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, and India of colluding to abduct the businessman to fly him to New Delhi. The allegations have been rejected by all three governments.Analysts in Delhi say that Dominica has rid itself of Choksi by agreeing to his bail on Monday as the whole episode has embarrassed the governments in the Caribbean nations. In Antigua and Barbuda, Choksi is fighting two cases over his extradition and the revocation of his citizenship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-reaches-antigua-101626319384325.html
