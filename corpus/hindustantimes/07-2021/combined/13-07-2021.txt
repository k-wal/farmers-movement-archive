Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has appointed a task force for the speedy execution of the projects.Anticipating power consumption of Mumbai and its suburbs to rise to 5,000 megawatts by 2024-25, the state has planned to increase the embedded generation of the power by another 1,000 MW in addition to the existing generation of 1,877MW. Similarly, the cope with the demand for power, the state has also decided to lay down transmission lines to enable the import of the power from outside projects and the national grid. The government is also considering power generation through solar energy panels on rooftops of the buildings in the city.“As part of the strengthening of the project, the replacement of the HTLS conductors of Kalwa-Padghe circuits will enable us to increase the transmission capacity to 2,000 MW. State-owned Uran plant’s generation is aimed to increase to 8,00MW by building its capacity and completion of the Kharghar substation by 2024 are some of the measures in that direction. CM Thackeray approved these projects. He has also directed to tap the feasibility of generation of 1,400 MW power through solar energy generated through panels on rooftops of the multi-storey building in Mumbai,” a statement by chief minister’s office stated.Dinesh Waghmare, principle secretary, energy department, said that the state is also giving an extension to the Mumbai-based Tata and Adani projects. “Some of the units of the Trombay and Dahanu power generation plants need life extension as their agreements are on the verge of completion. Apart from it, capacity building of gas-based Uran plant will help to cater the additional supply to the MMR and especially in Navi Mumbai,” he said.The task force appointed under Waghmare will ensure technical and environmental clearances to the projects. “Meeting the rising demand in Mumbai and MMR is a herculean task, especially in Navi Mumbai in the wake of upcoming airport and industrialisation. After the power outage last year, the state government has undertaken projects to increase generation and strengthening the transmission infrastructure to cater for the demand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-strengthen-power-generation-capacity-transmission-infra-101626200994613.html

Presently, all domestic passengers arriving in Mumbai need to carry a negative report of an RT-PCR test conducted 48 hours before commencing the journey.The civic body has also decided that vaccination for students and citizens travelling abroad, and for those travelling for Tokyo Olympics will now take place six days a week at seven dedicated vaccine centres, instead of three days a week. These centres will be dedicated for these beneficiaries on three additional days- Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, until August 31, BMC said in a statement on Friday. These seven vaccination centres are Kasturba Hospital, KEM Hospital in Parel, SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, Dahisar jumbo facility, and Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi.In a circular issued on May 12 this year, the Maharashtra government had imposed restrictions on domestic flyers arriving in Mumbai. While these restrictions were earlier imposed only on passengers arriving from Gujarat, Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala, they were applied to all passengers arriving in Mumbai from any part of the country.In a circular issued on Tuesday, BMC said, “The vaccination drives across the nation have been commenced and many citizens who are fully vaccinated, are requesting to waive off the condition with respect to carrying negative RT-PCR test report.” “Domestic passengers who are fully vaccinated may be exempted from carrying negative RT-PCR test report while arriving in the city of Mumbai,” read the circular.

The call centre was running for the past seven months from a building in south Delhi’s Sultanpur near Fatehpur Beri. The mastermind of the racket is absconding, the police said.“On average, the fraudsters cheated six US citizens daily and accumulated nearly ₹4 crore (5,25,000 USD) from approximately 1,250 citizens during these seven months,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Additional DCP (south) Harsha Vardhan Mandava said they conducted the search after the special staff team received information that an illegal call centre was operating from a building in Sultanpur in south Delhi. After verifying the information, a search was conducted on Monday and an office set-up was found in the building. The employees were caught red-handed trying to dupe people on calls, he said.The people at the call centre were pretending to be employee of Amazon Inc and were using illegal techniques such as VOIP calling, to bypass the legal international long-distance gateways. A total of 26 people were caught, said the additional DCP.“The arrested persons were extorting Amazon customers based in the US by claiming that their Amazon IDs had been hacked and there were illegal transactions. They were tricking the customers into purchasing online gift cards in the name of resolving the issues with their ID. We are now looking for more people involved in the racket,” he said.This is the third major crackdown in the past 20 days on fake call centres that were targeting US citizens. In the past two searches, the police arrested 84 and 95 persons, respectively. The 84 persons, who were arrested from a call centre in Jagatpuri on June 24, also impersonated Amazon customer service providers. The 95 fraudsters arrested in the second search from fake call centres in Kirti Nagar and Mangolpuri were contacting US citizens posing as that country’s social security administration -- they were duping citizens of money by threatening to revoke their social security number (SSN).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-fake-call-centre-busted-in-sultanpur-26-persons-duping-us-citizens-held-101626200875095.html

The camp had started on July 9. In the various sessions, the Sangh leaders discussed the response to the probable third wave of pandemic, upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls and construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.The Sangh also asked the government to prepare well for the third Covid wave. “Extensive arrangements should be made in the country to minimise the impact of the third wave of coronavirus,” said a press statement issued by the Sangh.Discussion was also held on the construction of Ram temple. People aware of the details claimed that Ram Mandir Trust secretary Champat Rai was warned and told that no wrongdoing would be tolerated.The issue of land deals came up for discussion at the meeting and Champat Rai met the Sangh chief over the construction of temple, said people privy to the details. Rai has been in a dock after allegations of irregularities in the purchase of land in Ayodhya. He was told to ensure complete transparency in the construction of Ram temple, they said.Rai in his meeting with Bhagwat sought to assure him that the allegations were baseless and the Ram temple would be built in the next three years, said Mahant Ram Hriday Dass, member of RSS National Guidance Committee.The Sangh leaders also discussed the new population policy the Uttar Pradesh government has launched. Entire leadership supported the policy and said it should be introduced before the UP assembly polls. The bill banning cow slaughter was also reviewed at the camp.“The Sangh supports the population control move by the UP government. This is quite an important development. Saints said this act needed to be replicated on the national basis,” Mahant Dass said.In addition, the Sangh made key changes in the responsibilities of office bearers, a crucial move ahead of the elections in five states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh. Dr Krishna Gopal, who was the Sangh’s pointsman in the BJP, was changed. He was replaced by Sah Sarkaryawah Arun Kumar, who would now coordinate with the BJP.At the same time, the Sangh has also made changes in West Bengal and at level of prant pracharaks. The exercise was based on social engineering as other castes, particularly the OBCs, were given representation, said people aware of the details.The Sangh leaders also gave hints of the inhouse social engineering it has set in motion and mood to emerge as a holistic nationalist body than a mere Hindutva body, they added.Discussions were held on the loss of West Bengal assembly elections as well besides the BJP’s performance in seven other states where it lost or barely clung back to power.Muslim outreach was deliberated upon and it was decided the Sangh would open shakhas (morning or evening assemblies) in Muslim pockets.Further, the Sangh would register a strong presence on the social media and establish a wing on lines of the BJP’s IT cell. The IIT pass outs would get the opportunity of setting up this wing. The Sangh has developed a liking for the Koo app, which it would extensively use.Bhagwat in his weeklong stay met a number of seers, including Jagadguru Rambhadracharya, and those associated with Akhara Parishad. The saints extended full support to the Ram temple construction. Jagadguru Rambhadracharya said he objected to Bhagwat’s “Hindu and Muslims have same DNA remark” and added that the RSS chief (during his meeting) listened to it but did not reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rss-chintan-shivir-deliberates-on-third-wave-assembly-polls-101626200816326.html

Among them, 166 villages do not have any instances of Covid deaths in the same time frame. As per the updated Government Resolution (GR), released on July 7, schools in zones with not a single Covid-19 case in the past one month will be allowed to restart physical classes for students from Class 8-12, after receiving the consent of parents. Since most cities are still recording Covid numbers daily, for the time being, this GR will be implemented in rural Maharashtra only. “Thane district has seven villages with not a single Covid case registered in the first as well as a second wave. In the past few weeks, around 292 villages have not recorded any new Covid case. If this continues for another week, we shall decide to reopen schools in these villages. There have been instances of school dropouts within rural areas as not everyone has access to online education.

The EV charging station has been set up in Turbhe TTC industrial area, while the sub-centre has been proposed at Sector 13 in Airoli. The charging station has 21 AC/DC EV chargers for both two and four-wheelers. These include four DC fast chargers of 15 to 50 kW capacity and 17 AC chargers of 3.5 to 7.5 kW capacity. The vehicles will be charged in 45 minutes. There is also provision for vehicles requiring AC slow charging. Claiming that this was one of the country’s largest EV stations, Desai said, “Setting up EV charging stations is the need of the hour. Electric vehicles are an excellent alternative to petrol and diesel vehicles. Such stations must be encouraged to meet the demand of the future. The government will make efforts to increase their numbers on the road.” He added that the Turbhe EV charging station will be operational 24x7. All the chargers are controlled online and updated by Chargegreen App making them completely secure. Apart from the charging station, CIDCO, has today transferred around 3,000 sq m of land to the state government for the development of the sub-centre. The sub-centre on the leased land will be developed by MIDC.

However, there are not many takers of the vaccine on payment basis and this is just an appeal to the corporate houses to purchase the vaccine from the private hospitals,” said Arun Gupta, principal secretary, health, UT.‘Appealing to corporations not a permanent solution’Meanwhile, Dr RS Sethi, former national vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, said that the purchasing of vaccines by the corporate sector was not a permanent solution to improve vaccination coverage in the UT.“Instead of appealing to the corporations to purchase the vaccine, there should be a system in place wherein private hospitals are allowed to sell the vaccine to other private doctors, who cannot buy a stock of 10,000 doses from the manufactures. Many private hospitals wish to take small quantities of vaccines but they are not allowed to make small orders. Whereas those hospitals having sufficient stock have few takers. If the majority of the doctors in the private sector have doses, the percentage of vaccination will shoot up tremendously,” Dr Bedi said.At the war room meeting, Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, said that 71% of the eligible population had already been given the first dose and 17% were fully vaccinated.“At present, about 55,000 doses are available with government hospitals and 45,000 with private hospitals. Further, about 75,000 doses of vaccines will be received shortly. Health department is going to start door-to-door survey-cum-drive in Dadu Majra and Manimajra for encouraging vaccination among the left-out eligible population with the help of the municipal councillors of these areas.”Badnore also advised the hospitals to upgrade the health infrastructure for paediatrics cases and ensure that separate facilities fully-equipped with paediatric ventilators were created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corporates-should-buy-vaccine-from-private-hospitals-donate-to-govt-chandigarh-administrator-101626200760968.html

What’s happening is that Arthur road jail with a capacity of 800 has no more scope for extension. And the lease of that land is going to end in 2024. Therefore, there is an urgent need for another facility in Mumbai. A 15 acre plot owned by the Women and Child Development department near the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in Chembur has been identified. The chairman of the committee is the home minister,” said ADG Ramanand.While announcing the jail tourism initiative in 2020, which is on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had said that he had proposed jail expansion in Maharashtra.FUNDING OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTIONThere are two methods of funding and undertaking projects, one where the proposal is sent to the government and the funding is provided by the government, and the other where a private entity is deployed called public-private-partnership (PPP). In the PPP method, the government will allow the private player to monetise prison assets in the non-jail areas in exchange for building the jail for free, according to the officer.“This will ensure bigger facilities with no monetary investment for the government. Although, the construction will be done using the Police Housing Corporation, but the private player will be allowed to monetise jail assets,” said ADG Ramanand.Jail assets including land, industries and skill of the inmates.“What remains to be seen is whether the government undertakes the AA or PPP method for these projects,” said ADG Ramanand.NEW PRISONSThe new facilities are in the pipeline at Mumbai, Gondia, Palghar, and Hingoli. A proposal for Pune is yet to be made, although there is no shortage of land for the prison department unlike in other regions.The proposal for Mumbai has been sent and is awaiting government response. The land in Hingoli is yet to be finalised while the land acquisition is pending in Palghar; in Gondia, the funding from the government is awaited.“There is an urgent need in Pune as well. But in Pune, the jail department already owns a huge piece of land. The process will be much easier for Pune and a jail with 5,000 capacity can be built,” said ADG Ramanand.VIDEO CONFERENCEThe ADG has claimed to have made an application to the department of justice, and other stakeholders, to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to allow for recording of evidence through video conferencing.“Even without video conferencing, the production rate of prisoners in court is only 38%. Video conferencing will allow for evidence to be recorded virtually. The number of trails of cases has had major setbacks due to the pandemic. The undertrial population has skyrocketed because of this. In video conferencing, the inmate can also be allowed to interrupt or state his/her side,” said ADG Ramanand.He also mentioned that the pandemic has forced the machinery to lose the prejudice against online functioning, as online classes, lectures, and meetings have become a norm.CANTEEN FACILITY FOR INMATESThe prison department has proposed a canteen facility for inmates with multiple food and consumer product options that are found in a normal department store.Every inmate has an expenditure limit of ₹4,500 per month and is provided with a wage as per their category - skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled on a daily basis.Each inmate has a bank account in which their wages as well as money sent by their family members can be used.The canteen is a long shot but it will supplement food requirements of inmates beyond the food provided by the prison department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/proposal-for-multi-storey-jail-for-undertrials-in-mumbai-sent-to-state-adgp-prisons-101626200754553.html

It will determine the extent of development of antibodies among the different age groups and will also help the state in taking policy decisions,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer.The survey is being conducted on orders from the Uttar Pradesh government that has already commissioned a similar survey in Lucknow. The officials said they would not consider whether the survey participants had been infected previously or not. The samples, taken from equal number of men and women and from different age groups, will be sent to King George’s Medical College (KGMC) in Lucknow for testing, they said.The health department said that the survey will also provide the government with an indicator of whether antibody levels had not developed in some people and the steps that would be required in case of another wave of infections.“The study will also reveal how long the antibodies last in the bodies of different age groups. The higher the antibody levels, the higher the rate of protection against the virus. We will be including primarily front line workers (medical staff, police and district officials) during the study,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.While Covishield has reported an efficacy of 76%, Covaxin recently reported its phase 3 trials to be 77.8% effective. According to experts, antibodies against the virus develop in the body two weeks after the second dose.Earlier serological surveys (determining the level of antibodies) were not exclusively for vaccinated people.In the first serological survey held in August last year in 11 UP cities, around 22% of people had antibodies, also called the prevalence rate. Ghaziabad, which was included in the survey, had a prevalence rate of around 25%. At the time, 1,500 people had been tested per city.In another survey that was held last month, 1,440 people had been tested in the city. “In the survey conducted in June, the state officials have indicated that the prevalence rate was about 60-70%. The report is yet to be made official,” said an official familiar with the development. “The rate of prevalence of antibodies was higher as the survey was conducted immediately after the second wave of infection’s peak that had infected a large number of people in a short span of time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-conduct-antibody-test-for-fully-vaccinated-beneficiaries-101626200635740.html

To be sure, only the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is empowered to decide if schools should be reopened or not. The DDMA last week announced opening of school auditoriums for academic activities, but with up to 50% of their attendance capacity. Rakesh Semalty, head of a government school in West Jyoti Nagar, said it was necessary to call students back to schools in a staggered manner to avoid “serious repercussions”. “These children have been in their homes for around 16 months now... Since a majority of parents and school staff have been vaccinated, we can consider calling senior students back to school in a staggered manner while maintaining physical distancing. Parents have been approaching us, asking us to hold at least one or two classes a week so that there is some involvement for students,” he said. Semalty also said that lack of access to the internet and online devices is also a reason why several parents want in-person classes to resume.A senior education department official, requesting anonymity, said the Delhi government has already started taking feedback from principals and teachers who are connected to the parents through school management committees on the road map to resume in-person classes.“Consultation with stakeholders and conversation within the department on the matter (reopening of schools) has already begun. The agenda of reopening schools are on the table, and we are waiting for feedback from parents during the upcoming PTMs before taking any call. While cases have gone down, we have to take the confidence level of students and parents into account and find out whether they feel confident about returning to school or not,” the official said.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of a government school in Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector-8, said, “Along with counselling parents and sharing inspirational stories, we will be focusing on removing the fear around Covid-19 and mentally prepare children to return to schools, if needed. We will ask parents if they are willing to send their children to school and record data on the matter.”Many private schools have also received requests from parents over holding offline classes. Mena Mittle, vice-president of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said they are waiting for government directives on the matter. “We have been receiving queries from several working parents... Though there are concerns of safety, teachers and parents believe that students need to be allowed to come to school and connect with their teachers to break the cycle of isolation due to the pandemic,” she said.However, some parent groups also raised concerns over reopening of schools. Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents Association, said, “Only those parents who have issues with internet accessibility and devices or those who have to step out for work may be in the favour of offline classes due to their own helplessness. The collapse of the health infrastructure during the second wave and the possibility of children being affected during the third wave doesn’t instil confidence among parents to send their children to school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-cases-declining-schools-await-delhi-govt-directions-to-resume-offline-classes-101626200634532.html

Number of potholes complaints in Mumbai go down, 239 since June||City has witnessed a 76% drop in the number of potholes during 2020-2021, as compared to 2019-2020, reveals a data based on Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s mobile application ‘MyBMC Pothole Fixit.’ Further, since June 1, 2021, a total of 239 potholes have been reported in the city, according to the data.In the city, the majority of potholes are reported during the monsoon following a heavy downpour. According to the data, between April 1 and July 12, 421 complaints of potholes were reported in the city, of these 239 were reported since June 1. Of the total 421 complaints in the ongoing financial year, 265 complaints have been attended and 255 complaints have been closed.To proactively report complaints related to potholes in the city, former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had launched a seven-day pothole challenge. As per the contest, that started on November 1, 2019, the civic body offered a ₹500 cash prize to citizens for reporting potholes. The citizens had to take a selfie with the pothole and report it, and they would be eligible for the cash prize, in case the pothole was not fixed within 24 hours.In the same year, BMC’s mobile application received a total of 5,390 complaints between April 2019 and March 2020. Of these, 3,811 complaints were attended and 3,806 were closed. However, as the country and city went into lockdown by mid-March, the complaints relating to potholes went down in 2020-2021.According to the data, between April 2020 and March 2021, a drastic fall of 1,292 potholes-related complaints were reported in the city, of which, 885 were attended and 877 were closed.Shantanu Kulkarni, director of Probity Soft, whose company has developed the BMC mobile application, said, “The complaints have gone down because of the lockdown. The response after the BMC’s pothole challenge in 2019 was good, however, now as local trains services are not permitted for general public and citizens are working from home, the number of complaints have gone down.”Kulkarni added, “I strongly feel that the BMC like earlier should publicise the usage of their pothole reporting mobile application to get more data on the number of potholes that require to be attended.”The BMC maintains around 2,055km of roads in the city, and every major and minor road is repaired or resurfaced using asphalt or concrete cement from the existing paver blocks. The roads and traffic department were allocated ₹2,279 crore in the ongoing fiscal of 2020-21, which came down to ₹2,231 crore in 2021-22.While the budgetary allocation for the road department has remained almost the same in the ongoing fiscal compared to last fiscal, the BMC has reduced its road improvement and repair targets by almost 45% this year. According to estimates presented in the budget on Wednesday, the BMC proposes to improve the road network of 157km in the city and suburbs during 2021-22, which is less than the target of 289 km set in 2020-21.Meanwhile, corporators have slammed the BMC over the quality of roads in the city, Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in the BMC said, “There is no proper mechanism to track potholes and attend to them. Every year during the monsoon, the city has to face the same old civic issues that include potholes and waterlogging after heavy rainfall. Several roads are taken for repair and maintenance but the number of potholes on it shows how poor the quality is.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lockdown-effect-number-of-potholes-complaints-in-mumbai-go-down-239-since-june-101626200635162.html
13-07-2021||Noida||Amid vaccine shortage, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar forced to curtail drive||The pace of vaccinations has slowed in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar with the Uttar Pradesh government not receiving enough vaccines to supply to the districts.While the vaccination drive had suffered during the second wave of infections, the numbers had picked up since June 21 when the central government took over the vaccine procurement drive and distributed it to the states. From July 1, the state government had mooted a mega vaccination drive to vaccinate 1 million people a day. However, at present the state is vaccinating only about 800,000 people a day.GhaziabadGhaziabad has been forced to scale down its Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVC) from nearly 100 in the last week of June to nearly 60 as the district once again suffered from a shortage of vaccines, officials said on Tuesday. Ghaziabad — which ranks third in the state on inoculations, after Lucknow (1,630,419 doses) and Gautam Budh Nagar (1,360,239 doses) — administered a total of 1,186,328 vaccine doses as of Tuesday morning. “Operations in nearly 30 centres in areas like Loni, Raj Nagar Extension, among others have been suspended temporarily due to vaccine shortage and low turnout. At present, nearly 65 to 70 vaccination centres are operational,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for vaccination in the district. “Nowadays, 8,000-12,000 vaccine doses are available per day.”The district had aimed to vaccinate at least 40,000 people a day.The shortage has hit Ghaziabad’s plan to initiate on-spot registrations for the cluster vaccination (close to home) for all adults. “We have the potential to administer nearly 30,000-40,000 vaccine doses per day, but the shortage has hampered the process. After receiving vaccines, we will scale up the regular vaccination,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad.The district has also reduced special CVCs that had seen low turnouts.“We have also converted four special CVCs — two exclusively for women and the other for parents — to general vaccination centres as the daily coverage at these centres ranged only between 45% and 60%. After the conversion, the turnout at these centres has increased,” said Dr Mathuria.The district now has eight special CVCs thatcater to officials of government departments like railways, post office, revenue department, and labour among others. Meanwhile, two special CVCs for women, and as many for parents of children aged below 12 were converted to general centres.According to data available on Tuesday (July 13), Uttar Pradesh reported 59 fresh Covid-19 cases, 149 discharges and four deaths in the past 24 hours.The active caseload in the state is at 1,479, with total discharges and deaths at 1,683,319 and 22,704, respectively.Gautam Budh NagarIn Gautam Budh Nagar too, the vaccine shortage has slowed the drive and forced the district to suspend walk-in registrations since July 1. The district had aimed to vaccinate at least 40,000 people a day too, which is now at around 6,000 to 9,000.Nearly 60% of the over 1.3 million doses of the vaccines against Covid-19 administered in Gautam Budh Nagar till Monday have gone to those below 45 years, while 25% went to those between 45 and 60 years of age, according to official data.GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj, said that out of nearly 1.6 million people in the district, who are eligible for inoculation, over 70% had been administered at least one dose, while the rest of the beneficiaries were from outside the district. “Out of total doses administered in the district, 38% are women. Had the pace of vaccination not slowed in July, we could have given at least one dose of the vaccines to all the eligible population by the end of this month,” he said. “Due to state-wide paucity of vaccines, the near-to-home vaccination is unlikely to take off before the last week of the month in the district. For kicking off the mega vaccination drive, we need at least 100,000 doses in the first lot. Since at present, the state headquarters don’t have ample stock of vaccines, we have to carry on the vaccination drive with the available stock of vaccines.”Officials said that the shortage is likely to remain till July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/amid-vaccine-shortage-ghaziabad-gautam-budh-nagar-forced-to-curtail-drive-101626200574654.html
13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Conduct senate polls immediately: Punjab to Panjab University||Flagging the delay in the senate elections, the Punjab government’s higher education department has asked Panjab University, Chandigarh, to conduct them immediately.The response from the state government came on Tuesday after the varsity had written to it, seeking permission to set up polling booths for the conduct of polls, which have been pending since August last year.In the letter addressed to the PU registrar, the higher education department has conveyed that the varsity has already been given the permission to set up booths at various colleges in Punjab on the condition that Covid protocol is strictly adhered to during polling. The Punjab government had flagged the delay in February as well.The polling booths of different constituencies of the PU senate are to be set up in Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. The university had sought permission from the states last month.While the Chandigarh administration has already given its nod, the varsity is yet to get the permission from other states to set up polling booths. However, sources said Haryana is in the process to give the permission.The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31, 2020. Elections were to take place in August 2020, but the varsity deferred them due to the pandemic.The polls were later scheduled in April this year after the high court pulled up the vice-chancellor, but the second wave again led to a delay. Last week, the HC had sought the election schedule from the varsity by July 16.PU senate elections: Candidates allege attempts being made to tinker with poll scheduleThe candidates who are contesting the senate elections of Panjab University (PU), including former senators, have alleged that the varsity was trying to tinker with the sequence of the poll schedule of various constituencies.Although the varsity is yet to announce the schedule, 19 candidates have written to the vice-president of India, M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the chancellor of PU, on Tuesday stating that a mala fide attempt was being made to tinker with the sequence of the poll schedule.The candidates, including Anu Chatrath, Rajesh Gill, Ashok Goyal, Harpreet Singh Dua, Keshav Malhotra, Ronki Ram, Jatinder Grover, Navdeep Goyal, Rajat Sandhir and others, have said that it has been an age-old practice to hold elections in the same sequence as announced twice in 2020 and 2021.The development comes after the high court on July 8 had directed PU to place on record the schedule of senate polls by July 16.“The registrar-cum-returning officer, who is supposed to act in an unbiased and objective manner while holding elections, is, reportedly, conniving with the vice-chancellor and his coterie, facilitating their attempts to manipulate the elections by diverting significantly from the age-old practice, violating all principles of morality and statesmanship,” states the letter to the chancellor. The candidates have requested the chancellor to issue instructions to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar that the senate election process may be executed as per the directions issued by the high court, without altering the past practices and sequence of the elections of various constituencies.Varsity officials did not comment on the matter and said that the issue of senate polls was subjudice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/conduct-senate-polls-immediately-punjab-to-panjab-university-101626200457818.html

For the family to have more smartphones than there are members, is commonplace. However, the scene changes dramatically as we move from an urban to a rural setting, where having one phone – and not always a smartphone – being shared by a family of four or five people, is not completely unheard of.Forced by the pandemic and in a bid to keep students safe, schools and studies went online a year ago, and those with PCs, laptops and smartphones, or, blessed with the wherewithal to acquire them, graduated to learning through these gadgets.Imagine how children from rural backgrounds coped with classes and studies. Their participation in school activities has declined remarkably. To put things in perspective, here are a few case studies:A topper stumped by paucityLess than a year ago, Nazia, a Class 7 student of a government school, in Sarojini Nagar block of Lucknow, was the brightest child in her class. Now, she struggles to keep up with her studies only because her family cannot afford devices like a desktop, laptop or even a smartphone.The family of six lives in a single room with a makeshift kitchen and bathroom which they share with three other families in a dilapidated building.The 13-year-old calls up her teachers over the phone and asks them about homework and problems she encounters while studying. Shazia steals time from a busy routine of helping with housework and taking care of her youngest sister to study for a few hours every day and even teaches young children in her locality for free.Poor private school kidsIfra Huzoor Khan, student of St Anjani’s Public School, Rajajipuram, Lucknow, was studying in Class 12 March 2020. In school, she was one of the top rankers, actively participated in all extra-curricular activities, won prizes for her oratory skills and was made the Head Girl.She said, “Life changed, when, due to the lockdown, school started online classes. We had only one smartphone in the house which my father needed to run his shop.” It was a major source of grief that she could not attend any class on Zoom. “On days when my father didn’t need the phone, I called up my teachers to clear doubts. They were extremely encouraging and praised my efforts,” she said.Circumstance-shackled siblingsAnupama, 16, is a high school student at Kesar Vidyapeeth Intermediate College on Zero Road, in Prayagraj. Her younger brother, Mayank Kumar, 14, is a Class 9 student at the same school. However, they don’t have even one smartphone between them to attend online classes. Reason: Their father, Shivbhau Yadav, who is a churmura (roasted puffed rice snack) seller, earns just enough to survive.“We both relied on self-study and a few rare classes we could attend whenever my maternal uncle came to visit us from Kaushambi and lent us his smart phone. We both are desperately waiting for offline classes to begin,” she added. Their teacher, Lalmani Pandey, pays the school fee of the two children and takes care of their other small needs to allow them to continue with their studies. “Anupama is a bright student, always coming first in class. Even last year, when the pandemic forced closure of schools and she could not attend online teaching, she came first,” he said with a smile. An effort in the right directionPrateek Mishra, 13, is a Class 8 student of a government-run upper primary school in Berui village, in the Baharia development block of Prayagraj. His mother, Nirma Devi, is a Class 4 employee and earns ₹2,500 per month – the only earning member of the family. They reside on the campus of Raj Narayan Inter College in Baharia, where Nirma Devi is also employed. She supports her family that includes her three children, including Prateek, her eldest child. “When online teaching began on April 10, 2020, I was accessing it using our simple mobile phone at home. However, one day in mid-June it broke, and I was no longer able to attend online studies and access assignments,” he said. Nirma Devi said that Prateek is a bright student and she did not want him to miss out on his studies. With three months’ payments in her Jandhan bank account, some money that she had saved, she made a down payment to buy a smart phone. The remaining amount was paid over five months. Govt data says...A survey undertaken by the state education department in mid-2020 revealed that as many as 50% of the 1.8 crore students enrolled in government-run primary and upper primary schools spread across 75 districts of UP were unable to access online content during the pandemic-hit academic year. A recent control survey undertaken in 65 districts by the department involving 4,348 students established that despite all efforts just 50% of them were able to access online content. The survey revealed that half of all students were unable to access the content due to poor Net connectivity, lack of devices, or, due to there being just one smartphone in the house, which was needed for other purposes. In Prayagraj, over 2 lakh out of 4.16 lakh students enrolled in 2,477 government-run primary and 1,001 upper primary schools struggled to access online study during the pandemic hit year, concedes Vinod Mishra, district coordinator (training) of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. A key reason for this is believed to be the digital divide that exists in the state.The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)-2018 showed that 91.7% families in rural UP had mobile phones but out of these, only 32.6% had smartphones and internet access. The study was carried out among 600 families each in 70 districts in rural UP. ASER-2019 which covered two districts from UP—Lucknow and Varanasi—showed 94.7% families had mobile phones, but only 48% had smartphones in the state capital. In Varanasi, 56% had smartphones of the 97% families who were covered under the study. Remaining 41% had regular phones without internet facility. The report covered 1,200 rural families in both the districts.

For Class 10, results will be tabulated based on students’ performances in unit tests, half-yearly examinations, and pre-board examinations conducted by schools. The board, however, said each school should watch against “inflation of marks”, and award scores in line with its best performance in Class 10 in the last three academic years -- 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20. The selected year of the previous three, in which the overall pass percentage was the highest, will be the reference year for the schools, and the average marks of the school for 2021 should not exceed the school’s overall average in the reference year.In a letter addressed to all its affiliated schools on Tuesday, CBSE’s controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj said: “Upon data analysis post uploading of marks by schools, it has been observed that while the majority of schools have followed the reference distribution, some schools have not done the same and bunched the marks in upper brackets of the given reference range. For instance, instead of distributing theory marks in the 70-80 range (as per reference year), marks have been bunched between the 77-80 range… This is unfair to the few actually deserving candidates, whose performance will fall in this range of marks.”Directing all such schools to comply with the tabulation policy, CBSE has given a final opportunity to all “defaulter schools”. “All defaulter schools who have not complied with the policy in its true spirit, and awarded marks to students on higher side are being given an opportunity to re-look the marks and redo moderation in accordance with historical performance and given reference range. Besides this, few schools have still not uploaded marks despite many extensions of the last date. Such schools are also being given the last opportunity to upload marks. In case it is observed that the schools do not follow the directions, CBSE, before preparation of result, will moderate the marks to bring the awarded marks as per policy and also initiate action against the schools,” the letter said.Schools can make changes in the online portal, which will remain open between Tuesday and Saturday. “It is also informed that the changes made by the schools in data will be recorded by CBSE. If it is observed that policy has not been followed, CBSE may initiate action against such schools as stipulated in the policy,” the letter added.Some schools, however, said that the CBSE’s formula in terms of reference year was “confusing”. “Due to the complete closure of schools, all internal exams were held in the online mode. The majority of the students have scored marks higher than the reference year set by the CBSE and that’s why it’s happening. Still, schools are trying to do their best in computing the scores,” said the principal of a private school in west Delhi who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbse-warns-schools-against-violating-class-10-assessment-policy-101626200155979.html
13-07-2021||Lucknow||New vehicle registrations fell in UP in last financial year||The registration of new two-wheelers (motorcycles and scooters) in Uttar Pradesh recorded a sharp decline by more than 35% and that of four-wheelers (cars) by around 11 % in the last financial year, a recent report prepared by the transport department shows. However, the sale of new bikes and cars was least affected in many so-called poor and backward districts of eastern and Bundelkhand regions of the state. Some of these districts even registered a positive growth in the registration of new cars and the decline in new registration of automobiles there was only comparatively lower.The report shows that against 29,06,104 two-wheelers registered in the state during 2019-2020, only 18,61,935 bikes and scooters were registered in 2020-21, the drop being 35.93%. The registration of cars was comparative better off at 2,59,412 in 2020-21 though it was less by 10.58% in comparison to the year 2019-2020 when 2,90,108 new four-wheelers were registered in the state.The sharpest fall in two-wheelers was recorded at 53.61% in the Sravasti district followed by Rampur (48.83%), Bahraich (48.15%), and Ayodhya (47.16%). Lucknow recorded 33.74% minus growth in registration of two-wheelers in 2020-21 vis-à-vis 2019-20. There were registered only 88,985 two-wheelers in the district during the last financial year compared to 1,34,287 new bikes and scooters registered in 2019-20.In the four-wheeler segment, Amethi recorded the sharpest fall at 29.05% followed by Gonda (28.85%) and Unnao (28.72%). The decrease in the number of registration of new cars in Lucknow was by 7.61%. A total 41,065 new cars were registered in Lucknow in 2020-21 against 44,449 new cars registered a year earlier. Lalitpur, Hamirpur Balia, Banda, Mau, Devaria, Sant Kabir Nagar Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Varanasi and Badaun were probably the only districts in the state to record a positive growth in the registration of new cars. The growth was highest at 7.23% in Badaun closely followed by 7.03% in Sant Kabir Nagar and 4.65% in Balia. “Incidentally, most districts showing a positive trend even in the pandemic year were the poor and backward, and barring Badaun, hailed from the backward regions of eastern UP and Bundelkhand,” pointed out a transport official requesting anonymity. “None of the districts with positive growth was from the affluent NCR or western UP,” he added. These are also the districts where the fall in the registration of new vehicles is comparatively less than that registered by the most affluent districts. However, there was not a single district to show a positive growth in the registration of new two-wheelers in the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-vehicle-registrations-fell-in-up-in-last-financial-year-101626199915157.html
13-07-2021||Gurugram||Spas under police scanner over illegal activities, norm violations||The police on Tuesday constituted four teams to keep a check on spas after receiving several complaints of illegal activities at such establishments across the city.According to the police, over 20 owners and managers of spas were booked in the last 10 days for operating without permission, even before the government allowed their resumption on Sunday, for exceeding 50% capacity and operating beyond 8pm, in violation of the latest lockdown orders, and running prostitution rackets in the guise of massage packages.KK Rao, the commissioner of police for Gurugram, said that the teams have been formed to check illegal activities taking place in some spas. “We have asked spa owners to maintain records and not to indulge in any illegal activity, as some were found conducting illegal activities in the garb of spa business. Recently, spa owners and managers were booked for operating their centres even during the lockdown. With the new order to operate at 50% capacity, it is important to keep a close watch on their activities,” he said.All station house officers were asked to compile a list of spas in their area and to check their records regularly. They were also warned of strict action in case of laxity or cahooting with spa owners.As per the order issued on Sunday by Vijai Vardhan, the state chief secretary, spas have been allowed to open from 6am to 8pm, with appropriate Covid-19 safeguards, and operate at 50% of their capacity.The police will also check the verification status of staff deployed at spas and those found working without certification will also be booked, said Rao. Plainclothes personnel are also deployed near commercial complexes and areas where maximum spas are operational, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/spas-under-police-scanner-over-illegal-activities-norm-violations-101626199136402.html

Khattar was in the city to address a grievance redressal session on Tuesday and made the statement while answering a query regarding the underprivileged population being missed out from the drive due to the ongoing shortage.First dose inoculations at government health centres have remained suspended for the past few days. On Wednesday too, only the second shot will be administered, as the health department will hold vaccinations at only six health centres. Officials said that 200 Covaxin doses will be given at five health centres, at Badshshpur, Tigra, Manesar, Chauma and Chanderlok, while 200 Covishield doses will be given at the Sector 31 polyclinic.“Vaccination progress of Gurugram is satisfactory as almost 15.5 lakh (1.55 million) have been administered vaccine out of the 25 lakh (2.5 million) population in the district. Despite the progress, for reaching out to the poor population, the chief medical officer will permit holding the vaccination camps,” said Khattar, while addressing the media after the grievance redressal meeting.Ravinder Jain, an advocate, raised the vaccination issue during the meeting, citing privileges being given to certain sections of society.It is for the first time in more than two years that a complaint regarding the health department was placed during the grievance committee meeting, which is held every month by the chief minister in the district to resolve issues related to land encroachment, industrial development and electricity supply, among others.Many people who work as daily wage labourers and servants have been facing difficulties in getting vaccinated over the past few days, as they are unaware of the vaccination schedule at health facilities. According to the chief medical officer for Gurugram, Dr Virender Yadav, the first dose inoculations will be suspended and second doses will be given only at a few sites. “Vaccination camps will be increased based on the supply of doses. The department was running a mobile vaccination van until last week to increase the coverage among the poor population,” said Yadav.The CM said that vaccines are issued to the state by the Central government based on the population count. Sputnik V inoculations have also started in the district and the supply will increase as more vaccine contenders will enter the market, he said.As per the data available with the health department, 1,587,152 doses of vaccines have been administered in the district. On Tuesday, about 17,187 vaccine shots were administered after the health department received around 15,000 doses of Covishield on Monday night. At least 12,180 doses were administered at government health centres, while 5,007 jabs were administered at private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khattar-assures-of-special-camps-to-vaccinate-underprivileged-101626199135177.html
13-07-2021||Gurugram||Water shortage for 15 days but no resolution, say DLF-3 residents||Residents of DLF Phase-3 complained of water shortage for the past 15 days, due to which they are buying water from private tankers at exorbitant rates. They alleged that the problem occurs every summer, but that the authorities concerned have failed to provide relief despite repeated complaints over the past few years.Even as residents alleged that the issue has worsened this year due to an increase in population, the developer, DLF, and the civic agency concerned, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (DLF), denied allegations of short supply.Achal Malhotra, the president of V Residents Empowerment and Welfare Society, said that basic requirements are not being met due to a severe shortage of water. “We have to depend on private tankers for water supply as our pleas to the GMDA, district administration and the developer failed to elicit any response. The residents are told by GMDA that the problem is with local distribution, while the developer says the former is not supplying adequate water. We have nowhere to go,” said Malhotra.On June 25, the association wrote to the Gurugram district administration also in this regard. “The matter has been raised with DLF and the civic agencies. DLF blames Huda, GMDA etc for supplying insufficient water. The agencies concerned hold DLF responsible for inadequate storage facilities and flawed distribution system. In this process of blame game, it is the DLF residents who are suffering the most,” an excerpt from the letter read.A resident, requesting anonymity, said that residents of the area have held protests over water shortage every year since 2013. “The residents came to live in the colony to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi. They expected peace of mind and comfortable life, but contrary to that, poor infrastructure has made life difficult,” the resident said.Prem Chopra, another resident, said that people were finding it difficult to perform basic household chores for the past two to three weeks. “Living on water supplied from private tankers is not feasible,” he said.David Amalraj, the senior vice-president, DLF Estate Developers Limited, said that they have been supplying adequate water to residents throughout the year and there is no complaint of shortage. “It is only during peak summer that for a couple of days, shortage of water supply happens and that too, due to reduction in water supplied by the GMDA. If there is adequate water available, then there would be no shortage. We have also held meetings with the authority to resolve the issue,” said Amalraj, adding that the company arranges tankers.However, the GMDA officials denied a shortage in supply. “The amount of water fixed for the colony, as per the service agreement, is being supplied. There has been no problem with our supply system and adequate water is being supplied. The developer should look into their distribution system if there is a problem because we are supplying more than the stipulated amount,” said Abhinav Verma, executive engineer of GMDA, who is responsible for the area.Verma said that water from the Basai water treatment plant is pumped through the Sector 16 pumping station to the area.Members of the residents’ association said that the recent decision of the government to allow four storeys for constructions on a plot would adversely impact them, as infrastructure for water, power and sewage was already being stretched. “The city was planned and infrastructure laid for a population of 1 million and now, the numbers are more than 3 million. With the number of new apartments coming up due to this decision, the infrastructure is going to crumble,” a resident said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/water-shortage-for-15-days-but-no-resolution-say-dlf-3-residents-101626199015164.html
13-07-2021||Gurugram||Sohna gang-rape: Victim’s neighbour assaulted, paraded for supporting her||A day after the police booked four men in Sohna for allegedly raping a Dalit woman, henchmen of the suspects assaulted a neighbour of the victim for supporting her to file a case against the suspects and paraded him in a semi-naked state across the village on Monday. The police booked 40 men in connection with the incident.According to the police, the suspects threatened villagers against supporting the woman and dragged the neighbour, a 40-year-old man who runs a private school, from inside the school premises. They entered the school, assaulted him, undressed him and paraded him through the village while issuing threats to villagers, the police said.Based on the man’s complaint, a case was registered at Sohna police station under sections 147 (riot), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (assault), 379A (snatching), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 506 (criminal intimidation)of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act on Tuesday.On Sunday, four persons were booked for allegedly holding an 18-year-old Dalit woman hostage for nine days from June 30 and raping her. They allegedly injected her with sedatives every day, the police said, adding that the woman’s shoulders were swollen due to the jabs and she has been admitted to a hospital for the past two days.The 40-year-old man said that he fell unconscious during the attack and found himself locked inside the school when he came to his senses, after about an hour. “They left me thinking I was dead,” the man said, adding that the attackers also damaged the school.He received medical treatment and is currently stable, the police said.The complainant alleged that the suspects also threatened to sexually assault the women of his family. “Being a neighbour, I helped them (rape victim’s family), for which the accused assaulted me and issued threats,” he told the police, alleging that the group was trying to turn the case into one of caste divisions.Sandeep Mallik, the assistant commissioner of police (Sohna), said, “We are investigating it. Proper action will be taken against those who are guilty based on the facts.”Meanwhile, the four suspects in the gang-rape case remained untraceable, the police said. On Tuesday, the police constituted three crime teams to track them through CCTV footage from Ballabhgarh and Faridabad, after their locations were traced by a cybercrime team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sohna-gang-rape-victim-s-neighbour-assaulted-paraded-for-supporting-her-101626198775188.html
13-07-2021||Gurugram||Rain brings along waterlogging, power outages to Gurugram||Several parts of the city were waterlogged while a few localities suffered power outages following three hours of rainfall on Tuesday morning, as the first spell of the monsoon hit the Millennium City. Areas around Rajeev Chowk, Subhash Chowk, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, sectors 9A and 10, Shivaji Park and Basai Road were the worst affected.The underpasses in the city as well as the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, which were inundated following spells of rain over the past few years, largely remained unaffected.According to a weather report issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday evening, Gurugram received 51.6mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours. As per the district-wise season rainfall status of Haryana issued by the IMD, the normal rainfall range for Gurugram during the monsoon, till mid-July, is 110.8mm, which indicates that the district is still suffering from a 61% deficit in rainfall for the season. Officials of the IMD predicted that the rain will intensify over the weekend.Even as the rain started around 7am and subsided by 10am, accumulated rainwater in the affected areas receded only by 1pm. In Basai Road, Sector 10 and CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, water accumulated up to the knee level, with civic agencies scrambling to resolve the issue.Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) cited localised factors for waterlogging in these areas. “The problem with both Basai Road and Sector 10 is geographical, rather than an inherent drainage issue. They are among the lowest points in the city, due to which rainwater from higher points of Gurugram accumulates there in high quantities. Using motorised pumps and pressure machines, we were able to channel rainwater out of these areas in a few hours after rains subsided,” said Ramesh Sharma, superintending engineer of the MCG.Before the start of the monsoon, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), MCG and the district administration had identified 113 locations across the city that were susceptible to waterlogging. Sharma said that joints teams of MCG and GMDA officials were deployed at the waterlogging-prone points, with motor pumps, suction tankers and bucket machines, to ensure that rainwater recedes within 30 minutes after rainfall subsides.At Subhash Chowk, opposite the Sadar police station, the carriageway leading to Bakhtawar Chowk was also heavily inundated. A team of MCG officials could be spotted opening a manhole at the spot, after which rainwater receded quickly.The civic agencies, in their joint drainage plan, had identified problem areas for both Rajiv Chowk and CH Bakhtawar Singh Road. At Rajiv Chowk, especially near the Mini Secretariat area, there is an absence of a proper drainage outlet and temporary pumps have been installed in the area to mitigate waterlogging, said officials, while at CH Bakhtawar Sing Road, estimates for the proposal for laying stormwater drain between CH Bakhtawar Singh Road and Sohna Road is under process.The GMDA and MCG, in their report, stated that they will take up the engineering work in September after the monsoon.“I could see heavy rainwater accumulation along CH Bakhtawar Singh Road from my house and decided to use Sohna Road instead to head towards Delhi. However, even at Rajiv Chowk, there was rainwater accumulation. Fortunately, I was able to pass the stretch without my vehicle stalling,” said Anand Rungta, a resident of Sector 47.Officials of the GMDA said that waterlogging was reported only from a few places in the city, with water receding from the roads within 15-20 minutes after the rain. “We a received a complaint of waterlogging only from Sector 9A on Tuesday and that was also because of an issue in the sewerage line. There is a sewage treatment plant in that area, where an electrical failure was reported, due to which the sewage line was shut for over an hour. Due to this, sewage water was overflowing, but stormwater was drained out within 15-20 minutes after the rain stopped on Tuesday morning,” said a senior official with the infrastructure-II division of GMDA.The Gurugram traffic police issued alerts on social media, cautioning commuters about waterlogging on CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, Basai Road and at Rajiv Chowk, and advising them to avoid these stretches.“Around 1,100 traffic police officials were deployed across the city, with a focus on waterlogging points. All our staff were at their respective locations before the rains started. Due to the low volume of traffic, following the second Covid-19 wave, we were able to divert traffic without much hindrance and there were no major snarls anywhere in the city,” said Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).Power outages were also reported in several parts of the city, including sectors 40, 48 and parts of Old Gurugram, where residents alleged that supply was cut from 7am till noon. “As soon as it started raining, there was a power outage. We were informed that a local transformer had developed an issue due to which power supply had been cut. Electricity only returned around 2.45pm,” said Akshay Yadav, a resident of Sector 48.A senior official of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), said, “A tree had fallen on the 11kv overhead power line in Sector 40, while in Sector 48, a private agency was carrying out cable work and the underground electric cables were affected. Both of these were fixed by early afternoon and power was resumed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rain-brings-along-waterlogging-power-outages-to-gurugram-101626198716315.html
13-07-2021||Gurugram||Rainfall brings down mercury levels in Gurugram||A three-hour spell of light rainfall in Gurugram from 7am on Tuesday brought down the mercury level in the city. The maximum temperature was recorded at 30.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which was five degrees below the normal, while the minimum temperature was recorded at 23.1 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees below the normal. This was the first spell of rain in the city this monsoon and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced the arrival of monsoon in Delhi-NCR. Officials of the IMD said that rain will intensify in the city from July 17 and an alert in this regard has already been issued. According to the weather warning issued by IMD, a “yellow alert” requesting authorities to be prepared has been issued for July 17, with predictions of thunderstorms and lightning at isolated locations. AK Singh, the director of the meteorological centre at Chandigarh, said, “On Tuesday, monsoon advanced to Delhi-NCR and remaining parts of Haryana and Punjab. At present, there is a light rain forecast for Wednesday, after which rain activity will increase after July 17. An alert has also been issued so that authorities concerned are prepared.” The IMD, in a statement on Tuesday morning, said, “In association with the continued prevalence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal in the lower levels since past four days, enhanced cloud cover and scattered to fairly widespread rainfall, the southwest monsoon has further advanced into remaining parts of the country including Delhi, remaining parts of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Thus, the southwest monsoon has covered entire country on 13th July, against the normal date of 8th July.” According to the weekly forecast of the IMD, one or two spells of rain or thundershowers are likely from July 14-17. Over the next few days, the maximum temperature is expected to remain between 32°C and 35°C, and the minimum temperature is likely to be around 24°C. Meanwhile, the rainfall ensured that the air quality in Gurugram was in the satisfactory zone for the third consecutive day on Tuesday, with an air quality index of 63. The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in the satisfactory category over the next five days, according to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi weather bulletin issued on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rainfall-brings-down-mercury-levels-in-gurugram-101626198715012.html

The duo had received funds from their Pakistan-based handler through ‘hawala’ network to arrange explosives and other things for this purpose, said police.UP ATS officials had earlier claimed that the two terror suspects were in touch with a Pakistan-based handler through a special messenger application after being radicalised online. A senior police official said the initial probe hinted that the duo arrested from Lucknow and their accomplices were getting funds through different sources. As many as 11 bank accounts of different people were under the scanner for allegedly being used for transferring funds to these suspects, he said. Though the two terror suspects visited Kanpur, the report regarding four Kanpur residents funding them was found fake. The ATS team was now tracking the money trail, said the official. “The reason behind their Kanpur visit is yet to be ascertained. The sources and the amount of money received by them are also to be confirmed,” he emphasised. On Tuesday morning, the ATS had taken custody of Minhaz Ahmad and Maseerudeen for 14 days to interrogate them about the source of funds and their other accomplices. The duo will be in custody till July 26. They will be taken to Kanpur to extract more information about their visits to the city, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alqaeda-module-busted-in-lucknow-terror-suspects-were-working-on-attack-plan-for-6-months-say-police-101626198654508.html

While keeping the submissions made by the state government on record, a division bench comprising justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Gautam Chaudhari directed to put up this case on July 16for further hearing. As per direction of the court dated July 8, the UP DGP filed a counter affidavit on Monday. The state counsel on the basis of the counter affidavit informed the court that some action ha been taken against the accused police officers, including sub-inspector Sunil Kumar Sharma and investigation officer Ram Naresh Singh and a preliminary inquiry was also being conducted. The state counsel further stated that up to date status of the matter would be placed before this court on the next date fixed and on which date Advocate General of UP would also appear before the court. Earlier, on July 8, after taking into account the injury reports and FIR filed by ex-soldier of Indian Army, the court had observed that “prima facie, it shows a very sorry state of affairs, police atrocities and a breach of fundamental rights of the petitioner by the accused police officials.” Emphasizing that the matter was serious and required serious consideration of the court, it had directed the UP DGP to file a counter-affidavit by means of his personal affidavit, indicating the action taken in the matter. To recall, on May 2, Resham Singh, along with his mother and two sisters was going from Pilibhit to Lakhimpur Kheri when they were stopped by the police officials at around 9 am. The police then asked for the papers of the car in which they were travelling. Allegedly, since it was taking some time to sort out the papers, the police officials abused the victim and his mother and two sisters. The victim asked the police officials to not abuse them and also informed that he was a retired army personnel. This infuriated the police who threatened the victim and his family members and then started abusing and beating the victim with lathis. Allegedly, the police officials also beat his mother and sisters and took them to the police station without any woman police officer. At the police station, the victim was disrobed and tied on a cot and brutally beaten up by the police officials for two continuous hours. They also gave him third degree torture only to satisfy their ego, the petitioner alleged. Thereafter, he lodged an FIR against the erring officials and took treatment in the army hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sit-constituted-to-probe-ex-army-man-s-torture-state-govt-tells-hc-101626197874380.html

13-07-2021||Patna||Farmers to get financial aid for crops damaged by Cyclone Yaas||Farmers in Bihar, who lost their standing rabi, maize and garma seasonal crops during the recent Cyclone Yaas, would be compensated for the damage as a proposal of ₹99 crore has been prepared by the state agriculture department after carrying a crop damage survey. The cyclone had hit the eastern Indian states, including Bihar, from May 26 to 30. The agriculture department’s survey report has assessed that thousands of farmers lost their standing crops in 73,000 hectares of land spread in 16 districts. Sources said the proposal has been sent to the disaster management department for vetting and would be put before the cabinet soon for approval. “Our field officers in 16 districts affected by the cyclone carried the survey to assess crop damage. A proposal has been sent to the disaster management for compensation worth ₹99 crore. It is under process and will get approval soon,” said, agriculture department secretary N Saravana Kumar. Under the compensation package, each selected farmer would get ₹6,800 per hectare for non-irrigated land against crop damages while ₹13,500 per hectare would be given to selected farmers who suffered crop damages on irrigated land. As per norms, the damages should be minimum of 33% of standing crops to qualify for the compensation. The total number of farmers to be benefitted from the compensation package is still unknown as the list of beneficiaries is under process. “Once the approval of the compensation proposal comes, we will start the disbursements to farmers immediately,” said a senior official. Officials said the cyclone had caused extensive damage to standing garma crops, mainly pulses, besides some varieties of paddy and maize. The garma crops are sown during March and harvested by June between the main Rabi and Kharif seasons. Certain medicinal plants are also sown during garma season. Meanwhile, the agriculture department has started giving fresh seeds to farmers who suffered damages of seedlings of paddy and other Kharif crops in the floods in four districts, including the Tirhut region. “We are carrying the assessment of damage to seedlings of paddy and other crops in four flood-hit districts and started giving fresh seeds to affected farmers for alternative crops,” said the secretary, agriculture. He also said that the department has started assessing damages to sugarcane crops in districts like Muzaffarpur and East Champaran, where floods have affected some areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/farmers-to-get-financial-aid-for-crops-damaged-by-cyclone-yaas-101626193614123.html

In a tweet, Modi has also asked the government to stop the vulgar display of women in the caged vehicles during wedding proceedings and the firings during celebrations. “A large portion of the population in the state has been using Bhojpuri and Magahi languages and people are emotionally attached to their mother tongue. However, these languages are reportedly being used in vulgar videos in the name of promoting regional culture. It’s quite shocking and needs to stop,” Sushil Kumar Modi said. People who have been using these languages must be feeling ashamed of the videos with obnoxious content. Women too must have been feeling embarrassed, he added. “Government in the state has already been maintaining zero-tolerance regarding the violation of women’s rights and dignity and liquor was banned here mainly because of these reasons. Why can’t these kinds of video productions be banned?” he asked. The former deputy CM said apart from the vulgar videos, there have also been reports of obscene displays of women during the wedding processions. “How can this be allowed? Baaratis or processions have been a traditional part of weddings in our society, but putting women into cage-like vehicles for entertainment of guests cannot be justified,” he said. There must be a provision of strict action against all those who indulge in a vulgar display of women during marriage processions and in creating vulgar videos, Modi said. Meanwhile, appreciating the former Deputy CM’s reactions over vulgar videos, Patna-based folk singer Lokesh Kumar Singh said that the trend of creating sizzling videos in Bhojpuri has picked up momentum in the last few years. “Video makers create the content and upload it on social media. There’s no tension of censorship or other restrictions. While the production cost is low, viewership is quite high,” he said. Though there have been resentments among some people, video makers hardly bother for these things, he added. Shashi Yadav, state secretary of the All India Progressive Women’s Association, said, “We do know where to complain. Earlier, women activists used to protest even against the vulgar posters put on display in the city. However, we are yet to find a platform to protest against the vulgar videos,” she said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ban-obnoxious-display-of-women-in-vulgar-videos-sushil-modi-to-state-govt-101626193434124.html

Muslim MLAs of Seemanchal, who sharply reacted over the new population policy of Uttar Pradesh, have extended their support to the Bihar chief minister.Araria Congress MLA Avidur Rahman while appreciating Nitish Kumar’s stand over the issue said “We too want to tackle the problem through education and not through legislation.” However, he admitted that the rising population is a problem for the country.Bihar president of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Akhatarul Iman said, “There should be a nationwide debate on whether the rising population is a boon or bane for India to feel the pulse of the common people in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seemanchal-muslim-mlas-support-nitish-s-views-on-population-control-policy-101626193374105.html
13-07-2021||Patna||Differences in Bihar NDA over need of population law||The NDA in Bihar seems to be a divided house over the need for a population law in the state after its neighbouring state’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced to bring in a law.The two major alliance partners of the NDA, the BJP and the JD(U), hold a diametrically opposite view on the issue. Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday had said that laws alone can’t help check the population. “It was found after a lot of research that the rate of reproduction comes down effectively if women are educated. Bihar has experimented with it by promoting education among the girls and achieved success. If it continued, the state would have negative growth in population after 2040,” said Kumar and gave the example of China to support his point. “In China too, a decision was taken regarding one to two children, now see what is happening there. The biggest thing is that when women are fully educated and aware, then the fertility rate will automatically decrease,” he said.Bihar’s Panchayati Raj Minister Samrat Choudhary put CM Nitish in a dock by saying that the CM has made the law applicable in municipal bodies. “It is very clear that population control law should be implemented in this country. In Bihar, this law is already applicable in the municipal body. Now is the time that it should be implemented in Panchayats also,” said Choudhary. “Now the time has come that the two-children norm should be introduced in panchayat elections,” he said while underlining that “any such provision could be introduced only from next rural local bodies polls to be held in 2026 if there is a consensus,” he added.Bihar’s deputy chief minister Renu Devi and other party leaders do not agree with Kumar’s views and vociferously demanded a law to check the population. “For population control, there is a need to make men aware than women because there is a lot of fear among men about sterilisation. In many districts of Bihar, the rate of sterilisation is only 1%,” said the deputy CM.Union minister Giriraj Singh too rejected Nitish Kumar’s theory. “Population policy is the need of the country. Caste, religion is not an issue of politics. The way population is becoming a hindrance in development, in this situation population control law is necessary. The population control law of the Yogi government is a big step,” said Singh at Lakhisarai. Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai, who is on a tour to Bihar said that demand for the law is coming from various corners. “The government is studying all aspects,” said Rai. The chief minister, who found himself cornered by the BJP and his party workers, got the support of Congress. Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathod said that the party agrees with the words of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Population control in the country should be done with awareness.Incidentally, this is not the first time that the BJP and the JD(U) have differed on issues. Earlier, after objecting to CAA, the party voted in favour of the government. The RJD attacked the chief minister. “If he is opposed to BJP’s stand, he should leave the party immediately,” said RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/differences-in-bihar-nda-over-need-of-population-law-101626193314053.html

CRPF thanked the dog for his bravery and sacrifice, which helped save a team of CoBRA commandos from the powerful blast. “His selfless sacrifice will be never forgotten and will always be remembered as an ACT OF VALOR. Shaheed DRONE was cremated with guard of honour and as per laid down procedure of the force,” a statement from CRPF said on Tuesday.Officials said the incident happened at 7 am when a joint team of the 203 Cobra Batallion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Jharkhand police was conducting an operation following specific information about Maoists movement in the forested mountainous pocket.The security forces had killed a suspected member of the CPI (Maoists) in the same area on May 31 and recovered arms and literature, officials said.“A specific operation was being conducted on Tuesday morning in the same area by the joint forces along with the dog squad and the bomb disposal and destruction squad (BDDS). During the operation, the team came under [the] impact of an IED [blast] in which swan Drone was martyred while its handler Vishwajit Kumbhkar got injured.

The students who tend to run from pillar to post on the event day every year had a different schedule in the last 15 days as they were busy compiling the audio and video clips and the event premiered on July 11.“Initially, we had planned to conduct the regatta offline, like every other year. We were ready for the event, but just a week before, restrictions were imposed and all our plans seemed to go in vain. We didn’t want to break the legacy of 92 years and hence decided to go online. Since regatta had never been virtual before, we had no idea how to go about implementing it,” said Siddhi Walunj, secretary, regatta.“I think the biggest challenge we faced was figuring out how to incorporate the shows, all of which we had never imagined being conducted online, without losing the essence of the festival. Realising that regatta will be incomplete without any boats in the water, we chose to carry out the passes of boats representing each show. Recording these and arranging the inaugural ceremony in the presence of dignitaries, following the Covid-19 restrictions, took around 14-15 days. All the efforts put into compiling the clips by our team finally bore fruit,” added Walnuj.The inaugural ceremony was hosted on July 2 with a limited number of guests and participants.Members from the event organising team said, “The unforeseen Covid-19 situation made it seem nearly impossible to host the regatta at first. While nothing replaces the feeling of practising together for the fest, social distancing measures sort of deprived the students of their beloved boat club. But it was indeed an acid test of the team’s managerial skills as well as the flexibility in decision-making. With the support of our well-wishers, we were able to pull off the regatta with massive success amid the crisis”.The event saw the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) of Amphenol India and the chief guest of the fest, Robert John, president of Boat Club, Dr BB Ahuja, the vice-president of Boat Club, Dr NA Hedao, regatta in-charge Dr VK Haribhakta and other faculty members.Regatta’s title sponsor this year was ‘Amphenol Interconnect’ with the Associate Sponsor ‘Bhate & Raje Construction Co Pvt Ltd.’Undoubtedly, Regatta is a visual treat for its audience, but there are some other perks to it too.It is a wonderful opportunity for the students to get introduced to water sports like rowing, kayaking, and canoeing and pursue them at a professional level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/college-of-engineering-pune-s-annual-regatta-fest-goes-virtual-101626187074542.html

Seeking directions to prevent the death of parrots, advocate and social activist HC Arora alleged that on June 11, nearly 400 parrots died in the compound of the office of the Faridkot deputy commissioner due to a chemical having been sprayed on jamun trees. Also read: NGT can’t ‘short shrift’ health hazards posed by plastic bottles: Supreme CourtHe said that such deaths have been taking place every year since 2017and this has been reported in the media but no remedial action has been taken. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel in its July 9 order observed that from the material filed, it is difficult to give a clear finding as to why the death of the parrots is taking place. “However, the reason for the death of such a large number of birds may need to be looked into. Accordingly, we direct the chief wildlife warden, Punjab, in coordination with the environment department or any other expert, to look into the matter and take remedial action,” the order reads. A copy of the order has been sent to CWW, Punjab, and the environment secretary of Punjab by e-mail for compliance. The district administration claimed that the parrots died due to a sand storm and not because of any chemical spray. Arora refuted the claim saying that nowhere else in Faridkot town was any parrot found dead except under jamun trees at the DC office. “On the basis of the records maintained by Shankar Sharma, a bird lover of Faridkot, the death of a large number of parrots has been taking place in Faridkot town for the past five years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-asks-punjab-chief-wildlife-warden-to-probe-faridkot-parrot-deaths-101626178914360.html

We have to close vaccination centres because of lack of vaccines,” he said. The vaccination drive had picked up pace after the policy change June 21 onwards where 75% of the vaccines manufactured in the country was being purchased by the Centre and distributed to states as opposed to states buying the doses at a differential, higher pricing for those between the ages of 18 and 45 years.

We are vaccinating the maximum number of people as and when we are receiving the vaccines.” Delhi had administered about 125,000 doses till Tuesday evening, according to CoWIN dashboard. Talking about the low number of Covid-19 cases – 45 cases reported on Monday, the lowest in the last fifteen months – the minister said people must continue to take precautions. “Covid-19 cases have come down sharply in Delhi but I still urge people to take complete precautions and wear masks at all times. We saw a similar situation back in January-February...These are not the times to assume that cases have gone down so they won’t spike again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccine-doses-near-end-delhi-might-shut-centres-tomorrow-101626178613736.html

13-07-2021||Bangalore||Lighthouse I The changing dynamics of BJP in Tamil Nadu||There is a subtle push for the change of governor for Tamil Nadu. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seriously reviewing its strategy after the massive victory of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in the 2021 assembly elections. The BJP is finding it hard to reconcile itself to having little access to proxy control of running the state administration and wants a more aggressive tactician as a governor. The elevation of Annamalai, an erstwhile police officer, as the president of the state BJP unit and the appointment of L Murugan as minister of state (MoS) are intended to consolidate caste and sub-regional identities with a long-term gameplan of divide and rule in Tamil Nadu politics. During the last five years, BJP has enjoyed the reign of proxy rule in Tamil Nadu with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in power and the complete turnaround in the politics of Puducherry through the office of lieutenant governor.Also Read | Kanimozhi dismisses reports of TN divisionThe office of governor in Indian politics has always been an instrument of coercive influence for the ruling party at Centre. The relevance of this office has also been debated in recent decades. We may not be able to do away with this institution given the colonial nature of political education that our ruling elites have imbibed and the useful negative functions of this office comparable to the role of viceroy between the colony and the empire. The BJP has gone further to fill this office with former party veterans and pracharaks (propagandists) from the RSS.According to the Indian constitution, the primary function of the governor is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law as incorporated in their oath of office under Article 159 in the administration of the state affairs. All their actions, recommendations and supervisory powers (under Article 167C, Article 200, Article 213, Article 355, etc.) over the executive and legislative entities of a state shall be used to implement the provisions of the constitution. It is necessary to observe that the governor is not permitted to take any decision on his own without the state cabinet’s advice when an elected government is in charge under the provisions of Part VI of the constitution.The political functions delivered by C Vidyasagar Rao as additional charge of Tamil Nadu besides being the governor of Maharashtra during the critical period of Jayalalithaa’s illness and her passing away were of pure political opportunism, exploiting the circumstances of chaos, confusion and uncertainty within the AIADMK, choking the DMK as an active opposition through backhand checkmates and consolidation of control for the BJP in Tamil Nadu politics by keeping the AIADMK government on ventilator through subversion and sabotage of legal and constitutional procedures.The role and office of governor, after the demise of Jayalalithaa and under the leadership of Edappadi Palanisamy, has been applied for everything under the sky from bridging the factions within the AIADMK to forging allies in local politics. The governor has emerged as the first and last word from high appointments at the universities to managing party and political crisis for the ruling party under the eagle eyes of the BJP key state unit members and RSS stalwarts in the state. The BJP has picked a handful of at least five state universities through the privileges and prerogatives of the governor as the chancellor, including the prestigious University of Madras and the Anna University (for Engineering and Technical Education). After Rao, Banwarilal Purohit has been facilitating the penetration for the BJP in Tamil Nadu with the critical access and movement for the party inside the corridors of power in a state, where it did not have a single member in the state legislature until recently or control over any local bodies.The BJP in Tamil Nadu, under the solemn presence of the governor, has been conducting itself like a parallel government and political opposition to raise its stakes in the eyes of the people in the state, until the recently concluded assembly elections. Neither is this proxy rule likely to extend with the return of DMK in power nor is the BJP is set to reconcile with enormous inroads it has made in the state politics. The governor’s address to the state legislature is a measure of MK Stalin-led DMK government’s determination to define the agenda. The BJP will try to make a Puducherry out of Tamil Nadu by appointing a governor who will not shy away from running like a bull into a china shop. It will, however, be a gross underestimation of the Tamil Nadu government and the political culture of the state.Prof. Ramu Manivannan is a scholar-social activist in areas of education, human rights and sustainable development through an initiative “Multiversity”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/lighthouse-i-the-changing-dynamics-of-bjp-in-tamil-nadu-101626174833621.html

With weekend crowds on the rise, the Uttarakhand government has now made district magistrates responsible to ensure the situation in tourist spots does not worsen. According to an official order issued by chief secretary Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, if the situation worsens in the tourist places of Uttarakhand, the district magistrate will be held responsible.A standard operating procedure (SOP) on the matter has also directed the DMs to ensure that tourists mandatorily follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour vis-à-vis wearing of masks, maintaining social distance, and sanitising hands. “They (DMs) have been authorised to take decisions regarding the crowds on weekends,” the SOP read.In the order, Sandhu said the percentage of tourists to be allowed to move or visit a tourist place will be decided on the basis of its capacity for “crowd control and the geographical conditions,” or else the DMs will be “free to decide whether to impose any restrictions”. According to an ANI report, DMs have also been given the charge to take strict action against any individual who flouts the Covid-19 norms.The Uttarakhand police sent back as many as 8,000 vehicles during the weekend from popular tourist locations of Nainital and Mussoorie. Check-posts have also been set up at the state borders to control the tourists’ rush.ALSO READ | Uttarakhand: 8,000 tourists on their way to Mussoorie and Nainital sent backOver the last few days, images of tourists roaming around in Mussoorie without masks and maintaining social distance had gone viral on social media. While locals have raised concerns over the matter and feared a possible arrival of the third Covid-19 wave, the ICMR had called the visuals “frightening”. During his meeting on Tuesday with the chief ministers of northeastern states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called the tourists’ rush in hill states as a “matter of concern”.The Uttarakhand government has extended the Covid-induced lockdown till 6am of July 20.

13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Learning the ropes of WhatsApp diplomacy||As I begin to write this piece in the Notes of my phone, I struggle to swipe away the ding-ding of WhatsApp messages lest the train of thought derails. The number of WhatsApp messages is directly proportional to the number of groups one is embroiled in. Greater the number of affiliations, greater the ding-ding intensity. It’s simple math! I was a reluctant participant on WhatsApp, initially. It was a tectonic shift from the iconic texting via the Blackberry messenger. The exclusivity was that only Blackberry phone holders could text each other. However, WhatsApp worked on all phones so it engulfed the Blackberry. It was quite the leveller. Blackberry phone or not, now literally everyone is just one text away. Parents, siblings, grandparents, siblings’ spouses, friends, friends of siblings, cousins -- you name it, we were all on the same platform. Everything was hunky dory till a wise one felt the need to connect on WhatsApp as a group. Logistically, of course it made sense. Announcing the baby’s first toothless picture in one family group, rather than buaji, tauji, chachaji, mausi separately, one big family group made life far easier. Similarly, having a college reunion group made it far simpler to stalk people one didn’t necessarily want to communicate with. Their display pictures gave a fulfilling peek into their personal lives. “Kids already!”, “Still single”, “Same picture for years. Too secretive or too boring”, these deductions were the result of the few hundred pixels next to the name of the person on WhatsApp. Then there came the work group. Irrespective of whether this bunch genuinely wanted to interact after 5pm or not, work-people too had their own WhatsApp group! Intriguingly, souls have no notion of time on WhatsApp. They will continue to send jokes bereft of humour, and you will have to continue to respond based on your subordination level. There also exist enthusiastic groups run by entrepreneurs. More often than not, there’s only one enthusiastic person, the entrepreneur himself armed with a thousand jewellery/clothing/crockery/whatnot designs. He will share pictures of all of them, all at once, each day religiously. Without you knowing, he will guzzle phone space as you wonder in horror how the phone memory got full! Over the last few months, my affiliations have grown, and as a result the WhatsApp activity and ding-dings have considerably increased. I have managed to get entangled in groups within groups. I wouldn’t deny though that these WhatsApp groups have been a lifeline during the grim times. Besides giving a constant barrage of information and providing social connectivity, these groups teach crucial diplomacy lessons. Allow me the liberty of doling out some recently acquired gems. One, you cannot choose to reply to one person in the group and ignore others. Either you instantly reply to each member, or you maintain stoic silence. At worst, they’ll think you’re snooty. At best, they’ll accuse you of being too busy. Two, if your political leanings are different from the others in the group, no amount of videshi articles, cumbersome journals or persuasive videos can change the mind of others. So, limit yourself to sending only a subtle text once in a while, only as a reminder that you are your own person despite the common last name. Three, always adhere to diplomacy protocol in WhatsApp groups. What you say to a person over the phone has to be layered and sugar-coated when written in a group. So, authenticity is a no-no. Four, there is no escape. You cannot exit a group without bruising a few hearts. Hence, brace yourself for this asphyxiating labyrinth of texting. At best, it’ll improve your writing skills. At worst, it’ll teach you a thing or two about diplomacy. Quite rarely, it’ll give you an opportunity to write a piece about WhatsApp diplomacy! seeratsandhu25@yahoo.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor.Views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/learning-the-ropes-of-whatsapp-diplomacy-101626173993481.html

13-07-2021||Pune||In my opinion: 150th death anniversary of James Thomas Molesworth, editor of Marathi-English dictionary first published 1831||Tarkateertha Lakshmanshastri Joshi, among the greatest Indian linguists, paid rich tributes to James Thomas Molesworth thus: “…both, the Marathi language and Maharashtra, owe him a tremendous debt which they can hardly afford to forget”. This is how the Tarkateertha concluded his 1975 foreword to the corrected reprint of the Molesworth’s Marathi-English Dictionary published way back in 1857. Molesworth had begun the dictionary project as an employee of the British East India Company in 1831. His team of seven Shastris and three English scholars collected Marathi words, phrases, idioms, and sayings and translated these into English. His team included twin brothers George and Thomas Candy, and Reverend John Wilson who later founded the Wilson College in Mumbai and became vice-chancellor of the Bombay University. The team’s work began with a compilation of a simple list of Marathi words for a glossary, for the benefit of British officers and staff of the East India Company. By 1857, when the dictionary’s second edition was published, it had amassed a huge collection of 60,000 Marathi words with their English translation. James Molesworth was son of a viscount in England. He did not know a word of Marathi when he reached India at the age 16, for a job. He started as a lowest commissioned officer in the infantry in 1812 and, in due course, was promoted to higher posts. As per his job requirement, he started studying Marathi, Hindustani, Sanskrit and Persian. While posted at Solapur around 1818, he along with a colleague, Thomas Candy, started working on a glossary of Marathi words necessary for translations. This led Molesworth to conceive the project of a comprehensive Marathi-English and English-Marathi dictionary. Bouts of ill health made him move to different places such as Bombay, Pune, Solapur, Dapoli, Mahabaleshwar and Bankot. All of these were small places those days in the 19th century. He struggled and fought all the odds to learn lexicography that was unheard of in the Bombay region then. Even after the manuscript of the dictionary, was ready, there was the problem of type for the press in Bombay. The type had to be procured from a foundry in faraway Calcutta (Kolkata) for the second edition in 1857. Until 1975, copies were sold gradually, and there was none available in the book depots. Sharad Gogate of Pune-based Shubhada Saraswat Prakashan says he ventured to reprint the dictionary in 1975. It was indeed a “heavy” job: 951 pages of a Royal Quarto (9½ inches x 12 2/3 inches), hard bound, weighing about two kilogrammes. He re-printed it 10 times till the Nirali Publications took over the book business over 20 years ago. In this era of print-on-demand technology, this dictionary continues to be sold, says Nirali publisher’s Jignesh Furia. But the Molesworth dictionary story does not end here. Computers, internet, the Unicode fonts, and funding agencies have made it possible to introduce digital dictionaries. National libraries and other funding agencies have pooled resources for the Digital Dictionaries of South Asia (DDSA) programme. They have joined in an initiative for the Digital South Asia Library. The Molesworth Dictionary is funded as a part of this programme. It is available for free use to anybody. The Journalism and Mass Communication Department of the Pune-based Vishwakarma University has decided to publish a paper to pay tribute to Molesworth on his 150th death anniversary, on July 13, 2021, on behalf of Marathi-speakers. As the Tarkateertha said, we do owe him a tremendous debt which we cannot forget. The writer is professor Emeritus, department of Journalism and Mass Communication, Vishwakarma University.

13-07-2021||Mumbai||Pankaja Munde pacifies supporters, says time not right to quit||Upset over her sister and Parliamentarian from Beed Pritam Munde Khade not getting a ministerial berth in the Cabinet expansion carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, national Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secretary Pankaja Munde on Tuesday told her supporters in Maharashtra that it was not the time to fight a “Dharmayuddha” (war fought over principles) and a decision in that regard would be taken at an appropriate time. She added that she was upset with the party’s state leadership and had full faith in the Central leadership.“Time is the solution to everything. This is not the time to take any extreme decision. Why should we leave our own house which has been built with our hard work. We will see if the roof comes crumbling down on us in the future,” she said.Pankaja is daughter of late Gopinath Munde, considered one of BJP’s most influential Other Backward Caste (OBC) leaders, who helped build the party in Maharashtra. After her father’s death, Pankaja has been fighting to retain his legacy in state politics. Over the last few days, more than 75 of her supporters offered to quit from local bodies of Beed and Ahmednagar in protest against MP Pritam Munde’s exclusion from the Cabinet. It is widely believed that Rajya Sabha MP Bhagwat Karad was instead inducted in the Union ministry to promote a new OBC leadership by passing Pankaja Munde’s family’s claim.Pankaja Munde’s supporters gathered in large numbers outside her Worli office on Tuesday seeking to protest against the party decision. Pankaja, however, told them that it was not the right time to quit the party and blamed her “detractors” in the state for trying to sideline her.Munde said that she was marginalised for saying that people, in their minds, considered her the chief minister, but what about those dreaming to become the prime minister.“I never said that I wanted to become the CM, it was the wish expressed by the people. Some say that I was deliberately pushed to the walls for talking about the post. But what about the people who say that they want to become the prime minister? They keep talking about the posts and ministerial berth I got, but conveniently forget about what was snatched away from me,” she said.Munde, who was accompanied with her family members on the stage, also hinted that many leaders in the state unit of the party were upset with the leadership at the state and were in touch with her. “Even the lieutenants of Kauravas in Mahabharat were not with them emotionally. They were with the Pandavas,” she said in a wielded attack on leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis.Munde said that she has full faith in the party’s Central leadership and they will never let her down.“Prime minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and party’s national president JP Nadda are our leaders and I have full faith in them. They have treated me with full respect. In our meeting with the Central leadership on Monday, I told Naddaji about the discontent among the party workers. He has shown full faith that I will convince you to calm down. This is a short pause in our political journey,” she said.Political analyst Hemant Desai said the incident was a show of strength by Pankaja Munde. “Though BJP’s central leadership never gives in to the pressure tactics, it may take a different stand in Pankaja’s case as she is a OBC face and enjoys following in Marathwada. She can dent the BJP if she decides to walk out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pankaja-munde-pacifies-supporters-says-time-not-right-to-quit-over-cabinet-expansion-101626169853284.html
13-07-2021||Delhi||IIT undergrads to return to hostels; excited to come back after a year||It has been more than a year since most outstation students, in different institutes, have stayed put at their homes. Waiting desperately for things to get normal, most have been wanting to get back to their colleges, or at least hostels; even if the classes continue to be conducted virtually. And now their pleas have been seemingly heard, at least those of the undergraduate students at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. Recently, a mail from the authorities pleasantly surprised most of the undergrads; as it informed them that the hostels were finally reopening their doors. Until now, only those students were allowed to stay on IIT campus who needed to use the lab and were pursuing their PhD. But this new mail allows students, pursuing the undergraduate courses, to be back on campus. “We got a mail informing us that the boarding facility will also start for undergrads, and we were so happy. I’m desperately waiting to be back on the campus, even if it’s just the hostels that are reopening for now,” shares Suhani Jain, a final year student of BTech in Electrical Engineering.Considering the fact that most of the college students, across the country, have been struggling with offline campus, Kartikeya Gupta, a third year computer science student confesses that it’s tough to attend classes from home. “At times the electricity goes out, or someone comes into the room. A few days back, I was giving a test and the electricity went off. Hence, the WiFi went off, too. I didn’t even have my phone with me, since I appearing for a test, and thus had to rush out of the room to get my phone and then quickly connect my laptop through a hotspot. But when I came back online, my professor started asking me as to where I went,” he says. The youngsters are stoked at the idea of the return, but apparently the parents don’t seem to be comfortable with the thought of on-campus accommodation, just yet. Gupta explains how his parents were initially hesitant, too. “I’ve been showing them mails, which we are getting from campus regarding the precautions that they are taking to ensure the safety of everyone against Covid-19. And now they have finally agreed upon allowing me to go back to the hostel mid of next month. Of course, the institute has told me that if there is a third wave or increase in the number of cases, then I will not be going back,” he says. “Once we rejoin campus, we’ve been asked to serve a two-week quarantine period; where they are even not allowed to leave their rooms,” says Maria Sandalwala, a final year student, adding, “My friends are very excited about this. Even the meals will delivered in the room. And they are being issued student IDs, to help them leave the hostel and use the library or other areas on campus.”Gupta adds, “My roommate is coming and so are my friends. So even if we are quarantined for a while, at least we will all be together. We all have got the first dose of our vaccination, and the second one can be taken at the institute itself. We’re pretty kicked about this.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/iit-undergrads-to-return-to-hostels-excited-to-come-back-after-a-year-101626167650476.html
13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Rain effect: Hotel occupancy falls by 35% in Himachal Pradesh||Heavy rain across Himachal Pradesh for the past two days has triggered flash floods and landslides at several places and also led to a dip of 35% in the number of visitors to the hill state. Himachal Pradesh had been seeing a heavy tourist influx from neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR since the middle of June when the Covid-19 restrictions were eased as the number of positive cases declined and there was a need to rev up the economy, particularly the hospitality and tourism sectors. Such was the rush of visitors from the scorching plains that the Centre had to caution the Himachal Pradesh government to ensure the visitors adhered to Covid-appropriate behaviour.

There was a lot of tourist rush from North India. We are hopeful that the weather will be pleasant in the plains too after the rains there,” state tourism director Amit Kashyap said. “There is a 35% decline in hotel occupancy. The flash floods have triggered the drop,” said Sanjay Sood, the president of the Shimla Hotel and Restaurateurs Association. Hotel occupancy in Shimla, which had shot up to 80% last weekend, would normally drop to 40% on weekdays, but this week many planning holidays in the hills had also cancelled their bookings, he said. Gajendra Thakur, the president of the Manali Tourism Stakeholders Association, said, “There was a rush of tourists in Manali for a few days but it wasn’t as much as was being projected on social media. There is a drop now, especially since the last two days.” Till June this year, about 18 lakh tourists had visited the state, including 2,744 foreigners. More than 1.64 lakh tourists visited Mandi alone, while 1 lakh visited Kangra, known for its temples. The disregard for Covid-appropriate behaviour had forced the police to deploy more personnel to implement safety guidelines in the key destinations of Dharamshala, Kasauli, Shimla, Dalhousie, Kullu and Manali. Shimla police had launched a special drive to distribute masks to tourists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-effect-hotel-occupancy-falls-by-35-in-himachal-pradesh-101626167033974.html

Among them, three are boys and the fourth is a girl, according to an Aaj Tak report.This comes only days after the Uttar Pradesh law commission formulated a proposal on “two-child policy” that bars people from getting government benefits if they have more than two children.Doctors who performed the surgery on the woman said that both the mother and her four children were healthy, the report mentioned. The children were born using the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) technology.Dr Shashi Arora, one of two doctors, who performed the surgery on the woman, said that the couple had been hoping to have a child for several years. The woman was unable to bear a child, and was even receiving treatment, as per the Aaj Tak report. She gave birth to the four children following two years of treatment. The woman and her family are overjoyed at the news of welcoming four children at once.What is in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)?Mayo Clinic defines IVF as a medical procedure that is used to aid with fertility issues or prevent genetic problems. In IVF, matured eggs are collected from ovaries and then fertilised by sperm in a lab. The fertilised egg or eggs are then transferred to a woman’s uterus, thereby assisting in conception of an embryo for women who have difficulty to do it naturally.Several factors come into the play to determine how likely a woman is to deliver a healthy baby using IVF technology. These include her age and the reason behind infertility. Among many aftermaths of IVF technology, one is multiple pregnancies – similar to the Ghaziabad woman, wherein more than one embryo is transferred to the uterus, leading to multiple births.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-woman-gives-birth-to-not-1-but-4-children-via-ivf-family-overjoyed-101626161292873.html

The donations coincided with reports of dumping of the bodies of suspected Covid-19 patients in rivers in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Hundreds of corpses have been donated in Bengal since some leaders in the Left Front government, which ruled the state for 34 years from 1977, began encouraging such donations for organ transplantation and research. Bodies of top Communist leaders such as former chief minister Jyoti Basu, Benoy Choudhury, and Anil Biswas were also donated.Also Read | India clocks 32,906 single-day Covid-19 cases, 2,020 new deaths reportedSaroj Pal said his son was treated at a reputable private hospital where doctors did their best, but Saikat Pal’s lungs were badly damaged. “When he failed to respond to standard respiratory support systems, I took him to Bangur Hospital where he passed away. I hope the autopsy helped doctors identify what the coronavirus can do to the organs of patients with similar medical history. I have pledged to donate my corneas,” said Pal.The body of Brojo Roy, a communist who founded Ganadarpan to promote the donation of bodies, was among the corpses donated this year.Sudipta Saha Roy, who succeeded Brojo Roy as Ganadarpan’s general secretary, said it was founded in 1977 as a cultural organisation. “Ganadarpan got its registration certificate in 1980. On November 5, 1986, (Brojo) Roy and 33 of his friends pledged to donate their bodies. Since then, 3,000 bodies have been donated, including that of (Brojo) Roy who died on May 13 at the age of 84.”The body of one Sukumar Hom Chaudhury was the first to be donated on January 8, 1990, as part of the campaign.Sudipta Saha Roy said a parallel campaign started in Bangladesh where, in 1985, the body of Araj Ali Matubbar was the first to be donated to the Barisal Medical College. “He was a farmer with little formal education but great interest in science.” He added that more people have overcome their taboos and the campaign needs to get more organised. “For example, besides collecting corneas, skin from a human body can be used for grafting. Eardrums can be used too. For all this, infrastructure in hospitals in Bengal needs to be upgraded.”Dr Kalyan Kar, who heads the surgery department at a Kolkata hospital, said body donations help medical students a lot. “Dissection and analysis help them understand the human anatomy much better. The movement contributes to medical studies.”The state health department encourages people to donate organs through its State Organ Tissue Transplantation Organisation. In August 2020, the liver and lungs of a man, who was declared brain dead at a Kolkata hospital, were flown to Hyderabad for transplantation. His skin and corneas were transplanted at two hospitals in Kolkata. In November 2018, Calcutta Medical College and Hospital became the first state-run hospital in Bengal to successfully transplant a heart. Two private hospitals in Kolkata conducted four heart transplant operations before that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/encouraged-since-the-1970s-bodies-continue-to-be-donated-in-bengal-101626157492328.html

We would, however, follow the government rules. We will have a meeting of our association members to discuss the issue.”Authorities earlier issued a similar direction for tourists visiting Birbhum, where some popular tourist destinations and important religious sites are located.“Initially, we issued instructions that tourists coming to Santiniketan, Kankalitala and Tarapith would need to carry Covid negative RT-PCR test reports or certificates of double vaccine doses. Rapid antigen kiosks were also set up to test tourists not carrying the documents. Later, hotels were also directed not to allow any tourists without these documents,” said a Birbhum district official.The Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic peaked in the state on May 14 (20,846). The cases have since come down steadily and dropped to 885 on July 12.

13-07-2021||Other||IIT Madras researchers develop model to detect cancerous mutations||Researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, have developed a machine learning model that can use genome sequencing data to detect cancerous mutations in the body. Cancer is caused by mutation or growth of cells in the body. While cell mutation is a common phenomenon, only some mutations cause cancer. They are called driver mutations. Other mutations, which are a majority of all mutations, are benign and are called passengers. The study by three researchers from the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI), IIT Madras, found that the neighbouring gene sequences of driver mutations are significantly different from that of passengers. The researchers further designed NBDriver, a mathematical model based on artificial intelligence, to identify the pathogenic variants of mutations that can cause cancer. The study, funded by the Department of Biotechnology, government of India, was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cancers in May this year.Also Read | This protein may prevent tumour cells from spreading“One of the major challenges faced by cancer researchers involves the differentiation between the relatively small number of ‘driver’ mutations that enable the cancer cells to grow and the large number of ‘passenger’ mutations that do not have any effect on the progression of the disease,” said B Ravindran, co-author of the study, head of RBCDSAI and professor in the department of computer science and engineering.The model developed by RBCDSAI will identify these driver mutations by looking at genome data around the mutations. “Think of it like looking for a spelling error in a sentence. We are feeding a sentence into the model and by looking at the words before and after a word, the model can identify the erroneous word,” said RBCDSAI member Karthik Raman, co-author of the study, associate professor at the Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences and co-ordinator of the Centre for Integrative Biology and Systems Medicine at IIT Madras.While global researchers have developed computational methods for distinguishing between driver and passenger mutations, limited literature exists on using raw nucleotide sequences surrounding a particular mutation as potential features for building predictive models.The researchers at IIT Madras aimed to discover patterns in the DNA sequences – made up of four letters, or bases, A, T, G and C, surrounding a particular site of alteration. “The underlying hypothesis was that these patterns would be unique to individual types of mutations – drivers and passengers. Therefore, these patterns could be modelled mathematically to distinguish between the two classes,” said Raman. The performance of NBDriver was tested on several open-source cancer mutation datasets. “Our model could distinguish between well-studied drivers and passenger mutations from cancer genes with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, combining the predictions from NBDriver and three others commonly used driver prediction algorithms resulted in an accuracy of 95%, significantly outperforming existing models,” said Ravindran.Raman added, “Interestingly, NBDriver could accurately identify 85% of the rare driver mutations from patients diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a particularly aggressive type of cancer affecting the brain or spine.”NBDriver is available publicly and can be used to obtain predictions on any user-defined set of mutations. Mumbai-based data scientist Anirvan Chatterjee, who was not a part of the study, said, “Multigenic disorders like cancer pose a significant challenge in understanding the effect of several hundreds of mutations in their contribution to the final disruption on cell repair.”“In this study, the researchers have initiated a significant new direction in our ability to use massive scale genomic data to understand the heuristic relationship between causal mutations and effect mutations. Exploring the analytical framework suggested here by various research groups globally can potentially bring a ‘crowd-sourced’ high predictive mutation list which can potentially be triangulated with other interpretive methods, and create a robust catalogue,” said Chatterjee, who is also the founder of HaystackAnalytics—a healthcare startup incubated under the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at IIT Bombay. “The tool can be used to identify the likelihood of a mutation being cancerous. Medical professionals can run a genome sequencing on the tool and trace the culprit mutation. This will help design specific treatment strategies for patients,” said Raman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iit-madras-researchers-develop-model-to-detect-cancerous-mutations-101626155694577.html

Till now, 10,506 deaths have been reported from MP, where the death rate is 1.33%. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “The deaths were reported late as health officials were focussing on providing treatment to infected people. With decrease in positivity rate in the state, the health officials conducted death audit and found backlog. It is nothing wrong that we focussed more on saving lives than counting deaths.”Also Read | India clocks 32,906 single-day Covid-19 cases, 2,020 new deaths reportedOpposition leaders and experts have been attacking the state government for hiding deaths due to Covid-19 in April and May and later adjusting the numbers in June.“In June, the death rate increased to 8%. The crematorium and burial ground data, which showed higher number of deaths in April and May as compared to data shared by health department exposed the lie of the state government. In many districts, more than five deaths have been reported in a day but no cremation and burial was done as per Covid-19 protocol,” said SR Azad, a health activist. Opposition leaders alleged the BJP-led state government wanted to hide data and that’s why they didn’t share break-up of deaths district-wise. “The state government wanted to hide that in Bhopal and Indore, people died in large numbers in the absence of oxygen beds and ventilators. Adding backlog of deaths has proved that they hid the data, but still there are many deaths which have not been added in the list. We will raise this issue in the monsoon session as we have real data,” said PC Sharma, a Congress MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/covid19-toll-madhya-pradesh-adds-1-478-deaths-as-backlog-101626155392149.html

"Thunderstorm with light to moderate intensity rain and winds with speed of 20-40 Km per hour would occur over and adjoining areas of few places of South-West Delhi, South Delhi, NCR (Gurugram, Manesar, Ballabhgarh), Rohtak, Meham, Jhajjar, Farukhnagar, Nuh, Sohana, Palwal in Haryana and Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh during next 2 hours," the IMD tweeted on Tuesday morning.Jenamani had informed that the weather conditions continue to remain favourable for the arrival of monsoon in the national capital. He said that IMD will study why the arrival of rainfall was delayed in Delhi despite favourable conditions.There is a 7 per cent rain deficiency over the country since June 1 and a 67 per cent deficiency over Delhi. The normal date for monsoon onset over Delhi is June 27.After the previous prediction about the monsoon proved to be wrong, the IMD did not announce any further date for the arrival of monsoon in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-receives-light-rain-imd-predicts-drop-in-temperature-101626144179699.html

13-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The man who sold school bags||Nothing has changed for him. So much has changed for him. Such are the clashing complexities that define Muhammed Khurshid Alam these days.He started his career in Delhi as a pavement seller a decade ago. He continues to be a pavement seller. For nine of these years, he was selling school bags. Last year, with the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic, he entirely shifted his business to selling masks.“It’s not me alone—everyone on the footpath is selling masks,” says Mr Alam while arranging his stall one late afternoon, under a tree, on a pedestrian path in central Delhi’s KG Marg. His assertion is not entirely correct. The stall next to him is selling freshly fried cocktail samosas. Another pavement business, close by, deals with locks and keys. “I mean many sellers have turned to masks,” he says absentmindedly.Almost every mask in Mr Alam’s stall is black, and neatly packed in plastic, as if to assure a potential buyer that it hasn’t been touched by any germs before. Mr Alam gets the masks from a wholesaler in Sadar Bazaar. He would source his school bags too from the same market. “The school bags used to sell in very good numbers, and were priced higher… they would bring me good money, that was a better business,” As the coronavirus hit the city, he says, schools shut down indefinitely and nobody bought his schoolbags any longer. “I then walked through many markets to see how other hawkers were coping.” Many of them were turning to masks, he says.“While you see people with masks nowadays, I’m, however, not able to sell many,” he says in a puzzled tone.A slow but steady stream of pedestrians is passing by his stall, but nobody is stopping.Perhaps he can go back to his village in Sitamarhi, Bihar, and start something afresh. The middle-aged Mr Alam looks at the traffic on the road, saying, “My village… there’s nothing to earn there.” But it has his wife and four kids. “I’m able to send them only ₹500 or so every month.”God knows how his family is surviving, he mutters. At 6, Mr Alam would close his stall and return to his room in Nabi Karim, where he lives alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-man-who-sold-school-bags-101626130353191.html

The withdrawal of the order came after discussions between traders and New Delhi district authorities, who warned retailers that they will shut shops if distancing norms and masking guidelines are flouted.The market, as a result, opened as usual on Monday morning, and enforcement teams went around monitoring that safety protocols were followed.Traders in the market, which is among the city’s popular shopping destinations, have been directed to ensure social distancing in the market, limit the number of salespeople and customers inside shops, issue ID cards to hawkers, apart from a host of other conditions. The Delhi Police and traders’ associations will monitor the footfall in the market, officials said.The revised directions were issued by the subdivisional magistrate (SDM) of Chanakyapuri after a meeting with various stakeholders, including the five traders’ associations from Janpath market.Delhi authorities, in recent weeks, have cracked down on, and temporarily shut other popular markets, including in Lajpat Nagar, Sadar Bazar and Laxmi Nagar, after a surge in crowds and violations of distancing and masking protocols.The New Delhi district authority late on Sunday night issued an order informing all agencies concerned that Janpath market will remain closed till further orders for violating the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) guidelines on Covid-appropriate behaviour during the weekend.But the revised order issued on Monday morning said: “The Director (Enforcement), NDMC and SHO [station house officer], Connaught Place are hereby directed to enforce the order with immediate effect and submit a compliance report. This is issued with the approval of the district magistrate, chairman, DDMA, New Delhi district.”Toni Chawla, general secretary of the Janpath Traders Association said, “All shop owners have been following Covid norms and ensuring distancing inside the shops.

13-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC refuses to stay new excise policy||The Delhi high court on Monday refused to stay the New Excise Policy 2021, approved last month, after a plea was filed by the retail liquor vendors who contended that it will “completely eliminate” their operations.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Lieutenant Governor, Delhi government and excise commissioner on the plea which questioned the excise commissioner‘s right to fix the price of the liquor in the new policy.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the retail liquor vendors, said that the new policy divides the city in 32 zones, with 9-10 wards in each zone, for the purpose of issuance of liquor licence.Noting that the Delhi government has introduced a new category of zonal licence, 1-7Z, for retail vends, he argued that the 1-7Z licence for each zone requires the licence holder to mandatorily run 18 retail vends.“This scheme has completely eliminated the existing retail vendors,” he contended, asking for a stay.The court refused to stall the policy and posted the matter for further hearing on August 9.Government officials, on condition of anonymity, said that the high court’s refusal to stay the liquor policy is a major blow to the liquor lobby.They said that had the high court stayed the order, it would have caused a revenue loss of ₹3,500 crore to the Delhi government.“This amount of ₹3,500 crore, that will be collected through excise duty, will enable the funding of many government social welfare schemes. This would help many, who have suffered during the coronavirus pandemic,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-refuses-to-stay-new-excise-policy-101626122869266.html

13-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt outlines policy to identify street children||The Delhi government’s department of women and child development (WCD) has come up with a policy to define street children, and asked 10 of its agencies to identify and rehabilitate them. The policy, called SAMPARC (sustainable approach for multi-faceted progress aimed at reclaiming childhood) could impact nearly 70,000 children in the Capital, according to estimates by the WCD department.Delhi’s WCD minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said the new guidelines, for the first time, attempt to define street children.“Children who have run away from their family and are living on the streets, or living with a family on the streets; or children who work on the street and go back to a family after work, are to be considered street children. The Arvind Kejriwal government believes in proper education and development of all children. I have also ordered the officers to ensure children living in shelter homes get good facilities and that no child’s education suffers due to lack of resources,” Gautam said.The policy, a copy of which is with HT, empowers child welfare committees (CWCs) to take legal action against parents who are making their children beg, with criminal or commercial intent. It also directs district administrations to identify such children who have turned 18, train them, and induct them in the government’s civil defence volunteers force.“It will not only provide such vulnerable children respectable employment, but owing to their street experience they can assist many other children who come from similar backgrounds,” said the document.Though there has been no thorough survey till date, estimates with the WCD department suggest that Delhi, on any given day, has 60,000 to 70,000 children surviving in “street-like” situations. The number includes those who live with families on roadsides or in temporary huts.Rashmi Singh, director of the WCD department, said the government has also floated an expression of interest (EOI) to authorise NGOs and civil society organisations to identify and profile vulnerable children, map resources, and match their needs.Specific roles have been assigned to different government agencies. For example, the health department and the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS) have to bring the street kids under the health safety net with mohalla clinics, Ayushman Bharat scheme, and so on. The labour department will ensure skill and vocational training, and the municipal corporations have to ensure that births and deaths are properly recorded and linked with the WCD data.“As the nodal department, we have solicited the active role of all departments concerned so that we can have a coordinated approach. We are also inviting more civil society participation, apart from NGOs already partnering with us, to run open shelters for such children,” Singh said.The state has 26 child care institutions (CCI). Additionally, the WCD department financially supports nine open shelters run by NGOs for street children.Data seen by HT showed that till June 30, 842 children were living in the government-run CCIs as against the sanctioned capacity of 2,075 — a clear indication that there is a greater necessity to identity more such children and put them under institutional care.The policy states that in case it is found that the custodians of a child are not his/her biological parents or guardians, the department will request a police investigation to prevent illegal adoption or trafficking. To increase the network of agencies and officials working on identifying and rescuing such vulnerable children, the policy also proposes to constitute the District Child Protection Convergence Committee (DCPCC) in each of the 11 districts.Once identified and rescued, such children are to be produced before a child welfare committee to decide on whether to allow adoption or foster care or to put them in institutional care.Sudarshan Suchi, CEO of NGO Save the Children said, “These guidelines need to go hand-in-hand with capacity building and training of all child protection staff to ensure adequate delivery [of the programme].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wcd-outlines-policy-to-ensure-welfare-of-street-children-in-delhi-101626122690258.html

Officials said the university is trying to come up with a method to bring all education boards at par since they have adopted different evaluation methods this year following the cancellation of Class 12 exams after the second wave of Covid-19 gripped the country. DU vice-chancellor (acting) P C Joshi said the university is still hopeful that the Centre will announce the conduct of the CUTET this year because of the unprecedented situation. “There is still a possibility of holding CUCET. However, in case it doesn’t happen and the university feels that the assessment criteria adopted by some boards are more lenient than others, we will have to come up with some policy to bring students at one level. It will be challenging but we cannot do injustice to students. We are working on it and are likely to announce something by the end of this week,” said Joshi.The University may start the registration process for admissions by the end of this month.A senior official at the university, who wished not to be named, said the varsity is exploring the possibility of adopting the ‘percentile’ method for admissions in case there is a substantial difference between the results of some education boards. A percentile is the percentage of students above whom he or she stands on the merit list. For instance, if a student’s score is in the 90th percentile, that means he/she has scored better than 90% of the candidates who took the exam. The same criteria are used for admission in several other courses in India, including engineering and business administration.“We are trying to see the possibility of adopting the percentile system. We will have to think of other options to moderate the marks of students in case there is a huge difference between the results of different boards. There is a high possibility that this situation may arise since different education boards have opted for different evaluation methods,” said the official. This year, while the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decided to evaluate students based on their performances in classes 10, 11, and 12 in 30:30:40 ratio, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) is considering students’ performances in classes 9 to 12. Different state boards have also opted for various assessment methods. For instance, even as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh boards consider marks of classes 10, 11, and 12 like CBSE, their weightage criteria are different. While Haryana is giving 60% weightage to class 12 performance, UP has fixed it at just 10%. The Odisha board will award marks to Class 12 students based on their performance in Class 10.Officials said due to the difference in evaluation methods of education boards, it will become very challenging for the university to admit students based on their absolute score. “It will be really challenging to set the cut-off this year as well since a majority of the boards are likely to award higher scores. So, the cut-off is expected to remain high,” said the principal of a north campus college. Last year, the highest cut-off was announced by the Lady Shri Ram College at 100% for three courses.Despite several attempts, officials at the UGC and ministry of education did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment on CUCET.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/common-test-up-in-the-air-du-considers-entrance-options-101626122629819.html

Give me just two weeks, most probably the approval will be given,” he said.“What is the Delhi government doing? When things are in bad shape, then you land in soup and start blaming left, right and centre,” the bench remarked.It granted two weeks to the Delhi government to finalise the proposal and set up a Covid-19 facility at the campus after petitioners – JNU Teachers Association, JNU Students Association and two faculty members – moved court in May this year seeking direction to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic situation at the varsity.The matter will now be heard on August 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcpulls-up-delhi-govt-over-delay-in-setting-up-covid-care-centre-inside-jnu-101626122629263.html

The goal of these camps is to update the data of all the construction workers so that the assistance provided by the state reaches all the construction workers in time,” said Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s labour minister.“Due to all these crucial reforms, the number of registered construction workers has increased from about 100,000 in December to over 300,000 today (Monday),” he added.The Delhi government estimates there are at least 1.5 million construction and labour workers in the Capital.Till June 23, the Delhi government disbursed ₹5,000 each to 217,039 construction workers as Covid relief disbursement this year. In addition, the government last month announced a relief package of ₹10,000 to workers found to have been worst hit by the pandemic induced lockdown.Meanwhile, the board has started an online verification system for workers.“Workers do not need to go to the labour office to get their registration done now. The entire process is online. Online verification of workers will also be done through live photo capturing and online payment. This will make sure that workers will not have to leave their work and stand in long lines at offices. They will be able to register themselves at any time according to their convenience,” said a government spokesperson.“With these new reforms, workers can now make all their claims online on the e-district portal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-registers-200k-more-construction-workers-sets-1-million-target-by-next-year-101626122570381.html

The party workers, led by senior leader Prem Singh Chandumajra and transport wing chief Parmjit Singh Fazilka, handed over the keys of trucks, buses and other vehicles at the New Moti Mehal as a mark of protest.Earlier, the demonstrators carried out a protest march in the CM’s hometown which culminated at YPS Chowk. Chandumajra said the BJP-led Centre and the Congress government in Punjab were directly responsible for manifold increase in prices of petroleum products. “While the Centre is not reducing custom duty on these products, the Amarinder-led government in the state has imposed the country’s highest VAT on them. The VAT and custom duty together are ₹55 per litre tax on petroleum products. Both the governments should slash these taxes by 50 percent so that people can get a respite up to ₹30 per litre,” he added. He said the Amarinder government dissolved the truck unions in the state after coming to power and later reduced loading charges, thus destroying the transport business. “More than 40,000 trucks and 65,000 taxis were sold in scrap in the last four-and-a-half years of the Congress rule in the state,” he claimed. Parmjit Fazilka said the Amarinder government was regularly pursuing destructive policies for the transport sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sads-transport-wing-gheraos-amarinder-s-patiala-residence-over-fuel-price-hikes-101626122391498.html

The party leaders met Agrawal and gave him a 24-hour ultimatum to arrest Bains. They threatened to launch a stir outside the residence of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu if the police failed to do so. SAD leader Harish Rai Dhanda accused Ashu of protecting the LIP chief. Senior leaders Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and Hira Singh Gabria said Bains’ Vidhan Sabha membership should also be annulled. SAD workers also blocked the Ferozepur road leading to massive traffic jams. BJP stir against attack on its party leadersThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on the other hand, staged a protest against the state government at the mini-secretariat over the attack on its leaders in Rajpura. BJP state general secretary Parveen Bansal said, “The goons who attacked the BJP leaders enjoy the support of the ruling Congress government.”District president Pushpinder Singhal, meanwhile, had to be rushed to the hospital as he complained of chest pain during the protest. His condition is stated to be stable.Anganwadis stir for long-pending demandsWhile the cops were busy handling protesters outside the mini-secretariat, nearly 600 anganwari workers reached the office of child development and protection officer, demanding that the state government should pay up its share for increasing the workers’ wages. They said state government was not willing to pay its share due to which their salaried were hiked to only ₹900, against the promised salary of ₹1,500 for workers and ₹1,250 for mini-workers. Besides, they also want that children aged between 3 to 6 years must be sent to anganwadi centres instead of government schools for pre-primary classes.

13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Recruitment of 7,416 cops: HC upholds SAD govt’s decision in 2016 to not hold interviews||The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the then Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government decision in 2016 to do away with the interviews for the recruitment of 7,416 cops in Punjab ahead of assembly polls in the state. The advertisement to recruit 7,416 constables in the district police and armed police cadre was put out on May 31, 2016. Over 200 petitions were filed challenging the recruitment on various grounds, including marking system, not holding interviews and not following reservation norms. The high court bench of justice Arun Monga upheld the government decision of not holding interviews, which could have impacted the entire selection as joining letters were issued on the condition that the same will be subject to the HC decision. Justice Monga observed that it is best left to the wisdom of the competent authorities to decide the educational qualifications and other requirements, including a decision for or against holding of interview carrying weightage and formulae to determine merit for selection to the posts, consistent with the nature and level of the job. “Considering the level and nature of job of a police constable, I find no justification for holding of interview cum-personality test and/or weightage of marks obtained therein to be kept as an essential requirement for selection,” justice Monga said. He further recorded that the interview-cum-personality test was dropped as a policy measure to bring more transparency and eliminate chances of subjective and erroneous assessment in awarding marks for the interview. “That apart, the decision had also the obvious merit of eliminating any possibility of the selection being influenced for extraneous considerations through any unethical, unscrupulous and unfair means,” he added. Justice Monga also said politicisation of recruitment in view of the then-forthcoming assembly elections in 2017, cuts at its own roots and goes against the petitions as it brought more transparency and eliminated chances of subjective and erroneous assessment. As of issue of wrong measurement of height in the case of some candidates, the high court has said that those petitioners who were aggrieved against the wrong measurement of their height would be given one chance for re-measurement of their height and they should approach authorities within 30 days. As of challenge laid to violation of reservation norms, the court separated such petitions and said that the issue will be decided separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/recruitment-of-7-416-cops-hc-upholds-sad-govt-s-decision-in-2016-to-not-hold-interviews-101626121010203.html
13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Long wait ends, monsoon finally drenches Chandigarh||With 21.5mm rain between 6.30pm and 11.30pm in the city, monsoon officially revived in the city on Monday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed.More rain is likely on Tuesday as well, but its intensity will be lower. After the day remained cloudy, showers arrived on Monday evening, causing the mercury to drop from 33°C at 5.30pm to 25.8°C at 8.30pm.Since its onset on June 13, monsoon had brought along only 128mm rain before Monday, 47% short of the 239.8mm rain considered normal.With Monday’s rain, the shortfall is down to 38%. Before this, July saw rain only on the third, when 12.2mm showers were recorded.IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said, “Monday’s rain was part of the monsoon movement strengthening and covering the region. Monsoon has now covered most parts of Punjab and Haryana.”Last year, 920.1mm rain was received in the monsoon period, higher than the average of 845.7mm. Against 302.6mm rain in July 2020, this year only 33.7mm rain has been recorded.Monsoon’s arrival on June 13 was the earliest since 2008, when also it was declared on June 13.Right after its onset was declared, the monsoon got subdued as a low pressure area that had formed over the Bay of Bengal dissipated and easterly winds stopped blowing in the region. Two heatwaves were also declared in the city during this duration, with maximum temperature crossing 40°C on June 30, July 1, and July 7, July 8.While IMD had predicted rain on July 9, July 10 and July 11, monsoon finally returned to the city on July 12. Even in June, after the monsoon was declared, it was said that rains will start after a few days, but the date was pushed forward eventually to July.On this, former director of Chandigarh IMD, Surender Paul, who is now IMD director in Shimla, said, “While IMD is going over the data to avoid such errors in the future, monsoon is also becoming erratic and even the lockdown had an effect on it, with air becoming much cleaner than previous years.”He added that the cyclonic activity before the monsoon as well as Western Disturbances had also made predictions harder. In the coming days, it is expected that dry spells like earlier won’t continue and the city will receive light to moderate rain as scattered showers are expected in the region. The spells won’t be daily, however maximum temperature is unlikely to cross 40°C again.Meanwhile, the city’s maximum temperature went down from 37.5°C on Sunday to 34.1°C, one degree below normal, on Monday. The minimum temperature went up from 26.7°C to 29.1°C, five notches abovenormal.In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 32°C and 34°C, and the minimum temperature will hover around 28°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/long-wait-ends-monsoon-finally-drenches-chandigarh-101626120770682.html

13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Cong took funds from firms running thermal plants: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday accused the ruling Congress of not scrapping the faulty power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed with private companies during the previous SAD-BJP government as it had received funds from them for the party. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann claimed that the Congress had taken ₹15.35 crore as party fund from the three private companies running power plants in the state. “This is the reason why the Congress has not cancelled power purchase deals,” he alleged at a press conference here. He also accused the Akali leaders of having financial stakes in power projects. Taking a dig at Congress leader and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s tweets on the controversial PPAs, the AAP leader asked him to put out a post on Twitter on the funds received by the Congress party from power companies. “He (Sidhu) has been tweeting a lot. Let’s see if he puts out a tweet on this or not,” he said. On the Delhi government’s petition in the Supreme Court seeking closure of thermal power plants causing air pollution, Mann said the AAP had moved the court, seeking upgrade of thermal power plants. “The guidelines in the plan of the central government for private power plants are clear on this, but the previous SAD-BJP government while signing agreements with power companies did not include these guidelines. It is necessary to upgrade the power plants to curb air and water pollution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-took-funds-from-firms-running-thermal-plants-aap-101626120229719.html

The special task force (STF) of the Punjab Police had recovered the contraband from a house rented out by Masih on the disclosure of one Sukhbir Singh alias Happy, who was arrested with 6-kg heroin in Mohali. With the raid on the house, the police had also arrested seven people, including Masih and an Afghanistan national. During the investigation, many more people were named in the case, including the racket’s kingpin Simranjit Singh alias Sandhu. The heroin was smuggled from Pakistan via a Gujarat port, the investigation had found. The Afghan national was helping the other accused in processing the contraband. “The accused would adulterate the heroin with other ingredients to increase its volume for more gains,” police had said, adding that besides heroin, suspected 38.2kg dextromethorphan powder, 25.9kg caffeine powder and a laboratory, along with six drums of chemicals, were recovered from the house. Masih had given his house on rent to the other accused. “Masih had filed a plea for regular bail on medical grounds in a local court around seven months ago. But, the court had granted him interim bail. On Monday, the court of additional district and sessions judge Pushpinder Singh cancelled the interim bail and instructed Masih to report to the jail in seven days,” said a senior STF official, who didn’t wish to be named. He said, “Masih was booked under section 25 of the NDPS Act. Our investigation had found that Masih was aware of accused drug smuggling while giving his house on rent for ₹80,000 per month. He had also not followed the law while renting out his house to the accused.” Deputy superintendent of police (DSP-STF) Vawinder Mahajan, who is investigating the case, confirmed the development, but refused to make any comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/194kg-heroin-seizure-in-feb-2020-house-owner-s-interim-bail-cancelled-101626120109688.html

13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Cong MLA Raja Warring opens another front against Manpreet||Two-time Congress MLA from Gidderbaha Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Monday demanded disciplinary action against Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal for favouring the Akali leaders over the Congressmen. Warring tagged former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Twitter, urging him to take note of Manpreet’s anti-party activities and demanded his removal from the state cabinet. Endorsing Warring’s political outburst against Manpreet who represents Bathinda assembly segment, Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu and MLA Kulbir Singh Zira re-tweeted the post. Cooperation minister Sukhjinder Randhawa also retweeted to state “Congress can never have any understanding with Akali Dal which has destroyed Punjab from roots. Still, if there is any perception, it should be broken (sic)”. For the last one month, Warring has been taking potshots at his political bete noire Manpreet whom he had defeated in 2012 from Gidderbaha that was earlier a bastion of the Badal family. To buttress his accusation of ignoring Congress workers, Warring on Monday posted photos on his Twitter and Facebook pages of a Youth Akali leader Charanjit Singh Lohara receiving a cheque for some development work from Manpreet. Lohara’s photographs with Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and former minister Bikramjit Singh Majithia were also posted by Warring to back his claim. Warring said Lohara is an active Akali leader in Gidderbaha segment and FM’s act gives a wrong message to the Congress cadre. SAD’s in-charge of the Gidderbaha segment Hardeep Dhillon Dimpy said Lohara is among the most active Akali members of the constituency. “It is ridiculous that Manpreet or any other Congress minister has favoured Akali workers. Warring is dragging Charanjit’s name for his political benefits,” said Dhillon. In his social media posts, Gidderbaha MLA stated Manpreet gained entry into the Congress party (ahead of the last assembly polls) under a political conspiracy. Warring cautioned Congress leaders and workers against Manpreet’s anti-party political designs. “Even after joining the Congress, Manpreet Badal still has a soft corner for his former party, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Congress accorded due space to Badal but he is backstabbing the same party by being soft to the Akali leadership,” he stated on social media. Later, Warring said he has apprised chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and the state party president Sunil Jakhar that Manpreet is interfering in Gidderbaha to weaken him. “While paying tributes to his maternal uncle, Manpreet Badal on July 4 announced a grant of ₹30 lakh for Mandhir to lay sewer pipes in the village. Mandhir falls in my constituency and the development work was announced on the demand of Akali workers. Congress workers are demoralised as the development works demanded by the area MLA is ignored and Akali activists get heard easily,” he said. Manpreet refuses to comment Manpreet Badal’s media coordinator Harjit Sidhu said the minister has refused to offer any comment on charges levelled by Warring.

13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Rajpura hostage drama: BJP protests outside CM house, Capt assures action||The Punjab BJP on Monday held a dharna in front of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s official residence against the brutal attack on its workers by farmers in Rajpura. The delegation led by state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma later met the chief minister and brought to his notice the frequent attacks on BJP leaders by members of some farmer unions, demanding strict action against such “miscreants”. Initially, the delegation had announced to stage dharna in front of Punjab DGP’s office, but changed the plan later. During their meeting with the chief minister, the BJP leaders blamed that in the past one year, the BJP workers and leaders were being harassed and intimidated by “miscreants” who had political protection. “The police are playing a mute role. We have gone and met the SSPs of the districts concerned where such ugly incidents had taken place, but not a single arrest was made,” said the state BJP chief. Sharma also asked the chief minister to withdraw security of all BJP leaders if the party workers have to face harassment at the hands of “miscreants who call themselves farmers”. Sharma said the chief minister promised that he will personally look into the matter and even talked to DGP Dinkar Gupta with directions to ensure strict action in all cases of attack on political (BJP) functionaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rajpura-hostage-drama-bjp-protests-outside-cm-house-capt-assures-action-101626119329651.html
13-07-2021||Mumbai||The Kolhapur paradox: District with highest daily caseload has the most 45+ vaccinations||Experts are mulling over the curious case of Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district, which has vaccinated the most number of people in the age group of 45 and above among the state’s 36 districts, but is still registering the highest daily caseload in the state for the past three weeks. Kolhapur has administered 1.47 million vaccine doses to date. Of these, nearly 400,000 people have got both the doses or are fully vaccinated. According to data of the state public health department on July 4, Kolhapur ranked first in vaccination coverage of the 45+ population with nearly 70% having received at least one dose. In contrast, only 1.6% of the age group of 18 to 44 years had received at least one dose – the lowest in the state. This has led experts to conjecture that Kolhapur’s surge is being driven by the unvaccinated, active, younger population. “The younger population in Kolhapur is the most vulnerable and the infections are higher among them,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. “There is also a lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate protocol and a need to strengthen the contact tracing and containment measures in the district,” he said. “Crowd management has been a problem in the district, particularly in market areas. People are also not following strict home quarantine norms leading to entire families testing positive. For instance, recently a 24-year-old tested positive and was asymptomatic but eventually, all 11 members of his family also turned positive,” a local health official said. According to state officials, the epidemic curve in Kolhapur also looked different compared to other districts. While most districts began to record a surge between February and March, Kolhapur’s surge began in April. For instance, when most districts had started recording cases in hundreds in March 2021, Kolhapur’s daily caseload hovered between 20 and 60. On April 7, the district recorded 233 cases, which steadily increased -- 393 cases on April 15 and 1,012 cases on April 30. On Monday, the district recorded 1,947 new cases; it currently has over 11,794 active cases, the second highest in the state after Pune (16,925). “Due to the late surge, the peak in the district came later too,” said Kolhapur’s district health officer Dr Yogesh Sale. To be sure, the number of tests in the district has also gone up. In May, the district was carrying out an average of 3,000 tests daily. The testing numbers now are between 15,000 and 18,000 daily. Nearly 60% of these tests are RT-PCR. “Our positivity rate has now come down to 10% compared to 15% to 17% in the past few weeks,” said Dr Anil Mali, the civil surgeon in the district. A declining positivity rate indicates that the spread of the disease is stabilising. However, a test positivity rate of less than 5% alone means that the pandemic is under control. The district administration will also send 100 samples to Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi, part of the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), which was set up in December 2020 to monitor genomic variations of the Covid-19 causing coronavirus. The results of the 286 samples sent by the district authorities in May and June are yet to come. According to data released by the Union health ministry last month, the Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 was a major contributor to the second wave of infections that peaked in April and May. The new Delta plus variant (AY 1) has been detected in the samples from 10 states already, including Maharashtra, and experts said that it is also highly transmissible especially among vulnerable groups (unmasked and unvaccinated). “We randomly select samples from the pool of samples received for testing, extract RNA and send it to IGIB for genome sequencing,” said Dr Smita Deshpande, the nodal officer for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) testing in the district. “We have not been informed about any variants as yet.” According to Joshi, the Delta variant that is predominantly in circulation in Maharashtra is likely the main variant in Kolhapur too. “The Delta variant is the more concerning strain, fittest to survive and spread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/the-kolhapur-paradox-district-with-highest-daily-caseload-has-the-most-45-vaccinations-101626118849129.html
13-07-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination scam fallout: civic bodies tighten SOPs, housing societies turn more vigilant||The vaccination which came to light last month, in which over 4000 people were administered saline water in fake vaccination drives across the city, has left many residents of high rise housing societies wary even as civic bodies have issued new guidelines to ensure greater vigilance. Housing society members of Royal Heights in Vartak Nagar, Thane, are exercising extreme vigilance before conducting a vaccination drive. “There were multiple questions on the authenticity of the vaccine raised by our residents as a result of the vaccination scam. So we have to ensure that we are dealing with reliable people to provide the vaccine doses. We are in touch with the civic body and hospitals,” said Anand Rao, chairman of the housing society. The society, which is in touch with a private hospital for conducting the drive, sought confirmation from the Thane Municipal Corporation that it was a valid vaccine provider. The TMC’s protocol, prepared on July 8 states that any society or private establishment that conducts a vaccination drive needs to inform the civic body. “If any private vaccination drive is being organized within Thane city we find out about those providing vaccine doses. We also send a team of officials to check the details and formalities related to the drive this includes the authenticity of the vaccine doses. Only after all this is checked do we give a go ahead to any private vaccination drive,” said Dr Amol Gitte, incharge of the private vaccination facility within TMC jurisdiction. A similar approach is being followed by Mumbai’s ward officers. “We have mandated that the private vaccination centres should inform the ward office before organising the drive. Our doctors and field staff visit the location before the arrangements for the vaccination drive are made,” Dr Nitish Thakur, a medical officer in P-South ward said. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s first set of guidelines for private vaccination centres and housing societies were issued on May 7. On June 14, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal issued a second circular reiterating the requirements including the need for a Memorandum of Understanding between the housing society and the private vaccination centre or hospital providing the vaccines. On July 1, the civic body circulated a revised set of guidelines that said that the ward’s medical officer and police should be intimated prior to the vaccination drive. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of BMC said that the new guidelines direct housing society committees to demand copies of bills and receipts of purchase of vaccine from the private centres. Housing societies have also been asked to destroy the labels on the vaccine vials to prevent misuse. Ajitkumar Ambi, assistant municipal commissioner of N Ward said that two queries were registered in the ward, which includes Ghatkopar, in the past few weeks. “Our medical officers and other field staff immediately visited the spot to verify. Because of the widespread news about the scams, the housing society members are now more alert while negotiating with private centres,” he said. The medical officer and field staff did not find any discrepancies and the vaccination drives were carried out thereafter. Mumbai has administered over 6 million doses so far, of which nearly 2.5 million doses have been administered at private vaccination centres. In Thane, of the 600,000 vaccinations that have taken place till date, 180,000 have been at private vaccination centres. Last month, residents of Hiranandani Heritage in Kandivli complained to the authorities about a suspicious vaccination drive held in their housing society on May 30 and June 1. Some of the 390 residents who were vaccinated received certificates from different hospitals, and with the wrong date. It emerged that they were victims of an elaborate scam, allegedly masterminded by Dr Shivraj Pataria, wife Neeta – who run Shivam Hospital in Charkop -- and associate Dr Manish Tripathi, who runs a training centre for medical staff in its premises. At least 14 people have been booked. The BMC on Monday said that it sought guidelines from both the state and the Centre on vaccinating the victims of the scam. Officials said that the police investigation revealed that none of the victims received genuine vaccine doses and remained vulnerable to the pandemic. “To vaccinate them we will need a set of guidelines from the state or central government. Many of the victims also have been issued certificates. These certificates will have to be nullified and fresh certificates will have to be issued after genuine vaccination,” Gomare said.This comes in the backdrop of reports about a resident of Hiranandani Park in Kandivali where the vaccination scam was first reported testing positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-scam-fallout-civic-bodies-tighten-sops-housing-societies-turn-more-vigilant-101626118789037.html

The situation is getting worse by the day due to low demand and the rising fuel prices, and ever-rising operating costs. The rising fuel prices also have a cascading effect on the prices of commodities and inflation is at an all-time high.

13-07-2021||Mumbai||NEET-UG schedule out: Exam on September 12, registration starts from Tuesday||The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for undergraduate medical aspirants (NEET-UG) will be conducted across the country on September 12. The Union health minister made the announcement on Monday, days after the National Testing Agency (NTA) declared dates for Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) Mains and Advanced for engineering aspirants.“NEET-UG 2021 will be held on 12th September, 2021 across the country following Covid-19 protocols. The application process will begin from 5pm on July 13 through the NTA website,” education minister Dharmendra Pradhan posted on Twitter.The announcement has calmed lakhs of medical aspirants who were clueless about the entrance exam for some months now. “With no exam dates in place, we were getting frustrated because we’ve been preparing for this test for couple of years. We are glad the exam date has been announced and registrations will begin soon,” said Navjyot Ahuja, an MBBS aspirant.Recently, the National Medical Commission (NMC) released a circular stating rescheduling of dates for examinations for the current and next academic years. While a previous circular had mentioned that exams for the 2021-22 batch will take place in August 2022, the latest circular stated that these exams will be rescheduled, hinting at a delayed examination season due to the delay in the start of the current academic year.“The schedule announced earlier on the website is not applicable anymore. Rescheduled dates will be announced soon,” stated the latest circular. Approval for new institutes as well as courses for 2022-23 has also been delayed, said NMC.Even with exam dates announced, students and parents are still worried that this delay in conducting exams will lead to delay in admissions as well. “This year, admission is likely to follow last year’s schedule and cut-off dates. Year after year admissions are eating into the academic calendar and this is a worrying trend,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of a medical student.Admissions to most professional courses was delayed by a few months in 2020 due to Covid restrictions and admissions to UG medical and dental colleges went on till January and February 2021, respectively. Students as well as institutes have shared concerns about this delay leading to a shorter academic year, which leaves students at a loss. While NEET-UG dates were delayed due to delay in Class 12 results, NEET-PG (postgraduate) aspirants are still waiting for their exam dates after it was postponed due to rising Covid cases in the second wave of the pandemic.Students still have queries and doubts about the admission process, which they hope will be cleared by NTA soon. “If the exam is held in September and results are out by October, medical institutes will end up conducting admissions till the end of this year. We hope NTA as well as state admissions authority share the admissions schedule soon as well,” said Anindita Chakraborty, another NEET-UG aspirant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neetug-schedule-out-exam-on-september-12-registration-starts-from-tuesday-101626118669047.html
13-07-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination awareness in rural Maharashtra: From art, street plays to priests||Even though Maharashtra has vaccinated more than 36 million people— the highest in the country, the state’s hinterlands are far behind when it comes to immunisation. To encourage people to get the jab, local public health authorities are employing creative ideas to spread awareness through wall graffiti and street plays. In fact, some districts are inoculating hakims (physicians who use traditional remedies) and pujaris (priests) in a bid to gain people’s trust about the efficiency of Covid-19 vaccines. Viswanath Koli, 62, a local activist, was one of the first beneficiaries from Govindpur, a village in Gadchiroli district, to get fully immunised in June. In April, when he took the first shot, he developed a fever with body pain which is common after any immunisation. Though he recovered within two days, fake news had started spreading among the villagers that he contracted Covid-19 post vaccination. “During vaccination, the nurse had warned me of such minor side effects. But people started spreading false information about my health. After I recovered, I had to inform the sarpanch (village head) who then made an announcement in the village about providing correct information,” he said. Govindpur has a population of around 1,200 people with a literacy rate of 72.23%, as per 2011 Census. But so far, only 71 villagers have been fully vaccinated. The situation is similar in most districts, significantly affecting the mass immunisation programme which is already suffering due to shortages of doses. Districts like Hingoli, Palghar, Nandurbar, Parbhani, Jalgaon and Gadchiroli have recorded less than 5% full vaccination among its residents. An analysis of the data provided by the state health department shows Hingoli, where 84.82% of the population live in rural areas, has recorded only 3.4% full vaccination. Nandurbar which has 83.29% population in villages has been able to fully vaccinate only 4%. Parbhani with 63.2% population in rural areas has fully immunised only 4.9% of its people. Jalgaon and Gadchiroli with 68% and 89% population in rural areas recorded 4.1% and 4.4% full immunisation, respectively. Similarly, Palghar has provided both jabs to only 3.78% of the residents.“In Maharashtra, almost 55% of the population consist of rural people. To gain success in the ongoing mass immunisation programme, it is imperative to attain at least 70% full vaccination among rural districts. For that, there is a need to start door-to-door awareness programmes,” said Dr Ravikant Singh from Doctors for You, an NGO that works in rural Maharashtra. Districts use art and ‘village docs’ Saraswati Vijay Gaikwad is one of the many health volunteers from Bori Shikari, a village in Hingoli, who has been given the responsibility to arrange for local artists to paint graffiti on walls with messages on vaccination. “Most hospitals have already posted paintings which emphasise the importance of vaccination. Now, we have been instructed to paint nearby walls with graffiti to sensitise people about vaccination,” said Gaikwad. She is also assisting ASHA and Anganwadi workers with door-to-door awareness drive.In addition, public health officers are trying to raise awareness among people through street plays. Some districts like Gadchiroli and Hingoli are also organising puppet shows. “Villagers often get scared when volunteers go to their houses. Presuming they will be forcefully inoculated, they often run away or do not open the door. So, we have decided to hold street plays in villages which help spread the information to a large audience,” said Dr Dayanand Suryavanshi, Palghar district health officer.Officers said villagers have the false belief that vaccination will kill them due to the spread of false information on social media platforms. To help villagers overcome their fear, district health officers are requesting local ‘doctors’ like hakims and pujaris to take the vaccine to motivate the people around them.Gadchiroli district health officer Dr Shashikant Shambarkar said once they vaccinate local hakims and pujaris, villagers follow suit. “The villagers strongly trust pujaris and hakims. So, it is essential that we vaccinate them first. We are reaching out to small hamlets like Dewada and Korkuti,” he said. “Local politicians who have good popularity need to come forward and need to raise awareness through door to door visits, just like the way they do during elections campaigns,” said Dr Singh.Medical teams are also being sent to the Maoist hotbed of Abhujamadh along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-awareness-in-rural-maharashtra-from-art-street-plays-to-priests-101626118609024.html

Although the state inoculated 490,283 people on Monday, it has almost run out of stock. “We are working below our capacity. It is literally a hand-to-mouth situation,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra has been claiming it has the capacity to vaccinate 1.5 million people daily. Tope further said 700,000 doses were received three days ago and would be almost exhausted by Monday evening.Maharashtra has administered 37,017,471 vaccine doses so far. The Assembly passed a resolution demanding 30 million doses per month to vaccinate maximum population within the next three months. Dr Satyendra Nath Mehra, medical director, Masina Hospital at Byculla, said, “Vaccines tend to reduce the rate of infection which means mild symptoms. This will ultimately translate to less stress on the medical infrastructure and also significantly reduce the mortality rate.”Mumbai on Monday recorded 496 new cases along with nine deaths, with its toll reaching 15,636. The total number of Covid-19 patients has now reached 6,165,402 of which Mumbai’s share is 728,190. A total of 175,899 tests done on Monday, while the number of recoveries clocked 15,277. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 108,343, while the toll has now reached 126,024. Currently, there are 108,343 active patients across the state.

13-07-2021||Mumbai||BYL Nair Hospital starts clinical trial of Zydus Cadila’s Covid vax on those aged between 12 and 17||BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central has become the first civic-run hospital to start the phase 3 clinical trial of indigenous vaccine ZyCoV-D on children in the city. A total of 50 children between the age 12 and 17 will be enrolled for the trial. Half of the volunteers will be given placebo, a false replica of the vaccine. Ahmedabad-based drug maker Zydus Cadila has manufactured ZyCoV-D — a plasmid DNA vaccine, which is the first-of-its-kind that uses a genetically engineered DNA molecule known as a plasmid which is coded to generate spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It elicits an immune response against it and develops antibodies. On July 1, in a statement, the manufacturer declared that they have recorded 66.6% primary efficacy in their interim analysis.The primary objective of the clinical trial reads, “To demonstrate the efficiency of ZyCoV-D in the prevention of virologically-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 cases as compared to placebo.”The enrolment of volunteers has begun at the hospital. “The volunteers have to be healthy, without severe comorbidities. We are looking to select children with educated parents as they will have to maintain a diary of daily health updates and submit to the hospital for consultation,” said a senior doctor. Along with written consent, audio-visual consent will also be taken from the parents of the children. “The parents will also have to agree that during the course of the trial, they would not get their children vaccinated,” said the doctor. As part of the trial, three doses will be administered to the volunteers. After the first dose, the second and third dose will be given after a gap of 28 and 56 days.“In the second wave, we have seen that a large number of children contracted Covid-19 infection. If this vaccine proves to be effective among children then it will be a great relief for parents, since there is no vaccine available in the market for children as of yet,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. “As seen in BMC’s sero survey, almost 50% surveyed children had antibodies, which indicates that a large number of children had contracted Covid-19 but remained undiagnosed. Hence, there is a need for a vaccine for children especially when cities are planning to open schools. This can save children from not only getting infected and but will also prevent the infection from being transmitted among the elderly population in their families,” said Dr Bela Verma, paediatrician from Sir JJ Hospital.ZyCoV-D is an intradermal vaccine, applied using a needle-free injector. Zydus claims that the needle-free system can lead to a significant reduction in side effects. “The plug-and-play technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based is ideally suited for dealing with Covid-19 as it can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring,” reads the statement. The vaccine can be stored at a temperature between two and eight degrees Celsius, and has shown good stability at 25 degrees Celsius for at least three months. The manufacturer has recently applied to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for emergency use authorisation (EUA) of the vaccine. Once Zydus receives approval, ZyCoV-D would become the fifth anti-Covid vaccine authorised for use in India, after Covishield, indigenous Covaxin, Sputnik V and Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/byl-nair-hospital-starts-clinical-trial-of-zydus-cadila-s-covid-vax-on-those-aged-between-12-and-17-101626118429575.html

Persistent fever in patients resolved within 48 hours and there was an overall reduction in days of hospitalisation, doctors have observed. The cocktail drug used at SevenHills Hospital included two monoclonal antibodies — Casirivimab and Imdevimab. Monoclonal antibodies are artificial antibodies injected into a patient to mimic the action of the natural antibodies. So far, 212 patients at SevenHills Hospital have received the cocktail drug, but doctors have analysed the data of only 199 patients. “We did not record any mortality in the 199 patients that were studied, and their recovery was quicker,” said Dr Maharudra Kumbhar, an officer on special duty at the hospital. “We currently have the drug for nearly 700 patients. Our analysis will continue as we administer it to more patients,” he said. The patients who received the drug were aged between 18 and 94 years. At least 74 patients had one or more comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease among others. At the time of administering the cocktail drug, 179 patients had persistent fever, 158 had a cough with or without fever, and four patients required oxygen support. All the patients were categorised as mild to moderate. The analysis, conducted over the past four weeks, by the team of doctors further states that the average hospitalisation period for such patients is around 13 to 14 days while for those who received the antibody cocktail, it came down to five to six days. While the patients were fit for discharge, they were kept in the hospital for monitoring. Only one patient’s condition deteriorated and required oxygen support.“It is crucial to use the drug at the right time,” said infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who is also a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. He has administered the cocktail drug to nearly 20 patients so far. “The drug has shown promising results in all patients. I have not seen any adverse effects so far,” he said. The drug comes in a pack of two vials containing monoclonal antibodies. One vial can be used for two patients. “The cost of the drug is around ₹1.2 lakh, but we use it in pairs so the cost for each patient is around ₹60,000,” said Nagvekar. The civic body has procured the drug through an initiative by the National Health Mission and is administering it to patients free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antibody-cocktail-shows-promise-analysis-by-sevenhills-hospital-doctors-101626118429024.html

Kharge said that Congress would corner the Modi government over inflation in the monsoon session of the Parliament, slated to from July 19.Kharge said that his party has been fighting the battle against inflation on roads, but it will now take it to the floor of both the Houses during the monsoon session.Kharge said that the Modi government increased fuel rates 326 times during his tenure as PM, even as the past two months have seen 38 price revisions. “During the Manmohan Singh government till 2014, the Central taxes on fuel were just 9.48%, which had not gone beyond ₹32.90 per litre. Despite the crude oil price being $111 per barrel, the price of petrol was ₹71 per litre as compared to today’s rate of ₹107, though the crude oil price in the international market is $44 per barrel. The Modi government has amassed ₹25 lakh crore in the past seven years. Similarly, the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy has come to zero when the price per cylinder is ₹834. Modi had said that the direct benefit transfer system will save ₹15,000 crore a year. We want to ask the Centre why the amount saved through it is not being spent on the citizens,” he asked.Kharge also said that the rates of pulses have increased by 12.72% as compared to last year. Citizens are directly hit because of the inflation and even farmers are not benefited from it, he said. “The Singh government could push 27.1 crore citizens above poverty line. But the Modi government’s tenure has resulted in 23 crore people slipping below the poverty line. Around 133,000 people lost their jobs over the past one year, while the per capita income has dropped by ₹10,000 in just one year,” he said.BJP spokesperson Vishwas Pathak said, “The Congress-led governments in the past use to play trick by asking the oil companies raise the money through oil bonds to keep the oil prices in control. Modi government had to shoulder the responsibility to repayment of the oil bonds raised by the previous government. Similarly, the Modi government did no increase direct taxes and reduce indirect taxes to 16% from previous rate of 23%. By introducing GST, the government could raise the budget size to ₹34 lakh crore from ₹14 lakh crore seven years ago. If the Congress wants the fuel prices in Maharashtra to reduce, it can ask its government to remove the state taxes which are a third of the selling price. The Central taxes are equal to one third of the selling price and of that too, 40% is given to states through devolution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-earned-25-lakh-crore-from-taxes-on-fuel-mallikarjun-kharge-101626118368955.html
13-07-2021||Other||Cooperation ministry: Amit Shah is not above law, says NCP||A day after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said that the creation of the new Union cooperation ministry would have an adverse impact on Maharashtra’s cooperative sector, his party on Monday said that no one is above the law be it cooperation minister Amit Shah or anyone else and any attempt to destroy the sector will be opposed by them.From the formation of the cooperation ministry and Shah –the Union home minister – assuming its charge, there are apprehensions in the state’s ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition that the cooperative sector in the state may turn into a new battleground between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the NCP-Congress, with the former trying to end the monopoly of the two parties in the sector. Maharashtra has a strong network of cooperative bodies, which also forms a significant support base for NCP and Congress.NCP’s chief spokesperson and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said that BJP leaders are making irresponsible statements as Shah was given the responsibility of the cooperation ministry.“Since Shah took charge of the ministry, a few BJP leaders have been making statements; some of them are even threatening that the leaders and bodies working in the cooperative sector would be in trouble. We would like to tell them that it is a state subject and only multistate cooperative bodies come under the purview of the Centre,” Malik said during a media interaction held on Monday at NCP headquarters.“We also want to inform BJP leaders that no one is above the law, be it Shah or anyone else. It is untrue that if a person becomes a minister then they get all the powers. We want BJP leaders to make comments responsibly,” he added.Malik said the cooperative sector was given the maximum autonomy by bringing the 97th Amendment in the Constitution, when Pawar was the agriculture minister.“The 97th Amendment was made to restrict all types of political and government interferences, and maximum autonomy was provided to the cooperation sector. Moreover, five years’ tenure of an elected body, election process, board of directors etc. everything was clearly defined. Not only this, an election body on the lines of the Election Commission of India (ECI) was also set up for impartial polls. Now if someone wants to strengthen the sector, NCP will support them. But if someone wants to destroy it, then we all will rise against them,” the NCP leader said.Speaking to reporters at Baramati on Sunday, Pawar had refuted apprehensions that the newly formed ministry of cooperation may be used to “hijack the cooperative movement” in Maharashtra.The NCP chief had said that while the concept is not new, forming a ministry at the Centre cannot interfere with the cooperative sector in Maharashtra, which has a strong network of such institutions, with politicians from the Congress and NCP relying on these networks to retain their clout.“As per the Constitution, cooperative institutions registered in a state come under the [jurisdiction of that respective] state,” Pawar said, days after leaders from Congress and NCP were suspicious of the move.He said the ministry is all about multi-state cooperative institutions. “A state cannot control a cooperative institution registered in more than one state, which is called multi-state institution, and the Central government has control over it.”Last week, deputy chief minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar had said, “The intention of the Central government is yet to be clear, but they may have something in their mind. It will be known only after the new legislations are introduced for the sector, just like the three contentious farm laws over which farmers are now protesting for the past eight months.”Madhav Bhandari, vice-president, state BJP unit, said that those who have done something wrong are making noise against the formation of the cooperation ministry. “No BJP leader ever tried to threaten anyone through their statement. Whatever statements were made were only to welcome the formation of the cooperation ministry. Those who have done nothing wrong are quiet. Why are only NCP leaders are making so much noise,” Bhandari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cooperation-ministry-amit-shah-is-not-above-law-says-ncp-101626118068989.html
13-07-2021||Other||5 ICICI Bank officials, firm booked for cheating Mumbai hotelier of ₹120-cr||The banking (fraud) unit of Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) has registered a cheating case against five senior executives of ICICI Bank and an assets reconstruction company (ARC) for allegedly causing wrongful loss of ₹120 crore to a hotelier. The case is registered on the basis of a complaint lodged on Saturday by Vishal Sharma, 48, director of Hotel Horizon Pvt Ltd, located at Juhu Tara Road. “The five senior ICICI Bank executives were then working on the posts of group executive, general manager, deputy general manager and relationship manager and assistant relationship manager at the bank’s BKC (Bandra-Kurla Complex) headquarters,” said a senior EOW officer.” Sharma has alleged that the accused bankers, ARC and others caused the loss of ₹120 crore to him since 2011, when he had first applied for a loan of ₹351 crore. EOW officers said Sharma tried to avail the loan by mortgaging properties worth ₹1,200 crore. “The bank’s management committee needed the credit committee’s sanction for discussing the loan amount. The management committee had, however, not informed the credit committee about the hotelier’s loan requirement. Instead, they allegedly made changes in the loan proposal and placed it before the credit committee, and kept Sharma in dark about it,” said an EOW officer. Sharma had alleged in the complaint that the accused bankers informed him that his loan was sanctioned, and that the amount would be disbursed in phases. Though he was informed of getting of ₹25 crore in the first phase, the bank deducted ₹15.5 crore from the loan amount as processing fees and Sharma only received ₹9.5 crore. “The said officials also allegedly showed a profit (which the bank was supposed to gain by sanctioning the loan) in the bank’s records and audit. They allegedly did this without processing the mortgaged properties and disbursing the entire loan amount to the applicant,” an EOW officer said requesting anonymity. The bank failed to disburse the entire loan amount to Sharma on pretexts such as non-compliance of all the terms and conditions mentioned in the loan agreement, the officer added. Sharma followed up on the matter with the bank for years. The accused bankers then started coercing Sharma for a final settlement and asked him to pay ₹45 crore as the final settlement amount which would include the interest on the loan amount disbursed to the applicant and also the final settlement amount. This was done so that the bank could close Sharma’s loan file, the police said. The bank then allegedly sold the loan to the private asset reconstruction company ARC, which Sharma was not aware of. He learnt about it after ARC initiated recovery proceedings against him by staking a claim of ₹120 crore on the mortgaged assets. Sharma then decided to approach the police a few months ago to initiate criminal proceedings against the bank and ARC. The banking (fraud) unit-2 had conducted a preliminary inquiry into Sharma’s complaint and after it prima facie established that a cognisable offence can be make out from the allegations registered a first information report (FIR) under sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code at BKC police station and took over the investigation on Saturday. “We will soon summon the accused and other witnesses to record their statement. We have already written to the bank, seeking documents pertaining to the said loan file,” another EOW officer said. An ICICI Bank spokesperson alleged, “The company is a defaulter to the Bank. The previous complaints by the company on the same matter were rejected not only by the EOW but also by the Banking Ombudsman. We will continue to co-operate with the investigating authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-icici-bank-officials-firm-booked-for-cheating-mumbai-hotelier-of-120cr-101626117888963.html
13-07-2021||Mumbai||NCP slams Yogi Adityanath, says Maharashtra has two-child norm for the past 21 years||The Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) slammed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his “much hyped” two-child policy. The ruling party in the state said Uttar Pradesh chief minister is making a lot of noise over the policy which is not new for Maharashtra. The policy has been in place in the state for the past 21 years.On World Population Day, Yogi Adityanath launched a population policy with an aim to incentivise couples who do not have more than two children. The UP law commission that has formulated a population control bill said the policy would be voluntary and nobody would be forced to follow any rule. However, if any person decides on his or her own to not have more than two children, they will be eligible for government schemes, while those who do not follow the policy, will face restrictions in government jobs, availing ration, and other benefits.Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister, said that Maharashtra has had this policy for the last 21 years. “Yogi Adityanath is making a lot of noise about the policy, which has been implemented in Maharashtra since 2000. Those who have more than two children are not allowed to contest any of the local body elections in the state. Also, they are not allowed to take benefits of government welfare schemes for more than two children,” he said.“Adityanath should also make a policy for Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who are in favour of producing more children (in order to increase Hindu population),” he said, referring to remarks made by right-wing leaders in the past about increasing Hindu population. Apart from Uttar Pradesh, the BJP-ruled Assam is also pushing for a similar move with its chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma stating last week that population norms will be slowly implemented for government schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-slams-yogi-adityanath-says-maharashtra-has-two-child-norm-for-the-past-21-years-101626117768963.html
13-07-2021||Other||Case against Anil Deshmukh: HC says corruption paralyses system, full-fledged probe needed||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), while arguing against the petition filed by former home minister Anil Deshmukh petition – that sought quashing of the first information report (FIR) – in the Bombay high court (HC), has submitted that the plea is against the Constitution as it is trying to stifle the issue of corruption which the law mandates should be dealt with severely. CBI further submitted that the principles of honesty and accountability were being violated and if the investigation is stalled, as sought in the petition, it would shake the confidence of the public. The court reiterated that apart from Deshmukh the other officers involved could not escape their responsibility and they should be probed to uphold public confidence. “Corruption is the root cause of what paralysed the system and hence, we want a full-fledged investigation,” the court observed. CBI assured HC that it would investigate all persons involved in the criminal conspiracy which has been alleged by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar that was hearing the case was informed by additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi – representing CBI – that Deshmukh’s petition was trying to revisit the April 5 HC order, wherein a preliminary inquiry was ordered. He added that as the order was affirmed by the Supreme Court, such an attempt was unwarranted. Lekhi also countered the claim by Deshmukh’s counsel Amit Desai who had said that the allegation that Deshmukh had directed former Mumbai assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to collect money from bars and orchestras in the city were merely whispers in the corridor of the then commissioner’s office and hence, could not be relied upon. Lekhi submitted that what Vaze disclosed to Singh was not hearsay. The court, thereafter, queried that if that was indeed the case, why did the highest officer not investigate or register an FIR, and reiterated that the role of all those involved should be investigated. “In any department, one individual cannot do it [corruption] alone. As long as everyone is happy, no one complains. But the moment there is a transfer, then someone speaks,” remarked the bench. The court then sought to know who the main collector was. If it was Vaze, then the question of his reinstatement arises, said HC. Lekhi responded that there were more than one individual involved and hence it was a conspiracy. Lekhi concurred and stated that as it was a case of alleged corruption and it needed to be detected and eradicated at the earliest, the petition aimed to stifle the investigation and hence it should not be allowed as CBI had found mandatory facts which needed to be probed. While arguing in rejoinder to CBI’s submissions, Desai questioned why the names of the police personnel were not mentioned in the FIR if it was registered to instil public confidence. He submitted that by intentionally leaving out the names of police officers and naming Deshmukh, there was an attempt to besmirch the ex-minister’s name while saving the cops involved. He added that as CBI had failed to unearth anything in Singh’s complaint it included other issues which were not considered in the April 5 order. After hearing all the submissions, the court asked CBI to submit a report on the progress of investigation in a sealed envelope and reserved its judgment. The court has reserved its judgment in the case and will pronounce it in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/case-against-anil-deshmukh-hc-says-corruption-paralyses-system-full-fledged-probe-needed-101626117649544.html

The state submitted that though the council of ministers had provided the aid and advice as per the relevant article of the Constitution of India, the governor had not respected the same and had kept his decision on the proposal pending for over eight months now. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Ratan Soli was informed by senior advocate Aspi Chinoy that by not taking a decision the Governor had acted contrary to the principles of constitutional democracy. Chinoy submitted that though the governor could not be made a party in the case, his actions and inactions could be subjected to a judicial review, which was appropriate in this case due to the inordinate delay on his part to decide. Senior counsel Rafique Dada for the state submitted that the governor should have accepted or rejected the recommendations of the council of ministers but could not have a third option which was illusionary or non-existent. After hearing the submissions the court sought to know from the petitioner as to whether the judicial review was possible in the present case and also sought a response on the maintainability of the petition and posted hearing to July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/governor-has-not-respected-advice-of-council-of-ministers-on-mlcs-maharashtra-govt-to-hc-101626117591182.html
13-07-2021||Mumbai||Nana Patole kicks up new row, irks all 3 Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi parties||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole has once again kicked up a controversy by alleging that he was kept under surveillance by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Dilip Walse-Patil. He said that the reports about his movements and chats are monitored by the leaders from two other parties as they cannot swallow the fact that the Congress was growing rapidly. His remarks led to strong reactions from Congress’s alliance partners in Maharashtra and embarrassed other Congress leaders who chose to avoid reacting to it.While addressing party workers in Lonavla on Saturday, Patole said that Congress’s revival in Maharashtra was not going down well with other two ruling parties. He alleged that he was under kept under surveillance by Thackeray, deputy chief minister Pawar and home minister Walse-Patil. “They (CM,DCM and home minister) receive report from intelligence department at 9am every day. Who is protesting where, who is talking what and every update about us. They even know what I do daily,” he said. The remarks sparked unrest within the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) after the video clip of his speech went viral on Monday.While Shiv Sena and NCP were irked by Patole’s remarks, other Congress leaders found it difficult to defend him. Deputy chief minister Pawar reportedly spoke to CM Thackeray over phone and expressed his anguish. He reportedly said that the remarks by Patole in the past five months since he took over as Maharashtra Congress chief have been creating cracks within the MVA. The DCM has believably demanded with the CM to take up the issue to senior leaders from the Congress.The remarks irked even other Congress leaders who chose not to defend Patole. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said: “I do not know what he wants to say and you should ask him about it.”A section of Congress leaders took up the matter with the party’s central leadership and complained that Patole’s comments are creating an unnecessary rift between Congress and its allies in the MVA. Senior Congress leader and leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and All India Congress Committee’s general secretary HK Patil were in Mumbai on Monday. State leaders have reportedly expressed their disapproval of Patole’s remarks.“HK Patil is holding a review meeting with party’s senior leaders, ministers in MVA government and other party senior leaders on Tuesday morning. The issue is expected to come up again on during the meeting,” said a senior Congress leader.NCP reacts sharply to Patole’s remarks Minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that the allegations by Patole have come out of ignorance. “A special cell of police keeps watch on the programmes, meetings, protests by all political parties and leaders and this happens under any government. The information thus collated goes to the home department. If Patole is unaware about it, he should take the information from former chief ministers from his party Ashok Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde and Prithviraj Chavan. If Patole does not want police protection for the leaders and ministers from his party and police presence during political events, he should make an application to the home minister,” he said.Patole’s remarks became public a day after NCP chief Sharad Pawar ridiculed the former, saying he was not a significant leader to take cognisance. Pawar said on Sunday that Patole was “a small leader whose comments do not warrant a response”. Pawar was reacting to Patole’s remarks on Saturday at Lonavla in the same meeting with the party workers. He had criticised Ajit Pawar for not releasing the funds for the bodies controlled by Congress and not giving nod to the works initiated by Congress. He had said that Shiv Sena and NCP “backstab” Congress when it comes to treating the party as a ruling partner.Patole on Monday said that his remarks were blown out of proportion. “When I said that I was under constant watch, I was not referring to the state government. It was meant for the central government. Collating the report about the political leaders is a constant process and its done by state as well as central agencies. The information collected by the agencies is shared with the state and central governments. There is no rift within MVA and we are doing well as an alliance. The BJP is trying to divide us by spreading false rumours,” he said.This not the first time that Patole stirred a controversy by his remarks. Last month, he publicly announced that his party would go solo in all the forthcoming elections including local bodies and Assembly. The remarks led to the strong reaction from NCP and Sena. CM Uddhav Thackeray later snubbed Congress for the announcement and said that it was not time to play politics when the pandemic was at its peak. The two parties are also upset over the way Patole resigned as Assembly speaker without taking them into confidence.Sena leader and urban development department minister Eknath Shinde downplayed the issue and said that there were no differences between the ruling parties and the alliance government will complete its term.BJP leader and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis has reacted on Patole’s comment by saying that Sena and NCP are scared ever since Patole announced to go solo in the elections. “Patole’s announcement has sent shivers down their spine and it must have compelled them to keep the Congress leader under surveillance. However, the CM and DCM should clarify what made them keep Patole under watch,” he said.(with inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nana-patole-kicks-up-new-row-irks-all-3-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-parties-101626117348942.html
13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana logs lowest ever weekly Covid case count||Haryana logged the lowest ever weekly coronavirus infection count during a period of decline recording 376 cases last week (July 5-11). Last week’s count also happens to be an all-time low surpassing 525 infections reported the week before (June 28-July 4).The downward trajectory of the virus which continued for a consecutive ninth week has prompted the government to ease restrictions including opening of educational institutions, cinema halls, shopping malls and uncapping number of persons allowed for indoor and outdoor congregations.Health officials said they now fear that the viral infection will start making a gradual climb. A similar trend was witnessed in February first week when the weekly case count had dipped to 534 and the subsequent weeks saw an increase, officials said.“Is this the culmination of flattening trajectory? That’s our worry. Since the restrictions are gone, we are keeping our fingers crossed,” said a health analyst citing the trend prior to the devastating second wave.As on Monday, there were only 900 active cases with 15 districts having 50 or less active cases. Only Hisar and Panipat districts have over 100 active cases. The weekly number of fatalities due to the contagion also came down to 64 last week.VACCINATION CLOSING IN TO 10-MN MARKHaryana is close to administering 10 million vaccine doses (including first and second dose) having inoculated about 99.27 lakh individuals by July 12.Statistics showed that about 81.51 lakh persons in state have been vaccinated with the first dose and about 17.76 lakh have got both the doses.About 36.64 lakh in the 18-45 age group have been vaccinated with the first dose and about 1.63 lakh have been vaccinated with both the doses.About 21.09 lakh individuals in the 45-60 age group have got the first shot and about 5.51 lakh have got both.In the 60+ category, about 18.87 lakh people have been inoculated with the first dose and about 7.60 lakh with both doses.REWARI, AMBALA CLOSE TO EXITING CRITICAL CATEGORYAs the cumulative positivity rate continues to fall, Rewari and Ambala districts are close to exiting the critical category.Positivity rate of more than 6% is regarded as critical. Five districts – Rohtak, Palwal, Kurukshetra, Jhajjar and Kaithal have already exited the critical category. Nuh is the only district with a desirable positivity rate of less than 2%.While fifteen districts still in the critical category have also seen reduction in the positivity rate, experts said the high cumulative positivity rate is indicative of the virulence of the contagion during the second wave and will take its time to come down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-logs-lowest-ever-weekly-covid-case-count-101626117169494.html
13-07-2021||Chandigarh||Now, dial 112 for emergency services in Haryana||Now dial 112 if you need ambulance, help from police or the fire department in Haryana.This round-the-clock emergency response support system (ERSS) will function from the state emergency response centre (SERC) in Panchkula. The state-of-the-art centre can function at uninterrupted speed even in the absence of power supply for four consecutive days.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday launched the dial 112 control room at SERC in the presence of state home minister Anil Vij and Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta.Haryana 112 is an integrated emergency response system, established to provide emergency services to people in distress anytime and anywhere across Haryana.The SERC has been digitally connected to the police control rooms at district level and suitably located emergency response vehicles.The toll free number in Hindi, English, Punjabi and Haryanvi promises to respond to people in distress within 15-20 minutes and will be operational from Tuesday morning.Khattar also flagged-off 630 emergency response vehicles equipped with mobile data terminals to all 22 districts. He said 300 more emergency response vehicles will be added so that the target of deploying 10 vehicles per assembly constituency is achieved.The SERC has been integrated with the mirror centre in Gurugram and disaster centre in Hyderabad so that the data remains secure all the times.Every call on Dial 112 will be recorded. The data will be completely secure and will not be deleted under any circumstance.Officials said in case of technical failure at the SERC, the service will continue to run uninterrupted through the mirror centre in Gurugram. If the services stop working at both places, even then the system will run smoothly and the data will be safe due to integration with the disaster centre in Hyderabad.Additional director general of police (ADGP) AS Chawla, who is also nodal officer of the toll free Haryana 112, said there will be no border restriction or police station jurisdiction limits for processing complaints received under dial 112. The nearest vehicle staff will be informed of the complainant’s location from the control room, who will immediately reach out to them to provide necessary help.‘HISTORIC STEP’Khattar said this ERSS is a historic step taken towards empowering citizens of Haryana with round-the-clock emergency assistance. He said ensuring people’s safety is utmost priority of the government.He said Dial 112 was started by the Union ministry of home affairs to provide a single number for all emergency services across country.“The service is designed to ensure immediate availability and accessibility of police in emergency situations. The system is an important step towards reducing police response time,” said Anil Vij.KHATTAR UNVEILS BOOK ON ‘UNTOLD’ STORIES OF HARYANA POLICE AMID COVIDKhattar also unveiled a coffee table book titled ‘Untold stories’ of the Haryana Police in the presence of Vij and other dignitaries on Monday.The book showcases the extraordinary work of Haryana Police during the Covid pandemic. It pays tribute to the 49 cops who succumbed to the contagion during the course of duty.The book features ‘karamveers’ of the police department who went beyond the call of duty in enforcing the lockdown, providing assistance to the public, or making them aware of Covid safety measures.Prologue of the book, penned by Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava, gives an overview of the role of police.“The human side of policing,” the DGP said, “came to fore in these trying times as 50,000 strong force worked round-the-clock to combat the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-dial-112-for-emergency-services-in-haryana-101626117050338.html

Haryana state minister for cooperatives Banwari Lal and Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal had also faced the farmers’ wrath in Fatehabad on Sunday.Farmers broke through the barricades amid heavy police security and tore posters put by BJP workers in Hisar, Fatehabad, Jind and Sirsa.Two days ago, BJP Haryana unit chief OP Dhankar had faced farmers’ protest outside Guru Jambheshwar University where farmers waved black flags and raised slogans.BKU Jind district president Azad Singh Palwa said the farmers’ agitation has picked pace after recent clashes with cops during BJP leaders’ meetings.“Despite hot summer, farmers from 15 villages are taking part in protests at Khatkar toll plaza. Farmers have also been camping at Delhi borders on a rotation basis. BJP leaders’ recent meetings in Jind and other areas where farmers held protests gave a new momentum to the stir,” he added.Dayanand Punia, state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, said the agitation will expand in the state in August and will start sending people from villages to Delhi borders.“After the Covid crisis, the farmers’ number had decreased but it is gaining momentum since July after BJP started sending its leaders across state to hold meetings with party workers to convince people in favour of the farm laws,” he added.Last week, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan, threatening of starting a ‘pucca morcha’ in Hisar, had given an ultimatum to the Hisar administration to revoke criminal cases filed against 350 farmers for protesting against Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during the second wave of Covid-19.“We will continue to protest against the farm laws until they are repealed,” he added.Two farm leaders, pleading anonymity, said many farmers were worried about the fate of the agitation after BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni asked farm leaders to take part in the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab.“After SKM denied forming a political outfit, the farmers’ number started rising at toll plazas. The numbers at Tikri and Singhu borders are less but will increase after a change in the weather conditions,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-numbers-rising-at-protest-sites-after-clashes-with-cops-101626116931282.html
13-07-2021||Lucknow||SP, other oppn parties ‘siding’ with divisive elements: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit out at opposition parties for casting doubts over the arrest of two suspected terrorists from Lucknow’s Kakori area who the state’s anti-terror squad (ATS) claimed could be operatives of an Al Qaeda-linked terror module. “The opposition raised voice against surgical strike carried out by the army against terrorists from across the border. Now, they are casting doubts after the arrest of terrorists suspected to be part of a global terror network,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev told media persons here on Monday. Expressing displeasure over SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s “don’t believe BJP government and its police” statement, the UP BJP chief said: “The SP leader must explain why he doesn’t trust the country’s army and the state’s police. And, then, he must also explain why his government tried to drop cases against terrorists. It appears that the SP and in fact the whole of opposition appears to side more with anti-social, divisive elements.” “This is not the SP rule when even buffaloes got stolen,” Swatantra Dev said. The “buffalo” reference was over the fact that during the SP rule buffaloes of SP leader Azam Khan had got stolen and traced later by police. “This is Yogi Adityanath government under which the police are acting freely against terrorists and not busy tracing VIP buffaloes. This government doesn’t engage in appeasement on issues linked to country’s security. It would have been nicer had the entire opposition supported the police’s action against terrorists in one voice,” Dev said.“In Congress time, there were leaders who reportedly wept when police killed terrorists in encounter and in SP regime cases against terrorists were sought to be withdrawn,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-other-oppn-parties-siding-with-divisive-elements-bjp-101626115369791.html

This year complaints were lodged by residents of Kausarbaug in Kondhwa, citing the markets as being a possible source for the spread of Covid-19, given the crowds the markets normally draw. Complaints were made to Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police and Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister, after which concerned government agencies issued advisories to all plot owners to refrain from allowing the sale of goats there.The Kondhwa police station also issued notices to the plot owners to stop the goat markets, citing Covid-19 restrictions. However, now the vendors have taken to the road-sides. Amir Shaikh, a goat vendor operating on the main road near Jyoti Hotel, said, “Since the markets have been discontinued due to Covid 19 restrictions, we have no option but to sell our animals on the road. Here limited people come and social distancing rules are followed. Also, we ensure that people wear masks while they come to see our goats. It is difficult for us, but we have to do it to earn our living.” Another goat vendor Mateen Khan said, “The road is the only platform for us to sell the goats. We are taking steps to complete the transaction in the deadlines set by the PMC and the police and try our best to avoid overcrowding and violation of Covid-19 rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-animal-markets-shut-goat-vendors-take-to-roadsides-ahead-of-eid-101626114651887.html

13-07-2021||Pune||Pune tree authority members dispute tree felling decision by PMC||Pune: The Pune Tree authority members and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) tree authority committee are at loggerheads over permission granted to fell trees in Deccan. The social organisation has decried the decision taken by the PMC committee. The trees in question are two historic ‘umbryachi’ trees standing tall in front of the Central Bank of India, Deccan branch, which is on lease from the board of trustees, Deccan Gymkhana, just along the wall of the building. The Central Bank of India has written several times to the Ghole road ward office asking permission to cut trees citing danger of falling and damaging the bank building. However, tree authority member Manoj Pachpute said the decision is ill-thought and will lead to an old grown tree to be felled. “I have written my objection to the permission granted by the committee to Ghole road regional office tree authority to cut down two very tall flourishing trees on Deccan Chowk on the false pretext that the security of the bank is in danger. The main reason is that there are two billboards of the bank, which are hidden by these trees. The tree houses many nests of birds. Did PMC conduct any structural audit test that states that the bank wall is in danger?” Pachpute said. Pachpute raised questions on the commissioner giving permission without verification. “Since there are many proposals, the commissioner signs them without looking at them, so such a proposal is approved. The commissioner may not know that such a proposal is wrong. Hence, I have submitted a letter stating that these trees should not be uprooted or felled,” he said. Guruswami Tumale, assistant tree authority officer, Ghole road said, “The Central Bank of India has been constantly writing to us for permission to remove the tree as it is posing a hazard and could be dangerous and fall in a letter dated April 7, 2021 and also had sent an attachment of the police FIR of theft of air conditioning unit from their premises due to the trees on June 11, 2021 and on July 8, 2021. After we sent out the advertisement for suggestions and objections notice, we followed up with a structural audit which stated that the roots around the building have penetrated inside the building, it will cause danger to the building by weakening the plinth, walls and foundations.” Ajit Gijare, structural engineer, wrote in his report that it is suggested to cut the roots of the tree outside the building, so building remains structurally stable. Tumale said, “It is a naturally grown tree and it has grown from within the sides of the wall and then into the flower bed in front of the bank, hence we will be uprooting it this week.” “As per order issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) application number 157, March 16, 2017, the tree authority has to follow due process for granting permission for any tree trimming only if the tree is dead, or diseased or wind fallen or it constitutes danger to life or property or obstructs traffic as per Section 8 of the Tree Act. Therefore, under no circumstances permission can be given by the tree authority for cutting, trimming of branches for any other reason,”an environmentalist, on condition of anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tree-authority-members-dispute-tree-felling-decision-by-pmc-101626105828348.html

Paras enjoys the support of five of the six of LJP’s Lok Sabha MPs. Both factions have claimed to be the real LJP and the Election Commission of India is yet to rule on the matter.Earlier on Monday, former minister and RJD leader Shyam Rajak also went to meet Chirag Paswan’s mother at their New Delhi residence. Asked whether Chirag is welcome in RJD, Rajak said, “All those who want to take forward the ideology of Lohia and Ambedkar are welcome, be it Chirag Paswan or anyone else.”Chirag Paswan (38) also faces the formidable challenge to retain his father’s legacy as a Dalit leader at a time when other Dalit faces in Bihar — Jitan Ram Manjhi, Meira Kumar, Shyam Rajak and others — are past their prime.“It is a golden opportunity for him. If he handles the legacy of late Ram Vilas Paswan and builds on the strength by mobilizing youths, no doubt he will become the face of the youth and Dalits. For this, he has to take himself out of the revenge politics and show statesmanship,” says D M Diwakar, former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies.“Paswan, with age on his side, can truly become a champion for the community but he has to prove his mettle. He must maintain a safe distance from RJD and JD (U),” said BJP leader Sanjay Paswan.Chirag Paswan, who embarked on a statewide tour earlier this month, visited his ancestral village Saharbani in Khagaria district and and took blessings form late Paswan’s first wife. He also paid visits to his step sisters in the state capital in an effort to win over the support of the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/chirag-dials-lalu-revives-family-links-101626105108964.html

It marks the fall of Bastille, a military fortress and prison, on July 14, 1789, when an angry mob stormed into it, signalling the beginning of the French Revolution.Here is everything you need to know about Bastille Day and why is it celebrated:1. On Wednesday (July 14, 2021), France will celebrate its national day, also known as Bastille Day. In French it is called la Fête nationale or le 14 juillet.2. The Bastille was initially built as a fortress guarding the eastern entrance of the city of Paris during the 1300s. It was later used as a French state prison and a place of detention for important persons during the 17th and the 18th centuries, the online English encyclopedia Britannica says.3. It was stormed by an angry mob of revolutionists on July 14, 1789, who then released the seven prisoners being detained at the site. It is largely considered the signal to the French Revolution.4. Last year, the celebrations were largely muted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, online news website France 24 had reported. The celebrations witnessed only half the participants than usual and the number of spectators was reduced too. The fireworks display also took place without the public.5. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished French President Emmanuel Macron last year during the occasion. “Felicitations to my dear friend @EmmanuelMacron and the friendly people of France on the occasion of Bastille Day! We are committed to further strengthening India's important strategic partnership with France, and expanding our cooperation,” Modi tweeted last year.6. In 2016, the day marked an occasion of great sorrow for the French following a truck attack in the city of Nice, in which 86 people were killed. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian man, carried out the attack, for which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility, the BBC reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-bastille-day-and-why-is-it-celebrated-all-you-need-to-know-101626198294780.html

It was formed in 1982 to frame and coordinate national policy on combating substance-use disorders, including the response to an opioid crisis.“President Biden’s nomination of Dr. Rahul Gupta to be the first physician ever to lead the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy is another historic step in the administration’s efforts to turn the tide of our nation’s addiction and overdose epidemic,” the White House said in a statement to The Washington Post, which first reported the move on Tuesday.

13-07-2021||World||Fire at Covid-19 ward in Iraq: Death toll climbs to 92, several others injured||The death toll from a fire at a hospital coronavirus ward climbed to 92 on Tuesday as anguished relatives buried their loved ones and lashed out at the government over the country's second such disaster in less than three months.Health officials said scores of others were injured in the blaze that erupted Monday at al-Hussein Teaching Hospital in Nasiriyah.The tragedy cast a spotlight on what many have decried as widespread negligence and mismanagement in Iraq's hospitals after decades of war and sanctions.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi convened an emergency meeting and ordered the suspension and arrest of the health director in Dhi Qar provice, the hospital director and the city's civil defense chief. The government also launched an investigation.The prime minister called the catastrophe “a deep wound in the consciousness of all Iraqis.”In the holy city of Najaf, the dead were laid to rest. Mourning families stood over coffins in the mosque to say one last prayer.Their tears were tinged with anger, with some saying the disaster could have been prevented. They blamed both the provincial government and the central government in Baghdad.Ahmed Resan, who witnessed the blaze, said it began with smoke. “But everyone ran away — the workers and even the police. A few minutes later there was an explosion,” he said. He said firefighters arrived an hour later.“The whole state system has collapsed, and who paid the price? The people inside here. These people have paid the price,” Haidar al-Askari seethed at the scene.Overnight, firefighters and rescuers — many holding flashlights and using blankets to extinguish small fires — searched through the ward in the darkness. As dawn broke, bodies covered with sheets could be seen laid out on the ground outside the hospital.Ali Khalid, 20, a volunteer who dashed to the scene, said he found the bodies of two young girls locked in embrace.“How terrified they must have been, they died hugging each other,” he said.Distraught relatives searched the burned-out ruins as well amid charred blankets and belongings.Officials at one point said the fire was caused by a short circuit but gave no details. Another official said the blaze erupted when an oxygen cylinder exploded. The officials were not authorized to talk to the news media and spoke on condition of anonymity.The ward, opened three months ago, contained 70 beds in three large halls. Maj. Gen. Khalid Bohan, head of Iraq’s civil defense, said the building was constructed from cheap, flammable materials.In April, at least 82 people died at Ibn al-Khateeb hospital in Baghdad when an oxygen tank exploded. Iraq’s health minister resigned over the disaster.Doctors have decried lax safety at Iraq's hospitals, especially around oxygen cylinders, and have described the institutions as ticking bombs.Iraq is in the midst of another severe Covid-19 surge. New cases per day peaked last week at 9,000. Iraq’s war-crippled health system has struggled to contain the virus. The country has recorded over 17,000 deaths and 1.4 million confirmed cases.Fear and widespread mistrust of the public health sector have kept many from seeking hospital care.Ali Abbas Salman, who rushed to evacuate his Covid-19-stricken father from after the fire broke out, swore he wouldn't take the older man back to a hospital.“He wants me to take him home.

13-07-2021||World||Facial recognition tech rolled out to fight Covid-19 in China's Ruili city||Facial recognition tech linked to personal health codes has been rolled out in a Chinese city bordering Myanmar as authorities seek to squash a coronavirus outbreak.China is one of the world's most surveilled countries, with the government rushing to install more than 200 million CCTV cameras to "cover all public spaces" in the past five years.Surveillance has been widely used to combat Covid-19 in China, which was the first country to adopt a QR code system to log test results and track contacts.But this is the first publicly reported instance of facial recognition being used to track a person's movements and health status as they enter and exit residential areas, supermarkets, transport hubs and other public places."Everyone who comes in and out needs to have their (health) code and face scanned to pass," officials in Ruili, in Yunnan province, told reporters on Saturday.Ruili discovered 155 cases over the past week in one of the worst virus flareups in recent months to hit China, according to data published Tuesday."Security tools such as facial recognition cameras, smart door locks and road barriers (run by police or community volunteers) have been put in place in key areas," local authorities said in a statement.The scanners can also check the temperatures of individuals, China National Radio reported.There are no details on how long the database will hold records or whether officials will shut down the system, which is monitored by the city's pandemic prevention taskforce, once the outbreak is contained.Privacy concernsRuili, a city of more than 210,000 people, is a major crossing point from Muse in neighbouring Myanmar, which has seen escalating unrest since a February 1 coup, raising fears that people will flood across the Chinese border to escape the violence.Nearly half of the new cases reported in the past week were Myanmar nationals, according to the Yunnan Provincial Health Commission, although it was not clear how they entered the city.China has adopted a zero-risk approach to coronavirus clusters.It has largely curbed the spread of the disease since it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, with tough border controls, mass testing, lockdowns and tie-ups with big tech for tracking.But the slew of new health monitoring apps has also raised privacy concerns.A widely used app tracking travel history and virus tests developed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba shared data with the police, according to a New York Times investigation in January.At the height of the pandemic, police in major cities wore helmets equipped with facial recognition and infrared cameras that gauged pedestrians' temperature.Rights groups have criticised China's omnipresent surveillance net, saying it is used to silence dissent and target minority ethnic groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facial-recognition-tech-rolled-out-to-fight-covid-19-in-china-s-ruili-city-101626187724353.html
13-07-2021||World||Taliban say do not want to fight inside Afghanistan's cities||The Taliban do not want to battle government forces inside Afghanistan's cities and would rather see them surrender, a senior insurgent leader said Tuesday, as the militants also warned Turkey against extending its troop presence.The hardline Islamist group has swept through much of the north as foreign troops complete their withdrawal, and the government now holds little more than a constellation of provincial capitals that must largely be resupplied by air.On Tuesday, the head of a Taliban commission that oversees government forces who surrender urged residents of Afghanistan's cities to reach out to them."Now that the fighting from mountains and deserts has reached the doors of the cities, Mujahiddin (Taliban) don't want fighting inside the city," Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a message tweeted by a Taliban spokesman."It is better... to use any possible channel to get in touch with our invitation and guidance commission," he said, adding this would "prevent their cities from getting damaged".The strategy is one well-worn by the Taliban -- particularly during their first rise to power in the 1990s -- cutting off towns and district centres and getting elders to negotiate a surrender.Hours after Muttaqi's message, a rush hour blast in the centre of the Afghan capital killed four civilians and wounded five others, police said."The explosion occurred in the centre of Kabul," police spokesman Ferdaws Faramurz told reporters, without specifying what caused it.Muttaqi's comments came as the defence ministry said Afghan forces had cleared Qala-i-Naw city after days of fighting.The Badghis province capital saw sustained street fighting last week in the first assault by the Taliban on a major urban centre since foreign troops commenced their final withdrawal in May.The call also came the same day as a video emerged that CNN said it had verified showing a group of Afghan commandos being gunned down by the Taliban in June after surrendering.Turkey warningIn a separate statement Tuesday, the Taliban said Turkey's decision to provide security to Kabul airport when US-led forces leave was "reprehensible"."We consider stay of foreign forces in our homeland by any country under whatever pretext as occupation," the group said, days after Ankara agreed with Washington to provide security for Kabul airport.As foreign forces wind up their withdrawal -- due to be completed by August 31 -- the situation on the ground is changing rapidly.The top US general in Afghanistan relinquished his command Monday at a ceremony in the capital, the latest symbolic gesture bringing America's longest war nearer to an end.The pace of the pullout -- and multiple offensives launched by the Taliban -- have raised fears that Afghanistan's security forces could be swiftly overwhelmed, particularly without vital US air support.Around 650 American service members are expected to remain in Kabul, guarding Washington's sprawling diplomatic compound.But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he had agreed with the United States on the "scope" of how to secure Kabul airport.Peace talks between the insurgents and the government supposedly taking place in Doha have largely fizzled out, and the Taliban now appear set on a complete military victory.But claims by the hardline group to control 85 percent of the country are impossible to verify independently -- and strongly disputed by the government.The insurgents have tried to capture cities in the past, but so far have failed to keep them.They briefly held the northern city of Kunduz in 2015 and 2016 but were pushed out by government forces.In 2018, insurgents seized Ghazni for a few days, torching its main bazaar and killing scores of civilians.In the latest fighting, local officials said the Taliban had captured two districts in the largely Shiite Hazara province of Bamiyan.During their repressive rule two decades ago, the insurgents drew international outrage by blowing up giant centuries-old statues of Buddha in Bamiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-do-not-want-to-fight-inside-afghanistan-s-cities-101626186955082.html
13-07-2021||World||After brief delay, Sher Bahadur Deuba takes oath as Nepal’s PM for fifth time||Nepal Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba on Tuesday took oath as prime minister for the fifth time hours after he refused swear in seeking a correction in his appointment letter that did not mention the constitutional clause under which he was appointed, multiple news agencies reportedThe scheduled ceremony was 6 pm local time (17:45 IST), but was delayed after Deuba refused to take oath as the new prime minister as he reportedly sought correction in his appointment letter that did not mention the constitutional clause under which he was appointed.Deuba was appointed by President Bidya Devi Bhandari in accordance with Article 76(5) of the Constitution, according to reports, a day after the country’s Supreme Court overturned former PM KP Sharma Oli’s May 21 decision to dissolve the House of Representatives. Oli resigned from the post of Nepal's caretaker prime minister earlier in the day. “Will abide by the Supreme Court orders,” Oli said as he sent his resignation letter.The five-member constitutional bench, led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana, said that Oli’s claim to the post of prime minister was unconstitutional.According to local media reports, Bhandari failed to disclose the article under which Deuba is being made the prime minister in the notice, issued earlier in the day.Following this, Deuba reportedly wrote to the president that he will not take the oath until the error is rectified.The swearing-in ceremony was scheduled to be held at 6 pm local time (17:45 IST).In the past, Deuba had served as the prime minister of the country four times -- June 2017–February 2018, June 2004–February 2005, July 2001–October 2002 and September 1995–March 1997.With Deuba's appointment today, he would have 30 days to seek vote of confidence and prove majority to survive as prime minister for the remaining term of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-newly-appointed-pm-sher-bahadur-deuba-refuses-to-take-oath-demands-correction-in-appointment-letter-101626185026637.html
13-07-2021||World||WTO should temporarily waive IP rights on Covid-19 vaccines: Study||A recent study published in an international journal has suggested that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) temporarily waive an agreement that protects intellectual property rights held by pharma companies producing vaccines against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. The study, published in the Journal of Media Ethics, said the move would help more firms manufacture the vaccines and help fight the pandemic that has claimed thousands of lives across the world and is continuing to wreak havoc.According to a report in Mirage News, the lead author of the study Nancy Jecker said a waiver is the best way to expedite distribution of vaccines in low- and middle-income nations where the inoculation drive has been very slow due to hoarding by richer nations. “Over 100 Nobel laureates and 75 former heads of state, as well as President Biden, have expressed support for a waiver. Opponents seem not to be defending intellectual property protections on ethical grounds but in the interest of profits,” the professor of bioethics and humanities at the University of Washington School of Medicine was quoted as saying in the report.She argued that while the IP waiver “isn’t a silver bullet,” it is one of many steps that health-minded organisations should take to protect the world from COVID-19 as well as from future pandemic that may hit the world.Meanwhile, nine Democratic US lawmakers have urged Germany to drop its "blockade" of a waiver of IP rights under global trade rules and asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to meet with them during her visit to Washington. According to a report in Reuters, the lawmakers said they were troubled that Germany was leading EU opposition to a proposed waiver being discussed at the WTO."The United States and almost every other WTO member seeks to enact a COVID emergency temporary TRIPS waiver as quickly as possible," they wrote in a letter to German Ambassador Emily Haber, adding that production of COVID-19 vaccines must be increased to save millions of lives.The German embassy had no immediate comment. The Joe Biden administration says the waiver will help boost global production of coronavirus vaccines. German officials and pharmaceutical companies have argued that the firms have invested their own funds to develop vaccines and that waiving their IP rights would undermine such work in the future.Merkel will meet with Biden at the White House on Thursday for a wide-ranging discussion that will touch on the global response to the pandemic and the proposed waiver of IP rights, a senior administration official said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-should-temporarily-waive-ip-rights-on-covid-19-vaccines-study-101626181794216.html

Referring to the natural calamity as 'nuisance floods', the study said the events would become more frequent and erratic and the US coastline will majorly face the brunt of it.Regarding the impact of the Moon on flooding on Earth, the study's lead author Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii, said that the 'wobble' in the Moon's orbit takes 18.6 years to complete. Here’s all we need to know about the Moon’s wobble:- While the ‘wobble’ has always been there, what makes it dangerous is that it will combine with the rising sea levels due to the planet's warming, said Thompson.- This cycle is expected to occur in mid-2030s, and coupled with the rising sea level, could lead to more such devastating floods.- According to the Nasa’s website, when the Moon makes its elliptical orbit, its velocity varies and alters causing our perspective of the "light side" to appear at slightly different angles. This is what it calls the Moon’s wobble or that is how it appears to our eyes.- Nasa says that while a casual glance skyward would not reveal this, when a full month of lunar views gets compressed into 12 seconds, it is impossible to miss.- During half of the Moon’s orbit of 18.6 years, the Earth's regular tides are suppressed -- high tides are lower than normal and low tides higher than normal. In the other half, the effect is reversed, which is called the tide-amplifying phase of the Moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-says-moon-s-wobble-will-cause-devastating-floods-here-s-what-it-means-101626173608614.html
13-07-2021||World||US FDA warns of rare immunological disorder from J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine||The US drug regulator has warned of an “increased risk” of an immunological disorder among those administered Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, known as Janssen, which has had an episodic roll-out in America marked by major manufacturing glitches and suspended use.Separately, top US health officials also said they would like to see more data before agreeing to Pfizer’s recent assertion that a booster dose of their vaccine might be needed. They had an hour-long meeting with the company’s experts, who cited an Israeli study in support of their recommendation. Israel began administering a booster - third dose - of the Pfizer vaccine to heart-transplant patients and those with compromised immune systems.Though experts asserted that the benefits of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine outweigh the risk of the disorder, regulators in India would take note of the US warning as the company prepares to launch its single-dose shot there after a general waiver granted by the government from bridging clinical trials.The US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) said in a warning that “reports of adverse events following use of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine under emergency-use authorisation suggest an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination”.Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system turns upon the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Its effect can range from mild and brief weakness to devastating paralysis, preventing the person from breathing without help. Most people are known to recover completely, but some may experience lasting weakness.The New York Times reported that people familiar with the FDA’s decision said although chances of developing the disorder are low, they are still three to five times higher than the average population of the United States.About 100 cases of GBS have been detected among the recipients of the J&J vaccine. Of them, 95 were serious enough to require hospitalisation, the FDA said. There was one death.While acknowledging the findings, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement, “Rare cases of the neurological disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been reported following vaccination with the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Most occurred within 42 days after vaccination. While the chance of having this occur is very low, Johnson & Johnson has updated its Covid-19 vaccine.”Bloomberg News has reported that regulators in Europe have also recommended a similar warning that AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine - which retails in India as Covidshield - could lead to an increased risk of GBS.The FDA cleared the J&J vaccine in April after a pause triggered by reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot among those administered the shot. “During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and the CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts,” the FDA had said then. “The teams at the FDA and the CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)”.In May, a plant manufacturing the J&J vaccine mixed up ingredients contaminating 15 million doses that were eventually dumped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-warns-of-rare-immunological-disorder-from-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-101626173633407.html

Deuba's appointment came a day after the country’s Supreme Court approved his claim to the premiership, replacing incumbent KP Sharma Oli.Deuba was appointed by President Bidya Devi Bhandari in accordance with Article 76(5) of the Constitution, according to the reports. The swearing-in ceremony is reportedly scheduled for 6 pm. According to the constitutional provision, Deuba, the Nepalese Congress chief, will be given 30 days to prove to his majority in the House to survive as prime minister for the remaining term of Parliament. Deuba runs short of a majority as a rival faction of CPN-UML separated itself from the alliance formed to fight against caretaker PM Oli.Meanwhile, Oli put in his papers and said his party will abide by the Supreme Court orders.This is the fifth time that the 74-year-old Deuba will be holding the post of prime minister in Nepal. He had been at the helm from June 2017–February 2018, June 2004–February 2005, July 2001–October 2002 and September 1995–March 1997.On Monday, the Supreme Court overturned Oli’s May 21 decision to dissolve theHouse of Representatives and ordered the appointment of Deuba as prime minister. The five-member Constitutional bench, led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana, said Oli’s claim to the post of prime minister was unconstitutional.In its order, the bench said President Bhandari’s decision to reject Deuba’s claim to form a new government was unconstitutional.Reinstating the House yet again (the court had restored the House earlier on February 23 after Oli dissolved it on December 20), the bench ordered for arrangements to be made to hold the House meeting by 5pm on July 18.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sher-bahadur-deuba-becomes-nepal-prime-minister-as-kp-oli-resigns-101626172285487.html
13-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada to donate 18 million surplus AZ vaccine doses to Covax||Canada has decided to provide nearly 18 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to the global distribution facility Covax. The decision is partly aimed at fulfilling the shortfall caused by the inability of Indian Covid manufacturers to meet that supply due to domestic demand during this summer’s devastating second wave of the pandemic.The Canadian decision to provide AZ vaccines to Covax has, however, been criticised in political circles at home as safety concerns have led to the jab’s use being curtailed in the country.Procured by Canada with an advance purchase agreement, 17.7 million AZ doses will be sent directly to the Covax global Covid vaccine distribution facility. Karina Gould, international development minister, and Anita Anand, public services and procurement minister, made the announcement on Monday. The vaccine doses will be “managed by the newly-funded Covax mechanism,” according to a statement issued by Global Affairs Canada.Anand said, “With nearly 55 million doses in Canada and millions more arriving weekly, we continue to ensure that the needs of Canadians for Covid-19 vaccines are met. In addition, as we are now able to donate excess vaccines, the contribution to Covax of close to 18 million doses will help to meet international needs and end this pandemic.”Gould told CBC News that shipments will start in a few weeks’ time and indicated that it was an attempt to replace the shortfall caused by Indian manufacturers being unable to meet external demand. She said, “One of the reasons Covax has been struggling is because AstraZeneca is one of the vaccines being manufactured in India and is being used widely within India right now.”The decision to donate AZ doses came in for criticism, as opposition MP Garnett Genius said the Canadian government shouldn’t be exporting vaccines that “it does not recommend for Canadians”, according to CBC News.Canadian health authorities have consistently weaned people away from the AZ vaccine and have called mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as the “preferred” shots. Health Canada, however, has continued to underscore that AZ is a safe vaccine and Gould countered criticism by pointing out that it was “still a vaccine of choice”, a “good vaccine” and “one that is in high demand around the world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-to-donate-18-million-surplus-az-vaccine-doses-to-covax-101626167153156.html

The ACP100 comes with a generation capacity of 125,000 kilowatt hours, and once completed, it can climb up to 1 billion kilowatt hours, thereby catering to more than 500,000 households in China, Global Times reported.The update on LingLong One comes as an icing atop a cake following the CNNC’s larger third-generation ‘Hualong One’ reactors that have a generation capacity of 1,170 megawatts. Notably, China is planning to rapidly roll out these reactors at home as well as abroad, Reuters reported.What sets small reactor technology apart?To start with, SMRs are cost-friendly and faster to construct as opposed to the traditional reactors. It can even be deployed at remote areas, for instance, on aircrafts and ships. Equipped with the ‘modular’ feature, as the Reuters report suggests, SMRs can easily be shipped by container from the factory and are relatively faster to be installed on any suggested spot.Furthermore, according to the Global Times report, SMRs come with the characteristics of high safety, and miniaturisation. Besides, application of SMRs can significantly cut down the consumption of fossil fuel energy in China and instead promote energy conservation and carbon emission reduction, the CNNC stated, as per the Reuters report.Small reactors have lately become a tool for China to provide urban heating in the north and also operate desalination facilities along the country’s coastal line, the Reuters report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-begins-construction-of-world-s-1st-commercial-small-modular-reactor-101626162330312.html

Later, the Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajwadi Party will join the government, news agency PTI reported, citing a party leader.Sher Bahadur Deuba was named as the Prime Minister of Nepal a day ago after the country's Supreme Court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives for the second time in five months and asked President Bidya Devi Bhandari to ensure that the NC leader is appointed as the PM within two days.Deuba will succeed KP Sharma Oli amid a political crisis that has plagued Nepal’s administrative machinery for months.The new Prime Minister of Nepal will keep his cabinet small, PTI reported, citing CPN-Maoist Centre leader Ganesh Shah. However, it is not yet certain if the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) will join the Deuba government since the Madhav Kumar Nepal faction of the party had earlier severed its ties with the opposition.Deuba is required to seek a majority vote of confidence from the Parliament within 30 days of his appointment as the prime minister of Nepal, as per the constitutional provisions, to survive in his post for the remaining term of the 275-member House.On the other hand, Nepal's incumbent prime minister KP Sharma Oli referred to the top court's move to reinstate the dissolved House of Representatives as "unconstitutional". A large number of Oli's supporters gathered at the supreme court premises on Monday evening and shouted slogans against the verdict which made Deuba the new prime minister of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sher-bahadur-deuba-nepal-s-prime-minister-elect-to-keep-cabinet-small-report-101626159298570.html

Google CEO Sundar Pichai shares tip||As data protection emerges as one of the burning issues of the digital space, so has the search for one-stop privacy solutions. Sundar Pichai, the Indian-born CEO of tech giant Google LLC, shared a few of his tips in this regard to help users arrive at their privacy needs. In an interview with the BBC on Monday, Pichai talked about his password habits, digital authentication on applications, the threat of internet-based surveillance, and more.When asked about the frequency with which he changed his passwords, Pichai said that he did not change them often. Instead, he encouraged users to adopt the "two-factor authentication" system, which is far safer and more reliable than constantly changing passwords. The multiple protection will ensure that a one-off attempt to scramble the password is not successful while hacking into the system.Google CEO Sundar Pichai was also asked about his thoughts on increased surveillance policies in countries and "different internets", which means different laws about online content and the definition of what is “offensive”."A free and open internet is a tremendous force for good and we take it for granted a bit," he said.Noting that each country is undergoing a "debate" on what constitutes free speech, Pichai added, "In some ways, I think we pull back from the bigger picture (which is that) many countries around the world are restricting the flow of information and drawing much more rigid boundaries."During the exclusive interview to the BBC at the Google headquarters at Silicon Valley in California, Sundar Pichai was also asked about his Indian roots.In response to the question, the Tamil Nadu-born CEO of both Google and its parent company Alphabet said that although he is an American citizen, India remains rooted "deeply" within him.

We receive a lot of queries from people who say they have taken one [dose] and are planning to take another one. It’s a little bit of a dangerous trend here. We are in a data-free, evidence-free zone as far as mix and match [is concerned].”Swaminathan clarified her remarks in a tweet, saying, “Individuals should not decide for themselves, public health agencies can, based on available data. Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited - immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated.”But Canada’s health officials stood by the decision to offer second doses that are different from the first. In an emailed response to queries from HT, a spokesperson for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada referred to the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation’s (NACI) June 1 on “the interchangeability of authorised Covid-19 vaccines”. “The NACI reviewed all available evidence from ongoing studies monitoring the mixing of Covid-19 vaccines. The NACI also considered the risk of Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) associated with Covid-19 viral vector vaccines, Canada’s current and projected mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) vaccine supply and principles of ethical decision-making. Updated recommendations were based on the current evidence and the NACI’s expert opinion,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson also said evidence was generated from three studies: the CoM-Cov randomised clinical trial in the UK, the CombiVacS trial in Spain, and an observational study of 326 healthcare workers. “Current evidence suggests a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by a second dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech was used in the studies) had a good safety profile,” the statement sent to HT said.“Evidence on immune responses produced from mixing Covid-19 vaccines was available from the CombiVacS trial in Spain. Current evidence suggests a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by a second dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech was used in studies) can boost the immune response at shorter (4-week) and longer (8- to 12- week) intervals,” it added.“Vaccine interchangeability is not a new concept. Similar vaccines from different manufacturers are used when vaccine supply or public health programmes change. Different vaccine products have been used to complete a vaccine series for influenza, Hepatitis A and others,” it noted.Canada is among a handful of nations where Covid-19 vaccine interchangeability is permitted. That isn’t the case in neighbouring United States.According to an analysis by the agency Canadian Press, as of July 7, at least 1.3 million Canadians opted for a second dose that was different from the first. Among those who went for it is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who received the AstraZeneca vaccine as his first jab and followed it up with a Moderna mRNA vaccine shot earlier this month.Canadian guidelines permit not just mixing and matching of the viral vector vaccines like AZ with mRNA jabs, but also between the mRNA varieties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-stands-by-decision-to-mix-and-match-covid-19-vaccines-despite-who-warning-101626152271960.html

He warned that the variant, now in over 104 countries, is expected to soon be the dominant Covid-19 strain circulating globally.Addressing a press briefing on Monday, Tedros said that last week marked the fourth consecutive week of increasing cases of Covid-19 globally, adding that with concern that after 10 weeks of declines, deaths are increasing again. “The Delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in cases and death,” Tedros said, according to news agency PTI.“Delta is now in more than 104 countries and we expect it to soon be the dominant Covid-19 strain circulating worldwide,” he said, adding that the world is watching in real-time as the Covid-19 virus continues to change and become more transmissible.“My message today is that we are experiencing a worsening public health emergency that further threatens lives, livelihoods and a sound global economic recovery. It is definitely worse in places that have very few vaccines, but the pandemic is not over anywhere,” he said. Tedros underscored that the world should battle together to put out this Covid-19 pandemic inferno everywhere.Noting that as the Delta variant spreads, the WHO chief said “We are in the midst of a growing two-track pandemic where the haves and have-nots within and between countries are increasingly divergent.”"In places with high vaccination coverage, Delta, first detected in India, is spreading quickly, especially infecting unprotected and vulnerable people and steadily putting pressure back on health systems. In countries with low vaccine coverage, the situation is particularly bad, he warned.Tedros stressed that Delta and other highly transmissible variants are driving catastrophic waves of case which are translating into high numbers of hospitalisations and death. “Even countries that successfully managed to ward off the early waves of the virus, through public health measures alone, are now in the midst of devastating outbreaks," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-expected-to-be-dominant-covid-19-strain-globally-says-who-chief-101626147042896.html
13-07-2021||World||10 dead in South Africa riots over jailing of ex-leader Jacob Zuma||Rioting triggered by the imprisonment of former South African President Jacob Zuma escalated Monday as shopping malls in Johannesburg were looted, major roads were blocked by burning tires and the police and military struggled to contain the violence.President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a somber address broadcast to the nation Monday night, vowed that the police and army would restore order, and he appealed to all South Africans to work together for peace.The unrest started last week in KwaZulu-Natal province after Zuma was imprisoned for contempt of court. What began as fairly small-scale blocking of roads in Zuma's home area intensified and spread to Gauteng, South Africa's most populous province, including Johannesburg, the country's largest city.The South African National Defence Force has been deployed to help the police.At least 10 people have been killed and more than 490 arrested “in acts of public violence rarely seen in the history of our democracy,” Ramaphosa said.Without once mentioning Zuma, Ramaphosa said that the “violence may indeed have its roots in the pronouncements and activities of individuals with a political purpose, and in expressions of frustration and anger ... However, what we are witnessing now are opportunistic acts of criminality, with groups of people instigating chaos merely as a cover for looting and theft.”He said the root cause of the rioting is South Africa's high rate of poverty and unemployment.“This moment has thrown into stark relief what we already knew: that the level of unemployment, poverty and inequality in our society is unsustainable,” Ramaphosa said. “We cannot expect a lasting and durable peace if we do not create jobs and build a more just and equitable society in which all South Africans can participate freely and equally.”He urged all South Africans to refrain from violence.“Together, we will defeat those who seek to destabilize our country," he said. “We will stand as one people, united against violence, unanimous in our commitment to peace and to the rule of law.”Earlier Monday, the looting of retail centers broke out in several of the poorer areas of Johannesburg, including Benmore, Jeppestown, Vosloorus, and Soweto, where the Jabulani and Dobsonville malls were hit.Retail stores in Alexandra, east of Johannesburg, were also affected, and journalists covering the riots for the public South African Broadcasting Corporation and news channel Newzroom Afrika were robbed of their equipment.Several malls, car dealerships and retail centers in more affluent areas of Johannesburg, including Rosebank and Kempton Park in eastern Johannesburg, closed early even though they were not directly threatened.In KwaZulu-Natal, people took appliances, including microwave ovens, television sets and clothing from stores in the Mariannhill and Umlazi areas.The violence began last week when Zuma began serving a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. He defied a court order to testify before a state-backed inquiry probing allegations of corruption during his term as president from 2009 to 2018.The Constitutional Court, the country’s highest court, began hearing Zuma's appeal on Monday.Police were investigating the deaths — four in Gauteng and two in KwaZulu-Natal, said police Col. Brenda Muridili. The police and national security forces expanded their presence in both provinces to help quell the violence, authorities said.Police have warned that anyone using social media to encourage rioting may be arrested and prosecuted.The way the political protest against Zuma's incarceration turned into wider rioting and looting highlights South Africa's widespread poverty, unemployment and economic disparity, analysts said.Many rioters were just poor, said Susan Booysen, director for research at the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection.“It is such a mixed bag because some other people are just taking advantage so they can grab things they could not have before," Booysen said.“There is poverty and inequality. We also know that some are criminals looking to benefit. Often legitimate protests are exploited for that purpose,” she said.Ralph Mathekga, a researcher at the University of the Western Cape, agreed that the political demonstration had been overtaken.“South Africa is a very complex nation, and (when) there is protest action, there is no doubt that those will be used opportunistically by criminal elements," Mathekga told the News24 website.“We have to recognize the socio-economic situation of the country. Almost the majority of the country is unemployed,” Mathekga said. "Protest action in South Africa, without some form of criminality, is very rare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-dead-in-south-africa-riots-over-jailing-of-ex-leader-jacob-zuma-101626139482785.html
13-07-2021||World||Sher Bahadur Deuba to take oath as new Nepal PM today||Nepal Supreme Court on Monday reinstated the dissolved lower house of Parliament and issued a mandamus ordering the appointment of Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba as Prime Minister within two days.Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is set to succeed KP Sharma Oli as Prime Minister of Nepal on Tuesday.Deuba will take oath as second Premier of the Himalayan Nation after the apex Court reinstated the dissolved lower house and issued a mandamus naming the opposition leader as the successor."Tomorrow (July 13), as per the verdict of the Supreme Court honorable Sher Bahadur Deuba will form a new cabinet for which we would start consultations and discussions. This would be alliance government and we will be holding a discussion about further ways to make it more effective and working addressing concerns of the public that would cover the issues about Covid-19 management, vaccines, corruptions and others," Baburam Bhattarai, former Prime Minister and one of the leaders of opposition alliance told reporters on Monday evening.A meeting was held in the capital this afternoon, senior leaders of NC, CPN (Maoist Center), UpendraYadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), and Madhav Nepal-led faction of the UML.The meeting focused on discussing their future course of action including the formation of a new cabinet. As per leaders, further discussion about division of ministerial portfolios would be decided through a meeting to be held on Tuesday morning.Although the apex court's order has paved the way for Deuba to become a new prime minister, for now, Deuba will have to secure majority votes in the parliament to survive as prime minister for the remaining term of parliament.Deuba runs short of a majority as a rival faction of CPN-UML backs offAfter months of intraparty rift, the rival faction of ruling CPN-UML under the leadership of Madhav Kumar Nepal has separated itself out from the alliance formed to fight against caretaker PM Oli.The two factions in the UML (one led by Oli and other by Nepal) on Sunday evening have reached a 10-point agreement to bury their hatchet. After Monday's verdict, Nepal faction has announced to unify with the party ending earlier formed alliance."This alliance reached to this point, it has completed one phase; now a totally new sphere has formed in front of us. In the present scenario we cannot stay on this alliance for any longer, our presence and support for this alliance would not remain the same. Question over role of CPN-UML in national politics of Nepal still prevails, so at first we will unify the party and then the role about our party in upcoming days would be decided through the meetings of concerned committees of party which also would determine whether to support new government or not," Raghuji Panta, leader representing the rival faction of CPN-UML which had signed for Deuba in court documents told reporters after today's meetingWith the break off of the rival faction of CPN-UML, the largest seat holder in parliament, the fate of the vote of confidence for to-be-appointed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba remains uncertain. Deuba will have to secure the vote of confidence in parliament within a month after his appointment as the new prime minister.A total of 146 members of the House of Representatives (HoR) reached out to Supreme Court with a writ petition to demand the restoration of house and appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba, as next Prime Minister on May 24.The petitions at that time included a total of 61 members of the House of Representatives from the Nepali Congress, 49 from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), 23 from the Madhav Nepal faction of CPN-UML, 12 from UpendraYadav-BaburamBhattarai of JanataSamajbadi Party and one from Rashtriya Janamorcha Nepal.While claiming the Prime Ministership back in May, Deuba had presented signatures of 149 lawmakers to prove that he commanded majority to lead a new government. Now Deuba falls short of 23 votes which he earlier use to have from Madhav Nepal led faction of CPN-UML.Court has also overturned provision of "whip" imposed on parliamentariansThe Apex Court which on Monday reinstated the May dissolved House of Representatives also has removed the provision of "whip" (directive issued from a political party to ensure attendance and voting in debates) on parliamentarians."The provisions of Article 76 (5) of the constitution which has been misused by President and Prime Minister regarding the formation of the new government has ended with this verdict. A clear interpretation over issue has been given which now states that the formation of a government under Article 76 (5) is always dependent on members of the House of Representatives. At the time of voting over motion of confidence, the parliamentarians now would not be abided by the 'whip' meaning they can decide over the candidate on their own when it comes to choosing a Prime Minister when Article 76 (5) is activated," Om Prakash Aryal, one of the advocate who took part in the discussions held in court told ANI.Nepal President Bidhya Devi Bhandari had refused to allow Deuba to form a new government as per Article 76 (5) and dissolution of the House.With Oli failing to secure vote of confidence on May 10, Bhandari on May 13 had appointed Oli prime ministerunder Article 76 (3) of the constitution as the leader of the party with the highest number of members in the House.A week after his appointment, Oli on May 20 in a sudden move recommended that the President invoke Article 76 (5) to choose a new prime minister. It's the President who initiates Article 76 (5) when a prime minister appointed under Article 76 (3) fails the trust vote. Oli, however, neither sought the trust vote nor resigned, thereby creating a situation in which a prime minister was asking the President to appoint a prime minister.Oli supporters to continue protest against verdictSoon after the verdict of Supreme Court to reinstate the lower house, overturning decision of President Bidhya Devi Bhandari to dissolve the parliament in recommendation of KP Sharma Oli protests has erupted in Nepali capital against it.Apex Court not only has reinstated the house but also passed a mandamus in the name of the Office of President to appoint Deuba as new prime minister of the country by Tuesday. Separately, the supreme judicial body also has ordered summon for fresh session of House of Representatives at 5 PM on July 18.Dissatisfied with the court's mandamus, protesting leaders have termed it as an attempt by the judicial body to exercise more power."Supreme Court is now trying to exercise rights of executive, legislature, that of President, constitutional bodies," Mahesh Basnet, Senior Leader of Youth Association Nepal, student wing of CPN-UML claimed while addressing a protest march.The apex court had on February 23 reinstated dissolved parliament on December 20, 2020. President Bidhya Devi Bhandari on May 22 this year again had dissolved the parliament on recommendation of the cabinet.Following the dissolution, more than two dozen writ petitions were filed seeking the restoration of the House and issuing an order that Deuba be appointed as the new Prime Minister.Though Monday's verdict has paved way for Deuba to become the next Prime Minister, failure to garner a vote of confidence would further plunge the Himalayan Nation into a political crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sher-bahadur-deuba-to-take-oath-as-new-nepal-pm-today-101626138483317.html
13-07-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for health care workers, say France, Greece||French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday ordered all French health care workers to get virus vaccine shots by Sept. 15 and urged all of his compatriots to get vaccinated as soon as possible, to fight resurgent infections that are threatening the country’s economic recovery.In a televised address, Macron also mandated special Covid-19 passes for anyone who wants to go to a restaurant, shopping mall or hospital or get on a train or plane. To get a pass, people must have proof they’re fully vaccinated, or recently recovered from the virus, or have taken a fresh negative virus test.The delta variant is driving France’s virus infections back up again, just as the country kicked off summer vacation season after a long-awaited reopening. Some 40% of France’s population is fully inoculated.“Get vaccinated!" was the president's overall message. He even tweeted a GIF of himself repeating the phrase.“The country is facing a strong resumption of the epidemic touching all our territory,” Macron said, speaking against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Warning of a new wave of potential hospitalizations in August, he said, “The equation is simple. The more we vaccinate, the less space we leave this virus to circulate.”But he stopped short of any new lockdown measures, saying “We have to learn to live with the virus.”Macron said the government would declare a medical state of emergency again starting Tuesday, which allows authorities more freedom to impose virus restrictions.Most European governments have shied away from mandating vaccinations. But after tens of thousands of people with the virus died in French nursing home s, Macron said vaccination is essential for all workers in health care facilities or nursing homes, and all workers or volunteers who care for the elderly or ailing at home. Those who don’t get vaccinated by Sept. 15 will face potential sanctions or fines, he said.Greece announced Monday that health care workers will be suspended if they refuse to get vaccinated. Italy made the coronavirus vaccination obligatory for health care workers and pharmacists, and those who opt out risk suspension from their jobs or a salary cut.In Denmark, restaurants and public events require a digital pass showing you’ve been fully vaccinated or have a recent negative test. Some German states require the same for restaurants, though suggestions of making vaccines obligatory have prompted widespread unease.In France, vaccines are widely available for anyone 12 and over. But interest has ebbed in recent weeks because of vaccine hesitancy, a sense that the virus is no longer a threat, and because some people put off their shots until after their summer vacation. Demand started rising again over the weekend as people braced for Macron’s announcements.Macron also declared Monday that France will start charging money for some virus tests, which up to now have all been free for anyone on French territory.Meanwhile, French restaurants and bars are thriving again, the Tour de France cycling race is drawing tightly packed crowds across the country, and Hollywood stars are posing arm-in-arm and mask-free on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. Cheek kisses are making a comeback.After staying shuttered for nine months since the pandemic began, Paris restaurant owners expressed worry about the challenges of enforcing the new requirements.“Our job used to be to make sure that our guests had a great time while they were with us. Now, we spend our time reprimanding them. We weren’t trained for this,” said the manager of the Parisian restaurant Bancs Public, Louis le Mahieu. He said he would observe any new health rules, but warned the new measures would likely incur new costs and lower returns.For Gauthier Max, whose bar Mama Kin was slapped with a nine-day closure for violating Covid-19 measures, restaurants and bars are no longer places of leisure but have become spaces of constraints and restrictions.“We’ve effectively become policemen,” he told The Associated Press.France’s virus infections started rising again two weeks ago. The number of people in French hospitals and intensive care units has been declining for weeks, but doctors predict it too will rise when the increase in delta variant infections hits vulnerable populations, as it has in Britain and Spain.Meanwhile, Macron also met with car industry figures Monday as he tried to combine his virus warnings with a message of hope for one of the world’s biggest economies. New infections are threatening France’s all-important tourism industry and Macron’s ambitious economic recovery plan — just nine months before the next presidential election in which he is expected to run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccination-mandatory-for-health-care-workers-say-france-greece-101626136493690.html
13-07-2021||World||Nasa study predicts record flooding in 2030s due to Moon's 'wobble'||Climate change has caused sudden weather changes on Earth, which has led to flood in many countries, especially the United State. But now, a new study has linked extreme weather events with Earth's neighbour, the moon.The study has been conducted by American space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), which says that a 'wobble' in Moon's orbit combined with rising sea levels due to climate change will lead to devastating floods on Earth.The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change on June 21.Called 'nuisance floods', these currently occur in coastal areas when the tide reaches about 2 feet above the daily average high tide. These events are much more problematic for businesses because they inundate the streets and homes, affecting everyday life.These nuisance floods will become more frequent and irregular by mid-2030s, according to Nasa study. A majority of US coastline will see three to four times increase in high tides for at least a decade, according to the study.It has also warned that these floods won't be spread out evenly through the year, and expected to cluster together over the span of just a few months.“Low-lying areas near sea level are increasingly at risk and suffering due to the increased flooding, and it will only get worse,” said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. “The combination of the Moon’s gravitational pull, rising sea levels, and climate change will continue to exacerbate coastal flooding on our coastlines and across the world."Explaining the impact of the Moon on the flooding on Earth, the study's lead author Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii, said that the wobble in the Moon's orbit takes 18.6 years to complete. While the wobble has always been there, what makes it dangerous is that it will combine with the rising sea levels due to the planet's warming, said Thompson.In half of these 18.6 years, the Earth's regular tides are suppressed: high tides are lower than normal and low tides higher than normal. In the other half, the effect is reversed, which is called the tide-amplifying phase of the Moon. The next time this cycle is expected in 2030s, which will severely affect the normal life, especially in coastal areas, according to Thompson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-study-predicts-record-flooding-in-2030s-due-to-moon-s-wobble-101626134826127.html

So it’s a big part of who I am,” Pichai, 49, said, when asked about his roots.“I view it [artificial intelligence] as the most profound technology that humanity will ever develop and work on. You know, if you think about fire or electricity or the internet, it's like that. But I think even more profound," said Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet.When asked about whether the Chinese model of the internet based on surveillance is in the ascendant, Pichai said the free and open internet "is being attacked". While he didn't refer to China directly, he said: "None of our major products and services are available in China."On the controversial issue of tax, he said: “We are one of the world’s largest taxpayers, if you look at on an average over the last decade, we have paid over 20 per cent in taxes.“We do pay the majority of our share of taxes in the US, where we originate and where our products are developed. I think there are good conversations and we support the global OECD conversations figuring out what is the right way to allocate taxes, this is beyond a single company to solve,” he said.He was also asked about his own personal tech habits and encouraged everyone to adopt “two-factor authentication” when it comes to passwords to ensure multiple protections and admitted he is constantly changing his phone to test out new technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-is-deeply-within-me-a-big-part-of-who-i-am-says-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-101626134473544.html

Those immediately eligible for a third shot include people who have had heart, lung and kidney transplants as well as some cancer patients.China’s two major Covid-19 vaccine makers have signed agreements to provide up to 550 million doses to Covax, a UN-backed distribution plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-focus-on-covid-jabs-for-all-first-boosters-later-101626128316363.html
13-07-2021||World||At least 44 killed, 67 injured in coronavirus hospital fire in Iraq||At least 44 people were killed and over 67 injured in a fire likely caused by an oxygen tank explosion at a coronavirus hospital in Iraq's southern city of Nassiriya, health officials and police said on Monday.As rescuers combed the smoke-charred building in search of more bodies, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi held urgent meetings with senior ministers and ordered the suspension and arrest of health and civil defense managers in Nassiriya, his office said in a statement.The manager of the hospital was also suspended and ordered to be arrested, the statement added.Already decimated by war and sanctions, Iraq's healthcare system has struggled to cope with the coronavirus crisis, which has killed 17,592 people and infected more than 1.4 million."Health crews carried charred bodies out of the burning hospital while many patients were coughing from the rising smoke," a Reuters reporter at the site of the fire said.Health officials at Nassiriya said search operations at the al-Hussain coronavirus hospital were continuing after the fire was brought under control, but thick smoke was making it difficult to enter some of the burnt wards."Raging fires have trapped many patients inside the coronavirus ward and rescue teams are struggling to reach them," a health worker told Reuters before entering the burning building.Initial police reports suggested that an oxygen tank explosion inside the hospital's COVID-19 wards was the likely cause of the fire, a policeman at the scene of the fire said."I heard a big explosion inside the coronavirus wards and then fire had erupted very quickly," said Ali Muhsin, a hospital guard who was helping carrying wounded patients away from fires.In April, a fire caused by an oxygen tank explosion at a COVID-19 hospital in Baghdad killed at least 82 people and injured 110 others.Health sources said earlier the death toll from Monday's fire could rise as many patients were still missing. Two health workers were among the dead, they said.Angry relatives gathered in front of the hospital and clashed with police, setting fire to two police vehicles, a Reuters witness said.Weary of political violence, Iraqis also suffer frequent accidents due to under-investment, corruption and wrecked infrastructure. During the coronavirus crisis, hospitals have struggled with an influx of patients and short supplies."Corrupt officials must be held accountable for the fire and killing innocent patients. Where is my father's body," said one young man as he searched among charred bodies wrapped in blankets in the hospital's yard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-killed-five-injured-in-coronavirus-hospital-fire-in-iraq-101626122749837.html
13-07-2021||World||US officials flag "small" reaction risk with J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine||Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine may pose a “small possible risk” of a rare but potentially dangerous neurological reaction, U.S. health officials said Monday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement it has received reports of 100 people who got the shot developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune system disorder that can cause muscle weakness and occasionally paralysis.That number represents a tiny fraction of the nearly 13 million Americans who have received the one-dose vaccine. Most cases of the side effect were reported in men — many 50 years old and up — and usually about two weeks after vaccination.The CDC said it would ask its panel of outside vaccine experts to review the issue at an upcoming meeting. J&J didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The government said the vaccines most used in the U.S., made by Pfizer and Moderna, show no risk of the disorder after more than 320 million doses have been administered.Guillain-Barre syndrome occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks some of its nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis that typically is temporary. An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome each year, according to the CDC.Vaccines historically provide broad protection with little risk but come with occasional side effects just like other drugs and medical therapies. The three Covid-19 vaccines used in the U.S. were each tested in tens of thousands of people, but even such huge studies can’t rule out extremely rare side effects.The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration have been monitoring side effect reports submitted by physicians, drugmakers and patients to a federal vaccine safety database.Guillain-Barre can be triggered by a number of infections, including flu, cytomegalovirus and Zika virus. But there have been rare cases in which people develop the disorder days or weeks after receiving certain vaccines.J&J’s vaccine was highly anticipated because of its one-and-done formulation and easy-to-ship refrigeration. But early on, it was linked to another rare risk, of blood clots, and the company hasn’t been able to produce as much as expected because of problems at a Baltimore factory that helps make the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-flag-small-reaction-risk-with-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-101626117813717.html

But she tweeted later, “I didn’t think I would be spending two and half hours in the police station on my final day in Cannes, but here we are.”Cannes has become a hunting ground for burglars with a member of the infamous Pink Panthers gang suspected of taking gems worth $122mn from Carlton hotel in 2013.The same year, a $1.89mn Chopard necklace was stolen at the film festival. Embarrassed police were found wanting again in 2015 when a few days before the festival began, $20.73mn worth of jewellery was taken from the Cartier shop on the Croisette.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/old-script-at-cannes-actor-s-hotel-room-broken-into-jewellery-stolen-101626116876366.html
13-07-2021||India||Arvind Kejriwal meets MGP’s Dhavalikar brothers, sparks AAP’s Goa alliance buzz||PANAJI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) chief Sudin Dhavalikar at a city hotel on Tuesday, sparking buzz that the two parties could deliberate on a possible alliance or an arrangement ahead of the state elections in early 2022.Kejriwal, who is staying at a hotel in the Dona Paula locality of the capital city, spent most of the day holding a series of meetings with the local party leaders. In between, he also met the Dhavalikar brothers, Ramkrishna “Sudin” Dhavalikar and his younger brother Pandurang “Deepak” Dhavalikar, who play the lead role in the MGP.Kejriwal last year announced his party’s decision to contest assembly elections in states such as Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Gujarat. There has been no word from Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) if it will join hands with local parties in Goa. Kejriwal didn’t speak with the media on Tuesday but will address a Press conference on Wednesday.AAP state convener Rahul Mhambre only referred to the internal meetings. “There were a series of meetings lined up with the local leadership of the AAP including one-on-one meetings,” he told HT.Sudin Dhavalikar insisted his meeting with Kejriwal was just a courtesy call. “There is nothing on that as yet. This was just a courtesy visit,” Sudin Dhavalikar said to repeated questions about speculation around his meeting with Kejriwal.“There is nothing about an alliance. We discussed the good work he has done and the good work I have done with regard to water supply in Goa,” Sudin said.“For a long time we had not met each other... now for two months because of corona we had not met. He had even come to Goa once (recently) but we couldn’t meet. I was supposed to go to Delhi but I didn’t get the time,”Sudin Dhavalikar’s MGP was once a powerful regional party that ruled Goa for the first three decades after its liberation in 1961, giving Goa its first chief minister Bhausaheb Bandodkar. The MGP, which had a dedicated support base among the state’s politically powerful Bahujan Samaj, however, has lost much of its sheen. The party has managed to become a part of every government in Goa between 1999 and 2019 when Sudin Dhavalikar was left stranded.The MGP’s three MLAs played a key role in helping the BJP capture power in Goa despite winning only 13 seats in the 40-member house. Pramod Sawant, who took charge of the state after Manohar Parrikar’s death, inducted Sudin Dhavalikar as deputy chief minister on 17 March 2019 but stripped him of his portfolios within a week. Dhavalikar’s two MLAs also defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Sawant. The MGP, which had three MLAs, was left with just one, Sudin Dhavalikar.Earlier this month, Dhavalikar indicated that the MGP was not keen on aligning with either the BJP or Congress, saying that the party was not interested in aligning with national parties ahead of the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-meets-mgp-s-dhavalikar-brothers-sparks-aap-s-goa-alliance-buzz-101626199137454.html

Submit Covid negative reports every week: Goa to school teachers||PANAJI: The Goa education department has asked all teaching and non-teaching staff to get vaccinated “without any further delay”, cautioning that teachers who do not get vaccinated will have to submit a negative Covid test report every week.In a circular issued by the state education department, director of education DR Bhagat said those teachers who either cannot get vaccinated nor can get themselves tested every week will need to produce a doctor’s certificate explaining the medical reasons why they should be exempted from being able to produce either report.“In the interest of the health of the students, all the teaching and non-teaching staff of the schools should get vaccinated urgently without any further delay. The staff who do not get vaccinated for any reason, must submit [an] RT-PCR report possibly weekly to attend their duties in the school,” Bhagat said in a circular issued on Tuesday. “The teaching and non teaching staff members must also ensure that their family members are also vaccinated without any further delay as a precaution to prevent any transmission through them,” he added.As in other parts of the country, schools in Goa have remained closed for students since March last year when the central government opted for a national lockdown and have not reopened since then.

13-07-2021||India||Indian, Afghan foreign ministers discuss developments in Afghanistan||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Afghan counterpart Haneef Atmar on Tuesday discussed the latest developments in Afghanistan, cooperation in the fight against terrorism and establishing peace and stability in the region.Jaishankar and Atmar met in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on the margins of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). They will also participate in a meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan on Wednesday.The meeting provided an opportunity for the two sides to compare notes on developments in Afghanistan, especially the security situation, amid the rapid drawdown of US and foreign forces and the Taliban’s violent campaign to capture territory, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.After his meeting with Atmar, Jaishankar tweeted: “Began my Dushanbe visit by meeting with Afghan FM @MHaneefAtmar. Appreciate his update on recent developments. Looking forward to the meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan tomorrow.”The Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement that Atmar and Jaishankar discussed the political and security situation, the peace process, and “India’s cooperation with Afghanistan in various fields, including the joint fight against terrorism and the establishment of lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan and the region”.Atmar referred to the escalation of Taliban attacks on civilians and Afghan forces in “collusion with foreign fighters and regional and international terrorist networks”, and said that “overcoming this common threat was of vital importance to regional security”.He underscored India’s constructive role in strengthening regional consensus on the Afghan peace process and preserving the achievements of the past two decades.Jaishankar expressed concern at the escalation of violence and stressed the need to end the bloodshed in Afghanistan, the statement said. He assured Atmar of India’s continued cooperation in “strengthening regional and global consensus to achieve a political settlement in Afghanistan”.In a separate meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Atmar described the “presence of foreign fighters and regional and international terrorist networks alongside the Taliban” as a major threat to the region. Atmar emphasised the need for “practical cooperation between regional countries, particularly Pakistan, in closing shelters and ceasing funding sources of the Taliban, and encouraging the group to resume meaningful talks and find a political solution”.The Taliban have stepped up attacks on rural areas of numerous provinces, especially in northern Afghanistan, and taken control of key border crossings and regions bordering Iran, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. The violence has coincided with the US saying it has completed 90% of the withdrawal of its troops and that the process will be completed by August 31.While India is a member of the SCO, Afghanistan has observer status with the grouping. Jaishankar is expected to hold more meetings with counterparts from SCO member states, including Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. This will be the first in-person meeting between the two ministers since they held talks on the margins of another SCO meeting in Moscow in September last year.India has repeatedly expressed concern at the spike in violence across Afghanistan and called for a comprehensive ceasefire while efforts continue to find a political settlement. Jaishankar has also asserted the need for having a legitimate government in Kabul amid fears that the Taliban will try to capture power by force.New Delhi pulled out all its diplomats, staffers and security personnel from its consulate in Kandahar over the weekend after fierce clashes erupted between the Taliban and security forces in and around the southern Afghan city.In a separate development, an 11-member team of Afghan politicians is expected to travel to Qatar by the end of this week for talks with the Taliban, Tolo News channel reported.Abdullah Abdullah, the chief Afghan peace negotiator, former president Hamid Karzai, former vice president Yunus Qanooni, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and Fatima Gailani will be part of the team. It is not clear who would represent the Taliban in the talks in Doha.Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, and Karzai said on Tuesday they expected important steps in the peace process within the next few days.The US special envoy for reconciliation in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, is also visiting the region and has met negotiators in Doha this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-afghan-foreign-ministers-discuss-developments-in-afghanistan-101626190434552.html
13-07-2021||India||MHA asks CBI to investigate death of 2 Nagaland residents in Gurugram||NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the mysterious deaths of two Nagaland residents, Rosy Sangma and Samuel Sangma, in Gurugram last month, a statement by the ministry said on Tuesday.Rosy Sangma died at a private hospital in Gurugram on June 24 after a medical condition. “On the next day, June 25 the Delhi Police (which has a special police unit for the north-east region) received information regarding the death of Shri Samuel Sangma in New Delhi,” the statement said. Rosy Sangma “The family of the deceased has alleged that Ms. Rosy Sangma had died due to negligence on part of the hospital. They also attributed some alleged foul play in the death of Shri Samuel Sangma by the hospital personnel,” the home ministry statement said.Before his death, Samuel made videos in the hospital accusing the doctors of feeding her ice-cream while she was in the intensive care unit, and insisted that their negligence led to her aunt’s death.The local police, however, treated his death as a suicide. But his family alleged that Samuel’s body had marks on his body, possibly due to assault.His family also stressed that he had no reason to give up his life and it was only on his insistence that his aunt - he referred to her as elder sister in the video clips - was taken to hospital on June 22 on account of severe pains.Officials cited above said a formal notification for a CBI probe will be issued in a few days.Several prominent leaders from the north-east including Lok Sabha member Agatha Sangma, former Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma and Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik have written to Union home minister Amit Shah to seek a thorough probe into their deaths over the last few days. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma too has expressed concern over their deaths and assured the family that the mystery behind their deaths will be unraveled. Meghalaya-based body – Achik Holistic Awakening Movement (AHAM) also appealed to Union minister Kiren Rijiju for a fresh autopsy on the body of Samuel Sangma.The North East Students’ Organisation (NESO), an umbrella body of several student unions of the region, has expressed deep anguish over the incident. It has demanded a thorough investigation on both the deaths.AHAM described Samuel Sangma’s death as “highly suspicious in nature”.“One does not need to be a medical doctor or forensic expert and just one glance into the victim’s body speaks volumes. There were injury marks all over the body, with broken teeth and swollen lips,” AHAM said, echoing concerns that the police hadn’t done a “genuine investigation” into his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-cbi-to-probe-deaths-of-2-nagaland-residents-in-gurugram-101626190194434.html
13-07-2021||India||Implement micro-containment zones to control Covid, PM tells northeast CMs||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said some districts of northeast were showing high test positivity rate and asked the states to rigorously implement micro-containment zone policy to ensure that Covid does not spread.“We have to be more alert and urge the public as well to do the same. In order to control the spread of the infection, we have to take steps at the micro level to contain the pandemic,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Here are the details of his interaction with the chief ministers of different northeastern states.ASSAM: Assam chief minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma highlighted the efforts taken to vaccinate the tea garden population at the earliest, noting the importance of containing the pandemic there. The chief minister also informed about the status of medical oxygen production, ICU beds, oxygen beds, isolation wards etc as part of the Covid-19 treatment infrastructure in the state. He requested the Prime Minister to increase the allotment of vaccines to Assam enabling coverage of the entire population at the earliest. Sarma said Assam had followed the ‘Testing-Tracking-Treatment’ strategy to contain the pandemic by declaring more than 6,000 micro-containment zones without going for total lockdown. Both the economy and the fight against Covid were sustained simultaneously, he said. The CM expressed confidence that Assam’s positivity rate will come down below 1% at the earliest. Assam has been recording around 2,500 new cases and around 25-30 deaths daily for more than two weeks now. The positivity rate has been hovering between 1.5% and 2% and the state has over 19,000 active cases. Though the state announced a campaign to vaccinate 300,000 persons daily from June 21 and complete 9 million doses in a month, it hasn’t been successful due to shortage of doses. Till Tuesday, the state has been able to administer at least one vaccine dose to 8.33 million of the state’s 23.1 million eligible persons above 18 years. At 19% vaccination, Assam has the lowest figure among all NE states. MEGHALAYA: Chief minister Conrad K Sangma said Meghalaya felt the delay in the onset of the 2nd wave compared to the rest of the country was a blessing in disguise. “We got to prepare the required infrastructure, augment oxygen generation capacity and others in advance,” the CM said, adding, “Though the graph is plateauing down, it’s not at the rate we anticipated because of the scattered population. In the dense areas cases go up but also come down fast, but in rural areas, the cases increase slowly and come down slowly, so it is a matter of concern.” On the vaccination front, while admitting that it was below the national average in Meghalaya, the CM optimistically said, “We are on the job to improve this and if we can achieve a target of 20 to 25 thousand doses per day, we should be able to complete the vaccination process by end of December or even early October.”Sangma also revealed that it had received 14 oxygen plants, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and other equipment from the Central government apart from free vaccines. 918 lives have been lost in Meghalaya due to Covid-19 and the number of active cases stands at 3,964. It recorded 365 new positive cases on Tuesday and five deaths. The State with an estimated population of around 3.2 million has administered 823,404 doses including 722,976 1st doses and 100,428 2nd doses. MANIPUR: Chief minister N Biren Singh presented the overall preparedness and preventive steps to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and others for support and cooperation at this crucial juncture. Manipur has been recording around 800 new cases daily and 10-15 deaths. The state has currently around 7,500 active cases. On the vaccination front, over 876,000 doses have been administered across the state till Monday. TRIPURA: Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb assured that the state will do the necessary to bring the positivity rate under 5% and reduce the number of cases. The state recorded a total 70,749 Covid-19 positive cases including 714 deaths, as per state health department. A senior health official said that the state registered 400 positive cases and two deaths on an average in the past week with a 5.5% positivity rate. On the vaccination front, the state has administered 2.733 million doses of vaccines including 2.074 million first doses and 659,043 second doses. Currently, the state has a total 190,190 doses in stock. However, the state is expected to receive 22,000 Covaxin and 50,000 Covishield doses in July. ARUNACHAL PRADESH: Chief minister Pema Khandu said that during the past week the state recorded a case fatality ratio of 0.57%, which was the lowest among all northeastern states. He added that despite the challenging topography including vastness, and remoteness, the state was able to vaccinate around 15,000 persons daily. During the past week, the state recorded negative vaccine wastage by administering 1,700 extra doses, by saving from each vial of vaccine supplied by the Centre. MIZORAM: Mizoram has been recording around 500 new cases daily, very high for the small state with around 1.2 million population. The state has around 4,700 active cases at present. Till Tuesday afternoon, Mizoram had administered over 695,000 doses—nearly 592,000 first doses and over 100,000 second doses.NAGALAND: Chief minister Neiphiu Rio told the Prime Minister how the state started its first phase of unlocking from July 11 following the lockdown in May. According to the state health and family welfare department, the weekly sample positivity rate in the state has gone down to 6% in the past week. However, health officials have expressed concern that the positivity rate in capital Kohima, Mokokchung and Wokha districts were still above 10%.The state on Tuesday reported 88 new cases, taking the state’s caseload to 26,140 including 962 active cases. Three Covid deaths on Tuesday have also sent the total number of fatalities past the 500-mark. As of July 12, the state has administered a total of 617,690 vaccination doses, with 97,752 persons having received both doses and 519,938 receiving the first dose of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/implement-micro-containment-zones-to-control-covid-pm-tells-northeast-cms-101626187794360.html

Meanwhile the Uttarakhand Police, which is also investigating the alleged scam, said it was about to make its first arrest in the case in the next couple of days.The probe committee led by chief development officer (CDO) of Haridwar, Saurabh Gaharwar, said another 35,000 phone numbers remained to be verified and the process was likely to take 10 more days to complete. However, he refused to reveal any detail from the investigations conducted so far.Gaharwar led committee earlier questioned the representatives of the agency named Max Corporate Services which had subcontracted testing to two laboratories-- Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lal Chandani Laboratories. They labs claimed to have conducted about 1.50 lakh tests but have been marred by allegations that they had made up the figures by including fake and fudged data such as contact numbers and Aadhaar card numbers.The Gaharwar committee is examining the phone numbers in its investigation to find out the number of actual fake tests conducted. “We had to verify about one lakh phone numbers mentioned in the tests. Of that, we have completed verifying 60,000 phone numbers while about 35,000 are still left,” said CDO Gaharwar. He added that the verification would take at least 10 days to complete.Meanwhile, the special investigation team (SIT) of the Haridwar district police, which is also probing the case, said it was likely to make the first arrest in the next few days. “The SIT has gathered many details after questioning the accused involved and examining the documents. With to the findings so far, it is somewhat sure that a scam had happened in the Covid-19 tests to siphon off money from the administration by the testing laboratories in a fraudulent manner,” said one of the officers in the SIT, who was privy to the probe details but didn’t wish to be quoted. “The SIT would soon make its first arrest in the next few days with the accused from one of the testing laboratories,” said the official. Haridwar’s senior superintendent of police Senthil Avoodai K Raj refused to confirm anything, but said, “The SIT is probing all the angles of the alleged scam by questioning different people. It will soon be completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-covid-testing-scam-60-000-numbers-verified-sit-close-to-1st-arrest-101626185034191.html
13-07-2021||India||Uttarakhand govt cancels Kanwar yatra over coronavirus fears||The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday decided to cancel the annual Kanwar Yatra scheduled this year in view of the raging the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and a possible third wave of the pandemic. This is second time in a row that the pilgrimage was cancelled. Earlier, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had said the Kanwar Yatra is not a one-state affair and his government will take the decision after holding talks with other states, including Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.While speaking about the cultural significance of the yatra, the newly appointed chief minister said his government's priority remains saving lives amid the coronavirus pandemic."Kanwar is part of the Sanatan culture but saving lives is paramount. Government's focus is to ensure that COVID does not spread," Dhami said.Hours ago, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) wrote to Dhami urging him to disallow the Kanwar Yatra this year in light of the pandemic. In the letter, IMA Uttarakhand State Secretary Dr Ajay Khanna expressed concerns about the crowds that may gather for the annual pilgrimage and urged Dhami not to allow devotees from outside to enter the state for the Yatra.Every year, during the Hindu calendar month of 'Saavan' (July and August), thousands of 'Kanwariyas' (devotees of Lord Shiva) from northern states travel on foot or by other means to collect water from River Ganga at Haridwar to offer at Shiva temples in their areas as part of the yatra.Dhami had earlier said the yatra is a matter of shraddha (reverence) and aastha (faith), and God would not like anyone to die.Earlier in March, another religious pilgrimage, the Kumbh Mela, was curtailed in light of rising COVID-19 cases and deaths.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has urged that only a minimum number of people should participate in the annual yatra this year and directed officials to ensure strict implementation of the COVID-19 protocol, an official spokesman said here on Tuesday.The UP government, which has allowed the yatra from July 25 despite concerns raised in various quarters over the risk posed by such events, said a negative RT-PCR test report can be made compulsory for pilgrims, if required.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-cancels-kanwar-yatra-over-coronavirus-fears-101626184746553.html

13-07-2021||India||2 more confirmed Zika virus cases in Kerala take total to 21||Two more persons tested positive for vector-borne Zika virus in Kerala on Tuesday, taking the total number of infected to 21, said the state health ministry. Both cases were reported from Thiruvananthapuram. State health minister Veena George has asked people to be vigilant and take part in the ongoing vector-control measures.“We have already started a campaign to clean water-logging [prone] areas and all will have to chip in to contain it. We will do everything possible to check its spread,” the minister said, adding testing of samples of suspected Zika virus had begun in three medical college hospitals in the state and a special Zika ward had been set up in Thiruvananthapuram medical college. Earlier the state was sending samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing. A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Parassala in Thiruvananthapuram district was the first case of Zika virus reported this year. Later, she gave birth and both mother and infant were stable now. In one week, Zika cases went up to 21. Later, the Union health ministry rushed a team of experts. Grappling with the high caseload of Covid-19, the latest Zika outbreak has overstretched the health machinery. Medical experts said unlike Covid-19, Zika was not a major threat and it could be controlled with effective vector control programmes. The virus spreads mostly through mosquitoes but can also be transmitted through casual sex, however, the fatality rate was very low and only one in five develops symptoms, they said. The main symptoms of the disease, first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and among humans in Nigeria in 1954, include joint pain, fever and headache. In May 2015, it was reported in Brazil, where it spread rapidly. The virus can cause a shrunken brain in children and a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome, experts said. They add that it was first reported in the country in Gujarat in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-confirmed-zika-virus-cases-in-kerala-take-total-to-21-101626182394193.html

Data from the ministry showed that the positivity rate remained above 10 per cent in 55 districts spread across 13 states and Union territories in the country. The health ministry also highlighted that some states in the northeastern region are reporting a surge in the number of new Covid-19 infections.#IndiaFightsCorona:📍Spread of infection concentrated in limited geography.- JS, @MoHFW_INDIA #Unite2FightCorona #StaySafeStayHealthy pic.twitter.com/x0KtTMfAA3In a regular press briefing, joint secretary of the ministry Lav Agarwal said that the number of districts with more than 10 per cent positivity rate has come down in the country. Data shared during the briefing showed that nine such districts are in Rajasthan, the highest in a single state. It was closely followed by eight districts each in Kerala and Manipur and Meghalaya with seven such districts.Also read | Don't take Covid third wave predictions as 'weather update', says govtMeanwhile, Maharashtra, Odisha and Puducherry contributed one district each to the list. Nagaland has five districts where the positivity remained above 10 per cent while Mizoram has four districts. Among other northeastern states, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura contributed three districts each to the list and Assam added two.However, the ministry also noted that there were 531 districts reporting over 100 daily new Cvodi-19 cases as of the week ending on May 4, 2021, and this number has gradually reduced. While it came down to 262 districts as of the week ending June 2, 2021, it is now at 73 districts as of the week ending on July 13, 2021. The joint secretary also said that the active caseload has been declining steadily and the daily new recoveries have been increasing.The ministry also warned about the surging number of infections in Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh. The warning came following the meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the chief ministers of these states earlier in the day to review the Covid-19 situation. The ministry also said that central teams have been deputed to these states along with Chattisgarh, Kerala and Odisha for helping in handling the coronavirus pandemic.Warning people that the pandemic is far from over, the ministry pointed to data from other countries globally and said that the infections are surging in countries like the United Kingdom, Russia, Bangladesh and Indonesia. It further insisted on the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially wearing a facemask, in controlling the transmission of the disease. It also warned of the impending dangers of the third wave of Covid-19 as more crowds gather at tourist destinations in the country.On the vaccination front, Agarwal said that more than 381 million doses of the vaccine have been administered to beneficiaries in the country. This includes over 306 million first doses and close to 75 million second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-positivity-over-10-in-55-districts-cases-surging-in-major-ne-states-govt-101626180902826.html
13-07-2021||India||All you need to know about Kanwar Yatra||The Uttarakhand government is yet to decide whether to allow Kanwar Yatra this year even as experts have warned that allowing it could spark a possible third wave of Covid months after the Mahakumbh seeded clusters of infections during the second wave. Here is all you need to know about the yatra that in 2019 attracted over 36 million pilgrims:What is Kanwar YatraIt is an annual pilgrimage of Shiva devotees, known as Kanwariyas, to Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri in Uttarakhand to fetch Ganga water. They take the water back to their native places for Shiv Lingams in temples. Amid fears of the third wave and delta plus variant of the virus, the state government last week decided not to allow the yatra. But two days later, after Uttar Pradesh allowed the yatra, Uttarakhand decided to review its decision by holding talks with other states. The government does not seem to be willing to annoy traders and religious leaders months before the polling in the state.Almost impossible to check Covid violationsThe Mahakumbh experience made it clear that it is difficult to ensure people follow social distancing and wear masks during religious congregations. At least 9.1 million pilgrims visited Haridwar for the Mahakumbh this year amid violations of Covid-19 protocols and massive overcrowding. The gatherings coincided with a surge in cases that inundated hospitals and sparked critical shortages of medical supplies. At least six million people congregated for the mega fair in April amid the worst surge in the second wave of the pandemic.Also Read | DMs to be responsible if Covid situation worsens: Uttarakhand issues fresh SOPRoughly 100,000 of the rapid antigen tests conducted at the Kumbh were also found fake, raising doubts about the efficacy of testing during the event.Officials in many states such as Madhya Pradesh found local cases that were traced to Kumbh returnees. Between April 1 and April 30, active cases in Uttarakhand registered a spike of 2,392%. The Uttarakhand high court rapped the government and said holding the Kumbh was a mistake.Haridwar, Dehradun and US Nagar reported 855 or nearly 70% of 1,210 backlog deaths reported in the state, mostly after Mahakumbh, in May and June.Kanwar Yatra is expected to attract three to four times more devotees than Mahakumbh. Around 30 to 40 million pilgrims are likely to visit Uttarakhand over 15 days compared to over 9 million pilgrims at Mahakumb. Sanjay Shah, vice president of the Association of Physicians of India, Uttarakhand chapter, said with newer variants of Covid being reported across the country, governments have to be extra cautious. “So, it is very dangerous to allow pilgrimage of this magnitude at this crucial juncture between slowing down of the second wave and the country being on the brink of the third wave. When millions of pilgrims will come, the medical infrastructure in Haridwar will hardly make any difference.”Challenge of managing huge numbersThe Kanwar Yatra was cancelled because of Covid-19 spread in the country last year. A majority of Kanwariyas in 2019 arrived from Haryana (31 %) and Uttar Pradesh (27 %). Kanwariyas arrive in Uttarakhand via Haridwar district, the gateway to the Garhwal division. Nearly 10 million Kanwariyas arrive on foot to fetch sacred Ganga waters. The remaining Kanwariyas arrive on two-wheelers, four-wheelers, trucks, trolleys and on public buses and trains. Prior to 2019, the yatra was not funded by the state government and was managed on the district levels. Since then, the state government has been allocating ₹1 crore for the annual fortnightly pilgrimage.Also Read | 8,000 tourists on their way to Mussoorie and Nainital sent backIn 2019, nearly 7,000 security personnel were deployed for Kanwar Yatra. A nodal Kanwar Mela Force officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police is also appointed for it.The Kanwar Mela zone is bifurcated into super zones, zones and sectors. As many as 50 odd sector magistrates are appointed to administer the yatra.Ananya Bhatnagar, a social activist, said the yatra should not be allowed this year. “With such a huge number of pilgrims expected to arrive, the state government should endanger the lives of millions of people.”Diversion of resources and manpower for the mega eventExperts say when the state is preparing for the third wave, directing huge resources and manpower for the yatra is not a good idea. The same resources and manpower could help the state in improving its readiness for the third wave.“Uttarakhand is not at all ready and does not have the wherewithal to handle the widely anticipated third wave post the Kanwar Yatra. If the state government relents in the face of pressure from larger states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the yatra could trigger the third wave not only for Uttarakhand but for the entire nation,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Foundation, which has been analysing the Covid data in the state.Nautiyal said while taking a decision on the yatra, the government needs to bear in mind that Standard Operating Procedures are impossible to implement on the ground as was seen during MahakumbhWhat the government is sayingSubodh Uniyal, cabinet minister and a government spokesperson, said that the state government is yet to take a final decision on whether to allow the Kanwar Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-kanwar-yatra-101626181313953.html
13-07-2021||India||Tamil Nadu’s power consumption dips after spells of rainfall||The power consumption of Tamil Nadu witnessed a significant drop after heavy rainfall lashed most parts of southern and western Tamil Nadu last week.During the summer months, the daily consumption peaks to an average of 36 crore units. The power consumption that peaked to 37.27 crores units on April 9 turned out to be a record high. The lockdown announced in Tamil Nadu on May 10 significantly brought down the industrial power consumption as the commercial establishments, including big malls, remained shut.The domestic power consumption at houses went down to 25 crore units during the first phase of the lockdown. As the lockdown restrictions were eased in a phased manner, the power consumption started to increase gradually once the shops and industrial establishments resumed operations. The consumption touched the mark of 33 crore units in the beginning of July.But the torrential rainfall in the southern and western districts of Tamil Nadu last week caused the drop in power consumption. State capital Chennai witnessed sporadic rainfall, too. During this time the consumption recorded a declining trend with 32 crore units on July 8, then 31 crore units on July 9, 28.91 crore units on July 10, 26.33 crore units on July 11, respectively. The rainfall brought down the need for air-conditioning and irrigating the agricultural lands.Meanwhile, the regional meteorological centre in Chennai made a forecast that three districts of Tamil Nadu will receive rainfall as the southwest monsoon turned intense. The weather bulletin stated that Theni, Dindigul and Tenkasi districts along the Western Ghats will receive rainfall on Monday and Tuesday. Sporadic rainfall is likely in Krishnagiri, Ranipet, Tirupathur, Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu districts these days.Chennai is likely to get mild showers on Tuesday, the bulletin stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-s-power-consumption-dips-after-spells-of-rainfall-101626178993081.html
13-07-2021||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: SC admits NIA appeal, bail to 12 accused stays||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to set aside the bail granted to 12 accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case but agreed to examine whether smuggling of gold amounts to a terrorist act under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967.The Union of India represented through the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had challenged a February 18, 2021 order of the Kerala High Court which released the 12 accused on bail while holding that “gold smuggling with a mere illegal profit motive” could not fall within the definition of a terrorist act as defined under Section 15(1)(a)(iiia) of the UA(P) Act .The above section of the 1967 act defines smuggling of high-quality counterfeit Indian paper currency, coin or of any other material with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the economic security of the country as a “terrorist act”, which is not bailable.The Kerala high court held that the expression “any other material” will not include gold. At the same time, the high court allowed NIA to seek cancellation of bail if it succeeds in digging out material to show complicity of the accused in a terrorist act.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana issued notice on Centre’s appeal stating that the only question to be considered is the question of law arising out of the HC order. The bench was not inclined to interfere with the bail granted to the 12 accused.Additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj appearing for NIA submitted that the Kerala HC’s conclusion that smuggling of gold does not amount to terrorist act will seriously impact pending cases probed by NIA and other central agencies.He pointed out a judgment given on February 1 this year by the Rajasthan high court which upheld charges under UA(P) Act against a man caught for smuggling more than 18 kilograms of gold. This order was later challenged by the accused before the Supreme Court and is still pending consideration.The bench directed the present appeal of NIA to be listed along with the pending appeal against the Rajasthan HC order.The NIA began its probe into the Kerala gold smuggling case after the Customs Department seized 30 kilograms of 24 carat gold from Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5, 2020, concealed within a diplomatic baggage sent from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Further probe led to arrest of the then principal secretary to Kerala chief minister among others. The 12 accused granted bail by the high court had allegedly arranged funds for smuggling gold through diplomatic channels or conspired together for arranging the same.The NIA had booked the accused under the UA(P) Act claiming the initial inquiry had revealed that the proceeds of the smuggled gold could have been used for financing terrorist activities in India.The Special NIA court granted bail to the accused on October 15 last year. This order came to be upheld by the Kerala high court. The accused had questioned the power of NIA to investigate the case relating to smuggling which is punishable under Section 135 of the Customs Act of 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-sc-admits-nia-appeal-bail-to-12-accused-stays-101626181014065.html

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the order while hearing a plea of pensioners M Kesavan Nair and EG Rajan which questioned the deduction of a portion of their pension towards the CM’s relief fund under the ‘vaccine challenge’ without their consent or knowledge. The petitioners said they wanted the court to set aside the decision of the KSEB and reimburse amount deducted from their pensions. Also Read | No action for not complying with IT rules: Kerala high courtThe KSEB argued that it was not a forcible deduction and a decision was arrived at after consulting with the association of pensioners. “The KSEB or the state had no case that employees, serving or retired, were under any legally sanctioned obligation to suffer any remittance under the vaccine challenge. The deduction without consent or volition is not allowed,” the court ruled. The government had started a ‘vaccine challenge’ three months ago after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the state will have to foot the vaccine bill of 18-45 age group people and Kerala was the first state to oppose it. Later, the government started accepting contributions from the public under the ‘vaccine challenge’. The PM later tweaked the policy and the Centre decided to procure vaccines for this age group as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-deduct-from-relief-fund-without-pensioners-consent-kerala-hc-101626180593836.html

"Our opposition AAP has always recognised my vision and work for Punjab. Be it Before 2017- Beadbi, Drugs, Farmers Issues, Corruption and Power Crisis faced by People of Punjab raised by me or today as I present “Punjab Model” It is clear they know - who is really fighting for Punjab," he wrote on Twitter.Our opposition AAP has always recognised my vision & work for Punjab.

This means they have resigned to their fate !!" the cricketer-turned-politician also said in the following tweet.The tweets were in response to a video clip that showed AAP's Sanjay Singh appreciating Sidhu about how he and his wife have raised a voice against various issues including corruption and drug abuse. They also come a day after AAP's Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann took a dig at Sidhu and asked him to tweet about the "funds" allegedly accepted by the ruling Congress from private power companies in the state.Mann had alleged that the Punjab government was not scrapping the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the former SAD-BJP government as the ruling Congress had accepted "funds" from the three private companies that have set up thermal plants in the state.The remarks have revived the speculation that the senior Congress leader who resigned from the Singh cabinet in 2017, might be looking for options out of the party. In April, Sidhu denied that he has any plans to leave the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-always-recognised-my-work-vision-for-punjab-navjot-singh-sidhu-101626179605270.html
13-07-2021||India||New IT rules to safeguard digital space, says Centre||The Centre on Tuesday debunked the claims that the new IT Act only pertains to intermediaries and does not include digital news publishers are untrue.The Act identifies the originator of an electronic message as one being different from an intermediary. While intermediaries only deal with third party content, originators directly control the content which is being published, the Centre said. "In this regard, while the Act provides safe harbour for the content being published by an intermediary, originators are not entitled to any safe harbour provisions and take full responsibility for the content hosted and/or published by them. Publishers of news and current affairs content are originators, and therefore, well within the scope of the Act," it said in a statement.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Codes) Rules, 2021, formulated under the Information Technology Act, 2000, were notified by the Centre on February 25.It also refuted assertions that the rules are not necessary since there is the Press Council Act, 1978, the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, and News Broadcasters Standards Authority. It said while the Press Council Act covers newspapers (including replica e-versions of a newspaper), the news portals/websites are not covered under it. "Similarly, digital news portals/websites of traditional TV organisations are not covered under Cable Television Networks Regulation Act. NBSA is a non-statutory body whose role as a self-regulator has already been questioned by various High Courts, including the Bombay High Court in Nilesh Navalakha vs. Union of India," the Centre said.Since the digital medium is format agnostic, there exists a difference in the content published and broadcast by traditional media entities on newspaper and television and the content published by their digital media arms."Digital platforms of many newspapers conduct panel discussions in the audio-visual format. These are not published in the newspaper, but are made available on digital media in the form of videos or podcasts on the websites and social media handles of the newspaper entities. Similarly, digital media platforms of many television news channels publish textual reports and editorial/opinion articles, which cannot be broadcast on television," it further said.Before the notification of the Rules, digital news media was largely unregulated. In respect of print media, the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 provides for registration of publications, including newspapers. The Press Council of India, under the Press Council Act, 1978, has the powers to conduct enquiries on the basis of complaints and take suitable action including warning, admonition, censor, etc. The Council has prepared the Norms for Journalistic Conduct for this purpose. Similarly, television news channels are required to follow the Programme and Advertising Codes laid down under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. No such mechanism was in operation with regard to news on digital media.The Centre further said that it is wrong to say the Code of Ethics contains vague and subjective notions like ‘half-truths’, ‘good taste’ and ‘decency’. The Code of Ethics for publishers of news and current affairs content requires adherence to the Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India under the Press Council Act, 1978; and Programme Code under section 5 of the Cable Television Networks Regulation) Act, 1995. These are identically the same norms which are presently applicable to traditional print and television news media under the statutes.The Centre also debunked the notion that the new IT rules seem like an attempt to intimidate the news media into self-censorship, apart from vesting the government with overreaching powers over news content.Calling the apprehensions totally misplaced, the Centre said that the rules neither contain any provision related to censorship of news, nor that related to monitoring of content by the government or any other body. "Therefore, any question of censorship or surveillance of news media does not arise," it says.The concept of Inter-Departmental Committee under the Rules is similar to that of the time-tested Inter-Ministerial Committee which looks at certain grievances relating to the violation of the programme code by TV channels."Over the last 15 years, the IMC has given recommendations by way of Advisories, Warnings, etc in many cases and in almost every such case, the TV channels have accepted the recommendations of the Committee," the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-it-rules-to-safeguard-digital-space-says-centre-101626179039300.html
13-07-2021||India||Goa assembly session: Congress to move resolution against defection||Leader of Opposition in the Goa assembly, Digambar Kamat, will move a private members resolution seeking significant changes to the anti-defection law in its present form. The Congress leader said “there needs to be accountability and responsibility of every elected representative towards the people”. The party has suffered huge losses because of defection. Right after the 2017 assembly elections, when the Congress won a decent 17 out of the 40 seats, one party MLA resigned, and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Down to 16, the Congress then saw two more MLAs move to the BJP the next year. It managed to win Manohar Parrikar’s Panaji seat, bringing its numbers to 15. Of these 15, 10 MLAs defected to BJP in 2019, reducing the party to just 5 MLAs in the assembly.Also Read | Arvind Kejriwal in Goa today with eye on next year’s assembly polls“Today, in spite of the mandate given by the people, the elected representatives violate that mandate. We elect a representative for five years. Our mandate given to the people by our elected representatives is very clear. In spite of that, elected representatives start defecting,” said Kamat.“One option is that such matters be referred directly to the high court or the Supreme Court for an express judgment -- should be given within a period of 60 days. Second, if someone has a difference of opinion with his party leadership, he has an option to resign and seek a fresh mandate from the people. But under no circumstances are people who have been elected for five years should defect,” said Kamat, who himself left the BJP for the Congress in 2005 after resigning as an MLA and contesting again.“I will move a private members resolution in the legislative assembly suggesting that the House should resolve to recommend to the Centre to make necessary changes in the anti-defection law which will stop all such defection and I appeal to all my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution,” he said.A three-day session of the assembly has been planned from July 28-30. The Congress wasn’t the only party to lose legislators to the BJP. Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party lost two of its three legislators to the BJP which managed to win only 13 seats in the 40 member House but formed the government with the help of regional parties such as the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. Congress state unit chief Girish Chodankar said this time, not a single MLA would defect. “We have changed our selection process. We will field 75-80% young faces in the coming election,” Chodankar said.

This will make the entire 137 km long Baramulla- Banihal section connecting north and south Kashmir operational.“The existing train services running between Budgam in central Kashmir to Banihal in south and back are being extended for full run up to Baramulla in north Kashmir and vice versa,” the railways said in a statement.The Kashmir stretch of the railways is yet to be connected to the rest of the country. The standalone section from Banihal, considered the gateway to Kashmir in the south, to Baramulla in north Kashmir is 137 km long and is very popular among the locals. The train services were suspended from May 10 owing to Covid-19 and were partially resumed from July 01. The full resumption in rail service comes when the valley is mostly registering under 150 daily Covid cases, a big improvement from a high of 3,500 cases daily, registered in May when the second wave had peaked. Two trains currently starting from Banihal and terminating at Budgam will be extended to Baramulla from Wednesday whereas another train will start from Baramulla for Banihal at 8 am.The railway communiqué also said that one extra train service will start at 3:10 pm from the north and will pick up the route of ex-Budgam at 4:15.Train services in the valley were also suspended for 11 months from March 19, 2020 owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic outbreak.In Kashmir, railways used to run with high occupancy. In summers 35,000 to 40,000 commuters used train services daily while it came down to 25,000 in winters.The train service in the valley has often been marred by political developments. In August 2019, the service was suspended for 100 days following the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. During the 2010 agitation, the services came to a halt after the coaches were damaged. In 2016, after the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, the services remained suspended for over six months. It also remained shut for over two months during 2014 floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-train-service-to-resume-fully-as-covid-cases-plunge-101626178915710.html

13-07-2021||India||NHRC files final report on Bengal post-poll violence at Calcutta high court||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday afternoon submitted its final report on post-poll violence in West Bengal during hearing of the case by a five-judge bench of Calcutta high court headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal. The voluminous report and its annexures were submitted in sealed envelopes. The NHRC filed an interim report on July 2. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, who are representing the state government, said copies of the interim and final reports should be given to the state government so that it may prepare its reply. The court asked the NHRC to give copies to the state and all the petitioners, said advocate Priyanka Tibrewal, who is representing many victims of the alleged violence. Tibrewal filed a supplementary affidavit seeking DNA test to identify the body of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporter Abhijit Sarkar who was allegedly strangled to death by a mob in the Narkeldanga area of Kolkata on May 2, the day the assembly poll results were declared. The court ordered a DNA test by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory and asked for the report to be submitted within a week. The bench had earlier ordered a fresh autopsy of the body at the army’s Command Hospital in Kolkata. The victim’s brother, Biswajit Sarkar, is among the petitioners who moved the Supreme Court in May seeking formation of a special investigation team for probing alleged violence by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers. Tibrewal told the court on Tuesday that members of Sarkar’s family could not identify the body. The court said that DNA samples from the corpse should be matched with the DNA of Biswajit Sarkar. Representing the state, advocate general Kishor Dutta accused Sarkar’s family of not cooperating with the police. He said several attempts were made to record their statements. The five-judge bench of acting chief justice Bindal and justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar on July 2 directed the police to record the statements of all the victims of violence, based on the recommendations of the NHRC and asked the state government to provide medical treatment and ration to the affected families. On Tuesday, Tibrewal alleged before the court that while recording the statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the government was collecting ₹600 from each person for videography. The court wanted to know who is collecting this money and whether receipts are being given. The case will be heard again on July 22. On June 21, the bench dismissed a petition seeking recall of its June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during the alleged violence. Dismissing the state’s plea for recall, justice Bindal remarked that there are allegations that police are not taking action while more complaints are being filed. He observed that the conduct of the state does not inspire confidence of the court. The TMC government suffered a setback on July 2 when the court took cognisance of the NHRC’s preliminary report which mentioned allegations of murder, rape and arson. The court gave more time to the seven-member panel of the NHRC and asked it to visit the districts, meet more complainants and file the final report on July 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-files-final-report-on-bengal-post-poll-violence-at-calcutta-high-court-101626175073573.html
13-07-2021||India||Sputnik V developer partners with SII for 300mn jabs a year||The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine and Serum Institute of India (SII) announced a partnership agreement on Tuesday to manufacture more than 300 million doses in India, with production set to start in September.Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), told a virtual news briefing that the developers of Sputnik V are looking at using the vaccine along with the AstraZeneca dose (marketed as Covishield in India) in a “mix and match” format. Results of the first trials using a mix of the two vaccines in Azerbaijan are set to be released in the next two weeks.September will be a “key month” for scaling up the production of Sputnik V in India as SII and several other companies are expected to launch production by then, and RDIF is in talks with the Indian government to allow the export of “some portion” of the vaccines after the immediate needs of the Indian population are met, he said.Though the RDIF-SII partnership agreement was announced on Tuesday, Dmitriev said the two firms had been working jointly for the past three months. As part of the technology transfer process, SII has received cell and vector samples from Russia’s Gamaleya Center.“We have all the ingredients approved by the Drugs Controller General of India and we have started the cultivation process,” he said.“We are quite advanced in the technology transfer process with Serum Institute,” he said, adding the work done over the past few months will facilitate the ramping up of production in the country.On July 4, the drugs controller general of India (DCGI) granted a test license to SII for manufacturing small batches meant for examination, test, and analysis at SII’s licensed Hadapsar facility in Pune.SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said: “We hope to make millions of doses in the coming months with trial batches starting in the month of September. With high efficacy and a good safety profile, it is critical that the Sputnik vaccine is accessible in full measure for people across India and the world.”SII is the world’s largest company in terms of Covid-19 vaccines production. In addition to developing its own vaccine, it currently manufactures Covishield and Covovax (developed by Novavax) and is conducting trials of Codagenix in the UK.Talking about the “mix and match” approach of vaccines – which is now being considered by a growing number of countries due to shortage of doses – Dmitriev said Sputnik V was a “leader in this field” and was the first to start trials along with AstraZeneca vaccines in Azerbaijan and some other countries.“We expect to release the results of the trials in the next two weeks. We are open to the mix and match approach with Covishield vaccine in India. We believe that it can produce a great result,” he said.“We believe the trials in Azerbaijan will show the high efficacy of this approach and Serum Institute of India will be able to produce Sputnik V for a mix and match and booster approaches,” he added.Dmitriev said RDIF perceives India as a major production hub for Sputnik V as agreements were earlier reached with pharmaceutical companies such as Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma, Virchow Biotech and Morepen.Sputnik V has so far been registered in 67 countries with a total population of more than 3.5 billion. Data obtained by regulators of several countries during vaccination, including Argentina, Bahrain, Mexico and the UAE, has demonstrated Sputnik V is safe and effective, Dmitriev said.Sputnik V has an efficacy of 97.6% based on the analysis of data on Coronavirus infection rate among people in Russia vaccinated with both components of the vaccine from December 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021.Dr Reddy’s laboratories has a partnership with RDIF to market the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V in India and it announced on Tuesday that commercial launch will begin in the coming week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-developers-unveil-partnership-with-sii-to-make-300mn-doses-a-year-101626173393358.html

13-07-2021||India||Govt’s wrong policies, inept economic management led to inflation: Congress||The Congress on Tuesday accused the Narendra Modi government of wrong polices and inept economic management that resulted in soaring inflation amid the pandemic. The party demanded that the GST rates on certain items be slashed and pre-emptive measures be put in place to cushion people from any possible economic woes related to the Covid-19 pandemic’s third wave. Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, former finance minister P Chidambaram said, “This inflation has not been caused by a spurt in demand. On the contrary, private consumer demand is low. This inflation has not been caused by excess liquidity or too much money in the hands of the people. This inflation has been caused by the wrong policies of the government and its inept management of the economy.” He said consumer price inflation has breached the upper limit of 6% while core inflation has moved up in a month from 5.5% to 5.8%. Reading out the inflation rates on pulses (10.01%), fruits (11.82%), oil and fats (34.78%), Chidambaram said, “Will the government please tell the people what they should eat, how they should light their homes and how they should go to work?” Also Read | PM Modi to review Covid situation in N-E states todayThe former minister and the Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala both hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said the government’s pre-emptive action for the pandemic’s third wave should not just include ramping up oxygen supply or the number of Covid beds. “If the third wave comes, the economic situation will be worse. Jobs have been cut and income is reduced. In the third wave, further income cut, job losses will take place. The government must act to cushion people from the economic impact,” said Chidambaram. The party also wants GST rates to be slashed but slammed the government and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for their scant regard for the GST council. “The government continues with multiple rates of GST as well as high rates of 12% or 18% on an array of items, including toothpaste, toiletries, processed food, other food items, home appliances, etc. GST is an indirect tax and by definition it is a regressive tax,” read the statement from Chidambaram. “The Congress party demands that the Central government should immediately reduce, substantially, the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG. We demand that import duties be reviewed and re-set so that prices of essential imported goods are cheaper. We also demand that GST rates be reduced on an array of goods that are mass-consumed by the people. We are convinced that these steps alone will bring relief to the people from the crushing burden of high inflation,” the former minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govts-wrong-policies-inept-economic-management-led-to-inflation-congress-101626168172885.html

Here are the likely contenders||Amid speculation about the change in Congress’s leadership in Lok Sabha, several names are being seen as a possible replacement for Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, a five-term Member of Parliament. Here are some of the names:Manish Tewari: A former Union minister, who represents Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib, Tewari is seen as a strong contender. He is deep-rooted within the party, having risen through the ranks after heading the Congress’s students and youth wings. Two Congress leaders said Tewari’s name was proposed as head of the party in Lok Sabha in 2019 but the leadership opted for seniority as criteria for the role. Tewari’s elevation will be significant as elections are due in Punjab next year.Also Read | Monsoon session of Parliament from July 19-August 13, says LS Speaker Om BirlaGaurav Gogoi: The son of late three-time former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi is the party’s deputy leader in Lok Sabha. He is seen to be close to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and known for his oratory skills. But the Congress’s failure in winning the Assam election this year may work against his elevation.Shashi Tharoor: A former Union minister, Tharoor is the other big contender as a lawmaker from Kerala, where the Congress in 2019 swept the Lok Sabha polls even as it lost the second national election in a row. But the case related to his wife’s death may go against his elevation.Ravneet Singh Bittu: The Member of Parliament from Punjab’s Ludhiana was given charge of the party in Lok Sabha when Chowdhury was busy campaigning for the March-April West Bengal polls. Many saw this as a possible sign of him eventually replacing Chowdhury. Bittu too is seen to be close to the Gandhi family. If Tewari gets the charge of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, Bittu can emerge as a serious contender from the state for the party’s leadership in Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adhir-may-be-replaced-as-cong-leader-in-ls-here-are-the-likely-contenders-101626164512868.html

Both the cases are from Thiruvananthapuram suburbs, state health minister Veena George said."Two more people in the state have been diagnosed with the Zika virus. A 35-year-old resident of Poonthura and a 41-year-old resident of Sasthamangalam. With this, 21 Zika virus cases are confirmed in the state," said George.The first case surfaced on Wednesday last week when a 24-year-old pregnant woman from Parasala in Thiruvananthapuram district tested positive for Zika virus. Two days later, 14 more people were added to the list.On July 12 (Monday), a 73-year-old woman tested positive for Zika virus. On Sunday, three people, including a toddler, had contracted the virus.The Kerala government launched a state-wide vector-borne disease control programme after the cases of Zika virus started surfacing. It also arranged testing facilities at Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Kozhikode Medical colleges and at National Institute of Virology (NIV), Alappuzha.The health minister said on Sunday that hospitals have been instructed to test patients, especially pregnant women, with fever, rashes and body pain.According to experts, Zika is not a major malady and can be controlled with effective vector-borne disease control programmes. The virus is spread mostly through mosquitoes but it can also be transmitted through casual sex and fatality rate among patients is very low and only one in five develops symptoms, they added.Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which share their borders with Kerala, have increased surveillance in border districts. Travellers arriving from Kerala through various modes of transport are being checked at the point of entry such as bus terminus and railway stations.Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that also transmit dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-cases-of-zika-virus-confirmed-in-kerala-infection-tally-reaches-21-101626163498094.html

The police have also set up border checkposts to regulate the flow of people visiting the popular tourist destinations."After videos went viral of huge crowds bathing in Kempty falls, the Uttarakhand government has taken steps to control the number of tourists. People have been given notices to carry negative RT-PCR reports and register on the online portal," said Uttarakhand Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Nilesh Anand Bharane.He further appealed to people to consider other places like Bhimtal, Ranikhet and Landsdowne and not gather at one or two places.This comes amid concerns of Covid protocol violations at hill stations as state governments gradually lift lockdown restrictions.The Uttarakhand government has instructed district magistrates to control the weekend crowd in all tourists places. The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were issued by chief secretary Sukhbir Singh Sandhu on Monday."If the situation worsens in the tourist places of Uttarakhand now, then the District Magistrate will be responsible. They have been authorized to take the decisions regarding the crowds on weekends," the guidelines released by the state government said.The DMs has been empowered to decide the percentage of tourists at a place based on its geographical conditions and the administration's capacity for crowd control.The district magistrates will also ensure strict action against those who violate the rules, the Uttarakhand government said in its order.As per the SOPs, all persons coming from outside the state will be allowed entry only with a negative report of RT-PCR, True Net, CBNET, or Rapid Antigen Test of a maximum period of 72 hours.The Uttarakhand government has extended the Covid curfew in the state till July 20.

Justice Chandrachud was speaking at Indo-US Joint Summer Conference on Indo-US legal ties on Monday evening when he underscored that no law can be employed to harass citizens and take away their freedom. “Criminal law, including anti-terror legislation, should not be misused for quelling dissent or harassment to citizens. As I noted in my judgement in Arnab Goswami Vs the State, our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of liberty of citizens,” said the judge. Justice Chandrachud added that depravation of liberty for even a single day is “one too many” and that judges must always be mindful of the deeper systemic issues of their decisions. “Today, the world’s oldest and largest democracy represent these ideals of a multicultural, pluralist society where their constitutions are focused on a deep commitment and respect for human rights,” said the judge. Justice Chandrachud’s remarks have come amid outrage over the death of 84-year-old activist Stan Swamy, who arrested under the anti-terror law in the Elgar Parishad case last year. He died last week in Mumbai while his bail plea on health grounds remained pending before the high court there. Also Read | UAPA’s inherently flawed architecture and the role of courtsSeveral other cases where the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UPA) has been invoked have also courted controversies recently. Only a few days ago, Assam leader Akhil Gogoi walked out of jail after spending 17 months behind bars in connection to a case under UAPA against him over violent protests against the contentious citizenship law. Last month, while granting bail to student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha, the Delhi high court made some sharp observations on the indiscriminate invocation of UAPA by the government and police. It said that foisting extremely grave and serious penal provisions engrafted in UAPA frivolously upon people would undermine the intent and purpose of the Parliament in enacting a law that is meant to address threats to the very existence of our nation. Sharing his views at the online conference hosted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and Society of Indian Law Firms (SILF), justice Chandrachud also highlighted that the Supreme Court of India, which is the last court of appeal in the country, has a wide reach over its population, executive and lower courts. The Supreme Court of India, he said, provides greater access to individuals by exercising not just its appellate jurisdiction but also its rich jurisdiction by protecting its fundamental rights enshrined in its constitution. About the role of the Supreme Court in ensuring jails are decongested, justice Chandrachud pointed out that during the first wave of the pandemic in March 2020, the top court ordered all states to set up high-level committees to consider releasing convicts on bail or parole, who had been jailed for up to seven years. “When the first wave subsided, those released were re-imprisoned. In view of the second wave in May 2021, the Supreme Court on May 7, ordered that those who were released in the first wave of the pandemic were eligible for immediate release and passed orders regarding improvement in prison sanitary conditions and regular Covid testing of inmates and prison staff,” said the judge, adding it is important that prisons are decongested because they are highly susceptible to becoming Covid hotspots. Justice Chandrachud also said that the Supreme Court of India has often relied on comparative jurisprudence emanating from the US, indulging often in a transnational judicial dialogue. “For instance in my judgement in Navtej Johar Vs Union of India, where the Indian Supreme Court decriminalised same-sex relations between adults, I relied on comparative law developments from the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights and the celebrated decision in Lawrence Vs Texas of the US Supreme Court to hold that there was the growing liberal consensus towards the equal treatment of LGBTQ rights and that India could not be left behind in this transformational revision,” noted the judge in his address. Dr Lalit Bhasin, president, SILF and Joseph L Raia, chair, ABA International, thanked justice Chandrachud for addressing the conference as its chief guest. In his November 2020 judgment granting bail to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and two others in a 2018 abetment to suicide case, justice Chandrachud had said: “It is the duty of courts across the spectrum — the district judiciary, the high courts and the Supreme Court — to ensure that the criminal law does not become a weapon for the selective harassment of citizens.” In the Navtej Johar case, a five-judge bench had partially struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, decriminalising same-sex relations between consenting adults. In his opinion, justice had examined how, when Section 377 interacts with the existing social and moral proscriptions, its effect is to confine the LGBT+ community to the proverbial closet, causing great harm to their individuality, personhood, and dignity. The legal provision, thus, was held to be discriminatory and was read down to decriminalise consensual sex between consenting adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antiterror-law-should-not-be-used-to-quell-dissent-sc-judge-dy-chandrachud-101626162172968.html

13-07-2021||India||Monsoon covers entire country after delay of five days: IMD||Monsoon finally advanced to Delhi on Tuesday, 16 days behind the normal schedule of June 27, as it covered the entire country five days later than usual, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday. The monsoon normally covers the entire country by July 8 even as it did so by July 19 in 2019 and August 15 in 2002. The monsoon advanced into Delhi on July 19 in 2002.The arrival of the monsoon is announced based on factors such as wind speed, consistency of rainfall, intensity, and cloud cover. It is crucial to the country’s farm-dependent economy and arrives in Kerala first around June 1 before covering the rest of India in over a month.The progress of the monsoon towards Delhi and neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Punjab was delayed as it entered a “break spell” from June 29 to July 8. The “break” is normal for monsoon weather systems and usually lasts around a week. A longer break can affect agriculture. India receives about 70% of its annual rain during the four-month monsoon that is crucial for rice, soybean, and cotton cultivation.IMD’s May 31 forecast for early Monsoon onset over Kerala raised hopes of fast advance across the country. But the Met department revised this at the last minute on May 30 and said the monsoon will arrive in India on June 3, two days later than the normal schedule.Also Read | Delhi sees light rainfall; IMD announces arrival of monsoonThe IMD on Tuesday said the monsoon further advanced into the remaining parts of the country, including Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. It added there has been a continued prevalence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal in the lower levels for the four days. IMD said there has been enhanced cloud cover and scattered to fairly widespread rainfall.IMD said from 8.30 am on Monday to 8.30 am on Tuesday, Delhi’s Safdarjung recorded 2.5 cm rainfall, Ayanagar 1.3 cm, Palam 2.4 cm, Lodi Road 0.9 cm, and Ridge 1 cm. In Haryana, Gurugram received 5.1 cm rainfall, Faridabad 2.8 cm, Panipat 1 cm, Rohtak 2.2 cm, Hisar 3.3 cm, Fatehabad 3 cm. Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer recorded 7.7 cm, Bikaner 6.8 cm, and Churu 9 cm rainfall.DS Pai, who heads IMD’s climate research and services, said their models are showing normal to above normal monsoon conditions till the end of July. “Due to development of a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, Peninsular India is getting good rains. The cross-equatorial flow is also strong.” Pai said the monsoon has revived completely. “As we forecasted earlier, the monsoon started reviving from July 8, and many parts of north and northwest India started getting good rains, including Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. A small area however did not get rain. Today, even that area is covered.”IMD said widespread rainfall was very likely in parts of northwest India during the next three days. Isolated heavy to very rainfall was expected in Uttarakhand, west Uttar Pradesh over the next five days and in Himachal Pradesh from Tuesday to Saturday.A low-pressure area was over the Saurashtra coast and neighbourhood and an east-west shear zone in middle levels across Central India. Strong westerly winds were also prevailing along the west coast. Under the influence of these conditions, IMD said widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall was very likely along the west coast, adjoining inland areas, and peninsular India during the next four days. Moderate to a severe thunderstorm with lightning was very likely in Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar during the next 24 hours.Good rainfall has been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years, and its ability last year to buck the Covid-19 pandemic. As much as 60% of the sown area does not have access to irrigation in India, where over 150 million farmers and nearly half of the population are dependent on a farm-based income. The monsoon also replenishes 89 nationally important reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.In its second long-range forecast In June, IMD said monsoon rainfall was likely to be normal at 101% of the long-period average (LPA) after two years of above-average rainfall. LPA is the average rainfall (88cm) recorded in India every year between June and September from 1961 to 2010. In 2020 and 2019, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the monsoon was normal at 103.4%, 102.2%, and 104%, according to IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-has-covered-the-entire-country-says-imd-101626159412534.html

It is developing the vaccine against Covid-19, along with Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).The Gamaleya institue said that during a study conducted by it, vaccination with Sputnik V has produced protective neutralising titers against new variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7) - first identified in UK - Beta (B.1.351) - first identified in South Africa - Gamma (P.1) - first identified in Brazil - and Delta (B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3), first identified in India.The vaccine is also able top provide protection against Moscow endemic variants B.1.1.141 and B.1.1.317, the institute further said.The Gamaleya institute study methodology was based on the assessment of virus neutralising activity (VNA) using the live virus. It said that the sera were obtained from individuals after vaccination with two doses of Sputnik V.The vaccine is a two-dose shot (but two unidentical doses unlike other two-dose vaccines) that is 91.6% effective in preventing serious illness as was found in phase 3 clinical trials.It has so far been registered in 67 countries globally with a total population of over 3.5 billion people, said the Gamaleya institute.Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, which is marketing the product in India, said that Sputnik V could be commercially launched “in the coming week” in the country."Starting initially in Hyderabad today, the soft launch rollout of Sputnik V has scaled up speedily and reached cities and towns all over India- including but not limited to Hyderabad, Vizag, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, NCR, Chennai, Miryalaguda, Vijayawada, Baddi, Kolhapur, Kochi, Raipur, Chandigarh, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik," it said in a tweet on Monday.The Indian drug regulator has granted permission for restricted emergency use of Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-vaccine-effective-against-new-variants-of-coronavirus-study-101626158252992.html

Jharkhand Congress chief and state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon said population control was required but it will be better for the Centre to come up with a policy on the issue. “The population policy has been brought in Uttar Pradesh... We all know what is their (BJP)’s agenda. However, as a student of economy, (I)... admit we cannot afford a population explosion because that stresses our resources. So, there should be a balance between the population and the resources. But this is a national issue. The central government conducts Census every 10 years. So, the Centre should come up with a policy on it,” he said.Also Read | The life and death of Father Stan SwamyJMM spokesperson Manoj Pandey echoed Oraon and called the introduction of a population policy in Uttar Pradesh a poll gimmick. “On one hand, RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) leaders say Hindus should have more children and on other hand, the BJP brings a (policy)...ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh. ...there needs to be a population check. But it needs to be looked into how awareness and education could play a role in it. Instead of doing politics, the BJP government should bring a national policy on it.”Opposition BJP has asked the Jharkhand government to come up with a population control policy while welcoming its introduction in Uttar Pradesh. Sanjay Seth, the BJP Lok Sabha member from Ranchi, said it is time for all state governments to follow suit. “Anyone having more than two children should not get any benefits from the government. If we do not take strict measures now, the future generation would not forgive us. ...the Jharkhand government should prepare a policy and implement it in the state. I raised this issue in Lok Sabha and would like to see a pan India policy on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhands-ruling-alliance-constituents-seek-central-policy-on-population-control-101626157852332.html

The activist had earlier made several posts on the social media platform making allegations regarding the sources of income of the diplomat and her husband, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri.The Delhi high court took note of Gokhale's tweets on Tuesday and asked the activist to immediately remove them. If the tweets are not deleted within 24 hours, Twitter India has been directed to take down the posts. The court directed the social media firm to file its compliance report in the matter on the next date of hearing.Gokhale, in his tweets on June 13 and 26, made reference to a certain property purchased by Lakshmi Puri in Switzerland and also referred to her husband Hardeep Singh Puri, the Union minister of housing and urban affairs.Challenging the remarks made in the posts, Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri, through her counsel, filed a defamation suit seeking ₹5 crore in damages from Gokhale. She also sought direction from the court to take down or delete the tweets, wherein “false and factually incorrect, per-se defamatory, slanderous and libellous statements/imputations have been made by him” against her and her family.The Delhi high court asked Gokhale to delete all the pertaining tweets but preserved his right to seek a modification to the order. The bench, according to reports, noted that while any citizen has to right to comment on a public servant's sources of income, the law of the land requires the concerned citizen to first seek clarification from the individual or approach the authorities regarding the matter before publishing their allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-directs-activist-saket-gokhale-to-remove-tweets-defaming-lakshmi-puri-101626154416210.html
13-07-2021||India||India to appoint National Maritime Security Coordinator for maritime security||Two decades after the Kargil Group of Ministers' recommendation, the Narendra Modi government is all set to create and appoint a National Maritime Security Coordinator (NMSC) to interface between the civilian and military maritime domain with the objective of enhancing security architecture and energy security of India. The Maritime Security Coordinator will work under Indian National Security Advisor and be the principal advisor to the government on maritime security domain.According to South Block sources, the Ministry of Defence and Military Affairs has sought Union Cabinet approval for the NMSC post and there is all likelihood that a serving or recently retired Vice Admiral of Indian Navy will be appointed to the job. The NMSC has been a long pending requirement since the Kargil GoM recommended it and its need was most felt during the 2008 Mumbai massacre when 10 Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) gunmen directed by ISI handlers in Karachi intruded into Mumbai and created mayhem with the maritime security agencies like Navy, Coast Guard and Mumbai Port all at sea figuratively. The appointment of NMSC fills the need of the hour as the Navy, Coast Guard and state maritime boards all tend to work in silos with overlapping jurisdictions and are constantly at odds with each other.While India has suffered from sea blindness over centuries with land based security doctrines, historically and geo-strategically, the country is a maritime nation with over 7000 km of coastline and over 2 million kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone. Over 70 per cent of Indian trade including vital crude oil is transported through sea and protection of sea shipping lanes is vital to India’s security with Modi government on June 16 clearing the Deep Ocean Mission for blue water economy.India has nine coastal states and four union territories, who believe that maritime and coastal security is responsibility of the central government and have little to increase the maritime domain awareness.With China moving towards a sea based security doctrine and penetrating into Indian Ocean through Pakistan and Myanmar, the post of NMSC will be vital for maritime and energy security as Beijing plans to reach to eastern sea board of Africa through Indian maritime domain.However, the creation of NMSC is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Act East Policy, SAGAR (Security and Growth of All in the Region), Deep Ocean Mission and the Sagarmala project to make India’s 12 major ports into world class standard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-appoint-national-maritime-security-coordinator-for-maritime-security-101626154622796.html
13-07-2021||India||Editors Guild of India ‘deeply disturbed by high-handedness in Uttar Pradesh’||The Editors Guild of India (EGI) on Monday said it is “deeply disturbed” by the “continuing trend of heavy-handedness by the state authorities” in Uttar Pradesh with journalists after a video showing a civil servant purportedly assaulting a journalist went viral.“In a video that has gone viral on social media, Krishna Tiwari, a local journalist, is seen being beaten up by Divyanshu Patel (chief development officer), as well as reportedly some BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) workers. EGI finds this incident highly condemnable and actionable. This incident has come against the backdrop of using tools like increased persecution of journalists in the state of UP (Uttar Pradesh)…” The guild noted Patel may have apologised but the “heavy-handedness by the administration is hurting the democratic rights of the media, which becomes all the more crucial given that the state goes into polls next year.” It demanded strict action against Patel. The guild called for concrete steps to “improve the environment for independent journalism in the state.” The incident happened on July 10 when Tiwari was covering the block ‘pramukh’ elections. In a video that has gone viral on social media, Tiwari is seen being beaten up by Patel and some alleged BJP workers.It said the government has “punished, penalised, and incarcerated journalists.” The guild added that journalist Siddique Kappan, who was arrested while on his way to report a rape and murder case last year, “still remains in jail under the draconian UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act). It added his incarceration continues despite several appeals by the family and the civil society to at least “afford him (Kappan) a fair trial and treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/editors-guild-of-india-deeply-disturbed-by-high-handedness-in-uttar-pradesh-101626154612165.html

13-07-2021||India||Jaishankar to meet Wang Yi: Afghanistan and Ladakh situation on the plate||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will meet his Chinese counterpart and State Councilor Wang Yi on the sidelines of the SCO foreign ministers meeting in Dushanbe to discuss the unfolding security situation in Afghanistan and discuss the ways to fast track de-escalation and disengagement in East Ladakh. Jaishankar leaves for Dushanbe, Tajikistan, today and will also be attending an international meeting on connectivity between south and central Asia in Uzbekistan.The focus of SCO Dushanbe meeting will be Taliban offensive in Afghanistan with the fundamentalist force encircling the Afghan nation by capturing the two land routes to Tajikistan over Amu Darya and another one to Iran via Herat. It is quite evident that the largely Sunni Pashtun force will try and capture the land route from Mazar-e-Sharif to Termez in Uzbekistan too after which it will launch an offensive towards Kabul from all the directions forcing the Afghan Army to surrender or get killed. The brutal killing of surrendered Afghan Army commandoes, shown on western TV networks, shows that the fundamental nature of Taliban has not changed 20 years after it was evicted by the US forces in 2001.While the agenda of the SCO ministerial meeting is the security situation in Afghanistan and its ramifications on neighbouring South and Central Asia, EAM Jaishankar will also discuss the East Ladakh situation with foreign minister Wang Yi as the PLA is dragging its feet on disengagement and de-escalation in East Ladakh. It is understood that the dates for the 12th round of senior military commanders meeting will be finalized after the two foreign ministers speak on the way forward.The PLA wants the senior commanders to discuss on disengagement from Gogra-Hot Springs area near Kongka La and leave the Depsang Bulge to the local commanders as it claims that it is a 2013 legacy issue. However, the Modi government is very clear that the Depsang Bulge issue should also be discussed as the PLA is blocking the ingress route to the area and not allowing the Indian Army to patrol points 10 to 13 in the region. “As the Depsang and Gogra-Hot Springs situation has been created due to PLA transgressions, it is important that the military commanders find a resolution to the aggravated situation as armies on both sides are packed up on either side of Line of Actual Control in East Ladakh,” said a senior official. The Depsang Bulge area is south of Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) area between the Indian Darbu-Shyok-DBO road and Chinese built Tainkong Highway on the other side.India and China will also discuss the Afghanistan situation with the Taliban unilaterally giving assurances to Beijing that they will not allow Uighur militants territory to operate against “friend” China through the Wakhan Corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-meet-wang-yi-afghanistan-and-ladakh-situation-on-the-plate-101626145247471.html

The stringent curbs will come into effect from today, and will last till Wednesday, according to state government order. Golaghat, along with neighbouring Jorhat, have been identified as districts of concern by the government where Covid-19 norms have been violated.The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) chairman issued an order on Monday, which said that all grocery shops, retail shops, vegetable and fruit vendors, except pharmacy and milk vending points, will remain closed on July 13 and 14 in Golaghat.The decision was in view of the rising trend of Covid-19 cases in the district and to stop the spread of the disease, the order added.Jorhat and Golaghat have been under containment since July 7, along with five other districts of Assam. These two districts reported the highest number of fresh Covid-19 cases on Sunday, with 185 cases detected in Jorhat and 180 in Golaghat, according to the National Health Mission bulletin.In Jorhat too, only establishments providing essential services like pharmacies, veterinary clinics, milk vending and paper delivery services are allowed to remain open. All other services have been closed.Jorhat deputy commissioner (DC) Ashok Kumar Barman said the containment measures have been tightened because people were using the exemptions as excuses and violating Covid-19 protocols.People who have received confirmation after booking a slot at a vaccination centre will only be allowed to come out, the deputy commissioner said. Warning of stringent action against violation of Covid-19 protocols, Jorhat superintendent of police (SP) Ankur Jain said, "People are coming out for morning and evening walks. All the walks will now end at the police station.""Many people come out with false documents of being associated with essential services or some fake emergency. When such people are caught, they will be punished as per provisions of law," he added.He said foot patrol was being conducted by security forces, including CRPF personnel in the morning as well as in the evening hours. People in rural areas tend to come out in greater numbers from 4pm to 7pm, so in those areas foot patrol is undertaken in the evening, he added."We have been fighting Covid-19 for one-and-a-half- years now. People are not ignorant of the protocols. It is not correct to ignore the rules," Jain said, urging the people to cooperate in enforcing the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stringent-curbs-in-assam-s-golaghat-from-today-to-check-covid-19-spread-101626137395195.html

Although the Uttar Pradesh police has ruled out any 'communal angle' in the case, an FIR was registered over offenses insinuating criminal conspiracy and enmity between religious groups.Also Read | Plea for relief from physical appearance: HC reserves order on Twitter head’s pleaTwitter India MD Manish Maheshwari has been held accountable by the Uttar Pradesh government for the uploaded video, which the prosecution says "resulted in violence". The defense, on the other hand, argued that Maheshwari is merely an employee at Twitter, a company managed from the United States, and as such cannot be held accountable for a video uploaded by any user on the platform."Who am I? An employee," Maheshwari submitted in his petition to the Karnataka high court, adding, "Twitter is not controlled or administered by me."The UP government says Manish Maheshwari is to be held accountable for the uploaded video since he, being the managing director of Twitter India, is a representative for the firm. The video "resulted in violence" and thus the representative has a "responsibility to the people" to come clean before the investigating authorities.The government also contended the jurisdiction of the Karnataka high court in hearing the case and deciding on the matter. The alleged offense was committed in Uttar Pradesh, the prosecution pointed out, questioning the grounds under which the court is hearing out the case.Twitter was earlier last month also issued a second notice by the Ghaziabad police to seek “account details” of the suspects accused by cops of posting and promoting the alleged Loni assault video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loni-assault-karnataka-hc-order-today-twitter-india-md-manish-maheshwari-plea-up-police-notice-101626135937294.html

13-07-2021||India||Growth in income in last three decades: How consumer trends evolved in India||The last three decades have brought consumption front and centre into Indian lives, irrespective of age or income. The major life focus of all Indians is to strive to earn more and save more in order to buy a better quality of life for themselves and their family. The tenet that consumption is wasteful and best done in moderation has been replaced by “it’s OK to want it, now let’s see how we can afford it”. What hasn’t changed, though, is belief that the Almighty needs to lend a hand too. The PayTM sign at the Kedarnath temple high up in Himalayas says it all. The moral purification of consumption is complete.Pragmatic ConsumptionPopular narratives of India’s new consumption as hedonistic and a means of self expression are shaped by interactions with or anecdotes of the richest 10 or 20% of urban India, accounting for less than 10% of Indian households (HHs), and 15 to 20% of HH income (pre-Covid); less than 10% of Indian HHs have people with a regular job and salary, while almost 60% of this group does. The fact is that pragmatic consumption remains the hallmark of most of Consumer India’s spending.Also read: Fuel, food prices keep inflation high at 6.26%Quality of life improvement is about getting a better house, be it a first-time bathroom or a second home; more water than the municipality supplies, brought in tankers to posh buildings or bastis alike; getting 24x7 electricity whether through inverters or Chinese rechargeable torches; better health care in America or from a private doctor or nursing homes (even in underdeveloped rural districts and in the poorest 20% of Indian households, 50-60% seek private health care).Child-centric spending is huge but its focus is mostly about giving children a better shot at the future -- education abroad, capitation fees, private colleges and even among the poor, private non-government schools, and tuition and coaching of all shades. Even modest income HHs will stretch to buy a timeshare resorts subscription because their children can have exposure to swimming pools and sophisticated augmented reality games a few weeks every year. They will buy a bike for the child to get to coaching class on time and fresh.Two-wheeler purchases are mostly pragmatic productivity tools for the self-employed and smart phones have the utility of cheap entertainment, though good looks are a must.Don’t Indians believe in spending for emotional not utilitarian payoffs and to get fun? First, pragmatic consumption, while appearing utilitarian, has strong status and emotional payoffs. Secondly, “affordable indulgences”, whether food, fashion, travel or entertainment are definitely seen as part of better living. As adman Santosh Desai puts it, for Indians now, life is not a condition to be endured but a product to be experienced. And Indians are excitedly seeking experience, provided the price fits the pocket.There is mass market demand for everything, provided affordable supply exists. Whenever it does, demand explodes, as we have seen with air travel after Indigo or data consumption after Jio or apparel after Myntra or temple tourism in the Himalayas.Borrowing to consume has also been morally purified. The cultural label of debt has changed from “irresponsible living beyond your means” to “responsible ways of achieving your goals of a better quality life”. Consumer India has mostly proved to be a responsible borrower with consumer durable and housing loans forming a large part of retail credit and debit cards outnumbering credit cards and by not borrowing when the future seems uncertain. After credit scores and CIBIL, they are even more cautious.More volatility in ConsumptionToday consumption is a lot more volatile than in 1991, despite economic growth. Earlier, there were only the haves and the have-nots, and it was mostly the “haves”, typically quite secure in their employment, who consumed, such consumption being further smoothened by controlled supply. With income growth in the last thirty years and more supply at various price points, and better access to credit, there are a whole class of “have-somes” who are consuming now.But these “have-somes” have stayed small-time self-employed, in a more volatile economy with low resilience to income shocks (60% of India has less than 5-6% surplus income after all their expenditure and account for 50% to India’s household consumption).Despite their optimism, they fall off various compartments of the consumption bandwagon frequently and get back on it when they can.A more complex consumer khichdiEarlier consumer categorisation was simple and binary. Today as exposure and experiences have increased, leading to more choices of how to live, it is a continuum with many shades of modern-traditional , westernised-Indian, rural-urban etc.A rich land-owning joint family living in the village with children studying abroad or in the city, with cars and modern appliances, but still steeped in traditional ritual celebrations is one example that defies simple stereotyping, and there are hundreds more.Food is a great metaphor for this. We commonly see vegetarian Mexican and Italian, “100% Belgian Waffles but no egg”, many shades of where and how non-vegetarian, north Indian homes now easily make dosas and south Indian eat Amritsari Chole (use a mix or just heat and eat or learn it on YouTube).This fluidity compared to the rigidity of 30 years ago makes marketing more complex but provides far more opportunities to capture value.Blurring urban-rural divideThis blurring of boundaries is most evident in the rural-urban divide. Roads, the internet, TV, cars, cell phones have collapsed distances and provide a quantum jump in urban-like exposure to a lot of rural India. The diversification of rural India’s occupation away from agriculture provides better income increases and along with that, amorphous entities called census towns have morphed into something best called “rurban”. The most interesting thing about this blurring of the urban-rural divide in income and exposure is the creation at last of a singular mass market that straddles both (See Chart 3 --mass market at last).Digital Moksha is hereThe education deficit has still not been fixed in these last 30 years, but digital literacy has stepped in, providing knowledge, information, ability of various kinds hitherto not possible. Digital environments now provide status-blind service for those lower in the social hierarchy (humans discriminate, IVRs and chatbots don’t).Middle Consumer India’s confidence is on the rise. A lot has been written about how digital ability creates livelihoods so I won’t repeat any of that. But in an everyday sense it helps too.A vernacular medium person with middle school knowledge of English alphabets who doesn’t speak English now confidently communicates via text with customers and employers in Roman Hindi. WhatsApp helps you project who you are (check out your tailor or subziwala’s DP), improves social bonding, allows easy assertion of decreased social distance (see who is sending you good morning messages or festival greetings) and easy e-commerce without spending on a website. When temples, government services, train ticketing and mobile recharges have gone online, when you can find everyday information or get an SMS that saves you a trip and money, when 57% of the poorest 20% of households have a smart phone, Cyber Consumer India is well and truly entrenched.But Consumer India is a spoilt brat who loves “and” doesn’t like “or” , so all permutations of physical and digital are here to stay.Also read | Number theory: How to read today’s inflation numbersThe cookie toughensConsumer India has seen prices come down and quality go up of a lot of things (think airlines, telecom durables) and seen inconvenience turn into convenience; e-commerce and China have done their bit too by dropping price-performance points, upping convenience and variety and providing better service at no extra cost and the new sharing economy says pay only for what you need to use. Amazon and Instagram have made “unorganised” or “boutique” suppliers mainstream and weakened the draw of big brands and reduced switching costs or costs of trying and experimenting. So, the “value conscious” Indian Consumer has become “value expecting and demanding” and loyalty has given way to promiscuity in purchaser choices.The spirit is willing, the flesh, weakConsumer India is very keen to consume more, but its income and income growth are the constraint.The good news is that Consumer India’s income has grown substantially these last three decades. The bad news is that we are, and will be for a long time to come, a large economy with lots of modest-income consumers, a fact that we don’t honestly enough acknowledge. The good news is that income growth has happened across the board, geographically and by income classes, which makes for more and more robust consumer economy.In the past thirty years, at an accelerating pace, Consumer India has grabbed all opportunities that have come its way to evolve both as a consumer and as a person.The supply side has not kept pace and embraced the new Consumer India, focusing instead on operational efficiency improvement and scale building simplicity.Rama Bijapurkar is co-founder of People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE).

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said that the interaction by PM Modi is an endeavour to motivate the athletes ahead of their participation at the Games which will begin on July 23.The virtual interaction is expected to take place at 5pm.PM Modi had recently reviewed the preparations for the facilitation of the Indian contingent at Tokyo 2020. He had also discussed the journeys of some of the athletes on his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio broadcast, besides urging the country to come forward and support them, the PMO stated.A total of 126 athletes across 18 sports disciplines from India will be heading to Tokyo. This is the biggest-ever contingent India is sending to any Olympics, the PMO said, adding that the 69 cumulative events across 18 sport disciplines that India will participate in is also the highest ever for the nation.The PMO highlighted the "notable" firsts in terms of participation and said that for the first time a fencer from India (Bhavani Devi) has qualified for the Olympic games.Nethra Kumanan is the first-ever female sailor from India to qualify for the Olympics, while Sajan Prakash and Srihari Nataraj are the first swimmers from India to qualify for Olympic games by achieving the "A" qualification standard in swimming, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tokyo-olympics-pm-modi-to-interact-with-indian-contingent-today-101626133282650.html
13-07-2021||India||Climate crisis reason behind increase in lightning strikes||At least 74 people have been killed in lightning strikes in the past 24 hours in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Of these, 11 are visitors who were killed on Sunday when lightning struck them at Amer Fort near Jaipur.The numbers may seem high but should not surprise anyone.Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning strikes (usually in the pre-monsoon and monsoon months) are the single-largest killers among natural disasters (extreme weather events) in India, according to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Lightning strikes have killed at least 2,000 people every year in India since 2004, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said last month in an awareness workshop on lightning strikes.In 2019, there were 2,876 deaths due to lightning, compared to fewer than 1,500 on an average, annually, between 1968 and 2004. There was a brief period of three to four years in between when lightning strikes killed more than 1,500 people, but the larger trend held.The disaster management division of ministry of home affairs is yet to update the data on lightning deaths for 2020.According to a paper published in Elsevier journal, Weather and Climate Extremes by the ministry of earth sciences titled “An assessment of long-term changes in mortalities due to extreme weather events in India: A study of 50 years’ data, 1970–2019”, the mortality rate of tropical cyclones reduced by 94% over a 20 year period, whereas that for heatwaves and lightning, increased by 62.2% and 52.8%, respectively.Monsoon break created conditions for strikesNormally, lightning strikes are high in frequency during the pre-monsoon season, and when the monsoon is about to make an onset over Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states. This is the time when moisture levels increase, and the surface temperature is high, creating favourable conditions for development of thunder clouds.This year, however, there have been massive lightning strikes and associated casualty in mid-July, mainly due to the long monsoon “break” when surface temperatures were very high in the absence of rain.“There has been around a 10-day break in monsoon. There has been significant surface heating during this period. As the monsoon is reviving, moisture levels have also increased. This is the most favourable condition for development of thunder clouds and collision of ice particles which leads to charging and lightning strikes,” said SD Pawar, project director, Thunderstorm Dynamics, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. Thunder clouds require heat and moisture to form. They are also required to be deep, around nine to 10 kilometres for collision of ice particles to take place. And that’s what is happening now.Why are we seeing a spike in recent years?According to Pawar, the spike in lightning strikes can certainly be linked to the climate crisis.“Both surface temperature and moisture levels have increased significantly in recent years. Urbanisation leading to loss of tree cover also contributes to the rise in surface temperature. We think the two have mainly contributed to rise in incidence of lightning. The rise in deaths can be because more people are outdoors and possibly exposed to lightning in recent years,” he said.Lightning mortalities are only going to increase in coming years. “Climate projections indicate that temperature and moisture will increase further in the future,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).How can deaths be prevented?IMD’s Damini app provides area specific lightning warnings, but lightning is an extremely localised phenomenon, and the warnings often don’t reach the last mile. However, one can do certain things in the event of a lightning strike to save one’s life, such as going to a safe structure but avoiding metal constructions and finding shelter in low-lying areas that aren’t flooded. Crouching with your arms and legs together to make a smaller target, and keeping away from utility lines (phone, power, etc) as well as metal fences, trees (they conduct electricity) and hilltops are some other ways to keep safe during such an event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-crisis-reason-behind-increase-in-lightning-strikes-101626129386299.html
13-07-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination drive hit as states run out of stock||The critical shortage of Covid-19 vaccines has crippled the vaccination drive in several states with government data showing a drop in the average daily inoculation since June 21 – when the drive was opened to everyone above 18 years of age.As per data available on the Centre's CoWin platform, 1.33 million doses were administered on Sunday, which is the lowest since May 30 when 1.11 million doses were administered. The figure rose to 4.04 million by 10 pm on Monday. An average of 6.21 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered daily in the last week of June which dropped to 4.18 million in the first few days of July. Between July 5 and 11, the daily average vaccine doses further dipped to 3.50 million doses.The country’s per day vaccination had peaked on June 21, at 8.87 million, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the new phase of universalisation of Covid-19 vaccination.On Monday, the health ministry said over 15.4 million balance and unutilised Covid-19 vaccine doses are still available with the states, UTs and private hospitals to be administered.“Normally, fewer vaccinations are reported on Sunday when fewer vaccinations sites operate,” a health ministry official said, wishing not to be named.India has so far administered 376.29 million doses to 303.01 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched.“We are preparing to administer close to 10 million doses in a single day by August,” Dr NK Arora, chairman of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines, had said in June.In Delhi, government officials said the national capital has run out of Covishield stock and some vaccinations are likely to remain shut on Tuesday. “Why is our country’s vaccine programme faltering even after so many days?” Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tweeted.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told news agency PTI that the state has the capacity to vaccinate 1.5 million people daily, but as of now, only 200,000 to 300,000 people are being inoculated due to shortage of stock. In Odisha, the drive was halted in 24 out of 30 districts with state health secretary P K Mohapatra saying that the next consignment of Covishield vaccine was expected to arrive on July 15.Madhya Pradesh immunisation officer Santosh Shukla issued an order saying that the state has run out of vaccines and no drive will take place on Monday and Wednesday (vaccination days). “We were regularly receiving doses but the manufacturers have limited supply,” state medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said.Rajasthan health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said the state received only 3.163 million vaccine doses, an average of 0.175 million doses, between June 21 and July 8. Jharkhand government officials said the state has the capacity to administer 0.15 million doses everyday but only 19,586 people were inoculated on Sunday. Bihar also recorded its lowest vaccination on Sunday after it administered only 18,064 doses.Former Niti Aayog vice chairperson Arvind Panagariya on Monday tweeted: “India’s current vaccination rate of 3 to 4 million per day is simply not good enough.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-hit-as-states-run-out-of-stock-101626123921611.html

13-07-2021||India||Told BJP chief everything, says Bengal unit’s Dilip Ghosh on Babul Supriyo, Khan||Kolkata: Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh on Monday briefed party chief JP Nadda about the political situation in the state and brought charges of indiscipline against at least two Lok Sabha members from the state, people familiar with the matter said.Leaders aware of the discussions at Nadda’s residence in New Delhi said Ghosh complained that last week former union minister Babul Supriyo and state Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) president Saumitra Khan made some objectionable remarks on social media. “I have told the national president everything. Certain things are supposed to be discussed inside the party and not in public. The BJP’s disciplinary action committee will look into this,” Ghosh told the media in Delhi when specifically asked about Supriyo and Khan. He did not take any name.Incidentally, the two leaders made the statements after the reshuffle in union ministries on July 7 when four Lok Sabha members from Bengal became ministers of state and two junior ministers, Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, resigned. The new appointments were seen in political circles as a reward for those who represent regions where the BJP did well in the state elections.Chaudhuri, the MP from north Bengal’s Raiganj, did not react to her resignation but Supriyo, the MP from Asanol in West Burdwan who unsuccessfully contested the Tollygunge assembly seat in Kolkata in the recent polls, put out a tweet that indicated he wasn’t going on his own.Supriyo initially tweeted that he was made to resign but when this immediately triggered a controversy, he changed his stance. “Yes, I have resigned from the Council Of Ministers. As I had framed it earlier, “Asked to resign” may not be the right way to put it. I thank Hon’ble Prime Minister @narendramodi for giving me the privilege to serve my country as a Member of his Council of Ministers..” Supriyo said.“I am extremely happy that I go today without a spot of corruption on me, having served my constituency with all my might & having enjoyed their confidence when Asansol voted me back as their MP once again, with triple the Margin in 2019,” he said in a second tweet. Khan, a two-time MP from Bishnurpur in Bankura district who left the TMC before the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and retained the seat on a BJP ticket, did not comment on the cabinet reshuffle but attacked Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly who switched over from the Trinamool Congress and defeated chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the assembly elections by around 1,900 votes. “The leader of the opposition is constantly visiting Delhi and trying to convince our national leaders that he is the one doing everything for the party. He is only projecting himself. Have the others not contributed to the BJP’s growth? I raised this before the state president. He understands a few things but doesn’t seem to understand the rest,” Khan said in a video message shared on social media. He also resigned from the BJYM saying, “I take responsibility for the party’s loss in the assembly polls” but without hours, withdrew his offer to resign.Ghosh had earlier described Khan’s statement as a breach of discipline. Supriyo and Khan did not react to Monday’s development till late evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/told-bjp-chief-everything-says-bengal-unit-s-dilip-ghosh-on-babul-supriyo-khan-101626119089905.html

Regarding opening of colleges, the vaccination programme is going on across the state inviting all the students to get vaccinated,” Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, the deputy chief minister said on Monday. As per data, the daily vaccination in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) area of Bengaluru on Monday (till 6.20 pm) stood at around 54,777 doses in total as against just 1,354 in Tumakuru, about 70 kms from Bengaluru. Though the daily vaccination numbers for persons aged between 18-45 years are above 100,000 to 200,000 per day, data shows that most of the doses have been in Bengaluru. On Sunday, out of the total 55,313 doses administered to persons between 18-45 years of age, nearly half or 22,359 doses were administered in the BBMP area or Bengaluru city, according to data on CoWin. From July 1 to July 11, Karnataka has administered 1743,028 doses to persons between 18-45. Of this 5,19,739 were in Bengaluru. Though Karnataka has seen a steady decline in new Covid-19 infections, the threat of a third wave looms large in the state. Karnataka reported 1386 new infections on Monday, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. There were 3,204 recoveries and the active caseload came down to 34,858. The positivity rate was at 1.26% as the state conducted 109,399 tests in total, according to government data. The fatality rate continued at a high of 4.40% as 61 more persons died, taking the toll to 35896, according to data. Bengaluru, the largest city in Karnataka and its economic centre, reported 319 new infections in a 24 hour period, according to the health department on Monday. There were 784 recoveries which brought down the active caseload to 12,985, data shows. The city also reported 9 deaths which took the toll to 15,745. Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru reported 10 deaths each, data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-remains-a-priority-in-vaccine-drive-even-as-other-districts-lag-behind-101626117648971.html
13-07-2021||India||HC upholds Karnataka govt’s decision to hold SSLC exams||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Monday dismissed a petition challenging the state government’s decision to hold Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) exams in July. The SSLC examination for the academic year 2020-21, was to be held on July 19 and 20. A Bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and Hanchate Sanjeevkumar dismissed a petition filed by one SV Singre Gowda seeking cancellation of examination in view of the pandemic, after the Advocate General (AG), appearing for the state, made a submission of the precautionary steps to be taken. The AG in the high court observed that the exams were being held keeping Covid-19 safety norms in place. The exams will be held for only two days and will last three hours, from 10.30 am to 1.30 pm. The state has also condensed all Class 10 subjects into two exam papers of multiple-choice questions (MCQ). “We will have only 12 students in a classroom. One desk for one student. There will be social distancing, health screening, 2 paramedical staff,” the AG said. In response, the bench said that it finds that the state has taken the required precautions. “Court is not inclined to interfere in the matter. We find that state has taken care to conduct exams by issuing SOP in form of a circular to be complied with by all students, teachers and all stakeholders. Petitioner is not able to point out how state conducting the exam is arbitrary. Hence, we do not find any merit in the petition. Hence, the petition is dismissed,” the court ordered. The petitioner pointed out that exams for Class 10 students have been cancelled in most states and added that the CBSE also has cancelled its board exams for Class 10 and 12. The petitioner also argued that the Union government is yet to roll out any vaccination drive for children. The petition also stated that the parents of students are anxious to send children to attend the exams. When the petitioner pointed out that only Karnataka will be holding the exams while the rest of India has cancelled the exams, the high court responded by saying that it was a policy decision of the state. “Many parents are single parents or have a single child and if anything happens to that child can the state government get the life of the child back? Keeping this in view, cancelling the examination is absolutely required,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-upholds-karnataka-govt-s-decision-to-hold-sslc-exams-101626117528903.html
13-07-2021||India||NEP to be implemented in K’taka govt colleges from this academic year: DyCM||Bengaluru Deputy chief minister of Karnataka and minister for higher education, Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, on Monday said that the National Education Policy (NEP) will be implemented from the current academic year. “NEP will be implemented in government higher education institutions by making use of LMS (learning management system) and Unified University College Management System (UUCMS),” Narayan said in a statement on Monday. He added that private colleges which have good infrastructure should come forward to implement the NEP from the current year itself. “Other institutions should also get ready to implement this in a gradual manner,” he added. “NEP aims to integrate various capabilities of the human intellect. It aspires to provide global exposure to the students even as it wishes to make them aware of the roots of the Indian tradition,” he said in the statement. The development comes at a time when the state government is trying to usher in the contentious NEP while reopening physical classes and the academic year after almost over a year of Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns in Karnataka and other parts of the country. NEP-2020, which will replace the National Policy on Education-1986, is an inclusive framework focusing on the elementary level of education to higher education in the country. The union cabinet had approved the NEP in July 2020 with an objective of universalisation of education from pre-school to secondary level. The policy also aims to enable an individual to study one or more specialised areas of interest at a deep level, and also develop character, scientific temper, creativity, the spirit of service, and 21st-century capabilities across a range of disciplines including sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities, among others. The state government has started to speed up the process of vaccinating students above the age of 18 years to help reopen colleges in the state. Narayan is also the head of the Covid-19 task force in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nep-to-be-implemented-in-k-taka-govt-colleges-from-this-academic-year-dycm-101626117468981.html

In this connection, an India-Centric online propaganda magazine ‘the Voice of Hind’ ( VOH) is published on monthly basis with an aim to incite and radicalize impressionable youth by projecting a skewed narrative of imagined injustices in India to arouse a feeling of alienation and communal hatred,” the NIA had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-is-members-arrested-from-south-kashmir-says-nia-101626117410551.html
13-07-2021||India||Leadership row: Yediyurappa continues outreach to different groups to gain support||Bengaluru Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday continued his review meetings of caste-specific boards and corporations in what is being seen as an attempt to reach out to groups that are traditionally not known to back the 78-year-old or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The chief minister held meetings on the Basava Kalyana, Kaginele and Sangolli Rayanna development board meetings on Monday, which relates to the Lingayat and Kuruba communities. In the Basava Kalyana development board meeting, the chief minister approved an action plan for the ongoing fiscal which involves several projects. “Out of 134 works taken up by the board, 76 works have been completed and 58 works are pending. The state government has earmarked Rs.500 crore for the Anubhava Mantapa Project and Rs.200 crore have been allocated during the current financial year. Anubhava Mantapa is coming up in an area of 101 acres of land. Philanthropists have donated 11.25 acres of land freely and the remaining 69 acres needs to be acquired from various farmers,” a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO) stated. The board pertains to the Lingayats, believed to be the single largest caste-group in the state, and who have until now considered Yediyurappa to be their undisputed political leader. However, the recent row involving the Panchamasali, the biggest sub-sect within the Lingayats, has bracketed Yediyurappa into a member of the Banajiga sub-sect and have sought to have one of their own instated in the top office if the BJP high command does decide to replace the 78-year-old. This was followed by Kaginele Development Board, a place where saint-poet Kanakadasa is believed to be buried and is one of the most important places for the politically active Kuruba community. Even the Sangolli Rayanna development board meeting was held on Monday, which appears to be an effort to expedite all works to show visible progress in the outreach to communities, like the Kurubas, who have backed former chief minister and leader of the opposition, Siddaramaiah. Yediyurappa has made boards for Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Kurbas, Brahmins and Marathas among other groups to help earn their backing to keep him in power till 2023 and also aspires to lead the BJP to the assembly elections two years later. On July 6, Yediyurappa approved around ₹223 crore worth of works in the Kempe Gowda Development Board. During the 512th Kempe Gowda Jayanthi celebrations on June 27, a prominent Vokkaliga seer also requested the chief minister to rename the Metro project and put up a bust of the person widely believed to have installed the foundation for the city of Bengaluru. He is also associated with the politically dominant Vokkaliga community, believed to be the second largest in the state. The request came in after Yediyurappa announced to install the statue of the 12th century social reformer, Basavanna inside Vidhana Soudha’s premises. The developments come at a time when Siddaramaiah has also backed marginalised communities to take the legal route to get Yediyurappa to release the findings of the Socio economic and educational survey, better known as caste-census, as a way to get the government to review the perceived size of dominant groups and the benefits they currently get under the existing provisions of reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leadership-row-yediyurappa-continues-outreach-to-different-groups-to-gain-support-101626117409004.html
13-07-2021||India||Despite curbs, B’luru traffic dept collects record fines till May 31||Bengaluru traffic department has collected more money in fines this year till May 31, as compared to previous years, even though the city was under lockdown that extended up to two months, due to Covid-19 second wave. As per the records of the traffic police, this year, till May 31, 2021, the traffic police have collected ₹58.9 crores in fines. In comparison, the fines collected for traffic violations was ₹99.5 crores in 2020, and in the year 2019, the amount collected was ₹89.1 crore. As per the traffic police’s estimate, the department could set the record for the highest fine collected so far, surpassing ₹112.3 crores in 2017. The traffic police department pointed out various reasons behind the high fine collection rate. Ravikanthe Gowda, the joint commissioner of police, traffic, said that even though people were asked to stay at home, the number of violations of lockdown rules were high. “Since we didn’t have much traffic management duties due to the lockdown, police were able to book more violations,” he said. On June 9, The Karnataka high court had allowed the police department to release over 1.5 lakh vehicles seized for violation of Covid-19 restrictions imposed across the state. The court noted that since a large number of vehicles have been seized, it would be difficult for the police to find adequate space to park these vehicles. As per the data submitted to the HC, 137,503 two-wheelers, 7,432 four-wheelers and 7,123 other vehicles have been seized in the state so far. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj ordered that such vehicles can be released to their owners after verification of documents along with an undertaking and deposit of fines. Junior rank officers say that apart from the violations of lockdown norms, there were strict instructions from the higher officers to increase the random checks of vehicles in the city, since January. “We have been asked to check documents of vehicles and also check if owners have any past violations against them. Many people have evaded paying fines have now asked to pay up during these random checks,” said an officer posted in Bengaluru east division, on the condition of anonymity. People not paying fine has been a big problem for the traffic department and that is the reason for the increasing the random checks, said Gowda. According to the department documents, more than 9.5 million traffic violations amounting to ₹390 crores have remained unpaid for the past three years because these challans were sent by post. “People were ignoring the challans issued to them. So, last year we began a drive to collect these fines by going to the violator’s home. The drive didn’t give the desired results. With more than ₹390 crore worth of fines, we have no options but conduct random vehicle checking across the city,” Gowda added. Since the random document checks have increased, in an effort to add one more option for contactless enforcement, the Bengaluru traffic police have enabled payment of fine amounts using Paytm. Bengaluru Police commissioner Kamal Pant launched the service on July 5. Earlier, there were options to pay traffic fines through Bangalore-one, BTP website and PDA machines. However, as the Paytm option is already in use in other states, the BTP decided to introduce the option in the city. Paytm has tied up with the traffic police to offer the payment option free of cost. Also, since there were issues regarding difficulties in carrying the original documents, the Bengaluru Traffic Police has advised vehicle users to use digital documents and produce them using Digilocker or mParivahan mobile applications during vehicle checks. “Documents such as registration certificate, driving licence, insurance, fitness certificate, permits, and emission test certificates can be downloaded onto Digilocker and mParivahan mobile applications. When asked by traffic police, vehicle users are requested to produce digital documents, which will help keep original documents safe and also weed out fake ones,” Gowda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-curbs-b-luru-traffic-dept-collects-record-fines-till-may-31-101626117288897.html

As per the state government’s Covid-19 regulations, all the shops and business establishments have to close by 1pm. Curfew starts in the district from 2pm.But according to the police, Abdul Mannan refused to down the shutters when two constables, Aminuddin Laskar and Badrul Hussain Laskar, asked him well past 2pm to comply with the restrictions.A heated argument followed. At one point, police said, Abdul Mannan and his friends started throwing broken tea cups at police. When the constables forcibly shut his shop, Abdul Mannan allegedly attacked them with a sharp object. Police said the two policemen also gave it back to Abdul Mannan, mostly using their sticks.The constables and the shopkeeper were taken to the Karimganj civil hospital.Later some videos emerged where the police officers were reportedly seen threatening to open fire. Some locals claimed the constables did fire, an allegation that was promptly rebutted by the district police chief Barua.“Our constables were trying to control the situation in spite of being attacked with sharp objects. But they did not use bullets to control the situation. In this critical time of Covid-19 spread, police officers are working hard to control public gatherings. But such attacks on them will not be condoned. We are going to file a case against Abdul Mannan for attempt to murder and some other charges.”On the other hand, the local traders’ association alleged that it was police constables who misbehaved and physically assaulted the shopkeeper first.“All shopkeepers in our bazaar close their shops at 1pm as per the state government’s guidelines. Abdul Mannan was not selling anything when police came. He was doing some work and assured them that he would close his shop in a few minutes. But the police constables misbehaved with him and in his defence, he attacked. Police should learn how to behave with common people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-assam-cops-attacked-by-karimganj-trader-for-shutting-shop-during-covid-curfew-police-101626116629443.html

Don’t disown your children only because you want to get elected and get a political post,” said a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta while dismissing the petition filed by Anita Magar.Magar challenged an order by the Bombay high court, which noted that there was enough evidence on record to show that Magar and her husband had three children on the date of filing of her nomination, and therefore, she was disqualified under the state’s two-child norm to run for public office.In her appeal, Magar told the top court that she only had two biological children, and the third child was not hers, but of her brother-in-law. She also asked the court to interfere in the interest of the girl child since her parentage was now in question.“The child has a birth certificate that mentions a different couple as her parents but the high court has called Magar and her husband as her parents. This case requires consideration to protect the child,” Magar’s lawyer said.Dismissing Magar’s petition, the bench said: “In your anxiety to get elected, you only created such a scenario. They are identified as your children in the school. And then the birth certificate was changed. To get over the legal requirements, all this is done. We cannot help you. You should think of your child.”On May 24, the Bombay high court upheld a 2018 civil court order that set aside Magar’s election as corporator of the Solapur Municipal Corporation in the polls conducted in 2017. Magar and three others contested from a ward in Solapur, and she was declared elected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-disown-kids-to-get-elected-sc-upholds-sena-leader-s-removal-101626116208860.html
13-07-2021||India||India invited to SCO meet on Afghanistan||Three meetings scheduled in the Central Asian states of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan this week will allow external affairs minister S Jaishankar to compare notes on the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan with interlocutors from several key countries.Jaishankar will visit the Central Asian states against the backdrop of growing concern in the region over the Taliban’s violent campaign aimed at capturing territory while stalling on peace talks aimed at finding a political settlement.He will visit Tajikistan during July 13-14 at the invitation of foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin to participate in a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). On the second day of the visit, he will take part in a meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan.Jaishankar will then travel to Uzbekistan to participate in a conference on regional trade, transport and connectivity in Tashkent during July 15-16. He is expected to meet several key interlocutors on the margins of the conference with the theme “Central and South Asia: Regional connectivity. Challenges and opportunities”.Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi is set to attend all three events, but people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that no bilateral meeting with Jaishankar has been lined up.Though the main item on the agenda of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting is the preparations for meeting of the SCO heads of states to be held in Dushanbe during September 16-17, the people cited above said, adding that the situation in Afghanistan is expected to figure prominently in the discussions.Afghanistan has observer status with SCO, which includes India, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar is expected to participate in both meetings in Dushanbe.Though the focus of the conference in Uzbekistan is on regional trade and connectivity, the presence of top leaders will provide opportunities for the Indian side to discuss the situation in Afghanistan on the margins of the meeting. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is expected to attend the meeting in Tashkent.The Uzbek government was keen to rope in the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers for the meeting in Tashkent, but the two countries will be represented by their foreign ministers. Representatives of China, Russia, Iran, the European Union and the US are also set to participate in the meeting.India has expressed strong concerns about the levels of violence in Afghanistan and Jaishankar asserted the need for a legitimate government in Kabul during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week. Russia has its own concerns about the violence in Afghanistan spilling over into the Central Asian states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-invited-to-sco-meet-on-afghanistan-101626116148825.html

The motivation, they say, is to nurture queer filmmakers who usually struggle for opportunities. “We wanted to ensure better resources for LGBTQIA+ filmmakers, considering the uphill task they have to make their films in the most sensitive and truest manner possible,” said Rangayan.Formally known as the Kashish QDrishti Film Grant, the award of R2 lakh is being offered by the Kashish Arts Foundation, a non-profit organisation that hosts the film festival and is open to emerging LGBTQIA+ directors of Indian origin based in India. “The Kashish QDristhi award empowers the members of the LGBTQIA+ filmmakers to own their narrative and boldly bring their own stories on their own terms to the world. The award celebrates the optimism, courage, and indomitable spirit of these visionary risk-takers,” said Neeraj of Lotus Vision Productions, whihc is supporting the grant.The initiative is in its sixth year but this is the first time it is targeted towards a filmmaker from the community. The winner will be announced on September 5. “We felt that it is important to support filmmakers who belong to the LGBTQIA+ community have no funding support to realise their dream projects. They are often sidelined by production houses and OTT platforms, because the LGBTQIA+ filmmakers believe in being true to their content and do not chase after bringing on board big stars,” said Rangayan. Previous winners of the grant have shown their shorts at various festivals around the world. “The grant enabled me to put my plan for my short film into motion. It’s not just the money but the confidence of being awarded the grant by an eminent jury that gave wings to me and the film,” said Arun Fulara, who received the grant in 2020 for his short, My Mother’s Girlfriend||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashish-institutes-short-film-grant-for-lgbtqia-directors-101626115368792.html

Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala visited the victim’s house on Monday and sought a court-monitored probe. Police had arrested a 22-year-old youth who was the victim’s neighbour three days after the murder on June 30. Daughter of tea plantation workers the incident happened when her parents went out for work. The girl was found to be hanging in her home when her brother returned home in the evening. During the post-mortem, it was found that the victim was brutally raped and later suffocated to death, said police. There were also attempts to skip post-mortem and hush up the case. Later, the police found that the accused was exploiting the girl for more than two years after enticing her with chocolates. Although he had abused the girl on several occasions earlier, police said, the victim turned unconscious on that particular day and the accused got panic and hanged her in the room with a shawl. The accused had even participated in the girl’s funeral and acted grief-stricken and insisted that the girl got hung accidentally while playing with the shawl, police said. During the investigation, it was found that her parents had given her the freedom to visit their house regularly and he used to bring sweets and he used this to allegedly exploit the victim. The ruling CPI(M) was red-faced after the accused Arjun P was found to be an active worker of the party youth wing, the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DFYI). But later the DYFI claimed he was expelled from the party long ago. “We don’t want the case to meet the fate of two siblings’ death in Walayar. There are many attempts to weaken the case. We need a court-monitored probe,” said Chennithala in Vandiperiyar (Idukki) after meeting the parents of the victim. In 2017 in Walayar (Palakkad) two siblings aged 13 and eight were found hanging inside their hut in a span of 50 days. Later post-mortem examinations revealed that they were subjected to sexual assault before their deaths. Following protests, five people were arrested by the police but later they were acquitted by the trial court and there was a big outrage in the state. Now the Central Bureau of Investigation is investigating the case afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncpcr-seeks-report-on-rape-and-murder-of-minor-in-kerala-101626115189397.html
13-07-2021||India||Customs plans to shift Kerala gold smuggling accused to other state||The customs department probing the Kerala gold smuggling case is planning to shift the main accused in the case to a neighbouring state, alleging intervention from many quarters. Last week, one of the accused, P S Sarith stated before a court that he was pressurised to take the names of the Congress and BJP leaders.Five main accused are in jail under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa). One of them, Sarith deposed before a court alleging that the jail authorities were torturing him and forced to take names of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders to implicate them in the case. But later, the central jail authorities in Thiruvananthapuram denied this and filed a counter-complaint against him and another accused KT Ramees, saying they regularly flout jail norms and discipline. “It is a serious issue. We are planning to move the high court with a plea to shift these accused to another jail. Threat to Cofeposa detainees is serious, and we also have informed the central government about this,” said a senior customs officer, who did not want to be named. He said the Centre could also move the supreme court to shift all cases relating to the gold smuggling to another state if the situation continued like this.Earlier, the mother of another accused Swapna Suresh had also alleged that her daughter was facing threat to life for not changing her statements. She had alleged that many in the CM’s office were aware the smuggling was done through the consulate office and that the consulate head used to visit the CM quite often. The Congress and BJP deplored the alleged move to implicate its leaders. “The ruling CPI(M) will have to pay a heavy price for this,” said state Congress chief K Sudhakaran. “Desperate, the government wants to sully the image of opposition party leaders,” said BJP state president K Surendran. At least four central agencies (customs, revenue intelligence, enforcement directorate (ED) and NIA) are involved in the gold smuggling probe. The sensational case came to light on July 5 last year after 30 kg gold was seized from a consignment that came to the United Arab Emirates consulate in the state capital camouflaged as a diplomatic consignment. The central agencies and state government have locked horns several times over the case. The government had filed a case against the ED last year and later constituted a judicial commission against it, saying it was trying to implicate many state leaders, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-plans-to-shift-kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-to-other-state-101626115188812.html

See you in Goa tomorrow,” Kejriwal tweeted on Monday.The local unit of the Aam Aadmi Party has launched a ‘Let’s Clean Goa’s Politics’ campaign and has been targeting primarily the Congress for having ‘sold’ its MLAs to the BJP.Despite an impressive campaign in 2017, AAP failed to win any seats and its candidates lost their deposit in 39 of the 40 seats that were contested but is hoping for a better showing this time round. Kejriwal’s arrival is expected to take forward the party’s campaign as well as make a significant electoral promise during his stay here.“The AAP has a role to play to split the opposition vote and help the BJP and the last time they succeeded...They hurt our chances in 3-4 constituencies without which we would have been able to form a government on our own,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.In the recent past, the BJP has brushed aside the threat posed to the party by the AAP with state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, saying, “They (AAP) can go ahead and declare their candidates as well. We are confident that we will return to power with a full majority on our own strength”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-2-day-visit-kejriwal-says-goa-wants-change-101626115008807.html
13-07-2021||India||SC gives govt 2 weeks to reply to petitions against sedition law||The Supreme Court on Monday gave the Centre two weeks’ time to respond to a petition challenging the validity of the sedition law under which expressions of dissent or valid criticism of governments are being penalised as attempts to spread hatred, contempt or disaffection towards elected regimes at the central and state level.The offence of sedition is punishable under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In 1962, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of this law in Kedar Nath Yadav v State of Bihar.On April 30 this year, the top court issued a notice to the Centre on a petition filed by two journalists Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla, working in Manipur and Chhattisgarh, who demanded a relook at the 1962 judgment in the light of blatant misuse of this law by governments to suppress criticism. The petitioners claimed that the said provision violated their freedom of speech and expression, a constitutionally guaranteed right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The court had even sought the assistance of attorney general KK Venugopal in the matter.On Monday, the bench of justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi gave solicitor general Tushar Mehta two weeks’ time to file an affidavit on behalf of the Centre. Before the next date of hearing on July 27, the court allowed the attorney general to file his written submissions.Meanwhile, three applications have also been filed in the matter by Foundation of Media Professionals, journalist Shashi Kumar and law professor Sanjay S Jain supporting the petition in challenging the constitutional validity of Section 124A of the IPC. Senior advocate Arvind Datar appeared for the foundation while advocates Kaleeswaram Raj and Namit Saxena represented the other two. The foundation said, “The internet has not only completely revolutionised the modes of communication, but also equipped nation states to exercise control over the minutest of actions, thoughts and speech of their citizens.”Shashi Kumar in his application stated that the “vague nature of the provision” allows Section 124A to be used as a “political weapon to create a chilling effect” on free speech. He cited sedition cases against anti-CAA protesters and farmers to highlight the misuse of the law. The third applicant showed how globally, the UK and New Zealand have repealed the sedition law while Australia replaced the term “sedition” with “urging violence offences” in 2010.The original petition filed by the two journalists was argued by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves.It pointed out that the SC may have been right in 1962 to uphold Section 124A but the application of this provision in recent times has made it “undemocratic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-gives-govt-2-weeks-to-reply-to-petitions-against-sedition-law-101626114948803.html

Congress’s Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken last week indicated that a cabinet expansion to fill nine vacant positions and appointments in state-run corporations and boards would happen “very soon” without giving any clear time frame. Maken reached Jaipur and held two rounds of meetings with Gehlot in presence of state party chief Govind Singh Dotasara last Tuesday and Wednesday. “The exercise on Cabinet reshuffle and political appointments is a work in progress...,” Maken stated.At 9pm on July 12 last year, Pilot’s camp released a statement on WhatsApp, claiming that the Gehlot-led Congress government was in minority, and that Pilot was being backed by 30 Congress MLAs and some independents, threatening the stability of the Congress government. The rebels stayed in Gurugram, Haryana till August 11, 2020 and returned to Jaipur after a month when it became clear that Gehlot had a majority on the floor of the House; the Congress high command set up a committee under Ahmed Patel to resolve issues.In June, Pilot expressed his displeasure at the lack of action by the committee.“We have apprised the party high command about everything... Our issues have not been resolved yet,” said Deepender Singh Shekhawat, MLA and former assembly speaker.A senior Congress leader said on condition of anonymity that even a cabinet reshuffle is unlikely to resolve the matter. Gehlot is pitching for independents and former Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs who saved his government during the floor test in August.Efforts were made to contact Gehlot and Pilot but neither responded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-yr-on-issues-of-pilot-camp-remain-unresolved-inraj-101626114889503.html

Following abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, we were sold dreams of rivers of milk and honey everywhere in J&K, especially in Jammu, but the move has aggravated problems...be it jobs, livelihood or our identity,” Mufti told reporters.The special status accorded to J&K under the Constitution were revoked on August 5, 2019 — a move opposed by mainstream parties in the state.Mufti also slammed the LG’s administration for dismissing government employees “without being proven guilty by the courts”, and the decision to do away with the Darbar move (the biannual shifting of the seat of power to Srinagar and Jammu).Mufti questioned the need for a delimitation exercise, which was stressed upon by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an all-party meeting on June 23.J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina, said: “...those who sympathise with Article 370 are in reality sympathisers of Pakistan and separatists and not of the common people of J&K.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nullification-of-article-370-an-attempt-to-loot-j-k-mehbooba-101626114888867.html

He is likely to be flown in an air ambulance to Antigua on Wednesday after completing legal formalities, the people cited above said.His legal team approached the Dominica high court last week seeking relief on the ground that his health was deteriorating and he needed urgent medical attention.The 62-year-old businessman, wanted in India in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, has been in the custody of Dominican authorities for illegally entering the island on May 24 and faces charges on this count. He was admitted to the Dominica-China Friendship hospital soon after and has been under treatment since May 31.His legal team sought permission for him to travel to Antigua on the grounds that he has a heart condition, is diabetic, has hypertension, and a clot in the brain.Choksi also submitted a medical certificate of Princess Margaret Hospital in Dominica in support of travel to Antigua, which said he would be examined by a private physician for a neurological assessment and a neurosurgeon from the US will also assist the physician.“Dominica courts finally upheld the rule of law and rights of a human to be treated in the medical facilities of his choice. And all attempts by various agencies did not bear fruit...,” said Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal.Also Read | Mehul Choksi alleges ‘collusion’ between India, DominicaThere was no formal response from New Delhi to Monday’s development. Indian government officials, however, have termed Choksi’s claim of poor medical health as a “drama” to stay away from prison in Dominica.As reported by HT, Choksi approached the high court last week to seek a judicial review of the illegal entry case against him alleging that he didn’t leave Antigua and Barbuda on his own but was brought to Dominica as part of “collusion” between governments, an allegation that has been rejected.Choksi, who fled India in January 2018 and has been living in Antigua, went missing from the country on May 23. He turned up on a Dominican beach about 200km away and was arrested, prompting the Indian government to seek his deportation as he was a prohibited immigrant in the country in contrast to Antigua, where he enjoys constitutional and legal protection by virtue of being a citizen.In Antigua, he, however, faces proceedings to extradite him to India as well as to revoke his citizenship. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne has previously said that his country will not take Choksi back and that he should be sent directly to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pnb-fraud-case-choksi-granted-bail-for-treatment-in-antigua-101626114829434.html
13-07-2021||India||Ashwini Vaishnaw reviews delayed bullet train project||Union railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has reviewed the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project that has faced several delays due to the slow pace of land acquisition and the Covid-19 pandemic, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The project connecting the two cities through a high-speed rail network was scheduled to be completed by December 2023, but top railway officials indicated that the timeline may be revised. “The ongoing pandemic and slow land acquisition process in Maharashtra is adversely affecting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project. The revised timelines will be worked out after assessing the exact impact of the pandemic on the entire project, land acquisition, and tender finalisation in the state of Maharashtra,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.The 508.17km rail corridor project comprises 348.04km in Gujarat, a 155.76km stretch in Maharashtra, and 4.3km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.Vaishnaw, 50, took charge on Thursday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted the bureaucrat-turned-politician into the Cabinet in last week’s mega reshuffle.He reviewed the high-speed rail project on Sunday.“All matters were reviewed with an aim to ensure that no stone is left unturned to achieve the objective,” the official added.HT reported in September last year that the bullet train may not be able to meet its 2023 deadline.The official cited above said 74% of the land acquisition project has been completed, mostly in Gujarat but the process hasn’t been on track in Maharashtra.The official added that work in Maharashtra is limited to land acquisition and utility shifting, and only 25% of the land is being acquired. “A major hindrance for contract award in the Maharashtra part of the alignment is the land availability since at least 80% of the land should be available before any of the work could be awarded,” the official said.The project has had to face issues ranging from protests by landowners to rising costs because of a widening gap between the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen; 81% of the ₹1 lakh crore needed to fund the project will come from a 20-year Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) loan. Officials said there was a possibility that the project cost could go up.According to the current project status compiled by the ministry, civil work contracts for the construction of 92% of the alignment in Gujarat and the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli (325km out of 351km and 5 stations) have been awarded, and construction work has commenced in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaishnaw-reviews-delayed-bullet-train-project-101626114828769.html
13-07-2021||India||In 24 hour, lightning kills 74 across three states||Lightning strikes killed 74 people in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh over 24 hours, making it one of the worst such disasters in the region in the recent past, according to data provided by the governments of the three states on Monday.On Sunday, 11 visitors at the historic Amber Fort on the outskirts of Jaipur were killed when a lightning bolt struck at a watchtower on which they were taking a selfie. Another 20 visitors were injured in the incident, the local police said.A witness said the incident occurred between 6.30pm and 7pm. “It was already raining when the people were there. As the rain intensified, they huddled together in the tower,” said senior police officer Saurabh Tiwari, adding that up to 30 people were there on the tower when lightning struck.Elsewhere in Rajasthan, seven children were killed in lightning strikes of whom four were in Kota and three in Dholpur. On Sunday, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced ex-gratia payment of ₹5 lakh each to the kin of the dead and ordered compensation for the injured.There were 41 deaths in Uttar Pradesh across 16 districts on Sunday evening in lightning strikes. “Thirty people have been injured as well. Ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh will be paid to the kin of the deceased,” Uttar Pradesh Relief Commissioner Ranvir Prasad told a news agency.He added that 250 animals were also killed in the lightning strikes and 20 were injured.In Madhya Pradesh, at least 11 people, including four minors, were killed and 13 sustained burn injuries due to lightning strikes on Sunday evening, the police said. Seven were killed in Gwalior and Chambal region, two in Rewa, and one each in Betuka and Hoshangabad, said a statement from the state disaster management authority.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about these incidents and the loss of lives, a person aware of the developments said. “Deeply saddened by the demise of people. I express my deepest condolences to the families of the deceased: PM @narendramodi,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a tweet.Later, the PMO issued a statement in which it said that ex-gratia relief of ₹2 lakh each to the families of the dead and ₹50,000 to the injured was announced.On June 7, lightning strikes in several districts of West Bengal killed at least 27 people. This prompted the India Meteorological Department to point to a trend of increasing danger from the weather phenomenon. Scientists there said that lightning strikes have killed nearly 2,000 people every year in India since 2004, which is nearly twice the number of deaths recorded since the late 1960s.Former director general IMD KJ Ramesh said that more deaths are being reported because of better reporting and compensation being awarded.“We need to create lightning alert systems to warn people as some states such as Odisha have done,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-24-hrs-lightning-kills-74-across-three-states-101626114768771.html
13-07-2021||India||Kanwar yatra tussle sparks Covid 3rd wave fears||An ongoing tussle over holding the kanwar yatra continued on Monday, with experts warning that allowing the religious pilgrimage that attracts millions of people could spark a possible third wave of Covid cases, months after the Mahakumbh drew 9.1 million devotees and seeded clusters of infections during the second wave.Uttar Pradesh has announced the yatra – in which Shiva devotees travel hundreds of kilometres to fetch water from the Ganga and carry it back to their villages – will begin from July 25, but Uttarakhand, home to the yatra’s destination, Haridwar, remained non-committal.The hill state earlier cancelled the yatra but decided to review the order last week after a request from UP. Both states are scheduled to go the polls in 2022.“The government respects religion and related traditions. But it is also the duty of the government to protect the life of every single person in state. Hence, a final decision would be taken only after proper analysis,” said Uttarakhand minister Subodh Uniyal.Doctors warned that allowing the event could propel a surge in infections because devotees typically travel through several states and maintaining Covid protocols is challenging.Health experts had issued similar warnings before the Mahakumbh — which was also hosted in Haridwar earlier this year – that appeared to spark infections in various north Indian states during the second wave.On Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) wrote a letter of caution to the state government. “The Uttarakhand government shouldn’t allow the Kanwar Yatra to happen in July-August in which lakhs of devotees from other states participate, as the third wave is ready to knock on the door of this country as per the statements of several specialists,” said the letter by Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary of IMA’s Uttarakhand chapter.“Learning from the previous failure, we should not allow the devotees to enter the boundaries of our state and keep the state safe from the third wave of Covid,” the letter added.Mahakumbh impactThe Mahakumbh attracted six million pilgrims in April alone, coinciding with the worst surge in infections – and only ended after an appeal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 17.By then, officials in many states such as Madhya Pradesh found local cases that were traced to Kumbh returnees. Between April 1 and April 30 active cases in the hill state registered a spike of 2,392%.The Uttarakhand high court later rapped the government and said holding the Kumbh was a mistake. It also cancelled the Char Dham Yatra — which attracted 3.2 million people in 2019 for a pilgrimage of the holy sites of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath – but the state government challenged the verdict in Supreme Court.Other experts warned that the kanwar yatra posed a logistical and health care challenge even more daunting than the Kumbh.The kanwar yatra attracted upwards of 30 million devotees in its last iteration in 2019 with pilgrims hailing from 10 states -- Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh -- walking or cycling to Uttarakhand.The fortnight-long pilgrimage was cancelled last year due to Covid but is set to be held from July 23 to August 6 this year.“Kanwar yatra shouldn’t be allowed in the state at any cost considering what happened after the Mahakumbh in Haridwar,” said Dr DD Choudhury, a senior doctor in Dehradun.In Uttar Pradesh, officials said the state government was planning to hold the yatra with all safety protocols. On July 9, chief minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed preparations and ordered that the yatra should be completed in complete adherence to Covid protocols.“The officers should ensure that there is no unnecessary assembly of crowd… Covid protocols should be implemented along with respecting public sentiments and faith,” he said.Hard to check violationsBut experts warned that elaborate guidelines were issued before the Mahakumbh — which included random testing, asking all pilgrims for Covid reports and masking – but the event saw rampant violation of Covid rules and mass gatherings without any masks. Moreover, roughly 100,000 of the rapid antigen tests conducted at the Kumbh were later found fake, raising doubts about the efficacy of testing during the event. “We know during Mahakumbh hardly anyone followed Covid guidelines,” said Dr Choudhury.Similar problems might force some other states to hold off on the yatra.Bihar said it will take a final decision on August 8 but indicated that holding the full pilgrimage may be difficult.“As per Unlock-4 guidelines, all the shrines and temples in the state have to remain closed till August 8. Fresh instructions will be issued afterwards,” said Subrat Sen, district magistrate of Bhagalpur, which is the node for the pilgrimage in the state.“In 2020, no kanwar yatra was allowed...this year also government is preparing to confront the third wave and huge gatherings need to be avoided. During events like kanwar yatra, it may be difficult to maintain social distancing,” he added.Despite increasing pressure from health experts, Uttarakhand said it was yet to take a final decision.Chief minister Pushkar Dhami -- whose predecessor Tirath Singh Rawat stepped down on July 3 after controversy over his decision to greenlight the Kumbh -- met Modi on Saturday and later hinted that the government was in two minds about holding the event.“The matter of faith is related to God and even God will not want that anyone should die. Our priority is that under no circumstances there should be danger to someone’s life,” he saidOpposition parties also opposed the yatra.Suryakant Dhasmana, vice president of the Uttarakhand unit of the Congress, said “During Kanwar yatra, which is mostly unorganised, people come from different states. How can they manage such huge numbers at a time when they should be readying for the third wave? PM Narendra Modi should intervene and stop this. Everyone knows what happened in Mahakumbh...they should not repeat the same mistake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanwar-yatra-tussle-sparks-3rd-wave-fears-101626114708815.html
13-07-2021||India||Supreme Court cancels bail of Rajasthan man accused of killing sister’s husband||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday cancelled the bail granted seven months ago to a man arrested for killing his sister’s husband in Rajasthan. The trial court has also been ordered to complete the trial within a year.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana cancelled Mukesh Chaudhary’s bail on a petition by his sister, Mamta Nair, who married the victim against her family’s wishes. He was shot dead at point blank range in May 2017.Mamta Nair had petitioned the top court against the December 1, 2020 order of the Rajasthan High Court granting bail to her brother Mukesh Chaudhary who was named as one of the conspirators in the crime registered at police station Karni Vihar in Rajasthan under the offences of murder (IPC Section 302), house trespass (IPC Section 452) and criminal conspiracy (IPC Section 120B).Mamta Nair told the court that she married the deceased against the wishes of her family. When she was six months pregnant in 2017, her family members barged into her house with some unknown persons and tried to forcibly take her away. When her husband tried to stop them, he was shot dead.The bench did not comment on the merits of the case since the trial is underway but set aside bail granted to Mukesh Chaudhary as there was prima facie material against him and only 21 out of 47 witnesses have been examined so far.The top court recalled that it had cancelled bail granted to Mukesh Chaudhary in November 2017 as well on the ground that there prima facie material against the accused, a change in the statement of the deceased’s wife recorded by the trial court did not provide for a “change in circumstance” for the high court to consider the fourth bail application of the accused.The top court asked Mukesh Chaudhary to surrender before the court of upper district and sessions judge, Jaipur and ordered the trial court to make all efforts to conclude the trial expeditiously and in no event later than one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-cancels-bail-of-rajasthan-man-accused-of-killing-sister-s-husband-101626114650603.html
13-07-2021||India||Fuel, food prices keep inflation high at 6.26%||Retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 6.26% in June on the back of higher food and fuel prices, the second straight month that India’s benchmark inflation measure has been above the Reserve Bank of India’s upper tolerance level, raising questions whether the country’s central bank will decide to continue with its easy interest rate regime when it meets next in August.The latest number, released Monday, is lower than the 6.59% forecast by a Bloomberg poll of economists, and also marginally lower than May’s 6.3%.Oils of all kinds seem to be the at the core of the problem -- inflation in oils and fats was 34.8% in the month, compared to May’s 30.8%, the result of high edible oil prices; and fuel and light inflation (as the head reads) was 12.68% (an all-time high) as compared to 11.6%, on account of spiralling fuel prices.Experts said the number could force the government to cut some duties on fuel to reduce retail prices.The National Statistics Office, which released inflation data, also put out factory output metrics for May, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The year-on-year growth of 29.3% in IIP is basically a base-effect driven illusion given the 33.4% contraction in May 2020 caused by last year’s hard lockdown to combat Covid-19. To be sure, May numbers this year too were expected to suffer because of the restrictions during the second wave, although many factories continued to remain open during India’s crippling second wave (unlike last year).While some high frequency indicators such as the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) suggest a sharp revival in economic activity – NIBRI jumped to 95.7 in the week ending July 11, where 100 captures the per-pandemic levels of activity – other indicators such as Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) suggest a loss of momentum in June compared to May. The composite PMI index fell from 48.1 to 43.1 between May and June 2021.The latest inflation numbers suggest that fuel prices are pushing up prices of other commodities. The moderation in headline inflation number is basically a result of reduction in inflation for pan, tobacco and intoxicants and housing category. Food inflation rose from 5.01% to 5.15% and inflation in clothing and footwear increased from 5.3% to 6.2% . Within food items, which have an overall share of 39% in the CPI basket, the oil and fat category reached yet another record high with an annual inflation number of 34.78%. Prices for cereals and vegetables continued to contract, although prices of the latter seem to be gaining momentum. Pulse prices also posted a double-digit growth in June.There could be multiple sources of tailwinds to inflation in the month of July. Fuel prices continue to increase. Petrol and diesel prices have increased by ₹2.38 and ₹0.54 per litre in Delhi between June 30 and July 12. Most dairy cooperatives have increased milk prices in the month of July. Inflation for the miscellaneous category of CPI was flat at 7.3% in May and June.In its June meeting, RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee projected an inflation number of 5.2% in the quarter ending June 2021. At 5.59%, the June inflation numbers have overshot the MPC projections by 39 basis points. The MPC forecast an annual inflation of 5.1% in 2020-21.“There is need for the government to start lowering taxes (on fuel) or CPI inflation will increase and put pressure on MPC,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings.“The current inflation spike appears to be transitory, driven largely by supply side factors and going forward, it is expected to moderate in the third quarter,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das told Business Standard in an interview on July 8.But the challenge remains.“We forecast CPI inflation at 5.4% in FY22. The drivers of inflation will likely change, from logistical disruptions in 1H to cost push and services demand led inflation in 2H. Even as headline inflation falls over the next few months... the headline print is likely to remain higher than the 4% target. We expect the RBI to embark on a gradual normalization path starting 4Q2021,” Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-food-prices-keep-inflation-high-at-626-101626114648728.html
13-07-2021||India||Parliament gears up for full session||Parliament is gearing up to hold its first full session in over a year next week amid some relaxations, including a revised seating arrangement for MPs as Covid cases in the country have reduced considerably over the past month. But a ban on the entry of visitors, no access to Central Hall for former MPs and the media, and strict social distancing norms will remain in place, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla said after a review of preparations on Monday.People aware of the matter said that the Congress party has called the meeting of its Parliament strategy group on Wednesday to decide its floor tactics. The virtual meeting will be attended by president Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rajya Sabha leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Lok Sabha floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh, among other leaders. The Congress is keen to raise issues such as the Centre’s vaccination policy, the economic situation and price rise, the people cited above added.With a week to go for the session, which runs from July 19 to August 13, speaker Om Birla said that about 311, or 58%, of 540 Lok Sabha MPs have been administered both doses of the Covid vaccine, and most of the remaining MPs have got at least one shot. Those who are yet to take their first shots — mainly because they contracted the virus in recent weeks — will be required to take RT-PCR tests.Over the past two sessions, MPs from both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha were seated in a dispersed arrangement that included members of one House sitting in the other and following the proceedings on giant screens. Both Houses were convened in shifts to enable this system to work.This time, MPs will sit in their own Houses, but some lawmakers may have to sit in the galleries to avoid crowding, the speaker said.“Adequate measures have been taken to ensure the safety of the members. MPs who have taken at least one dose of vaccination will not be required to undertake the RT-PCR test. Visitors will not be allowed during the session,” Birla told reporters.Ambulances, health centres, Covid testing facilities have also been kept ready for the session, he added.An all-party meeting will be organised on July 18 to discuss the agendas of the Treasury and Opposition members. Question Hour and Zero Hour will be conducted as per the usual norms.A senior Opposition leader said that a joint meeting of the Opposition’s floor leaders will take place before the session. The anti-Bharatiya Janata Party camp could not manage organised debates on these issues due to paucity of time in the last two sessions. This time, they expect to get at least two short duration discussions and call attention to debates.The list of pending bills includes The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, The National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (Amendment) Bill, The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021 and The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020.

13-07-2021||India||Centre expedited search for drone tech before attack||The Centre accelerated the hunt for anti-drone technologies to detect, identify and mitigate the threat of rogue drones even before two such devices, in a first-of-its-kind attack, carried out explosions at the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) station in Jammu last month, people aware of the developments said on Monday.The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), a federal police think tank, has formulated detailed specifications and guidelines for anti-drone technologies and submitted them to the ministry of home affairs (MHA), the people quote above said.Details accessed by HT reveal that BPRD, since 2019, consulted various stakeholders, including Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), National Security Guard (NSG), Airports Authority of India (AAI), Indian Air Force (IAF), ECIL (Electronics Corporation of India Ltd), BEL (Bharat Electronics Ltd), BCAS (Bureau of Civil Aviation Security), IIT Kanpur, and private companies, among others, to discuss the menace of rogue drones before preparing a comprehensive draft on anti-drone policy.The suggestions made by BPRD are currently being considered by the government for implementation after finding the right technology, for which trials have taken place on various occasions, an official said, without elaborating on the exact dates. He added: “The entire process is currently in advanced stages.”Among the issues covered by BPRD are the threat posed by unregulated/rogue drones, including attack on critical structures such as oil, gas, military and space establishments and airports, apart from targeted assassinations; declaring particular areas as no-drone zones; training personnel in handling anti-drone systems and collaborating with the private sector for harnessing the technology.The bureau is currently also evaluating a proposal for the establishment of Centre of Excellence for Drones and Counter Drones at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, under the aegis of the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), the official quoted above said on condition of anonymity.Another official, who asked not to be named, said 30-35 drones from across the border are spotted every month – some are fired at by the BSF while some manage to pass through as they go unnoticed, which is a serious problem. As seen in the Jammu attack, these drones, mostly made in China, manage to fly 10-14km within the Indian territory from Pakistan to drop arms, drugs and explosives.Apart from using technologies involving radar, radio frequency, thermal detection and audio detection, security experts are also exploring other methods.“There has to be a mix of technological and conventional on-ground methods to deal with rogue drones and it has to happen fast,” said the second officer.In its annual internal book last year, BSF also spoke about some other methods to deal with unfriendly incoming drones. For example, security agencies can explore using counter-drone drones which engage the enemy devices on one-to-one basis and try to overpower/crash them. The use of high-powered laser beams, capable of destroying drones from a distance, possibility of using nets for the rogue drones, training eagles to intercept enemy drones and firing projectiles at them were also mentioned.For the use of drones by citizens and private companies, India already has a policy in place which says no unmanned aircraft system can be used unless it is registered by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The rule came into effect in March this year through a gazette notification.According to the March notification, the Centre has also sought to establish Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management system in the Indian airspace.Sameer Patil, fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said: “Our adversaries – China and Pakistan – have developed, procured and already deployed armed drones... India must strengthen its defences by deploying anti-drone systems. Time is of essence when it comes to building counter-capabilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-expedited-search-for-drone-tech-before-attack-101626113928804.html
13-07-2021||India||4 days, four ‘tomorrow’ predictions by IMD, but southwest monsoon yet to arrive||On Monday, the monsoon missed yet another date with Delhi, and the India Meteorological Department got another forecast wrong.Since July 9, IMD has promised an onset over the Capital, where rainfall so far in the June-September southwest monsoon is 67% deficient, “in the next 24 hours”.And each time, the 24 hours have come and gone with no sight of the monsoon. Sure, Monday saw some clouds over the city early in the morning, and a stiff easterly breeze blowing -- but till evening there was no sign of rain.But IMD continued to hope.At around 5pm on Monday, its official Twitter account predicted a thunderstorm with “light to moderate intensity rain and gusty winds” over isolated “places of Delhi, north Delhi, northeast Delhi, southeast Delhi, and east Delhi”.It followed up, a few minutes later with another tweet predicting “thunderstorm with light to moderate intensity rain and winds with speed of 20-40 km/hr” in “few places” in “south, southwest, New Delhi...”.The thunderstorms never came.Earlier, at 8.15 am, IMD said: “Conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over Delhi…today, the 12th July.”But the 3.30pm bulletin didn’t even mention Delhi.“In association with the continued prevalence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal in the lower levels since past three days, enhanced cloud cover and scattered to fairly widespread rainfall during past 24 hours, the south-west monsoon has further advanced and covered most parts of Rajasthan and Punjab and some more parts of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh today, the 12 July 2021. IMD is continuously monitoring further progress of the monsoon into remaining parts of the country,” the second bulletin said.On Monday, amid all this the skies over Delhi changed from cloudy to sunny to clear (but not rainy) -- a progression captured by people on social media. As of Monday, the monsoon is already delayed by 16 days over Delhi, the most it has been since 2002, when it was 22 days late. An independent meteorologist shared a GIF from the cult movie Lagaan where Amir Khan and other characters look up for rain clouds.On July 8, IMD forecast in its bulletin that monsoon was likely to make an onset over Delhi on July 10 raising the hopes of Delhi’s residents who have added the term heat-bulb temperature to their lexicon this year (to reflect the sweltering heat caused by a combination of high temperatures and humidity levels). All subsequent bulletins since July 9 to July 11 announced that monsoon would make an onset in the “next 24 hours” .Then, maybe, as an independent meteorologist seemed to suggest, maybe the monsoon winds are already here over the capital -- minus the rains.“The only reason preventing the declaration of the monsoon’s arrival in New Delhi in recent days is the absence of rainfall. The monsoon winds have reached the city, but they are not carrying sufficient moisture to trigger thunderstorms. Furthermore, there is no monsoon low-pressure system over eastern or central India, which could have boosted the monsoon’s progression in the remaining parts of northwest India,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom.But IMD should have still been able to predict this.“Thunderstorms will form only when the meteorological situation is totally favourable. If it is not ideal, say due to the lack of moisture, weather models will fluctuate, resulting in forecasting pitfalls. However, meteorologists should be able to detect such pitfalls through a careful and regular assessment of all factors, and exercise caution when thunderstorms appear uncertain during a period,” Deoras added.On Monday, M Mohapatra, director general, IMD only said: “The forecast for Delhi has been modified. Please see the new forecast.” The new afternoon forecast did not mention Delhi.IMD scientists said they strictly follow the criteria that it should rain before monsoon onset is announced. “We cannot announce the onset before it rains. There is cloud formation but the prime criteria for onset is rain. It has rained only in Aya Nagar, some parts of south Haryana and southeast Punjab. We are monitoring the conditions and we hope that monsoon will make an onset soon,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.He also defended IMD.“If you notice that we have been making monsoon onset forecasts for several places in the past few days. Not only Delhi. Monsoon has already covered 80% of the area for which forecasts had been issued. Only Delhi and a small area to its west is left.”While responding to questions raised by journalists on errors in monsoon forecast for Delhi, Sunitha Devi, IMD’s in charge for cyclones said on July 10: “As an operational meteorologist for the past 22 years, let me tell you with all humility that it will take still many more years to improve the predictability of tropical weather beyond a few days of actionable accuracy. It is highly complex and that is why we are keeping constant monitoring and frequent updates. This is more or less the same case even with mid latitude countries, where the weather systems are quite well defined and move from land to Sea, where monitoring is rather easy and numerical models can incorporate the physics in a better manner.”Later on Monday, while responding to HT’s queries, she said: “Monsoon winds are all over the country. Over Delhi also there are easterly winds and clouds but the clouds haven’t made rain. Its because the instability required for rain development is not there. The lower level convergence of winds is also not happening. The monsoon trough is to the south compared to its normal position which is why Maharashtra recorded 34 cm rain in the past 24 hours. Such changes can happen in forecasting. Every forecast will not be exact.”In a statement on Monday evening, IMD said, “Such type of failure by numerical models in prediction of monsoon advance over Delhi is rare and uncommon. It is needless to mention that IMD has predicted well with high accuracy about the advance of monsoon over Delhi quite accurately in the recent past years and also the advance of monsoon over different parts of the country during the monsoon 2021 accurately about four to five days ahead. IMD is monitoring the situation continuously and will provide the regular updates on advance of monsoon into remaining parts of northwest India including Delhi.”The only silver lining to Monday’s touch of grey: the northern limit of monsoon which was stationary passing through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar since June 19 moved slightly to Jaisalmer, Nagaur, Bharatpur, Aligarh, Karnal and Ganganagar. The NLM is the northernmost limit of monsoon up to which it has advanced on any given day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-days-four-tomorrow-predictions-by-imd-but-southwest-monsoon-yet-to-arrive-in-capital-101626113868734.html
13-07-2021||India||Lightning strikes have killed 74 people in 24 hours: An explainer||At least 74 people have been killed in lightning strikes in the past 24 hours in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Of these, 11 are visitors who were killed on Sunday when lightning struck them at Amer Fort near Jaipur.The numbers may seem high but should not surprise anyone.Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning strikes (usually in the pre-monsoon and monsoon months) are the single-largest killers among natural disasters (extreme weather events) in India, according to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Lightning strikes have killed at least 2,000 people every year in India since 2004, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said last month in an awareness workshop on lightning strikes.In 2019, there were 2,876 deaths due to lightning strikes, compared to fewer than 1,500 on an average, annually, between 1968 and 2004. There was a brief period of three to four years in between when lightning strikes killed more than 1,500 people, but the larger trend held.The disaster management division of ministry of home affairs is yet to update the data on lightning deaths for 2020.According to a paper published in Elsevier journal, Weather and Climate Extremes by the ministry of earth sciences titled “An assessment of long-term changes in mortalities due to extreme weather events in India: A study of 50 years’ data, 1970–2019”, the mortality rate of tropical cyclones reduced by 94% over a 20 year period, whereas that for heatwaves and lightning, increased by 62.2% and 52.8%, respectively.Monsoon break created conditions for killer strikesNormally, lightning strikes are high in frequency during the pre-monsoon season, and when the monsoon is about to make an onset over Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states. This is the time when moisture levels increase, and the surface temperature is high, creating favourable conditions for development of thunder clouds.This year, however, there have been massive lightning strikes and associated casualty in mid-July, mainly due to the long monsoon “break” when surface temperatures were very high in the absence of rain.“There has been around a ten-day break in monsoon. There has been significant surface heating during this period. As the monsoon is reviving, moisture levels have also increased. This is the most favourable condition for development of thunder clouds and collision of ice particles which leads to charging and lightning strikes,” explained SD Pawar, project director, Thunderstorm Dynamics, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.Thunder clouds require heat and moisture to form. They are also required to be deep, around nine to 10 kilometres for collision of ice particles to take place. And that’s what is happening now.Why are we seeing a spike in lightning strikes in recent years?According to Pawar, the spike in lightning strikes can certainly be linked to the climate crisis.“Both surface temperature and moisture levels have increased significantly in recent years. Urbanisation leading to loss of tree cover also contributes to the rise in surface temperature. We think the two have mainly contributed to rise in incidence of lightning. The rise in deaths due to lightning can be because more people are outdoors and possibly exposed to lightning in recent years,” Pawar added.Lightning mortalities are only going to increase in coming years. “Climate projections indicate that temperature and moisture will increase further in the future,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).“The use of electrical appliances has also increased significantly in the past 30 years, from mobile phones to TVs to power lines. Lightning can interfere with their electromagnetic field,” M Mohapatra, director general, IMD, said during the workshop last month.How can deaths be prevented?IMD’s Damini app provides area specific lightning warnings, but lightning is an extremely localised phenomenon, and the warnings often don’t reach the last mile. However, one can do certain things in the event of a lightning strike to save one’s life, such as going to a safe structure but avoiding medal constructions and sheetings and finding shelter in low-lying areas that aren’t flooded. Crouching with your arms and legs together, not lying flat on the ground to make yourself a wider target, and keeping away from utility lines (phone, power sockets, etc) as well as medal fences, trees (they conduct electricity) and hilltops are some other ways to keep safe during such an event. Rubber soled shoes and car tyres, however, do not offer protection from lighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lightning-strikes-have-killed-40-people-in-24-hours-an-explainer-101626085783516.html

13-07-2021||Today's||How the US lost the plot in Afghanistan||After two decades, United States (US) President Joe Biden has announced the end of the US’s military mission in Afghanistan by August 31. This decision was not unanticipated, even if the timing and extent of the drawdown were deliberated until the last minute. Even now, the details of US military assistance to Afghanistan and the presence of regional intelligence and counterterrorism assets remain uncertain.The US was initially motivated after the 9/11 attacks to defeat al-Qaeda, then based in Afghanistan, and ensure that the Taliban regime could no longer harbour international terrorists. The subsequent intervention resulted in over 2,400 US military deaths, some 20,000 US troops injured, and over $776 billion spent between 2001 and 2019 according to the Pentagon. Although al-Qaeda was diminished and Osama bin Laden killed, the Taliban has returned and shows little intention of renouncing violence or reforming its core ideology.The US misadventure in Afghanistan did not necessarily have to end this way. The initial US troop commitment after 2001 was small, and despite important military engagements in Nangarhar and Paktia provinces, the 2003 intervention in Iraq soon diverted resources. With only 8,000 troops on the ground, the US began focusing on reconstruction while delegating more security responsibilities to allied North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces. After 2006, Washington’s relations with allies and the Afghan government grew strained amid a Taliban resurgence.In some ways, the real war began after 2009, as the US forces drew down from Iraq. The result was a carrots and sticks approach; the swelling to over 60,000 US troops in Afghanistan (with another 30,000 committed during the “surge”) coupled with greater economic assistance to Pakistan. The focus turned to east of the Durand Line. These years saw fighting between NATO and Pakistani forces at Salala, intensified violence along the Afghan-Pakistan border, and the killing of bin Laden in Abbottabad.But rather than the US pressing its advantage, the 2011-2013 period marked another period of transition. After bin Laden’s killing, President Barack Obama announced the beginning of a troop withdrawal, intra-Afghan negotiations restarted, former president and peace negotiator Burhanuddin Rabbani was assassinated by the Taliban, and Pakistan boycotted the second Bonn Conference. By 2013, the US and NATO handed over primary security responsibilities to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), and the US military limited itself to training and special operations missions. This period also saw a focus on decapitation strikes, including that of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour near Quetta in 2016.Although Donald Trump initially announced a redoubling of efforts in 2017, amid increasing suicide bombings in Kabul and the growing profile of the Islamic State, he subsequently reversed course, indicating his preference for a US withdrawal before the 2020 elections. That year, the US signed an agreement with the Taliban and facilitated intra-Afghan negotiations.In hindsight, a number of conclusions can be drawn. The first is that, other than the period between 2009 and 2012, the US was unwilling to make major security commitments, especially at times when it held the initiative. The distraction of Iraq, wasteful aid efforts, and hasty transfers to NATO and the ANSF proved complicating rather than complementary.Secondly, strategic decisions were held hostage to political timelines – notably the US presidential elections in 2012, 2016, and 2020 – although such considerations cannot be completely circumvented in a competitive democracy.A third was that the adverse role of Pakistan, which harboured the Haqqani Network, Quetta Shura, and al Qaeda leadership, was never fully acknowledged due to logistical necessities (particularly given fraught US relations with Iran and Russia), concern about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons, and the belief that the Pakistan Army and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) could be cajoled or coerced into cooperation. There was also a good deal of wilful ignorance on the part of Washington when it came to Pakistan, although 20 years of bitter experience have certainly left an unfavourable imprint.For India, the writing on the wall was apparent by 2018, when Trump’s reversal confirmed that a complete US withdrawal was only a matter of time. India is among Afghanistan’s largest donors, trade partners, and capacity-builders but its efforts remain contingent upon local security. The conditions are adverse. An Indian security presence on the ground is politically untenable (and undesirable for Kabul), while India’s geographical access is limited except via air, Iran, or possibly Central Asia.Although the US was initially discouraging of an Indian role in Afghanistan, challenges of coordination remained even after it changed tack. For example, India’s attempts at establishing lines of communication were complicated by US-led sanctions against Iran and Russia, and the provision of Russian equipment to Kabul by India did not align with US military assistance.With all these considerations in mind, the near future will necessitate economic and technical assistance insofar as local conditions allow; military assistance that could include further equipment and training; coordination with international partners from Washington to Tehran to Moscow; and outreach to an ever widening spectrum of Afghan political leaders as the Taliban’s resurgence continues. Nature, after all, abhors a vacuum. A US withdrawal spells a period of certain turbulence for India’s regional environment.Dhruva Jaishankar is executive director of ORF-AmericaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-the-us-lost-the-plot-in-afghanistan-101626182634177.html
13-07-2021||Today's||Bar Council’s social media rules are regressive. Adopt the reformative approach||The Bar Council of India (BCI), the chief regulator of Indian lawyers, is once again embroiled in a controversy. The regulator is often caught between the conflicting interests of the judiciary, bar associations across the country and the ministry of law and justice. Proposed regulatory changes by one group are met with severe attacks by other groups or questioned in courts. The recent amendment to the BCI rules, introduced at the behest of the Supreme Court (SC), is no exception to this rule and has met severe backlash by bar associations.On June 25, 2021, the BCI issued a notification amending the Bar Council of India Rules via insertion of two novel sections (V and VA) in Part-VI, Chapter II (popularly called the “BCI Social Media Rules”). Failure to observe the newly laid down professional standard would amount to misconduct resulting in disciplinary proceedings. The amendment was made with “a view to maintain and improve the standards of professional conduct and etiquette for Advocates”.Also Read | Madras HC issues notices to Centre, Bar Council on constitution of disciplinary committeeThe stated rationaleThe intention of the amended law, as clarified by the BCI chairman through a press release dated June 30, 2021, is to weed out “black sheeps” (sic) and “undeserving elements” from the Bar who misuse social and electronic media and undermine the reputation of the legal profession in the eyes of the general public.The amended rules forbid lawyers from doing anything unlawful and from making statements against any court, judge, or bar council in print, electronic or social media which may be “indecent or derogatory, defamatory or motivated, malicious or mischievous”. Moreover, as per the amended rules, lawyers in defiance of any resolution or order of a bar council will also suffer the same fate.Section V-A similarly prohibits members of bar councils from making any statement, criticising publicly, or publishing a press release in any of the above mentioned formats against any resolution/order/decision of the applicable bar council or the BCI, or use of derogatory or abusive language against bar councils or their office-bearers or members.Pursuant to disciplinary proceedings, lawyers and members of bar councils found guilty can be amongst other things, suspended, removed from membership, reprimanded, removed from the roll of advocates, or disqualified from contesting elections of any bar association or council. The amendment makes an exception for healthy and bona fide criticism made in good faith.The challengeThe amended rules have been challenged in SC on grounds of being violative of constitutionally-guaranteed fundamental rights specially equality rights (under Article 14), freedom of speech and expression and to form associations (under Articles 19 (1) (a) and 19 (1) (c)), and the right to life (under Article 21).In response to the strong backlash, BCI has constituted a committee to review and seek consultations from lawyers and lawyer associations on the said rules. Until a report is submitted by the committee, considered and acted upon, the amended rules have been put on abeyance.The process of seeking public consultation post-introduction of rules and their abeyance is indicative of poor rule-making regulatory abilities. Moreover, the amendment is problematic, from a regulatory governance perspective that examines not only the correctness of regulatory action but also the appropriateness of tools chosen by the regulatory body to achieve an objective.If we examine the BCI social media rules through this prism, there are two major areas of concerns.The possibility of arbitrariness The first is with regard to compliance and enforcement.The amendment categorises “indecent or derogatory, defamatory or motivated, malicious or mischievous” speech as professional misconduct. While the meaning of the terms “defamatory” and “obscenity” can be found under law, there is no standard or test for defining or determining “derogatory, malicious and motivated” speech. For example, the law of defamation comprising of libel and slander, is well-defined. Similarly, the test and scope of indecent and obscene content can be found in sections 292 to 296 of the Indian Penal Code and laid down case laws such as the SC’s decision in the case of Ranjit D. Udeshi v state of Maharashtra. Instances of mischievous speech are also defined under section 505 of the IPC.Usage of vague and undefined terms in law may have the unintended consequence of non-uniform compliance and enforcement of the law, giving rise to arbitrariness in decision-making in the disciplining process of lawyers. Legislative clarity simplifies regulatory burden by ensuring uniform compliance wherein the expectation of the regulator on required standard of conduct is obvious not only to the regulator itself but also to the regulated and the public.Moreover, given the burden of implementing these standards falls on the multiple state bar councils and their disciplinary committees, without adequate regulatory or judicial guidance, uniform enforcement of the law would be an exercise in boiling the ocean.Educational versus disciplinary approachThe second concern is related to the choice of regulatory instrument.The rationale offered in support of the legal profession disciplinary system is that it ensures protection of the community and maintains the integrity of the profession. The disciplinary mechanism cures market imperfections such as information asymmetry, the free rider problem, and externalities. Market imperfections such as external cost to society that may be incurred from unethical conduct or self-serving conduct of lawyers are curtailed by this process.While the BCI’s intention to reform the standard of the profession by taking unethical lawyer behaviour on social media seriously is to be applauded, the behaviour can be modelled through practices that are educational in nature vis-à-vis the disciplinary mechanism approach currently adopted.Many bar authorities in foreign Common Law jurisdictions have issued ethical guidelines to direct lawyers’s use of social media. The New York State Bar Association for example, has advised lawyers on a range of matters relating to online behaviour such as maintenance of client confidentiality, avoidance of false and misleading statements and mindful use of social media and online commentary that may have a bearing on professional reputations.Similarly, the Law Institute of Australia’s Guidelines on Ethical Use of Social Media, that have been endorsed by Australian professional regulators such as the Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner, advice lawyers to ensure that their statements expressed online do not amount to contempt of court or make adverse or demeaning comments about judicial officers and fellow members of the legal profession as those could diminish public confidence in the administration of justice.While guidelines may be unenforceable, their purpose is to educate and guide behaviour of regulated persons. They are easier to communicate and impose a lesser burden on regulatory capacity. The use of social media by the legal profession is a recent phenomenon and legal profession regulators around the world are still grappling to comprehend its merits and demerits.BCI must therefore educate lawyers on its ethical use rather than impose disciplinary sanctions for vague, undefined reasons with possibility for arbitrariness in decision-making. Punishment for misconduct without education would be a regressive than a reformative regulatory step.Dakshina Chandra is a fellow at the Regulatory Governance Project, National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, conducting research in the field of regulatory governance.

13-07-2021||Today's||The potential of India’s circular economy||Can India aspire to build a circular economy unicorn? Some might argue that India is naturally a circular economy. It might seem that we recycle everything. In reality, we are confronted with an exponentially growing waste problem. Herein lies the challenge and the opportunity.Recycling has three drivers: Need, responsibility, and wealth. In India, we are driven by need — conserve and reuse to save money. As incomes rise, behaviour could tilt towards throwaway choices. Responsibility requires that, by understanding the impact of our choices, we reduce our footprint. Finally, recognition of business opportunities could drive efforts that go beyond individual action towards wealth creation from recycling and reuse.As economies evolve, we see these different drivers taking hold. For instance, in 2015, India produced 9% but consumed 5% of global plastic (signs of low per capita consumption as well as recycling). But recycling rates for e-waste in 2020 were just 11.7% in largely developing Asia compared to 42.5% in Europe. (Our research finds that 44% of India’s critical minerals could be sourced from e-waste, a multibillion dollar opportunity.) While Europeans are not less consumerist, they have tapped into generating wealth from waste.Also Read | Waste processing: Awareness drive to promote dumping at recently opened hubsAre Indian companies shifting consumers from an informal reliance on the need to recycle towards a formal leveraging of responsibility, thereby creating wealth? I spoke to three firms, at different scales, to understand the larger economy and policy landscape around the sector.One, innovation is key, and startups in the circular economy need innovation in product and process. Hyderabad-based Banyan Nation has developed a plastic washing technology using which recycled plastic can substitute for virgin plastic in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries. This is a change from informal recycling that produces mixed-grade recycled plastic, which companies cannot use. Last year, its product was used to manufacture more than 200 million bottles for a major FMCG multinational company.Ecoware (with a factory in Greater Noida) treats sugarcane bagasse to make food-grade packaging containers. In its 10-year journey, it claims to have displaced more than 300 million pieces of single-use plastic. Bengaluru-based Bare Necessities, working against the “plastic pandemic”, has converted its minimalist living philosophy into dozens of personal care, home care and lifestyle products, challenging a chemicals-laden industry with alternatives.In each case, process innovation has been necessary to source raw material, segregate, control quality, or manage delivery logistics.Two, informing clients is crucial. Each firm invested in educating potential clients and reassuring customers that their products were safe and certified. From explaining what biodegradable means to offering online courses on sustainable living, these startups have tapped into a consumer sentiment that is questioning chemical ingredients and carbon footprint. One entrepreneur observed, “Waste is personal that you have control over.”One firm developed a data platform, digitising thousands of informal recyclers, to trace its supply chain so that customers could be confident that there has been no polymer contamination. Another saw the opportunity to reach out to hospitals and offer biodegradable medical disposables. In the absence of effective standards in India, these startups must invest in getting certified in developed countries. Although expensive, this is critical for product and quality differentiation.Three, angels aren’t enough. Tech investors and social enterprise incubators stepped in when they saw promise. Sometimes, it was chance encounters, say when the head of Social Alpha heard the founder of Bare Necessities speak at an event. Ecoware got investor attention when it was recognised by Barclays-backed Unreasonable Impact (it is now exporting to 15 countries). Banyan Nation has scaled to a level where it has already raised several million dollars and is looking for more.Two challenges persist. One entrepreneur told me, “In India, we have angels and then private equity. We have a void of venture capitalists (for scaling the business before one’s equity gets diluted).” Another complained, “Banks are not in the picture. Loans are too small; it would take weeks to get emergency working capital during the pandemic.” A third said, “Debt is just three years’ balance sheet and collateral.” With no soft loans, startups in the circular economy are excluded from bank credit.Four, policy isn’t helping yet. The announced ban on single-use plastics has not been followed through. Policy could mandate an increasing share of recycled plastic in FMCG industries (just like policy mandated renewable purchase obligations for power utilities). Mandatory disclosures could ensure that the plastics value chain becomes cleaner. Products face high Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates because there is no distinction between a sustainable product and one with a large environmental footprint. Since agri-waste does not have GST, businesses are unable to offset GST payments further down the value chain. The absence of enabling policies keeps circular economy businesses small-scale, often informal, uncertified and undifferentiated.And finally, the idea of growth needs redefinition. Rather than repeat sales of unsustainable products to meet quarterly targets, entrepreneurs in the circular economy believe in other definitions of growth: Replicable, scalable models; minimalist lifestyles; women’s entrepreneurship; gender-sensitive employment; and including informal enterprises in formal value chains.The circular economy cannot be restricted to cocktail conversations. India has immense resources — people, capital, supply chains and scale — to find value in waste. A billion-dollar-valued circular economy unicorn can indeed emerge if technology, finance, policy and behavioural change could create markets where none existed.Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-potential-of-india-s-circular-economy-101626178133779.html
13-07-2021||Today's||To protect personal liberty, enforce standardised parameters on bail||The death of 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy in custody has rekindled the debate on the scope of pre-trial detention. This had gained steam in May, too, when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested four Trinamool Congress leaders in the Narada scam case.These debates have been entangled in a political quagmire. However, as the Supreme Court (SC) had repeatedly reminded CBI during the Narada matter, all such debates fundamentally rest on the principles of bail jurisprudence.“Bail is the rule, and jail is an exception” is an oft-quoted phrase. If that is so, why do prosecuting agencies tend to arrest, and why are courts hesitant to promptly enforce the primacy of personal liberty (right from the stage of anticipatory bail to remand under Section 167, Code of Criminal Procedure, and subsequently, bail)?The courts have often stressed that personal liberty is humankind’s most valuable possession, and the law of bail has to find the balance between two conflicting demands — shielding society from criminals, and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.Also Read | Anti-terror law should not be used to quell dissent: SC judge DY ChandrachudThis assumes significance since, as data from National Crime Records Bureau has shown, there is a huge mismatch between the number of those who are arrested, those accused who are charge-sheeted, and finally those who are convicted. In nearly two-thirds of all cases, innocent persons stand the chance of being thrown in jail.It was in 1959, at the New Delhi Conference on the Rule of Law, that the rights of an accused were identified. These included the presumption of innocence, and power of arrest and detention pending trial to be exercised only within strict limits. The prosecuting agencies and courts must be guided by these principles as they form the core of the rule of law.The unfettered power of the prosecuting agencies to make indiscriminate arrests has also been recognised as a source of corruption. An attempt was made to keep this in check through the introduction of Section 41A in CrPC by prescribing legislative guidelines for making arrests in certain offences. In 2014, the SC also laid down exhaustive guidelines on this.Post-arrest, the first judicial intervention takes place when an accused is produced before a magistrate for remand. The reality is that due to the sheer volume of work, this judicial exercise has become almost mechanical. In almost all cases, police remand of the accused is ordered without examining the need for such detention.At the stage of the consideration of bail matters, largely, subjective discretion is exercised by the courts. In the 1978 case of Gudikanti Narasimhulu, Justice VR Krishna Iyer recognised the grey area of pre-trial bail and noticed that it “largely hinges on the hunch of the bench, otherwise called judicial discretion”. Recognising that personal liberty is too precious a value in India’s constitutional system, he stated, “To glamorize impressionistic orders as discretionary may, on occasions, make a litigative gamble decisive of a fundamental right.”Deprivation of the liberty of an individual is a serious matter. Accused persons spend a long time in jail, only to be proved innocent after lengthy trials in several cases.Therefore, it is imperative to uniformly enforce pre-trial detention only within strict limits governed by factors such as the probability of fleeing from justice, the likelihood of tampering with evidence including intimidation of witnesses, the gravity of the offence and the propensity to indulge in criminal activities while on bail.Sensitising magistrates on the importance of zealous scrutiny of remand applications and monitoring by superior courts will go a long way towards achieving the constitutional goal of protecting personal liberty. The discretion exercised along standardised parameters will bring certainty and fairness in the judicial system, and is, therefore, the need of the hour.NR Elango is a senior advocate and DMK MP in the Rajya Sabha.
