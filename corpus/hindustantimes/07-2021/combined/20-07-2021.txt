A large number of couples separate each year while many women end their lives due to harassment or are killed for dowry etc. To bring down such incidents, the police will now not only counsel but also provide free legal advice to women, besides giving them information about their rights.Personnel posted at the Women’s Help Desk will be called to the one-stop centre for training. The women personnel will observe the way in which women in distress are helped and will follow the same process at help desks at police stations. After primary assistance to women in distress by the help desk, disputes will be referred to the Sakhi centre where they will be disposed of by trained women cops.IG Range KP Singh said for a solution to their problems, women often have to run to both the counselling centre and one-stop centre. Now, women will be given all solutions and help in one place. At the Sakhi centre, women will be counselled, given medical attention, if needed, and information about government schemes like widow pension, etc. Women complainants will also be given information about their rights. Police will distribute handbills regarding the new initiative, a decision taken recently by senior police officials along with district probationary officer Pankaj Mishra and one-stop centre authorities.This year, 37 cases of murder of women, 83 cases of rape, 296 cases of molestation, 610 cases of women harassment and 69 cases of dowry deaths have been reported so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sakhi-one-stop-centre-for-all-assistance-to-women-101626805776387.html
20-07-2021||Mumbai||CET syllabus biased, parents, ICSE schools tell Maharashtra school edu minister||A day after the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) released a circular announcing the date and curriculum for the upcoming common entrance test (CET) for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) courses, students from other school education boards are a worried lot. Parents, as well as ICSE school groups, have approached the state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad calling the CET exam unfair to those students from boards other than the Maharashtra state board.“We are aware that the CET exam will be conducted based on the state board Class 10 curriculum and equal weightage will be given to subjects of English, maths, science and social sciences. However, in ICSE board students have the option of dropping maths and science in Class 9 and 10, so how do our students prepare for this exam?” stated a letter addressed to minister Varsha Gaikwad by the association of ICSE schools in Maharashtra. Gaikwad, however, was unavailable for comments.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards were scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. While the other boards are yet to announce results, MSBSHSE released SSC results on Friday, July 16. According to the circular released by the state board on Monday, an optional CET exam based solely on the SSC syllabus and consisting of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks will be conducted. This two-hour paper will be conducted in physical mode on August 21 from 11am to 1pm and registrations for this exam has started from today.Last month, a Class 10 ICSE student also approached the Bombay high court seeking help in this matter. The student’s petition points out the ‘bias’ against students of other boards and the added stress for students. This matter is up for its second hearing on July 22 and parents as well as ICSE schools are hoping for relief.Similarly, Members of International Schools Association (MISA) has also approached Gaikwad seeking clarity on whether Class 10 exam scores of students from the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) board can be considered, instead of CET scores at the time of FYJC admission. “Unlike other Class 10 students, our children appeared for their exams in physical mode despite rising fear of Covid. Therefore, these students should be allowed to seek admissions based on their exam score,” said MISA in a letter addressed to Gaikwad. They’ve also sought clarity on whether IGCSE students who do appear for the CET will have the choice to choose between their board score and CET score, whichever is higher, at the time of admission. “It’ll be unfair to not give students a level playing field. We have requested that the education minister hold a meeting with all stakeholders to understand the issue better,” said Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parent Association (IWPA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cet-syllabus-biased-parents-icse-schools-tell-maharashtra-school-edu-minister-101626805055555.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||Rain continues for second day in Delhi, triggers waterlogging, snarls||The monsoon rain continued for the second consecutive day on Tuesday in the national capital, triggering water-logging, and a repeat of the snarls and chaos on Monday. Light rain is likely to continue on Wednesday as well, the weather forecasters said, with patchy rain expected thereafter in some parts. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Safdarjung observatory, which is taken as representative of the city weather, between 8.30am and 5.30pm recorded 6.3mm (to be updated by 9pm) rain. On Monday, after a week of hot and humid conditions, Delhi received its first heavy spell of rainfall this monsoon, which reached the city on July 13 after a delay of 16 days. Meanwhile, the Palam weather station recorded 29.3mm rain while Lodhi Road got 6.7mm, Aya Nagar received 13.4mm and Ridge got 4.2mm rain during the day. These stations also received overnight and early morning showers. The 24-hour rainfall count for Palam was 67.6mm. while Ridge, Lodhi Road and Aya Nagar stations received 47mm, 34.1mm and 39.8mm 24-hour rainfall, respectively.IMD officials said the continuous showers kept the day temperature below normal. The maximum temperature was 31.9 degrees Celsius (°C), three notches below normal for this time of the year. The minimum settled at 24°C, three degrees below the season’s normal. “Light rain is likely to continue in Delhi and the surrounding region on Wednesday as well. Thereafter, patchy rain will continue in some parts of the city. The rainfall activity is likely to pick up again on July 23 and July 26 when moderate showers are expected,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD’s head of regional weather forecasting centre.He said though July is likely to see more rain, the capital city gets most of its yearly rainfall in August . “This is because the monsoon trough and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, the two primary conditions for rainfall, are more favourable during that time for Delhi,” said Srivastava.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), of private weather forecasting company Skymet, said Delhi is likely to receive patchy and light rain on Wednesday as well. He said on Tuesday, Delhi had covered its rainfall deficit, which stood at 3% on Monday evening.“The high moisture content in the air will result in continued rain on Wednesday but the forecast says the intensity of showers will increase now by July 23,” Palawat said.The moderate to heavy rainfall resulted in traffic jams on Wednesday, with motorists having to navigate through waterlogged roads. Delhi traffic police said traffic moved slow along Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ring Road (near Moti Bagh, AIIMS and Defence Colony), Dwarka Road, Dhaula Kuan, Rao Tula Ram Marg, Rajouri Garden, Janakpuri (near metro station and near block- C2B) Dabri Mor, Azadpur Chowk, Pul Prahladpur, Lajpat Nagar (towards Ashram Chowk), MB Road and Anand Parbat traffic signal. Besides key stretches, many residential colonies also saw waterlogging including Greater Kailash, Dwarka, Malviya Nagar, Dakshinpuri, Chhatarpur Enclave,Mahavir Nagar, Basant Lok market (near Vasant Vihar), Okhla, Zakhira and VikasMarg, among others. According to officials in the three municipal corporations of south, north and east, at least 23 trees across the city were uprooted in the downpour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rain-continues-for-second-day-in-delhi-triggers-waterlogging-snarls-101626804937858.html

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Is Congress a factory of churning out courageous workers: Sena||Days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the party doesn’t need people who are afraid but wanted fearless people within its fold, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana yet again targeted its alliance partner asking if the party is a factory of churning out courageous workers if the ones who are afraid keep quitting the grand old party. It criticised Congress saying that it is a “confused” party on what it wants to do and about its direction.Gandhi’s remarks were targeted at former Congress leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada, who were known to be close to Gandhi but quit the party to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gandhi, while addressing social media workers last Friday, hit out at Congress deserters. He said those in the party, who are scared of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), should leave the party and “enjoy” their company, while the party should induct people who have the courage to fight the RSS.“Whether one is in power or not, people who dedicate themselves fully, keep the party and organisation alive. Congress does not have such people in several states. Priyanka Gandhi will defeat [the ruling party], but workers need to be energised. What Rahul Gandhi said that there is no place for cowards in Congress, is true. But if these cowards keep quitting the Congress, then is Congress a factory to churn out courageous workers, that needs to be seen,” the editorial remarked. The mouthpiece also compared the BJP-RSS cadre with the Congress’, saying that RSS did not have cadre during the freedom struggle, but Congress had several leaders. Now, Congress does not have such people in several states, the editorial added. It further said that Congress’ contribution to the freedom movement is huge, and it had many leaders who took part in the struggle without any fear. “Such courage was not shown by the Sangh or others during the freedom movement. But such leaders are not there in Congress today. The scenario has changed, and the Congress is struggling for its existence,” it added. In an apparent suggestion to the Congress leadership, the editorial said that though Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi can mobilise the crowd, this effort should constant. “Priyanka Gandhi got a good response in Uttar Pradesh a few days ago. When Rahul Gandhi takes to the streets, there is a crowd around him. But there must be continuity in this struggle. If the momentum stops, then there is a chance for stagnation. How will the Congress or secular parties get strengthened by attacking the Sangh Parivar?” asked the editorial. It further stated that BJP is nothing without RSS. “There could be a difference of opinion about Sangh’s ideology but the work they are doing in some of the sectors cannot be ignored. The work of pracharaks and swayamsevaks with dedication cannot be ignored. Congress had such workers earlier. Today, Shiv Sena has such workers. A party or organisation sustains due to the devoted workers despite not being in power,” it added.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, meanwhile, declined to comment on the editorial. He said, “We do not read Saamana. Sanjay Raut has made it a habit to criticise Congress, but we will discuss this once [within the party] and then respond.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/is-congress-a-factory-of-churning-out-courageous-workers-sena-101626804935490.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||BSES discoms to procure 510 MW green energy to power Delhi||Reliance Infrastructure-led BSES Delhi discoms have signed contracts with Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) to procure 510MW of solar and hybrid power (a mix of solar and wind power) at ₹2.44 per unit and ₹2.48 per unit, respectively, the company said on Tuesday.The cost of power in these contracts is much lower than that of power procured from major thermal or gas-based power plants around Delhi. “This is not only one of the lowest tariffs for renewable energy, but is also priced substantially lower than the average cost of power purchase agreements in general, which are around ₹5.5 per unit. Another major benefit is that a prudent mix of wind and solar power in BSES’s power portfolio will be helpful in effectively meeting Delhi’s power demand,” a BSES spokesperson said. Hybrid power is a bundled mix of solar and wind power, wherein one component is at least 33% of the contracted capacity. In hybrid power, both sources of power are co-located and the pooled power is put into the system at the same point. One of the biggest advantages of hybrid power is the optimum cost utilisation of the power evacuation network and loading of transmission lines as solar power is primarily a day phenomenon and wind, round-the-clock.While solar power will help the discom meet the day’s peak demand, the wind power, sourced from coastal areas, will cater to the night-time peak demand. The contracts have been inked for a period of 25 years. The solar and hybrid power is expected to be available to Reliance Infrastructure led BSES discoms 18 months after the signing of the agreement at a very competitive tariff of ₹2.44 per unit for solar and ₹2.48 per unit for hybrid (including SECI’s trading margin), determined through an e-auction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bses-discoms-to-procure-510-mw-green-energy-to-power-delhi-101626804876094.html

It granted time to the Delhi government till July 27 to decide on the resumption of services.The court was hearing a plea by spa owners, who contended that they were aggrieved by the “inordinate delay” in allowing spa centres to reopen. The plea sought directions to the authorities to decide the matter of reopening spas in Delhi within a week. A lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 15, to control the second and most deadly wave of Covid-19 that raged on till Mid-May. All spas along with malls, bars, gyms, restaurants and shops were closed; but except for spas, all other facilities were allowed to reopen in a staggered manner in June.On Tuesday, Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan informed the court that the file has been sent to the LG for his final decision and sought time from the court.Advocate Manik Dogra, appearing for spa owners, said thousands of employees have been affected by the indefinite closure. He said as a precautionary measure, they were ready to get the staff vaccinated before reopening.The court noted the submissions and posted the matter for further hearing to July 27.The petitioners have also challenged the guidelines issued by the government on June 26, 2021, through Delhi Disaster Management Authority, by virtue of which salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed.referring to an order of the high court, passed on January 14, directing reopening of spas that were closed during the first wave of the pandemic, the petitioners said the slightly higher percentage of risk due to the proximity of the client and the service provider can be obviated by prescribing stricter measures and safeguards rather than continuing to keep such establishments closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-to-decide-on-reopening-of-spas-delhi-govt-tells-high-court-101626804816120.html

Kalra, subsequently, was arrested on May 16 and granted bail on May 29.Justice Rekha Palli questioned the authorities for not having passed a final order yet in pursuance to the show cause notices issued with regard to the two restaurants.“You compel people to come here. You should have passed an order by now. Ultimately, he wants to run them. If he is not entitled in law, please pass an order. What is this – you are involved in an FIR – and that is the end of it?” the judge said.The court granted time to the police to clarify their stand and posted the matter for further hearing to July 30.Kalra, through his counsel, challenged the May 11 show cause notice issued by the joint commissioner of police (licensing) suspending the registration of the two eateries in Khan Market. He was granted an opportunity to submit his reply within 15 days.Appearing for Kalra, senior advocate Maninder Singh argued that he submitted the response on June 9; however, since he did not hear back from the authorities, he again wrote to them on June 17. Till date, officials concerned have neither withdrawn the suspension order nor decided on the show cause notice.Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Tripathi sought time to take instructions in the case.In his petition, Kalra also said the order of suspension was issued without first affording an opportunity to show cause and it is, therefore, punitive and illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/navneet-kalra-moves-hc-challenging-suspension-of-registration-of-khan-chacha-town-hall-101626804757463.html

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress leadership rap for Patole||Upset over Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole’s style of working and remarks, party leader Rahul Gandhi summoned him to Delhi on Tuesday. The reprimand came after Patole’s recent remarks related to leaders from the other two ruling parties led to strong reactions from Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Patole met Gandhi, along with HK Patil, state in-charge of party and KC Venugopal, organisational general secretary. The leadership has reportedly told Patole to refrain from any controversial remarks that would affect the interest of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) of Sena, NCP and Congress. The state unit chief has also been told to refrain from commenting on the alliance between the ruling parties for the forthcoming polls. “Pawar and Thackeray took Patole’s remarks against them very seriously. Pawar conveyed the dismay to the Congress leadership, while Thackeray spoke to Congress president Sonia Gandhi over the entire episode. HK Patil and four other in-charge secretaries submitted their reports to party high command over Patole’s style of working,” said a senior party leader. The leader also said that the central leadership of the party was so upset with Patole that his presidency as state unit chief had come under trouble. Patole has been in the news since he took over as the state unit chief of the party in February with his ‘unguarded’ statements. His announcement of going solo in the local body and Assembly elections made immediately after taking over did not go well with the Sena and NCP. More recently, he stirred a controversy after he said that the chief minister, deputy chief minister and home minister keep a close watch on him as “the two ruling parties cannot swallow the resurrection of the Congress”. In a meeting with party’s local leaders in Lonavala on Saturday, Patole also said that the Sena and NCP backstab Congress when it comes to releasing funds for the local bodies under them. Pawar ridiculed Patole, saying the latter was “a small leader whose comments do not warrant a response”. Thackeray publicly snubbed Patole last month for talking about going solo in the forthcoming elections. Senior Congress leaders too were upset over the remarks by Patole as they were leading to disturbance between the leading parties. They had reportedly complained to HK Patil and senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge during their Mumbai visit last week. After meeting Gandhi, Patole said, “We discussed organisational issues in the wake of the political developments in the state. There is no problem with the MVA combine and the state in Maharashtra will complete its term.” In a U-turn over his stand, Patole said the decision on the alliance between the three parties for the forthcoming local body elections will be taken by the party’s central leadership. Patole also said the MVA government may hold a special session of the state legislature to pass farm laws and hold speaker’s election. “The suggestions on the farm bills tabled in state legislature are expected to be submitted by stakeholders in two months, after which there could be a special session to pass the bills. The same session could see election to the post of Assembly speaker. There is no need to wait for the election till the winter session.” Meanwhile, the Congress is reportedly considering reshuffle of their ministers in the state cabinet. The reshuffle may take place ahead of the winter session, by appointing one of the ministers as the Assembly speaker. Though Patole is vying for a ministerial berth, party high command is said to be against any such move. The reshuffle may happen in the near future as the NCP and Sena too want to fill their vacant berths after the resignation of Anil Deshmukh and Sanjay Rathod as home and forest ministers, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-leadership-rap-for-patole-101626804515558.html
20-07-2021||Other||Theatre doyen Urmil Kumar Thapliyal no more||Lucknow Playwright, author, poet, performer, satirist, theatre personality and a lot more, Urmil Kumar Thapliyal (78) passed away in Lucknow on Tuesday evening. Thapliyal gave everything he had to revive Nautanki in stage plays, said Anil Rastogi, a senior theatre artist and television actor. His death was a huge loss to the theatre world and a big blow to ‘Darpan’ theatre group as he was one of the founding members, Rastogi said. In his last interview to this newspaper in 2019, Thapliyal had said, “Nautanki is one of the treasures of our culture. I have given all and will continue to give my all to save this art form. If only a few artists from this generation stand up for this art form, a lot more can be done to save Nautanki.” Rastogi said, “My regret is that Urmil, who was a part of our upcoming Marathi play Katha, will never be able to perform now.” Born in 1943 in Dhaudhan Mason village in the Garhwal hills of the present-day Uttarakhand, Urmil Kumar Thapliyal began dabbling in theatre at an early age, as an actor in Ramlilas staged in Dehradun and adjoining areas. He learnt Garhwali and Kumaoni folk music during his formative years as an actor-director. He was the founder-director of ‘Darpan’, a theatre group of Lucknow. He relocated to Lucknow in 1965 when he got a job in All India Radio as a newsreader. He completed Ph D in dialectical theatre from Lucknow University which brought him closer to the city as well as to theatre. Thapliyal directed around 140 plays for Darpan and other groups, moulding traditional theatre forms in his productions. Among notable plays written and directed by him are ‘Harishchanner ki Ladai,’ ‘Nagri Nautanki,’ ‘Choon-choon ka Murabba,’ ‘Barkha Bahar,’ ‘Mahasati’, ‘Ladkiyan’, ‘Ek Chawanni Chandi ki’, ‘Shaheedon ne Lau Lagai Jo’, ‘Pyare Harichand ki Kahani Rah Jayegi’ and ‘Bhaunri Katha’ — all produced in the manner of Nautanki. His significant contribution lies, however, in giving a new lease of life to traditional theatre forms such as Nautanki, Swang and Bhagat. Thapliyal was also a prolific writer. Besides drama, he wrote stories, plays and satire published in Hans, Saptahik Hindustan, Dharmayug, and other Hindi periodicals. He also wrote columns in newspapers including Hindustan, as well as a number of radio and television scripts. He worked as chief news reader at the Lucknow station of All India Radio. For his varied work in the field of theatre, Thapliyal was honoured with an award and also a fellowship by the Uttar Pradesh Sangeet Natak Academy. He was given the coveted Yash Bharti award for his immense contributions in the field of theatre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/theatre-doyen-urmil-kumar-thapliyal-no-more-101626804455533.html
20-07-2021||Mumbai||HC asks Thane, Bhiwandi civic chiefs to curb illegal slaughtering on Eid||The Bombay high court (HC) in two different petitions on Tuesday directed the commissioners of Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation (BNMC) and Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to ensure that slaughtering of animals does not take place on Bakri Eid in temporary slaughterhouses and sacrifices be done in licensed slaughterhouses only. The orders were passed after the petitioners expressed apprehension that due to the illegal sale of livestock namely water buffaloes for the sacrificial ritual of the Muslims from July 21-23 in the jurisdiction of the two corporations, there was an imminent possibility of the animals being slaughtered without conforming to the rules and regulations thus putting the lives of the common man at risk. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by NGO Jiv Maitri Trust was informed by advocates Raju Gupta, Hare Krishna Mishra and Mukesh Gupta that through a July 15 order the commissioner of BNMC had permitted the setting up of 38 temporary slaughterhouses. The advocates submitted that the slaughterhouses were sans licenses and hence the order was not in conformity with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughterhouse) Rules. However, advocate NR Bubna representing the civic authority tried to assure the court that the commissioner was aware of the rules and the temporary slaughterhouses would be operational under the supervision of the permanent and licensed slaughterhouses. Bubna added that the order was passed to ensure that sacrifices in public places were avoided and disposal of the waste would be done as per the rules. The court then observed that a deputy commissioner, animal husbandry department had opposed the move of the commissioner and had refused to approve to start a temporary slaughterhouse without obtaining proper permission. “We have no other option to stay the operation of the impugned order and no effect should be given to it without permission of the court. We make it abundantly clear that no slaughters shall be allowed except in those licensed and sanctioned slaughterhouses and in case of violation of relevant laws, strict action is taken by the police,” noted the bench in its order. Meanwhile, the division bench of justice S S Shinde and justice N J Jamadar while hearing a petition filed by NGO Gau Gyan Foundation was informed that a livestock market had been set up in Kausa, Mumbra in the jurisdiction of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). The petitioners contended that they had an apprehension that illegal slaughter of animals would take place in those markets on the day of Eid as neither the municipal authorities nor the police had taken cognizance of the complaints lodged by the NGO. Advocate JS Kini for the petitioner submitted that as the authorities had failed to take cognizance of his clients’ complaints the HC should issue directions to them to ensure that the illegal slaughtering did not take place. After hearing submissions, the bench posted the further hearing to August 6 and noted in the order, “We are of the view that the slaughtering of animals ought to conform with the licenses issued by the competent authorities and specified at designated places and specified hours. Given this, we direct respondent Commissioner of police, Thane to check/ensure no illegal slaughter of animals takes place within the jurisdiction of Mumbra Police station Thane.”Meanwhile, with popular markets in Mumbai closed on the backdrop of Bakri Eid, a huge crowd was witnessed at a section of the APMC market in Kalyan for the purchase of goats a day before Bakri Eid. Around 17,000 goats were stocked at the market for sale ahead of the festival. “We decided to start with online trading of goats as the market in Mumbai were shut, however, the response was poor. People usually chose to come to the market and purchase. At the same time we are ensuring all the lockdown norms are followed,” said Sanjay Ukirde, administrator, Bakri mandai, APMC, Kalyan.

Adani Group, however, has denied shifting the headquarters and called it a “rumour”.Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Vinayak Raut said that the party will not tolerate the attempt to reduce the importance of Mumbai and added that the city airport’s headquarters must remain in the financial capital. Congress alleged that the shifting of the Adani office to Gujarat is indicative of the Modi government, which has shifted many prime projects from Mumbai. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that dandiya played as part of the flash mob at the Mumbai airport recently and the shifting of the office of Adani is a clear message to the people in Maharashtra. “The Modi government has shifted many key projects including International Financial Services Centre, coastal police institute, offices of RBI and Air India, to Gujarat from Maharashtra. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) has also planned to set up an alternative film city in Uttar Pradesh. This is a systematic attempt of reducing the importance of Mumbai and Maharashtra,” he said.Sawant said that this has never been the culture of Congress as it never had extended the discriminating treatment to any of the states. “We have headquarters of many companies here in Maharashtra. Industrialists have been living in the state for years and they have become part and parcel of the state culture. This type of bias was never witnessed in the state,” he said. Sena’s Lok Sabha MP from Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Vinayak Raut said, “The moving of the headquarters is an extremely condemnable matter. This is yet another attempt to reduce Mumbai’s importance and give Ahmedabad more prominence. Instead, they must give Ahmedabad its own identity and not steal from here. This is happening through the Centre, but Shiv Sena will not tolerate this. The party will remain aggressive to keep Mumbai airports’ head office in the city itself.”Adani Airport Holdings Ltd took charge of the Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) a few days back from GVK Group. The company in a tweet through its official handle stated, “In light of rumours that the Mumbai Airport HQ will be moving to Ahmedabad, we unambiguously state that both MIAL and NMIAL Airports will remain headquartered in Mumbai. We reiterate our commitment to make Mumbai proud and create thousands of jobs through our airport ecosystem (sic)”.Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said it is up to the company to decide where they want to set up its headquarters. Mumbai airport and its office are not moving anywhere. “Neither Mumbai airport can be shifted, nor its office. The headquarters of a company can be set up anywhere in the country. Even the headquarters of GVK was not in Mumbai. It is the prerogative of the company to decide,” said Nawab Malik, national spokesperson and minority affairs minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shifting-of-mumbai-airport-hqs-unfair-says-sena-cong-adani-denies-calls-it-rumour-101626804396284.html

All the firms including those dealing with areca nut (supari) have done business transactions worth ₹574 crore in the last few years, officials said.“The biggest revelation has been the detection of three bogus firms engaged in the trade of areca nut. Prima facie, it appears that these firms have been dealing with the illegal consignment of areca nut from northeastern states via West Bengal and sending it to various states across the country including Gujarat, UP and Maharashtra. These non-existent firms have been engaged in generating e-way bills and illegal bill trading,” said a senior tax officer, engaged in the raids. He said these firms seemed to be part of a syndicate of illegal bill trading.“We have alerted customs about these firms and getting inputs from other agencies about the trade of areca nut from other states,” the official added. Following the implementation of goods and services tax ( GST), the commercial tax department has detected the trend of tax evasion by non-existent business firms which apparently act as fronts for clandestine ferrying of goods and claiming ITC (the tax credit availed by the firms after receiving of goods and other conditions for furthering his business).The department officials said these bogus firms come to light only when there is tracking through human intelligence and data analysis by the intelligence wing of the department. “In recent weeks, we have unearthed a large number of fake firms and tracking their actual owner through mobile calls and tax receipts. All the operators of the fake firms would be facing heavy penalty and punitive action,” said another officer.Commissioner cum secretary, commercial taxes department, Dr Pratima said eight firms were detected in today’s raids which failed to show proper book of records and engaged in wrongly claiming ITC. “We are working on revenue leakage and all those involved in clandestine trade would be facing action,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/commercial-taxes-dept-detects-evasion-worth-rs-48-45-crore-in-bihar-101626804277849.html

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra controlled operations of porn racket, says Mumbai Police||A metropolitan magistrate court on Tuesday remanded actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Ripu Sudan aka Raj Kundra and his aide Ryan Thorpe to police custody till July 23 in connection with a pornographic film racket.In its application seeking Kundra’s remand, the Mumbai Police crime branch claimed that the 45-year-old had got a mobile application developed for running a pornographic film racket and used to control its entire operation himself through WhatsApp groups.Kundra, along with one Sourabh Kushwah, according to the remand application, had in February 2019 started a company namely, Arms Prime Media Pvt Ltd. Around six months later, the company developed a mobile phone application, Hotshot, and then sold it to Kenrin Ltd., a London-based entity owned by Kundra’s relative Pardeep Bakshi for $25,000.In December 2019, Kundra resigned from Arms Prime Media, after which, one Sanjay Tripathi, a witness in the case, took it over.The mobile phone application, available only to paid subscribers, was used to upload pornographic content, shot in Mumbai and surrounding areas, police claimed. The remand application added that other accused and witnesses in the case have revealed that the pornographic films shot in Mumbai were transferred to Kenrin, London, from where the obscene content was uploaded on the Hotshot app. Kundra controlled the entire operation of the app through three WhatsApp groups that he had created in the name of “HS,” and that Kundra was the administrator of these WhatsApp groups.The crime branch raided in Kundra’s office in Andheri (West) and have seized incriminating evidence like subscription hits, WhatsApp chats, pornographic clips, agreement papers, emails and account details, said joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambe of the crime branch.Thorpe worked in Kundra’s company as IT head. Kamat had allegedly sent the porn videos to the UK where it was uploaded on Hotshot app. After noticing its contents the Hotshots app was taken down by Apple App Store in June 2020 and was also removed from the Google Play Store in November 2020. We have freezed a total of ₹7.5 crore from the bank accounts of several apps in the case, said Bharambe.Police further claimed that it was through these groups — HS Accounts, HS Take Down and HS Operations — Kundra monitored the content, payments to artists and the revenue generated through the app. Bakshi made the payments based on Kundra’s instructions, the remand application added.Property cell of the Mumbai crime branch has registered a case in connection with the pornographic racket on February 4, 2021, when it raided a bungalow in the Madh area and arrested five persons, including two women engaged in shooting a pornographic film.

The property cell on Tuesday also arrested one Ryan Thorpe, a Nerul resident and an expert in information technology, who allegedly helped maintain the mobile phone application through two of his associates.Both, Kundra and Thorpe, were produced before a metropolitan magistrate court on Tuesday and remanded to police custody till July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raj-kundra-controlled-operations-of-porn-racket-says-mumbai-police-101626804216762.html
20-07-2021||Other||Cong withdraws expulsion of three veterans||Lucknow: The Congress appears to have extended an olive branch to the party’s expelled old guards, withdrawing expulsion of three veterans who, along with seven others, were expelled from the party for indulging in anti-party activities in 2019. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and other party leaders welcomed the three veterans at UPCC headquarters here on Tuesday. The UPCC had expelled 10 senior leaders, including former ministers, for indulging in anti-party activities when they gathered at the residence of their colleagues to celebrate birth anniversary of India’s first prime minister late Jawahar Lal Nehru and former prime minister late Indira Gandhi here on November 14, 2019 and November 19, 2019 respectively. Action to expel them was taken on November 24. This was considered as one of the reasons for an apparent divide between the party’s old guards and Lallu’s team. “Following approval of All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Sonia Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu, the disciplinary committee of Uttar Pradesh Congress has with immediate effect withdrawn expulsion of former legislators Nek Chand Pandey, Bhudhar Narain Mishra and Gajendra Singh Solanki. AICC secretaries Dhiraj Gurjar and Rohit Chaudhary expect from these legislators that they will play an important role in strengthening the Congress in future,” said UPCC spokesman Ashok Singh in a press statement. Priyanka, during her three-day tour to the state capital last week, had given a call to the party’s old guards and the youngsters to join hands to strengthen the party. She had also asked party’s state leaders to withdraw expulsion of old guards. An expelled leader, however, said withdrawal of expulsion of only three veterans in an expelled group of 10 raised a question mark on the entire exercise of taking all sections of the party together. “We all (10 leaders) had gathered to celebrate the birth anniversary of former prime ministers and did not indulge in any party activity. Those expelled included former minister Ram Krishna Dwivedi and he later died following illness. Action against six leaders is yet to be withdrawn. We were asked to tender an apology. Why should we tender any apology when we did not indulge in any indiscipline,” said an expelled leader. When contacted, Lallu said the Congress was reaching out to all the veterans and all those committed to the party would be welcomed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-withdraws-expulsion-of-three-veterans-101626804216107.html
20-07-2021||Mumbai||HC refuses to interfere with Mumbai civic body’s circular for Bakri Eid sacrifices at Deonar||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday refused to interfere with the decision of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to allow the sacrifice of only 300 big animals — water buffaloes per day at Deonar abattoir for the Bakri Eid festival starting from Wednesday (July 21).Two separate petitions had sought directions to permit the sacrifice of privately-owned animals at the abattoir. They had challenged the BMC circular of July 19, stating that 300 big animals (water buffaloes) would be permitted to be sacrificed at the abattoir per day from July 21-23.However, after the petitioners requested that the number be increased to 700, the court said that in light of public health and pandemic, it was not inclined to interfere in the decision of the BMC. The court held that as the circular had resolved the issues raised in the petition, it could not grant further relief. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing public interest litigations (PILs) filed by Al- Quraish Human Welfare Association and All India Jamiatul Qureish seeking directions to the BMC to increase the number of animals allowed to be sacrificed at Deonar abattoir to deter private individuals from carrying out the sacrifices unauthorisedly.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare appearing for the BMC informed the bench that the civic authority had issued a circular on July 19 with regards to the activities and programmes and festivities connected with Bakri eid and the use of the Deonar abattoir between July 22 and 23. “Last year, the number of large animals that were allowed to be slaughtered at the abattoir last year was 150 animals per day which have been increased to 300 this year. This has been done to avoid overcrowding. Devotees reaching the abattoir will have to follow protocols while sacrificing animals. There are already 900 and more animals at Deonar permitting more animals will result in overcrowding and hence the requests of the petitioners should not be allowed,” said Sakhare. Sakhare further added that as there was a threat of the third wave, the civic authority was taking these precautionary measures and hence the relaxation sought for in the petition should not be allowed. “Now other festivals are starting, for Hindus, Muslims and others. Nearly 13-14 lakh people walk in pilgrimage (Vaari) to Pandharpur, but it is not permitted this year except for a few persons going by bus. Now Ganesh Utsav and Navratri will also come,” said Sakhkare. After the BMC’s submissions, advocates AA Siddique and Tanveer Nizam for the petitioners submitted that the slaughter of 300 animals per day was insufficient as many people had made online purchases of the sacrificial animals before the BMC issued the circular, hence permission should be given to slaughtering of 700 animals per day during a three-day period. However, the bench observed, “It appears from such a circular that the slaughterhouse will be open at an aforesaid rate between 6am and 6pm and maximum buffaloes permitted to be slaughtered is 300 per day. The circular provides for other measures to be adopted for the Covid protocol at the slaughterhouse. With the issuance of the circular dated July 19, 2021, the primary grievance with which the writ jurisdiction was invoked stands redressed.” When advocate Nizam insisted on relaxations at the Deonar abattoir to accommodate the animals purchased the bench said, “Isn’t public health above religion? This is done keeping in mind prevailing circumstances. Possibly next time. Otherwise, the administration will not be able to function or manage.” The bench then disposed of the petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-mumbai-civic-body-s-circular-for-bakri-eid-sacrifices-at-deonar-101626804155425.html

The flats and plots are located in Greater Noida sectors 2, 3, Eta 1, Gamma 1 and 2, Alpha 1 and 2, Beta 1 and 2, Delta 1 and 2, Omicron 3, Chi 3 and 4, among others. Most of these properties are occupied, according to the officials. “We have issued notices to these property buyers for delaying the registration process. If we cancel land allotment, they will lose the property,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Buyers can, however, recover the property ownership by paying a fine to the authority. When allotment of a property is cancelled, the authority charges 5% of the total cost of the property as restoration charge. After paying this amount, the buyer has to pay the registration fee for taking over ownership of the property from the owner. “If a person fails to pay the fine, the property allotment remains cancelled, and the flat/plot is allotted to someone else. So, we have asked these property owners to get to register their properties immediately,” said another Greater Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.Another official, requesting anonymity, said, “Most of the buyers wait for a profitable offer to sell the property, so they keep delaying the registration process. We won’t allow this anymore and will take action against the violators.”Richa Sharma, a buyer who is yet to register her property, said, “The authority should not be too harsh during this tough situation amidst Covid-19 crisis. Many people are suffering from financial crises. They should be allowed more time for the registry process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/g-noida-authority-issues-notice-to-3-373-buyers-for-not-registering-properties-101626803615480.html

As per information, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) had taken up the issue of illegal discharge in repeated meetings and the urban local bodies department was also alerted in this regard.The monitoring committees will conduct raids and take action against the errant industrial units found releasing untreated effluent illegally.HT has learnt that the HSPCB was also planning to provide incentives to volunteers, who will provide secret information about people involved in releasing illegal discharge.“As per the recommendations, every DC will constitute an inspection team at local level and the teams will help to put a check on the illegal effluents,” said HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan.On cash incentives to informers, he said as of now, the HSPCB has taken up the issue with the Panipat DC as maximum cases of illegal discharge are being reported from there. “I have asked the Panipat DC to involve some volunteers. We will give cash awards for information on illegal discharge and the informers’ identity will be kept a secret,” he added.He said this initiative could also be extended to other districts if the DCs of other districts also work on it.Putting a complete check on industrial and domestic waste discharge into Yamuna and Ghaggar rivers remains a tough task for the authorities in state as the issue was deeply discussed in the meeting of the River Rejuvenation Committee (RRC) held on April 28.As per proceedings of the meeting, it was observed that of 126 locations identified along Yamuna river as sources of pollution, action plan is pending for 34 locations. Also, of 255 locations identified along Ghaggar, action plan is pending for 69 locations.Slow progress of laying of sewerage network in Ambala city-Ambala Sadar, Kaithal, Jakhal Mandi, Hisar, Jagadhari-Yamunanagar, Palwal, Rohtak, Faridabad, Karnal and Bahadurgarh was also noted.Of 100.5 MLD being discharged at 155 locations, only 48.15 MLD from 90 locations has been diverted and the work is yet to be started at 18 locations in the Yamuna catchment area.In the Ghaggar catchment area, of total 42.25 MLD being discharged from 56 locations, only 21.08 MLD from 28 locations has been diverted and the work has not started at 14 locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/districtlevel-teams-to-check-illegal-sewage-discharge-in-haryana-101626803378333.html
20-07-2021||Noida||RRTS project: Laying of tracks for 17km priority section begins in Ghaziabad||The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has started laying tracks on the Sahibabad-Duhai stretch -- the 17km priority section -- for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), officials said on Tuesday. The officials also said that the production of train coaches for the project has started at a plant in Savli, Gujarat. The RRTS project is an 82km high-speed rail corridor connecting Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut. The ₹30,274 crore project is aimed at reducing the travel time between Delhi and Meerut to 55-60 minutes. The Sahibabad-Duhai stretch has a deadline of March 2023.“We have started laying tracks at the priority section, and a number of parallel activities, including the production of coaches in Gujarat, have also started. All these activities are getting coordinated to meet the deadline of March 2023. About 60% of the civil construction work of the priority section is complete,” said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer (CPRO) of NCRTC. The 82km corridor is scheduled to open for passenger operations in 2025. “For laying of tracks, we have come up with a precast track slab technology which is being used for the first time in India for a speed of 180km per hour. The actual maximum speed of trains will be 160kmph while the average speed will be close to 100kmph. Each precast slab will be numbered and designed as per its location. So, every slab will synchronise with the RRTS alignment,” Vats said. The officials are hopeful that they will be able to make up for the time loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the entire viaduct of the 17km priority section will be completed in the next eight months. “To speed up the civil construction and viaduct, we have placed 16 gantries over the entire 82km section and four more will be introduced soon. We have also deployed about 1,100 engineers and 10,000 labourers for the project,” the CPRO said.According to the officials, the delivery of the first set of coaches is likely by June 2022.

They also said that the work for the construction of a maintenance depot for the e-bus project is almost complete. The low-floor air-conditioned e-buses will operate on 10 routes within the municipal limits, the officials said. “We are expecting that 50 buses for Ghaziabad may arrive in the next two-three months. At present, work for tendering of the ticketing system for e-buses is going on. Once it gets complete, we are hopeful that the buses will be delivered. In our division, we have 50 e-buses each for Ghaziabad and Meerut,” said Surendra Singh, divisional commissioner, Meerut. The Ghaziabad city at present has no government-run bus network for intra-city commuting. The officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said that the maintenance depot has been developed over an area of about 25,000 square metres at Akbarpur-Behrampur (near Vijay Nagar) adjacent to NH-9. “The construction work (for maintenance depot) is almost finished. The depot will serve as a major point for the maintenance and charging of the e-buses,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. For the operation of e-buses, the corporation officials have chalked out 10 different routes within the municipal limits. The routes include Surya Nagar to Indirapuram and further to Noida City Centre; Govindpuram to UP Gate on NH-9; Shalimar Garden to Ghaziabad railway station; Vijay Nagar to Noida City Centre; Anand Vihar border to Mohan Nagar and further up to ALT Centre, Raj Nagar; Dilshad Garden to Mohan Nagar and further to Old Bus Stand and Govindpuram; and Mohan Nagar to Raj Nagar Extension which will further go to NH-9. In August 2019, the Union ministry of heavy industries had approved the sanction of 5,595 e-buses to 64 cities across the country for intra-city and inter-city operations. Out of 5,595 e-buses, 600 were approved for 11 cities of Uttar Pradesh, including 50 for Ghaziabad city. The approval was made under the phase 2 of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid Electric Vehicles scheme in order to push for clean mobility in public transportation. The 5,595 e-buses are proposed to run about four billion kilometres during their contract period and expected to cumulatively save about 1.2 billion litres of traditional fuel that will help reduce 846 million tonnes of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-likely-to-get-50-electric-buses-in-three-months-101626803315397.html

During the second wave, Covid-related biomedical waste was about 1,200-1,600kg per day.The Covid-19 biomedical waste includes masks, personal protection equipment, tubes, swabs and medicines, among others. These are collected from Covid care facilities, including hospitals dedicated to treat the disease.These days, syringes used in the vaccination against Covid-19 form most of the Covid-19 waste, said Sanjay Kaushik, chief executive officer of Synergy, the agency hired to handle biomedical waste in the district as well as 32 others in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Bihar. “The load of Covid-19 waste has decreased drastically since June. Currently, we get waste from only a few hospitals. We collect the waste in yellow bags, and transported it to our incinerator in Meerut,” said Kaushik.Despite the second wave’s intensity, Kaushik said the first wave generate more waste -- almost 2,100-3,000kg in June-July last year.“This was because the UP pollution control board guidelines till July 31, 2020 regarded food waste from a Covid facility as Covid-19 waste. Later, this was revised, and food waste was categorised as general waste that we collect in green bags,” said Kaushik.As on Monday, GB Nagar saw four more Covid-19 infections that took active cases to 39 and net total cases to 62,651 in the district, according to the state health bulletin.The biomedical waste is segregated under four colour categories – yellow (biomedical), red (plastic), white/transparent (metals) and blue (glass). “We ensure that all Covid-19 waste is collected and managed properly. Private agencies hired by us collect the biomedical waste from the Covid-19 hospitals and isolation centres. We collect it from the patients under home quarantine (and give it to the agency). Currently, there are no Covid-19 patients under home quarantine,” said SC Mishra, project engineer (health), Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-covid-waste-drops-by-98-as-situation-improves-101626803135347.html

Eye-ball to eye-ball confrontation is going on at the moment in Hailakandi, Karimganj and Cachar districts of Assam in areas falling along the border with Mizoram,” Sarma said.Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km-long boundary. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972 when it became a Union territory. It became a state in 1987. There have been minor skirmishes in the past with Mizoram seeking delineation of the border on basis of the East Bengal Frontier Regulation of 1873.Though both Assam and Mizoram governments agreed to maintain the status quo on the dispute several years ago, there have been transgressions and encroachments with each side blaming the other.There is palpable tension along the inter-state border at present with each state blaming the other for encroachment of its territory and attacks on its residents. Both states have ensured a heavy deployment of police personnel along the border.“Union home secretary (Ajay Kumar Bhalla) also recently discussed the issue with chief secretaries of Assam and Mizoram to resolve the crisis. But as of now, the situation along the Assam-Mizoram border is still fragile. I don’t expect any immediate result on the Assam-Mizoram border. It will take time,” said Sarma.Besides Mizoram, Assam has long-standing border disputes with Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland. The state shares an 804-km long boundary with Arunachal Pradesh, 434-km with Nagaland and 733-km with Meghalaya.“We can expect some headway on Assam-Meghalaya and Assam-Arunachal Pradesh fronts. On July 23, I will meet Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma to resolve the border dispute between our two states amicably. I will also meet Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu to discuss the border situation,” said Sarma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-immediate-resolution-of-assam-mizoram-border-row-assam-cm-101626802957399.html

The cave-in took place on the carriageway leading to Gurugram, said officials.Most of the cave-in took place on the barricaded lanes of the expressway that are being used for the construction of the Ambience Mall underpass, with only a small patch of the main carriageway affected. However, commuters said that this increased their travel time by 10 minutes.“Due to the Ambience Mall underpass construction, there is anyways a minor snarl at the border crossing, due to the limited road width. The reduced cave-in resulted in an additional 10-minute delay than usual to cross the stretch,” said Manik Singh, a resident of DLF-5.Traffic police officials deployed at the spot said that measures were taken swiftly to ensure no mishap occurs due to the cave-in. “We took stock of the situation as soon as we were informed about the cave-in and managed to cover it before any untoward incident. Officials were stationed at the spot and ensured vehicle movement never came to a standstill and there was just a minor snarl,” said Karan Singh, traffic inspector (highway), Gurugram traffic police.Around 7am, traffic police officials were alerted and they barricaded 20 metres of the affected portion with the help of traffic cones, concrete and plastic jersey barriers. Vehicles were diverted on the three other lanes of the carriageway. The traffic police officials also issued an update on social media around 5pm, informing commuters about the cave-in.The Ambience Mall underpass is expected to open by September, with work on around 15 metres of the 377 metre-long underpass remaining.Kunal Garg, project manager, RK Contractor, the concessionaire of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for the Ambience Mall underpass, said that originally, the cave-in was four feet wide, and later, it was excavated with machines so that the upper surface of the remaining portion of the underpass could be boxed with reinforced concrete slabs. As a temporary measure, the su“Due to the pending work on shifting a gas pipeline, work on a 15-metre portion of the underpass is remaining. A high volume of rainwater accumulated inside the underpass and without any concrete slab on top of the remaining 15-metre portion, the water came in contact with the exposed road surface, leading to the cave-in,” said Garg.Garg said that rainwater accumulation inside the underpass has been a common occurrence but this time around, the volume was much higher due to the intensity of the rains on Sunday and Monday, when the city recorded 185mm of cumulative rain, according to the India Meteorological Department.“We would always pump it out with motor pumps soon after (it filled up). Most of the rainwater usually drains out from the underpass’ surface drain itself. However, this time around, the intensity of rain was too much. Provided there is no more rain, we will be able to pump out all the rainwater within 24 hours, with the help of a 15-horsepower motor pump,” said Garg.Garg said that once the rainwater is removed and the skies clear up, casting work will commence. “Once the weather clears up, we will execute casting work on the remaining 15-metre portion, which would take us two days to complete. Post casting, the concrete takes three weeks to reach its optimum strength. Everything combined, the affected portion will open after a period of one month,” said Garg.Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said, “Our main focus currently is to ensure that no vehicles pass over the affected stretch. Most of our resources is allocated towards diverting vehicles through safely. We are ascertaining the cause of the cave-in and will accordingly take action.”It is not the first time rainwater accumulation in an under-construction underpass affected the structural integrity of road infrastructure.In September 2019, rainwater accumulated up to a height of seven feet inside the Iffco Chowk underpass, threatening the foundation of entire the MG Road stretch and a petrol pump located above the underpass. “The cave-in shows that quality of construction is being compromised. There was already an orange alert issued for Monday and Tuesday regarding high rainfall. Officials in charge should have foreseen the issues arising from it and accordingly taken precautionary measures,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert with Nagarro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/patch-of-delhi-gurgaon-e-way-caves-in-at-border-causes-10-minute-snarl-101626801639909.html

A charted accountant was appointed by the administration to check whether the hospitals complied with the treatment rates set by the Haryana government, officials said on Tuesday.“A majority of the overcharging complaints are against the smaller hospitals. A few of these complaints have been referred to the director, general health services, for clarification regarding the line of treatment and its cost mentioned in the bill, while other complaints are shared with a charted accountant to check the amount charged by the hospital against the Covid-19 treatment cost fixed by the Haryana government,” said Surinder Dahiya, city magistrate.Dahiya is the nodal officer for the committee that was constituted by the district administration on June 2 to address the complaints of exorbitant bills generated by private hospitals for the treatment for Covid-19 patients during the second Covid-19 wave in April and May.On May 29, the Haryana government directed the deputy commissioners across the state to constitute a district-level committee to monitor the complaints. In the district, a three-member committee was constituted on June 2, comprising Dahiya, Dr Anuj Garg of the district health department and Dr MP Jain of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer for Gurugram, said, “All complaints related to inflated bills are directly transferred to the district administration’s committee for investigation.”According to an order issued on June 25, 2020, the state government fixed rates (per day) in hospitals accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare providers (NABH) at ₹10,000 for an isolation bed, including supportive care and oxygen; ₹15,000 for an intensive care unit (ICU) bed without a ventilator and ₹18,000 for an ICU bed with ventilator support. Likewise, rates in non-NABH accredited hospitals were fixed at ₹8000, ₹13,000 and ₹15,000, respectively, for the same services.Officials, while fixing the rates, had said that the purpose behind the standardisation of rates was to eliminate disparity in charges across private hospitals.During the surge in cases during the second wave, residents alleged that the treatment cost in ICU went above ₹50,000, while over ₹20,000 a day was charged for treatment in the general ward. The state government intervened after people directly reached out to the state administration.“Action will be taken against the hospital concerned based on the final report submitted by the charted accountant,” said Dahiya, refusing to comment on the deadline given to submit the final report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-treatment-at-least-38-complaints-of-overcharging-for-treatment-filed-101626801638525.html

The district administration also formed a three-member committee to probe the collapse. The committee, comprising the subdivisional officer of Pataudi, junior engineer of the Public Works Department (B&R) of Farrukhnagar and subdivisional officer of Panchayati Raj, collected samples from the site on Tuesday and sent them for further examination to the PWD lab. The subdivisional magistrate (SMD) of Pataudi, Pradeep Kumar, said that the deputy commissioner directed for a magisterial probe. “The team has started its work and has collected samples from the site,” he said. The three persons who died were identified as Robin (34), Pradeep Sharma (39) and Tiny Bhardwaj (24), while a fourth resident, Pradeep Choudhary (36), was rescued on Sunday evening. According to a statement released by the district spokesperson, ₹2 lakh will be given to the families of the three who died and ₹1 lakh to the survivor, who is presently undergoing treatment at the Sector 10 Civil Hospital. His right leg was fractured when he was trapped in the rubble following the collapse on Sunday. The bodies of the deceased were handed over to the families on Monday and Tuesday. Devinder Sharma, a resident of Bhiwani, a brother of one of the deceased, said, “He was the sole breadwinner of the family and both his children are minors. This compensation can bring temporary relief but they have a long way to go.” Vinod Kumar, a relative of Bhardwaj, said, “We had to borrow money from our relatives to bear the expenses of transporting the body to village. This has come as a huge shock to all of us and we are not able to come to terms with it. He had called in the morning after his shift and was planning to visit home next month.” Meanwhile, the police on Tuesday arrested a manager of the company, after a case was filed against the building owner and manager of the warehouse on Monday under sections of “negligence leading to death”. A worker, in his complaint to the police, alleged that they had complained to the owner multiple times about the poor condition of the building and requested they be shifted to another building. “Police and administration have initiated a probe in the case,” said MLA (Pataudi) Satya Prakash Jarawta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/building-collapse-khattar-announces-2-lakh-for-kin-of-deceased-1-lakh-for-survivor-101626801637273.html
20-07-2021||Gurugram||Water run-off from Aravallis prevented from reaching Golf Course Road||Despite heavy rain on Monday, there was minimal waterlogging reported from stretches around the Aravallis compared to previous years as rainwater was diverted to the forests through check dams built in the area, said officials. After severe waterlogging on Golf Course Road last year, authorities identified that run-off water from the creeks in the Aravallis was the main cause. Ahead of this monsoon, they built check dams in the Aravallis to ensure that the water was diverted to the forest area, which also serves as a vital catchment area for recharging the groundwater table. Subhash Yadav, the divisional forest officer and head of the urban environment division, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), said that till last year, water from the creeks used to flow into the drain system and added to the load on the Badshahpur drain. “This time, we ensured rainwater from the Aravallis did not run off into drains. Water from three creeks was stored in the forests itself with the help of water bodies and check dams made there. This will help in both groundwater recharge and availability of water for wildlife,” said Yadav. Three check dams were built along the creeks on Golf Course Road, while creeks near the Shiv Nadar School and in Wazirabad were revitalised to arrest rainwater flow.On August 19 and 20 of 2020, the city received over 196mm of rainfall, following which the seven-kilometre Golf Course Road was inundated, with rainwater accumulation as high as 0.5 metres above the surface level at several points. However, this year, despite receiving 185mm of rainfall in two days, waterlogging was not reported from Golf Course Road, Sector 28 and Sector 26 that are located around the Aravallis. Latika Thukral, the co-founder of iamgurgaon, an organisation that helped authorities conduct a hydrogeological study of the area, said, “This time, a decision was taken that no concretised drains will be made near the Aravallis and try to move the water from the roads into the green areas. So, for instance, MG Road and Faridabad Road are 200 metres above the Golf Course Road; so when water comes from there, it gushes down. But with this trial, this year, water flowed into the forests.” She said that cleaning of the Chakkarpur-Wazibarad bundh helped channel water from roads to the drains and that this part of the city did not get flooded. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the counter waterlogging measures in the Aravallis was also discussed during a high-level meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) at the PWD rest house in Civil Lines on Tuesday. In the meeting, held to review Monday’s waterlogging woes, MCG councillor Kuldeep Yadav expressed appreciation for the arrangement of ponds and natural drains made in the Aravalli region. “Wherever possible, such arrangements should be made in other areas also. Due to heavy rains on Monday, water collected in these ponds and natural drains would gradually recharge the groundwater. Small creeks should be made at other places in the city also. Along with this, the green belt area should be made below the road level, so that rainwater can be collected there,” said Yadav, in an official release issued by the MCG. He also suggested the construction of modular harvesting pits. The MCG commissioner, Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, directed all joint commissioners to visit spots where waterlogging was reported along with the local ward councillor and engineering wing officials to take remedial measures. Mayor Madhu Azad also said that a proposal would be sent to senior officials, including the Haryana chief minister, seeking action against officers or MCG workers over laxity in work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/water-run-off-from-aravallis-prevented-from-reaching-golf-course-road-101626801636017.html

The ACP added that this was the second marriage of Neeru, who had a son from her first marriage, while it was the first marriage of the accused, Raja Sekhon. “After Neeru’s parents left, the argument got out of hand and Neeru made a loop of a piece of cloth and tied its one end to a ceiling fan. She wrapped the loop around her neck and threatened to end her life. Raja has confessed that in a fit of rage, he kicked out the stool from under her feet, causing her to hang.

It took the search and rescue teams nearly 19 hours to recover the bodies from under the rubble, but the initial alert had come from Kush the German shepherd, as early as 1.30am on Monday, followed by alerts from Pluto the Labrador. Both dogs are from the Ghaziabad unit of NDRF, their handlers said. After the dogs led the rescue team to a particular spot of the collapsed deck, drilling was intensified and the concrete slab broken off to reach the man trapped under. Shri Niwas, assistant commandant, NDRF, said both Kush and Pluto are well-trained, and while even machines may sometimes go wrong, the two canines never do. “They have undergone extensive training for six months and have been involved in more than 20 search and rescue operations in Nepal, Uttarakhand, Bhopal, Ghaziabad, Noida and Kanpur,” he said. Niwas said their teams had reached the Khawaspur site around 11.30pm Sunday from Ghaziabad and Kush and Pluto reached around 12.30am along with a unit of 30 personnel. “Both dogs started assisting us within minutes of their arrival. As machines were yet to clear the debris, they made rounds of the site and identified the areas where the three men were trapped,” he said. Amit Tomar, master (dog handler) of Kush, said Kush is trained to detect human scent. “He works off leash and barks once he notices something of interest,” he said. Both of them have been awarded several times for their exemplary work in search and rescue missions, said Tomar. In appreciation of their good work on Monday, they will be given a weekly off on Tuesday and, as a treat, will also get to go the ground and play, said Niwas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/building-collapse-kush-and-pluto-led-rescue-teams-to-men-trapped-under-debris-101626799475838.html

The paediatric Covid facility will have 50 oxygenated beds. It will be the second dedicated paediatric Covid facility prepared by the civic body. Currently, Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Yerwada is ready with a 200-bed capacity. “We are all hoping that the third Covid wave will not happen, but we have to be prepared just in case the Covid infection spreads amongst the paediatric group. So these arrangements are made. I have just taken the charge and will soon visit both facilities at the Rajiv Gandhi hospital and the Magar hospital. I am told that the work is in progress,” Ravindra Binwade, additional municipal commissioner, PMC, said. The Annasaheb Magar facility is a maternity hospital run by PMC. “The preliminary work to convert it into a paediatric Covid facility has started. We will have to shift the general medical facilities offered at the hospital such as OPDs, general OPDs, immunisation centre, somewhere else. We are in the process of this planning,” said Dr Ashish Bharati, chief medical officer, PMC. Dr Bharati also said that the civic body plans to have general Covid hospitals in each zone. “Currently COEP jumbo facility is closed. The number of patients are also few, so there is no inconvenience caused. Our new facility in Baner is also ready. In the second wave, more cases were observed from the Kharadi, Hadapsar area. So we planned that paediatric hospital in this part,” said Dr Bharati. PMC currently has prepared a 200-bed paediatric Covid facility at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerwada. However, no admissions have been recorded in this facility so far. There are 160 oxygenated beds in this facility and 40 are ICU beds. PMC has also closed its Covid care centres. Currently, only one CCC in Yerwada with 18 patients is functional. “If we want we can make these centres operational again. The CCC in Yerwada is functional because it is run in partnership with an NGO. The other 13 have been inoperative for over a month now,” said Rajendra Muthe, deputy Commissioner, PMC.Currently, the COEP jumbo facility has been closed and the process of a structural audit of the infrastructure is underway.

According to the state agriculture department, rain at this time save surface and subsoil water and also helps in better growth of paddy, which was sown or transplanted within the past 15 days to a month.Punjab agriculture director SS Sidhu the current spell of rain will lead to a bumper yield, as the crop is already set and the showers will act as a catalyst for growth. Paddy crop in most parts of the state is already 30-40 days old.The south-western corner of the state received low rainfall than the rest of Punjab, but that region does not need irrigation, being a cotton growing area. “On Tuesday, 70-100 mm rainfall was reported in most parts of the state. It is expected to taper down on Wednesday, when the focus would be on the north Punjab districts of Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur,” said an official of the meteorological department. “Farmers in north Punjab prefer aromatic basmati over the coarse variety. Basmati grows best under rain, particularly when it is normal and there is no flooding. Wednesday’s rain over basmati crop, which is in the process of being transplanted will give us best results,” said an agriculture department officer. Paddy is being cultivated on over 30 lakh hectare, of which 5 lakh hectare is the aromatic variety. Rain also brings nitrogen for crops and it help in better growth and shoot development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heavy-rain-raises-hopes-of-bumper-paddy-yield-101626798696124.html

Singh is said to be a trusted aide of Lalu Prasad. On November 22, 2017, a month before RJD chief Lalu Prasad was incarcerated in fodder scam cases, it was Singh who had proposed Tejashwi Yadav’s name as the party’s chief ministerial candidate.For the record, Singh maintained he was in Delhi just to enquire about Lalu Prasad’s health and other party matters. “I do not know from where these reports of Tejashwi becoming acting national president are coming from. But if something happens, you all will all know,” he said on phone on Tuesday.Party’s top leaders said elevating Tejashwi Yadav as acting national president would not be difficult as such powers are vested with the RJD’s national president, as per the party’s constitution. “Though there is no such post as acting national president in the party’s constitution, the RJD national president can do it by exercising his powers. But any such decision would have to be approved by the national executive,” said RJD leader and former MLA Bhola Yadav. He, however, said he did not have any knowledge about any such move. Speculation is also rife that Singh, who has been holding the post since November 2019, is likely to step down as state unit president.Lalu Yadav’s elder son and MLA Tej Pratap Yadav, while speaking on RJD’s 25th foundation day, had taken a swipe at “Jagdanand uncle”, saying he also seemed angry with him. Meanwhile, BJP’s state spokesperson Nikhil Anand on Tuesday said Tejashwi becoming the acting national president of RJD was on predictable lines, given the party believed in “family rule”. “RJD is a party run by a single family. But Tejashwi’s elevation will be injustice to his elder siblings, Misa Bharti and Tej Pratap, who had a rightful claim on the RJD’s chief legacy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/buzz-of-tejashwi-s-elevation-jagdanand-s-exit-in-rjdshakeup-101626797915119.html

BRTB Chairman Akhilesh Kumar Jain said the board has decided not to allow kanwariyas to collect water in groups from rivers and to offer prayers at Shiva temples across the state, which they do on each Monday of the holy month of Shrawan. He said the government took the decision, for the second consecutive year, in view of a possible third wave of Covid-19. The move is aimed to prevent public gatherings at Garib Nath Dham, Hariharnath, Bihteshwar Nath, Baikunth Nath and Kusheshwarsthan. Jain also requested people to refrain from participating in kanwar yatra this year. Though the state government has allowed various activities in a phased manner under the unlock plan, all the religious sites and places of worship, including temples, remain shut in the state and devotees are not allowed to visit till August 6. The month of Shrawan will start from July 25 this year. The Shrawani Mela is organised every year in July and continues for a month. More than one crore pilgrims from across the country, besides neighbouring Nepal, fetch water from Ganga at Sultanganj in Bhagalpur and then walk for over 100 km to Jyotirlinga (a devotional representation of the Hindu god Shiva) at Deoghar in Jharkhand via Banka and Munger districts. They mostly travel on foot in groups. Meanwhile, the Deoghar police officers held a meeting with their counterparts from Jamui and Banka districts of Bihar and decided to seal the borders of Bihar and Jharkhand for devotees.

20-07-2021||Patna||Bihar may miss 5-cr plantation target||The Covid-19 pandemic and floods are likely to affect Bihar’s afforestation drive with the state having set an ambitious target to plant 5 crore saplings this year. The pre-monsoon plantation mobilisation work has been hit after seven forest officials, including a district forest officer (DFO) and two range officers, died of coronavirus disease, while several other officials were infected by the virus, said Dipak Kumar Singh, Bihar’s principal secretary, department of environment, forest and climate change. Most deaths in the department occurred between April and June, the peak of the second wave of the pandemic in the state. The three months accounted for 7,869 of the total 9,630 Covid-19 deaths in Bihar. There was a single-day increase of 3,971 deaths on June 8 when the state government completed a review of fatalities at private and government hospitals, under home isolation and those succumbing to post-Covid complications. The peak of the second pandemic, leading to lockdown that began in May, forced the department to put on hold several outreach initiatives and IEC (information, education and counselling) activities, including “Kisan chaupal” (farmers’ open-air meeting) to sensitise them about agro-forestry and other plantation programmes. When the Covid-19 situation began to ease this month, the floods in north Bihar did not help the cause of the forest department either. Flooding has affected the state since late June after heavy rainfall in river catchments in neighbouring Nepal. As of July 12, the National Emergency Response Centre reported over 1 million people having been affected by floods in 10 of Bihar’s 38 districts. Rivers, including the Bagmati, Kosi, Gandak and Burhi Gandak, were above the danger mark at 14 locations as of July 14. “In some flood-hit districts of north Bihar, we have to wait for floodwaters to recede before we can begin our plantation,” said Singh. The department still hopes to catch up by intensifying the drive in areas not affected by floods between July and September, considered to be the best season when major plantation work for the year is done, and then tapping the February-March spring season for Poplar plantation in north Bihar. “Despite the setback to the department’s plantation initiative due to Covid-19 and floods, our activities through our stakeholders are underway. We involve Jeevika didis (women self-help group), NGOs, PSUs, central paramilitary force, railways and other government departments in our plantation activities. We are distributing plants and doing plantations through them and hope to catch up on our deficit,” said Singh. “As on this day, we have done 1.53 crore plantations since June 5 and hope to intensify the drive further in the next two months,” he said. Buoyed by the achievement last year, the state has set an ambitious annual target to plant 5 crore saplings till May next year in its endeavour to increase its green cover. Last year, the state achieved 3.97 crore plantations, surpassing its target of 2.51 crore. According to the India State of Forest Report, 2019, Bihar has 7.76% forest cover, which includes land having trees in more than one hectare area with tree canopy density of 10%. It increased by a nominal 0.10% in 2019 as compared to 2017. Bihar, with a geographical area of 94,163 sq km, is estimated to have 2.13% (2,003 sq km) tree cover, which is tree patches of less than 1 hectare occurring outside the forest area, and also includes scattered trees. However, quoting data from the Forest Survey of India, another officer associated with the Hariyali Mission, said: “We have 14.5% green cover (total forest cover and trees outside forest area) as per an assessment of 2019. We hope to increase it to 17% in two years.”Red flags in green wayPandemic and lockdownPre-monsoon plantation work hit after seven forest officials, including a district forest officer and two range officers, died of coronavirus disease.

During the lockdown and even now, the condition of these canines has worsened as there are less people out on the streets and these dogs don’t get food easily.” Volunteers of ‘Pune Animals’ ensure that street dogs in and around Sahakar nagar are fed chicken and rice every night. Not only do the volunteers take care of the animals’ food, they also regularly sterilise and vaccinate them. According to Satav, the group also helps keep the canine population in check.

Everyone is devoted to the cause and participates happily,” he added. Aishwarya Abhyankar who has been feeding street dogs for the last 20 years said, “The group is doing a really good job. Even during the monsoon, they are visiting different areas and feeding the dogs there. Anyone can join the group and feed street canines. They only need to love animals.”However, new members are hand-held by senior volunteers for a few days before they are able to do the job on their own. The good news is 90% of the people have been supportive of the group and its activities.“Volunteers might face objections in some areas. However, no one can stop volunteers from feeding the dogs. Of course, there are people who hate animals in several housing societies,” said Abhyankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-animals-display-a-humane-touch-to-keep-canines-fed-in-sahakar-nagar-101626795634914.html

This is the first time that such a survey was conducted by the CEE and schools to understand the rich biodiversity,” said Mr Babarao, who along with five of his colleagues, visited 50 schools and communities and discovered 21 varieties of jamun in the Sahyadris.The varieties of jamun found by the survey include: Garpi, Mutki, Redy, Khati, Bahadoli, Kuutri, Kirkas, Lendi, khadkii, drakshi, and Kala Jambhul; all of which are sweet and tangy and typically ripen towards the end of the summer season.However, “Climate change in terms of less rainfall poses the risk of losing this kind of biodiversity which may not have been documented but this report should help scientists, the community and the government to conserve this natural resource which is used as natural medicine to control diabetes,” Mr Babarao lamented.The report has been put together ahead of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC), scheduled to be held between November 1 and 12, 2021, at Glasgow, UK. The COP 26 is working on forward action for the protection and restoration of forests and critical ecosystems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/climate-change-impacting-jamun-varieties-in-sahyadris-101626793234777.html

According to the police, the operation left people, whose data was thus compromised, with gaping holes in their bank accounts. Assistant public prosecutor Maithili Kalvit of Shivajinagar court said that the four men have been remanded to police custody till July 26. Meanwhile, the police know of at least four people who collectively lost ₹514,841 to the men suspected to be part of a larger nexus.One such complainant, Jyoti Shinde, 53, who is a resident of the Law college road area, lost ₹514,841 to the accused. Three other people have suffered similar consequences after the accused allegedly made them download mirroring applications which provided remote access to the accused.The police have identified the arrested accused as Virbhadrasingh Dharmendrasingh Jhala, 29, a resident of Bhavnagar in Gujarat; Mehul Zaverbhai Kakdia, 28, a resident of Surat in Gujarat; Yash Bharatbhai Bhuptani, 24, a resident of Amreli in Gujarat; and Jitendra Teklal Mandal, 35, a resident of Giridih in Jharkhand.The modus operandi of the arrested accused was to take cash from one set of people under the pretext of paying their electricity bills while stealing money from the bank accounts of another set of people, according to the police submission in court.Police inspector Kumar Ghadge of the cyber police station who is investigating the case said, “The electricity distributor in Gujarat is a private entity. They paid the electricity bills of local businessmen in advance and showed the receipts to them and took the same amount of cash from them. This way, the businessmen got the benefit of advance payment, the accused got untraceable hard cash, and the people whose bank account details had been compromised, were left in a lurch.”A case under sections 419 (impersonation) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, along with sections 66(c) and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act was registered at the cyber police station. The police is on the lookout for any previous cases registered against the arrested accused and the kingpin of the racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-steal-bank-accounts-on-pretext-of-paying-bills-in-custody-101626792814711.html

20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Burning the midnight oil to scaring daylights out||Some days ago, I received a photograph of our first-year tutorial group in the medical college on the college WhatsApp group. That initiated a series of exchanges of anecdotes of college life. Forty years after passing out, everyone had something to share about our years together and the life after. This made me recall an amusing incident. Medical studies are tough. Joining a medical college after 10+2 is a totally different ball game. Back-to-back lectures, practicals, dissection hall and labs, all make a heady mixture. The course is vast and subjects varied. There are tutorials, group discussions, assignments and weekly and monthly assessments with batch-mates from different parts of the country. Also read: NTA NEET 2021: New exam pattern explainedAnd if you are a hosteller, as most students are, you find it strange how people survive on mess food. As you settle down after the initial excitement of taking the first step towards becoming an exalted doctor, it dawns upon you that life is not easy. But then the newfound freedom overtakes everything else. No restrictions for staying out late or eating junk food or motorbike rides. You are your own boss. You do what you want and for a while you feel you are on top of the world. This goes on for a few months till you look at the exam calendar. I fondly remember my days in the medical college. The first semester exams sent us scurrying to our seniors, asking for tips, notes and tricks to face the viva voce where you can be questioned on anything vaguely connected to your textbooks in one-on-one interactions where you can be ridiculed or made to question your decision to opt for medicine as a career. The seniors scared us with data that so many students were unable to clear exams the previous year, and that could happen repeatedly to some. But then they shared their notes and prepared you for the “encounters”. Over a period of time, you learn the ropes and gather a group of friends with whom you have nocturnal study sessions. There are some who you consider your rivals or competitors. I remember after a few hours of studying, I would go for a stroll in hostel corridors to stretch my legs. I would look at windows of my batch-mates to see whose light was still on, imagining who all were studying. Trying to outdo them, I would keep studying till most of the lights got switched off. In the final year, a studious fellow shifted to our block. His room always had the lights on even after my late-night sorties. That would egg me on further till I would finally call it a day out of exhaustion. This went on till the last exam. Soon, the results were declared and I had beaten that batch-mate by quite a distance. While celebrating our passing out, I picked up courage to ask him what pulled him down despite burning the midnight oil endlessly. He looked surprised and said since joining the medical college he had always slept with the room lights on because he was afraid of the dark!

Pune had only 50 people seeking home vaccination till July 19, he said. Kumbhakoni then assured the bench that the draft policy would be finalised without major modifications and a status report of home vaccinated persons would be placed before the court in the next hearing. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for BMC confirmed the willingness of the civic authority to conduct free home vaccination from August 1. Sakhare added that a policy was required for private hospitals so that they can also provide facilities of home vaccination. After hearing submissions, the bench said, “The Centre did not rise to the occasion. However, we record our satisfaction that the state has risen to the occasion and today, we find some light at the end of the tunnel.” The bench then sought a status report from the authorities and posted hearing of the PIL to August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/home-vaccination-will-start-in-mumbai-from-august-1-state-to-hc-101626784114938.html

Before he reached Amritsar, the former Punjab minister was accorded a warm welcome by Jandiala Guru MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny, who is among the four working presidents of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC). He was accompanied by Amritsar South MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria when he left from Patiala, but on reaching the city, no local MLA turned up to welcome him. Sidhu’s convoy resembled a road show as he headed for his residence. Though his main residence is in Amritsar, Sidhu was seen in the city after several months as he shifted based to Patiala, his home town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-returns-to-hero-s-welcome-with-road-show-in-amritsar-101626782435489.html

20-07-2021||Kolkata||On TMC’s martyr’s day, BJP to project killing of party workers in Bengal||Even as Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee prepared to observe martyrs’ day, her party’s biggest annual event held in the memory of 13 youth Congress workers killed in police firing in Kolkata on July 21, 1993, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit on Tuesday upped the ante by declaring that it would observe the day to pay homage to its workers killed in political violence. Claiming that 124 BJP workers have been killed since the 2008 panchayat polls, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “We have lost 38 workers since the end of the recent assembly polls. The report on post-poll violence filed at the Calcutta high court by the National Human Rights Commissions shows only the tip of the iceberg. We will hold programmes in Delhi and Bengal tomorrow to tell people that the ruling party has destroyed democracy.”Bhattacharya alleged that Debesh Burman, a BJP worker from Raigunj in South Dinajpur district, was murdered on Monday and the body was hung by the neck from a tree. “But the police said he either died by suicide or was killed in a family dispute. The police are working in liaison with the TMC,” said Bhattacharya. In a tweet, Bengal Congress leader Rohan Mitra claimed that Debesh Burman was a Congress worker. Referring to a tweet by the BJP’s national IT cell head Amit Malviya, Mitra wrote, “I can confirm Debesh Burman was a Congress worker, our @IYCWestBengal district president Tushar Guha is already there, he will be sharing more information shortly. @amitmalviya is a liar.”Also read: Have details of Abhishek Banerjee’s calls made to police - Suvendu amid Pegasus rowMamata Banerjee was a Youth Congress leader in 1993 and led an agitation on July 21 the same year against the then Left Front government. Over the years, the martyr’s day rally has emerged as a symbol of the TMC’s struggle since its birth in 1998 and serves as a platform from where Banerjee sends out messages and declares future plans. Held at Esplanade in the heart of Kolkata, the martyrs’ day rally is known to be a big crowd puller but like last year it will be held virtually because of the pandemic. Banerjee will address people on social media and giant screens will be installed in public places and TMC offices across the state and, for the first time, even in Delhi and some other states. This is being seen as part of the TMC’s efforts to project Banerjee as the face of the opposition against the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Bhattacharya alleged that the TMC has been using the July 21 tragedy faced by the Youth Congress for its own agenda. “The TMC has always tried to project itself as an oppressed party but on the ground, it chocked the voice of the opposition. Tomorrow, our state president Dilip Ghosh will hold a programme at Rajghat in New Delhi while our workers will pay homage to their fallen colleagues in all the districts and Kolkata,” he said.TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said the BJP is making a farce.“Can there be a counter martyr’s day? Our martyr’s day is a symbol of the sacrifices made by party workers. The BJP is making a futile attempt to draw public attention,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/on-tmc-s-martyr-s-day-bjp-to-project-killing-of-party-workers-in-bengal-101626780394995.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to introduce QR-code mechanism for liquor supply||The Punjab government will soon come up with a quick response (QR) code-based track and trace mechanism for liquor supply to prevent the smuggling and sale of spurious liquor in the border state. The decision was taken on Tuesday at the executive committee meeting of the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB), chaired by chief secretary Vini Mahajan, to review infrastructure projects. Also read: Will give back power to people of Punjab: Navjot Singh SidhuThe chief secretary said the QR code-based mechanism has been designed in public private partnership (PPP) mode, which will help in keeping a check on spurious and illicit liquor by real time data monitoring and verification of production and supply. It was also decided at the meeting to set up a technical support unit (TSU) for faecal sludge and septage management (FSSM) implementation in the rural areas of Punjab. The PIDB committee approved raising a loan of ₹300 crore to accelerate urban development in the state. Mahajan reviewed the progress of work on Sangrur Kothi, Durbar Hall and Gol Kothi in Kapurthala, Ran Baas, and Qila Mubarak in Patiala. She also took up the operation and maintenance of Circuit House in Amritsar on PPP mode. The executive committee approved projects of commercial complex-cum-convention centres in Mohali and Amritsar over an area of 6 acres and 8.26 acres, respectively, with revised parameters to attract investment. The progress of eco-tourism around Ranjit Sagar lake was also reviewed, the bidding for which is under process. It was decided to take up three new projects – the old PWD headquarters building on Mall Road in Patiala as heritage hotel on PPP mode; multi-level car parking and office space in Ludhiana; and multi-level parking with commercial development space in Patiala on PPP mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-introduce-qr-code-mechanism-for-liquor-supply-101626780154576.html
20-07-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Historical core city of Pune needs an election push for devp||PUNE Pune’s core city, like many historical cities built before motorcycles and cars were invented, has many people- and environment-friendly features. The street network with small block sizes makes it easy to walk around.Despite the density, you find sitting platforms, locally known as paars, around peepal and banyan trees that provide quiet spaces to relax. You can enjoy a chai and misal and watch the bustle of commercial activity and modernity amid heritage.The core city also has heritage temples and ghats, traditional occupations of Kumbhars (potters), Tambats (brass and copper workers) at Tambat Ali, bamboo artisans at Burud Ali. Tulshi Baug is still a popular shopping street selling specialised household products. Such precincts have a character that no other place in Pune has.Unfortunately, new developments in the last few decades are erasing the core city’s unique fabric. The hustle-bustle has turned into congestion. People avoid visiting the core city for shopping for traditional items like saris and jewellery.According to Sujit Patwardhan, founder Trustee of Parisar, “There are broadly two visions for the core area’s future. One that sees it as no different from the rest of the city, and the other, that values the historic and cultural qualities that need to be preserved.”There is an even more serious consequence. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has recently published its study of air pollutants in Pune. Dr Gufran Beig, Principal Lead Author of the report cautions, “The Emissions Inventory study shows a very high level of emission in Pune’s core city. Pune’s high-altitude location helps in slower conversion of emissions to pollutants as compared to plain areas. However, looking at the high emission level and rate of increase, the time is not far when the advantage of being high altitude would be lost after emissions cross a tipping point and Pune will also witness high air pollution. Transport is the source of over 45% of emissions of most toxic PM2.5. Better to act now to reduce emissions.Tiny pollutant particles enter the lungs, causing respiratory illnesses. Some particles are small enough to pass through the lungs into the bloodstream affecting the brain, heart and kidneys. Children, pregnant women, older people, those with cardiovascular ailments are at greater risk. Air pollution is also known to increase the severity of the Covid-19 disease.Pune Municipal Corporation and Traffic Police must take note of the IITM Emissions Inventory and take urgent steps to reduce air pollution in the core city.Fortunately, the PMC, with great foresight, has already got a few different plans – the Comprehensive Mobility Plan, Bicycle Plan, Parking Policy, Pune Streets Programme, and Urban Street Design Guidelines. Initiatives introducing minibuses and electric vehicles have been in the news recently.Imagine the attractive, calmer, and healthier environment the core city could have with these provisions implemented in true letter and spirit:Attractive street designBeautiful designs for about 25 km of core city streets were prepared under the Pune Streets Programme with footpaths, vending zones, rickshaw stands, and easy bus movement. In addition, a walking plaza, greenery and neatly arranged street vending zones were designed reflecting the unique character of Laxmi Road.Architect Prasanna Desai and PVP College Architecture students had conceptualized an “open-air mall” design for Laxmi Road. If traffic-clogged roads can be freed up, people can enjoy the core city ambience, its cultural activities, restaurants, and of course, shopping!We can learn from similar projects at Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh in Delhi, which are more crowded than Pune’s core city. Amsterdam, London, Paris, Stockholm and many others have decongested inner-city areas to improve liveability and economy.ShuttlesShuttle services with CNG or electric minibuses or share-rickshaws would help cut the noise and air pollution. Shuttles would ease mobility within the core city and connect to the metro, major bus stops, and parking lots.Traffic re-routingThe Comprehensive Mobility Plan recommended an inner ring road of sorts by streamlining traffic movement along JM Road, Shastri Road, Shankar Sheth Road, Nehru Road. As a result, traffic that is not destined for the core city need not enter it but can go around. Traffic re-routing and restricted timings for vehicle movement would be a boon for residents in the Peth areas to reduce vehicular pollution.Parking managementVehicles parked on the road eat up one or two lanes of precious road space, making bus movement, cycling and even walking difficult.Studies show that most of the parked vehicles are of shop employees, leaving very little for customers. Pay-n-park can ensure that long-term parking is shifted to parking lots and on-street parking is utilized efficiently.Paid parking facilities exist in and near the core city. With free parking available on the road, they are not much used. In some parking lots, other businesses have come up! This situation should be corrected as recommended in the CMP.With good bus connectivity, shuttles and cycle-safe roads in place, people coming to the core area every day for work could leave their bike or car behind. It is an adjustment people will have to make not to increase pollution and cause health problems for themselves and others.All we need is for PMC to implement these projects already envisaged in city plans. Public deliberations among residents, businesses, institutions, the wider public and PMC are needed so that proposals are well-understood, tried out and fine-tuned for the public’s needs.Lockdown losses, urgent health concerns, and the longer-term need for heritage-sensitive modernization call for authentic leadership from elected officials and the administration. Such a project to heal, nurture and celebrate Pune’s historical core city must find a place in election manifestos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-historical-core-city-of-pune-needs-an-election-push-for-devp-101626779434859.html
20-07-2021||Kolkata||'Have details of Abhishek Banerjee’s phone calls': Suvendu amid Pegasus row||A video clip in which Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, can be purportedly heard saying that he has records of all the phone calls made from the office of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee has created a stir in Bengal, HT has learnt.The video, in which Adhikari can be seen addressing a public meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), surfaced a day after opposition parties targeted the BJP in Parliament by accusing the Centre of using an Israeli malware called Pegasus to snoop on opposition leaders, journalists and government officials. TMC alleged in Parliament that Abhishek Banerjee is among those whose phone was tapped.In the 35-second video clip, Adhikari can be heard referring to the chief minister as “aunt” and Abhishek Banerjee, the TMC national general secretary and Lok Sabha member, as “nephew.”The video was apparently shot in some district of Bengal recently. Adhikari can be heard saying, “The role of the IO (investigating officer), inspector-in-charge and the superintendent of police will be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Then you will understand that no aunt can save you. Phone calls are made to you from the nephew’s office. I have all the phone numbers and call records. If you have the state government, we have the Central government.”HT could not independently ascertain the authenticity of the video or identify the police officers referred to.A section of the local media in Bengal, however, reported that Adhikari made the statement at a public meeting in East Midnapore district on Monday afternoon and he was referring to local police officers.The East Midnapore police on Tuesday filed three suo motu cases against Adhikari, accusing him of intimidating government officials, insulting them and tapping their phones.Amarnath K, superintendent of police, East Midnapore, said, "The cases have been lodged on the basis of the statement Adhikari made on Monday.""Adhikari said he has phone records of police officers which he should not officially have. Hence a case has been registered under Official Secrecy Act. He made some communal statements for which Section 295 (A) of the Indian Penal Code has been added. A case has also been filed under the Disaster Management Act as more than 50 people had assembled for the meeting violating Covid restrictions." Amarnath K told the media.Not denying the charges, Adhikari, who joined the BJP seven months ago, said, "One should not give importance to this. The TMC and police are synonymous."Reacting to this, Bengal BJP's chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, "Suvendu Adhikari is a seasoned politician. He made the statements at a political rally. If the police can lodge cases against Adhikari why is Mukul Roy being spared? After joining the BJP (in 2017) he told a television channel that his phone was tapped by the TMC government."Roy, who was a national vice-president of the BJP, returned to the TMC on June 11 along with his son.The TMC reacted sharply saying the video confirms the illegal use of Pegasus by the BJP.“Adhikari should be arrested immediately and interrogated in custody. He has proved that Pegasus was used to snoop on many people, including Abhishek Banerjee. This is a heinous crime. The Centre is misusing its powers,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh.Two senior state BJP leaders, who did not want to be identified, said they would not comment on his statements.Adhikari is a legislator from East Midnapore’s Nandigram where he defeated the chief minister in the recent assembly polls by 1,958 votes. His father and one of his brothers are TMC Lok Sabha MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/suvendu-adhikari-s-remark-on-abhishek-banerjee-s-phone-records-adds-to-pegasus-row-101626777216395.html

Such an approach will also contribute to the “economic upliftment” of Deoghar, the letter added.For Jharkhand,especially in and around Santhal Pargana, AIIMS Deoghar will be a platform of excellence in both medical education & public health.However I have raised my concerns with @mansukhmandviya ‘ji on under-representation of our local people in employment of staff in AIIMS pic.twitter.com/1HWmQfXdPxThe chief minister also stated that the Jharkhand government is “committed” to providing employment opportunities to the local citizens, and accordingly had set up the Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2021. This bill permits 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs with a remuneration of up to ₹30,000 for local people, Soren’s letter highlighted.“I request you to look into this issue as a matter of great urgency and importance and ensure that the local people of Jharkhand are employed to ensure engagement with the local community,” Soren’s letter mentioned.The central government had announced the establishment of an AIIMS in Jharkhand in the 2017-18 Union budget.

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination campaign in Mumbai from Aug 1: Maharashtra govt tells Bombay HC||The Maharashtra government and the Mumbai civic body told the Bombay High Court on Tuesday that they would start door-to-door vaccination against Covid-19 for bed-ridden and immobile people in the city as a pilot project from August 1. The court expressed its satisfaction and said, “The Union government did not rise to the occasion. However, the state government has risen to the occasion and today there is some light at the end of the tunnel.”Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the state government, told a division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni that initially the plan was to start the home vaccination drive in Pune, but it has been changed to Mumbai considering the response received from such people. Kumbhakoni told the court that the government has received 3,505 responses in Mumbai from people who are bed-ridden or immobile and hence, unable to travel to the vaccination centres. He said a policy to this effect would be issued by the government and the home vaccination drive would begin from August 1 in Mumbai. As per the policy, people who are completely bed-ridden, immobile or suffering from some terminal illness shall be eligible for home vaccination. The court said the government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) can begin the home vaccination drive for bed-ridden and immobile people from August 1, and a status report shall be filed by August 6 on its progress. "We hope and trust that the state government and the BMC shall leave no stone unturned to ensure that the eligible bed-ridden and immobile individuals will also have the benefit of Covid-19 vaccine,” the court said. The HC said the home inoculation drive shall also include those bed-ridden and immobile people who have somehow managed to get the first dose of the vaccine. Kumbhakoni said they will be included and the vaccines would be free of cost, as is being done in all government and civic-run hospitals. The court was hearing a petition filed by two advocates, seeking a direction to the Union and state governments to start door-to-door inoculation against Covid-19 for senior citizens above the age of 75, specially-abled people and those who are bed-ridden and hence, unable to go to vaccination centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doortodoor-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-in-mumbai-from-aug-1-maharashtra-govt-tells-bombay-hc-101626770023765.html
20-07-2021||Patna||Patna HC quashes blacklisting of firm, orders fresh bidding for NMCG project||The Patna high court has come down heavily on Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (BUIDCo) for disqualifying a bidder M/S EMS Infracon Pvt. Ltd on the basis of a complaint alleging fact-fudging from an unknown source. BUIDCo had also served a show-cause notice to the company without enclosing the copy of the complaint, and directed the technical tender committee of the government to revisit the technical bid evaluation reports (TBER) for a ₹300 crore World Bank-funded sewage and sewerage project in Hajipur.“The Court is of the considered opinion that BUIDCo has acted irresponsibly in passing the impugned order in casual and cavalier manner, which has serious adverse consequences not only in respect of the petitioner’s eligibility to participate in the bid with others in government contracts, but has also adversely affected the progress of the project in question,” said justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh, setting aside the blacklisting order and ordering fresh evaluation of bids by a committee under the development commissioner, not urban development secretary. The order was passed on Monday.Also Read | Ahead of Eid-al-Adha, Covid norms ignored in Patna’s goat market“Let a fresh evaluation of the technical bid be done by a technical committee with the Development Commissioner, Bihar, as its Chairman and Executive Director, Technical, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) as one of the members. The Development Commissioner shall be at liberty to reconstitute Technical Tender Committee for the purpose of said evaluation. It will be open for the Technical Tender Committee to take into account the facts mentioned in the show cause notice and the petitioner’s reply thereto, keeping also in mind this Court’s observation, for the limited purpose of evaluation of technical bid of the work in question; if permitted under the model bid document and other arrangements under which the project is to be implemented to disqualify the petitioner. It is expected that the Chairman and other members of the Technical Tender Committee shall go into wider aspects of the matter in accordance with the mandatory requirements under World Bank’s Guidelines January, 2011. Considering the dateline for finalisation of the tender as noted in the letter of the World Bank dated June 15, 2021, the Court expects that the meeting of the Technical Tender Committee be held, if not before, by Thursday,” the court said.Since three orders blacklisting the bidders by the same chief engineer were found illegal and quashed by the court, the bench left it to the development commissioner to consider whether he should be allowed to participate as a member of the technical tender committee for evaluation of the technical bid and whether there is any chance of his view being biased because of the facts and circumstances of this case recounted herein above.“The impugned order of blacklisting dated March 4, 2021 is hereby set aside. It is clarified that the court is interfering with the impugned order mainly for four reasons, viz. it does not duly consider the petitioner‘s explanation submitted the in response to the show cause notice, it has referred to a new fact which was not part of the show cause notice, it has completely ignored the observations made by this court in its previous order and the most importantly, the Chief Engineer had an obligation to record a finding on the applicability of Bihar Contractor Registration Rules, which is in the nature of executive instructions for taking action in relation to the bid process in question where as tender documents is based on model tender document set by NMCG in funding arrangement from the World Bank, a plea which was specifically taken in the reply to the show cause notice. This aspect goes to the root of the matter, which has been completely ignored. The Technical Tender Committee shall be obliged to consider all communications received from NMCG in this regard. ” the court said. “The court has not given complete clean chit to the petitioner and that BUIDCo shall be at liberty to act in accordance with law in this regard and issue to the petitioner a fresh show-cause notice, if black-listing is proposed under Bihar Contractor Registration Rules, 2007. Before issuance of such show cause notice, however, the competent authority shall be obliged to record a finding that the said executive instruction is applicable even in respect of the externally aided project in question,” it added.Petitioners’ counsel and former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay said that BUIDCo exercised the power of blacklisting only for the purpose of keeping the petitioner out of competition in the tender process. He submitted that the chain of events show that the blacklisting order was passed hurriedly, overreaching the direction of NMCG and the World Bank on the pretext that funding share of the state government was also there to the extent of 30%. Advocate general Lalit Kishore appeared for BUIDCo and defended the decision. The court said that the technical tender of the petitioner had been rejected on some other grounds and though by a subsequent letter dated August 14, 2020, the secretary, urban development and housing department, government of Bihar, and the programme director, SMCG, were asked to revisit the TBER with respect to M/s EMS, those points, which were the basis for rejecting the petitioner’s tender documents, were overlooked and BUIDCo put the petitioner on notice for proposed blacklisting through the show-cause notice dated October 31, 2020, on different grounds altogether.“I must record that if the State of Bihar or any of its undertakings intend to have or adopt any document in the form of Act, rules, regulations, notifications or guidelines for the purpose of blacklisting a contractor, the same must be clear and structured in its form as half-baked arrangement of casually adopting an executive instruction issued by the Road Construction Department for all works and projects under the State Government or its undertakings, in Court’s opinion, does not go well, keeping in mind steep rise in infrastructure development projects,” the court said.The petitioner, aggrieved by a BUIDCo order to blacklist it on March 4, 2021, that rendered it disqualified for award of any contract by BUIDCo for a term of one year, sought that Bihar Contractor Registration Rules, 2007 (Public Works Department) was ultra vires and not enforceable to the extent the same was repugnant to the provisions of Bihar Financial Rules, 1950. It challenged the legality of the TBER of the BUIDCo for a World Bank-funded Ganga River Basin Project in Hajipur, citing its representations along with the letters of the other functionaries of the government of India, government of Bihar as well as the director, NMCG, New Delhi, and team leader, World Bank, New Delhi, asserting that it was wrongly disqualified by the bid evaluation committee. The director (projects), NMCG, addressed a letter August 14, 2020 to the secretary, urban development and housing department, government of Bihar, to consider the petitioner’s bid for the project, but BUIDCo again disqualified it, which the petitioner said seemed to help other competitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-hc-quashes-blacklisting-of-firm-orders-fresh-bidding-for-nmcg-project-101626774094317.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Bargari sacrilege: Punjab Police SIT files chargesheet against 4 dera men||The Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege incidents on Tuesday filed a chargesheet in a Faridkot court against four Dera Sacha Sauda followers for pasting derogatory posters near the gurdwaras of Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in Faridkot district on September 24, 2015. However, the SIT has not named Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in this case so far. Sources said the SIT is looking for clinching evidence before naming the dera head. Also read: Sidhu shown black flags by farmers protesting against farm laws in Punjab3 absconding dera members named conspirators The chargesheet was filed in the court of judicial magistrate Tarjani against Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, and Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola, both residents of Kotkapura, Shakti Singh of Daggu Romana village and Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village in Faridkot district. The SIT has also named dera follower Mohinder Pal Singh Bittu, who was killed in Nabha jail, and three absconding members of the Sirsa-based dera’s national committee as conspirators in the case. They are Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kaler and Harsh Dhuri, all residents of Haryana. The challan was filed under Sections 295-A (malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120-B (being party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) and 153-A (promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence or language etc) of the Indian Penal Code. Sacrilege threat if MSG-2 film release stalled The SIT said that Sukhjinder wrote the posters and pasted two of them on the gate of the gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala along with Ranjit. “Shakti brought A-4 size papers and the marker from the stationary shop of Gopal at Bargari. He along with Baljit pasted the poster at the Bargari gurdwara,” the SIT found. In the three posters, it was threatened that the “bir (copy)” of Guru Granth Sahib stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015, would be torn if the Gurmeet Ram Rahim film Messenger of God (MSG)-2 was not allowed to be released in Punjab. Court dismisses dera follower’s plea The move comes a day after the Punjab and Haryana high court dismissed Sukhjinder’s plea, challenging the SIT’s action of resending his handwriting samples to match it with the writings on the derogatory posters at Bargari village to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh. During the July 9 hearing the court had taken up Sukhjinder’s plea and restrained the SIT from submitting a chargesheet. The restraining order was lifted after his plea was dismissed. On June 1 this year, the SIT collected samples of Sukhjinder to match them with the writing on the derogatory posters, claiming that one of the posters was written by him. The CFSL report is pending. SIT probing three interlinked sacrilege cases The SIT led by then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra had in 2018 found that the handwriting of the dera followers matched with the ones on the posters. But the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019, said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the CFSL in Delhi did not match with the ones on the posters. The SIT, led by inspector general, border range, SPS Parmar, is probing three interlinked sacrilege cases. The first case pertains to the theft of the “bir” from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala near Kotkapura in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. The second is the putting up of derogatory posters at Bargari village on September 25, 2015, and the third is the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as torn pages of the “bir” were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari on October 12, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-punjab-police-sit-files-chargesheet-against-4-dera-men-101626773854468.html

20-07-2021||Delhi||3 Delhi children get ₹16 crore drug for fatal genetic disease||One-year-old Zuha’s mother Ayesha, both of whom go by one name, thought the child would meet the same fate as her brother. The boy, born in 2018, died just six months later because of a genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a progressive condition that affects the nerves that signal the muscle, leading to muscular weakness. Children with Type 1 severe SMA, accounting for 60% of those with SMA, die within the first two years of life after the respiratory muscles weaken. “She was normal for two months but after that, her activities reduced significantly. That’s when we suspected she might have SMA just like her brother. We got her tested and by October, we had a diagnosis of Type 1 SMA,” said Ayesha. This time, however, there was a treatment. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the gene therapy-based medicine, Zolgensma, in 2019. The medicine replaces the defective SMN 1 gene, thereby producing the protein needed to keep the connection to the muscles alive. But the single dose therapy costs ₹16 crore. “We had given up hope. That’s when I saw the news about a baby from Mumbai whose parents crowd-funded the treatment,” said Ayesha. Also Read | Scientifically Speaking : Identifying genetic superpowers in peopleZuha is one of the first three babies in Delhi to receive the therapy at Sir Ganga Ram hospital three weeks ago. “The medicine is expensive, but we were able to get it through the managed access programme of Novartis, the company that manufactures the drug; it is a lottery system of free doses for those who cannot afford it,” said Dr Ratna Puri, chairperson of the Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics at Sir Ganga Ram hospital. She said, “This is a game-changer. This is the first time a therapy exists for children who would have died otherwise. The babies are now doing well and the mothers have reported some increase in activities –one child can hold their milk bottle, another is using their leg. Of course, it is early and the children will have to continue physiotherapy.” Ahmedi Khatun’s 1.5-year-old could not stand or sit up properly. “Everyone kept saying that it was because he was healthy. But, I had my doubts. Two of my older daughters were also born healthy but by his age they could walk. So, I decided to take him to a doctor in Benaras who told us he has a rare disease and asked us to come to Delhi for the treatment,” said Ahmedi. She too was able to get the medicine through lottery system. The third child to receive the therapy is a one-year-old with type 1 SMA. The doctors refused to give any details without the parents’ consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-delhi-children-get-rs-16-crore-drug-for-fatal-genetic-disease-101626762453766.html

The Border Roads Organisation that built the tunnel over a decade since 2010 excavated 15 lakh cubic metres of earth and dumped it at the landfill site at Sissu near the tunnel’s North Portal. The Indian Army has already created a lake near the South Portal about 10km away by tapping a rivulet. Also read: ‘Congress still not out of coma’: PM Modi at BJP parliamentary party meetingThe Himachal Pradesh government has asked the BRO to return the land allocated for activities related to the construction of the tunnel. The Lahaul and Spiti district administration had given 34.87 hectares. “We have asked the BRO to return the land allocated to it for different activities to set up a tourism village,” said Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar. Walking trails to vistadome buses When contacted, state tourism director Amit Kashyap said, “Nayi rahein nayi manzilein (New routes, new destinations). The tourism village will have cafes, walking trails, eateries and a hotel, too. There will be rural haat (exhibition area) where tribal residents of the region can display and sell local organic produce besides articles of traditional attire and accessories.” Once the plan is ready, the government will apply for forest clearances. The government plans to run vistadome buses with a glass rooftop for a panoramic view through the region. The bus will ply through the 8.8-km tunnel between Manali and Leh. There are plans to develop ski slopes at Tiling village in Lahaul to boost tourism in the Himalayan valley. Tiling, which has a population of 35 people according to the 2011 census, is 2km from the North Portal. Tourist footfall on the rise The ₹32,000-crore tunnel has shortened the 474-km distance between Manali and Leh by 46km and has further cut short the journey by two-and-a-half hours. The tourism potential can be gauged from the fact that a record 6,400 vehicles crossed the all-weather Atal Tunnel on July 18. The tourist footfall has been on a rise since the Covid restrictions were lifted as the second wave subsided in June. After the opening of the tunnel in October last year, more than 3.45 lakh vehicles have crossed the tunnel. “Normally, the number of vehicles crossing the tunnel ranges between 600 and 2,300 vehicles a day,” says superintendent of police Manav Verma. The government plans to improve amenities, including building toilet facilities, for tourists as littering and waste disposal have emerged as concerns along the Manali-Leh highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rohtang-tunnel-landfill-to-be-developed-into-tourism-village-101626761254618.html

20-07-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC judge criticises acting chief over case transfer ‘modus operandi’||A Calcutta high court judge on Monday criticised acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and the court administration over “whimsical modus operandi” after a case the former was hearing was “suddenly” transferred to a division bench even as it did not have the jurisdiction to take up the matter. In his 10-page order, justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya noted “chutzpah is probably not appreciated in the higher echelons of power” and added that “opacity creates whispers in the corridors and is not healthy for a judicial system”. He said that “do not wash your dirty linen in public” is a nice defence for the “beneficiaries of an oppressive/corrupt system” but it is an anathema to “transparency, which is in-built in the concept of the judiciary being the last bastion of democracy”.The case was transferred days after Bhattacharyya on Friday directed the central project coordinator in charge of the virtual hearing to explain why technical glitches have become a regular feature. He asked why proceedings should not be drawn up against the court administration, including the registrar general and the central project coordinator, in particular, for criminal contempt of court. “I categorically refuse to be a part of such circus because I have taken an oath to deliver justice to the litigants, who are outside the courtrooms and beyond the reaches of the air-conditioned rooms accommodating the Judges and toiling in the sun and the dust outside,” he said in his July 16 order. “I personally feel guilty, as a part of this court, since disruption and interference in the functioning of courts, in whatever form, might amount to criminal contempt. I am a party to such an act as a part of the showcase of Judges who are adorning this court, including the Chief Justice.”Bhattacharyya on Monday said at no point of time was he ever contacted to seek either his consent or shown the courtesy of informing him about the transfer. “I have serious doubts about the transparency of the system of dispensation of justice in our court in view of the... chain of events. Hence, I feel it my duty to inform all the beneficiaries and victims of such translucence in the system...,” he said.Also Read | Aspiring police constables chased away by real ones during agitation in Kolkata“I was amazed when my officer...intimated me that the RG (registrar general) had been directed to call for the records, to be allocated before a division bench, despite my judicial order dated July 16, 2021, on the instruction of the Hon’ble the Acting Chief Justice of this court. A copy of the letter, allegedly written and signed by the Hon’ble Acting Chief Justice, who was not even present in Kolkata due to a personal bereavement in the family, was also sent via WhatsApp and forwarded to me,” he said. He added in his previous order on July 16, he made “certain caustic comments” against the court administration including the registrar general”.Bhattacharyya underlined the chief justice (including acting chief justice) is the “Master of the Roster” and “more equal among equals”. He added the “equality pertains only to the Administrative Side of this court and cannot override the Appellate Side Rules, framed and modified by the Full Court comprised of all Judges of this Hon’ble Court”.“There is doubt as to whether the Chief Justice/Acting Chief Justice, in her/his administrative capacity as the Master of the Roster, can override a judicial order passed by a Bench having determination, fixed by the Chief 4 Justice/Acting Chief Justice herself/himself, and the file of the matter be assigned to some other court overnight,” said Bhattacharyya in the order uploaded on the court’s website late on Monday.He said the Appellate Side Rules of the court clearly provide that these matters “are to be heard by single judges, coupled with the fact...that this court had determination on both the relevant dates to take up such matters”. Bhattacharyya added the “Master of Roster‟ concept cannot be equated with the “Master of all I survey”, even as per the Supreme Court’s interpretation. “As per my instruction, my ACO (assistant court officer) indicated to the registrar general (RG), that she should not have the audacity or the gall to dictate as to what matter shall be allocated to each Bench, particularly in the teeth of a judicial order dated July 16...”He cited the restricted hearings to virtual appearances and added access to justice is being denied to most litigants and advocates from distant places, who are technically and financially challenged. “A coterie of members of the Bar and a limited few of the litigants are having an undue monopoly by running the virtual show, thereby depriving the common citizen of access to justice before this court, which is included in their right to life and equality before the law as guaranteed by the Constitution,” he said.“I sincerely hope that the uploading of this order will, at least, not be prevented by the powers-that-be, so that the contents of the order may appear in the public domain.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-judge-criticises-acting-chief-over-case-transfer-modus-operandi-101626753333145.html

In a 198-seat hall, this is no embarrassment. Since a crowd is actively discouraged in these times of social distancing, only a few invites were sent on WhatsApp. A mobile phone camera has been set up to stream the proceedings live on Facebook.This is the first literary meet of the Ghalib Academy following the pandemic’s deadly second surge that began in April. Held once a month on a Friday evening, poets, writers and readers from across the city gather at this central Delhi hall, and read/hear fresh compositions on the stage. This has been a tradition for 25 years in the literary institution. It was set up 52 years ago to celebrate the life of Delhi’s great poet. Ghalib’s grave lies in a courtyard nearby.The masked attendees include poet Gulshan Rai Kanwal (in a magnificent long tie), who has come from Punjabi Bagh extension, writer Chashma Faruqui from Zakir Nagar, poet Naseem Begum from Jasola, poet Sarfaraz Faraz from Jafrabad, artist Ehtram Siddiqui from Laxmi Nagar and poet Mateen Amrohi from H. Nizamuddin West. And of course there is the scholar Aqil Ahmad, the academy’s long-time very-unassuming secretary who launches the proceedings by noting that everyone present here, both offline and online, personally knows of at least one person lost to Covid-19. He recalls some of the departed who were regulars to this Friday tradition—professor emeritus Shamim Hanfi, short story writer Anjum Usmani, novelist Tarannum Riyaz and poet Naseem Abassi (the list is long).Later, Chashma Faruqui gets up to read a paper on her late father, a writer and journalist.In the lobby outside, a framed panel displays old photos of various meets—each picture shows crowds without masks.

The app, which was launched in February this year, has helped solve several such cases. “So far, the data of about 3,300 persons (missing and found) has been uploaded in the app. The app uses facial recognition to connect databases of missing children or elderly persons. It is also useful in case of unidentified bodies,” said police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal.Users can search the database with case ID, text search and image search using different filters such as age, gender, date when the person went missing etc. The reports can be easily downloaded in PDF format and shared over different platforms.

The work order for the project was issued last week and construction is set to begin soon.Will restore C&D waste into sand, gravelThe plant will be commissioned within six months and the contractor hired for the project will supply, install, commission, operate and maintain the plant for a period of five years. The contractor will also be responsible for restoring the C&D waste into sand and gravel, which the civic body will procure.Will help check pollutionThe plant will come as a major relief for residents who have been raising a hue and cry over the dumping of C&D waste at vacant plots and green zones of various parts of the city, including the cremation ground road in Model Town Extension, Dugri, Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar, Focal Point, Haibowal among other areas.Dumping of waste in the open also leads to air pollution. During a virtual meeting held on May 21, the monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the MC to start operations of the C&D waste plant within three months, otherwise a penalty of ₹2 lakh will be imposed on the civic body. Arvind Sharma, a resident of SBS Nagar, said, “We have been regularly complaining about dumping of construction waste by building contractors. It creates unhygienic conditions and encourages others to do the same.” Karandeep Singh, a resident of Model Town Extension Block-B, said, “The green belts on the cremation ground road have been lying in shambles for a long time.

If maintained properly, the area can be developed as a place where residents can spend leisure time with their families.”As per officials, the MC will also be purchasing dumpers and JCB machines under the Smart City project for shifting waste dumped in different parts of the city to the plant.MC commissioner-cum-chief executive officer (CEO) of Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) Pardeep Sabharwal said the plant will help the civic body in reducing pollution. The civic body has already designated six sites for dumping C&D waste. These are located on the Chandigarh Road, Dhandari Kalan, Rahon Road, Barewal among other areas. Those caught dumping waste in green belts or open plots will be penalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-issues-work-orders-for-c-d-waste-plant-in-city-101626723753003.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Building bridges with Capt, putting Congress’s house in order key challenges for Sidhu||Former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu has been keen to head the Punjab Congress to set himself up for the chief minister’s post if the party wins in 2022.On Sunday, he was named president of the state unit by the Congress leadership despite a stiff opposition from chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. The elevation has come as a huge boost for the cricketer-turned-politician who is considered close to former party president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.But there are several challenges tied to the reins of the party and the state polls are just seven months away. The first and foremost task before the 57-year-old Amritsar East MLA is to build bridges with the veteran leader who is angry over the former’s “derogatory” tweets and remarks against him.Amarinder had told All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat, who informed him about the impending changes, on Saturday that he would meet Sidhu only after a public apology from him. Sidhu had, in his tweets and interviews, accused Capt of colluding with the Badals and allowing mafia raj.Accompanied by a few young MLAs, Sidhu traveled to Chandigarh and Mohali and visited several party leaders on Monday, but he has not responded to the CM’s demand as a public apology would mean recantation of his accusations. The former minister will need to find a way to reach out to the CM to mend relations with him for cohesion, not just the customary photo-op, now that he heads the state unit, said two senior party leaders.Former Union minister Ashwani Kumar said this is a time to be united and reconciliation is the way forward, appealing to both sides to show magnanimity. The two-month-long factional war, which saw a number of other seniors, including some ministers, MPs and some traditional Congressmen, oppose his promotion, has made the cadres and leaders apprehensive about the party’s poll prospects.The Congress’ rivals, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), are already sensing an opportunity in the Congress infighting.Though the former TV commentator is a tireless campaigner with crowd-pulling capacity, he will need to take everyone along, besides addressing issues related to caste and religious equations, to build a winning campaign. Both Amarinder and Sidhu are Jat Sikhs and belong to Patiala. The party high command has also attempted to strike a balance by appointing four working presidents. Another challenge that he faces now is his position on issues, including Bargari sacrilege, drugs, mafia and power purchase agreements (PPAs), on which he attacked the government.“The question is will he (Sidhu) continue to target the CM or focus on poll agenda and preparations? The onus is on him. A party is like a cart pulled by two bulls. If they start pulling it in different directions, it gets stuck,” said one of the leaders quoted above. Also, the new job will put to test his organisational and election management capabilities like never before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/building-bridges-with-capt-putting-cong-s-house-in-order-key-challenges-for-sidhu-101626723751789.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Meet the new Punjab Congress working presidents||Kuljit Singh Nagra, Fatehgarh Sahib MLAFrom being a student union leader at Khalsa College, Chandigarh, to working president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, it is no less than meteoric rise for Kuljit Singh Nagra (56), the Fatehgarh Sahib MLA who comes from a non-political family. Considered close to the party leadership, particularly former president Rahul Gandhi, Nagra is associated with All India Congress Committee (AICC) communication head Randeep Singh Surjewala since college days. Nagra remained Punjab Youth Congress general secretary from 1995 to 1997 and later general secretary of the India Youth Congress besides being a senate member of Panjab University, Chandigarh. He caught Rahul Gandhi’s attention in 2007 when he spoke on the farmers’ issues. He was made vice-president of the party’s kisan cell. He managed to get ticket from Fatehgarh Sahib in 2012 and defeated Akali heavyweight Prem Singh Chandumajra. He was re-elected in 2017. “My appointment as PPCC working president is a testimony to the fact that any ordinary worker can reach up to any level in the party, provided you work with dedication. I considered myself among grassroots workers who are the backbone of a party,” said two-time MLA and AICC secretary Nagra, thanking Rahul Gandhi.Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Jandiala Guru MLAJandiala Guru MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny, also known as Danny Bandala, has been appointed as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) working president at a relatively young age of 43. Though there are other senior Congress leaders like Amritsar east MLA Raj Kumar Verka and Attari MLA Tarsem Singh DC from the scheduled caste (SC) community in the Majha region, the party high command preferred him for the post in an attempt to woo the Dalits. His proximity with Rahul Gandhi is also believed to have played a role in his new appointment.Sukhwinder’s father and two-time Congress MLA late Sardool Singh Bandala was a minister in the previous Congress government led by Amarinder Singh from 2002 to 2007. The Bandala junior was among the Youth Congress leaders who were fielded by Rahul Gandhi in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections but he lost from the Faridkot segment. He, however, scraped through in the 2017 assembly elections and defeated SAD’s Dalbir Singh. He was Youth Congress vice-president from 2005 to 2014 and served as a member of the Committee on Welfare of SCs, STs and BCs of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha (2017-2019). Pawan Goel, former PPCC general secretaryPawan Goel is the only Hindu face and a non-MLA among four newly appointed working presidents of the Punjab Pradesh Congress committee (PPCC). The 65-year-old low-key leader, Goel, who hails from Jaitu in Faridkot district, comes from a family of traditional Congressmen. His father Lala Bhagwan Dass was elected MLA from Kotkapura in 1980 and served in the cabinet of then chief minister Darbara Singh for two years starting 1981 (the Darbara Singh government resigned and President’s rule was imposed in Punjab in 1983). He also served as PPCC vice-president from 1985 to 1988. Dass was assassinated by Sikh militants in 1988. His family had close ties with former chief ministers Beant Singh and Rajinder Kaur Bhathal. Goel is considered to be close to the CM Capt Amarinder Singh. He was general secretary of PPCC, which was dissolved in 2020. Goel also served as Faridkot Congress president between 2006 and 2011. He, however, never got a chance to contest an assembly election but his recent appointment has made him a frontrunner for Congress ticket from Kotkapura in the assembly elections. Sangat Singh Gilzian, Urmur MLAGilzian, 68, a three-time MLA from the Urmur assembly segment in Hoshiarpur district, began his political journey at the grassroots level when he was elected sarpanch of his village in the 1990s. One of the few MLAs who first joined ranks with Navjot Singh Sidhu against Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, Gilzian lost his first election from Urmur in 2002 by a small margin. During the 2007 assembly, the Congress denied him party ticket but he chose to contest as an independent and won with a margin of over 10,000 votes. Till he rejoined the Congress-fold in 2009, his supporters managed to stage an impressive victory in the Tanda municipal elections despite the fact that the Shiromani Akali Dal was in power. The backward class (BC) community leader has retained the Urmur assembly seat since 2007. He resigned from party posts in 2018 after he was not included in the expanded state cabinet and accused the party of “ignoring” the backward classes in the government, underlining that he is a senior legislator from the Doaba region. “I have been serving the people since I became sarpanch. We will take our workers along and form government in 2022,” he said.

20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu in Chandigarh but no meeting with Capt||A day after he became the new Punjab Congress president, expectation was that Navjot Singh Sidhu will call on chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.Sidhu, whose appointment was announced on Sunday night, spent the entire day visiting cabinet ministers and other senior leaders of the party in Chandigarh and Mohali, but their much-anticipated meeting did not materialise even though they were within a few hundred meters of each other at one point of time.The new state Congress head was with leaders at cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s house, whereas the chief minister was having a meeting with MLAs from Patiala district at his official residence. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring had indicated earlier that the two leaders would meet.Sidhu returned to Patiala after meeting dozens of party leaders in the tricity and will travel to Amritsar on Tuesday. Both sides later said there was no meeting planned or requested.Monday’s developments are sign that the crisis is still simmering. Amarinder, who had opposed Sidhu’s appointment, is furious with the Amritsar East MLA for making “derogatory” tweets and statements against him. The CM told Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, one of the three persons tasked with resolving the crisis in the Congress, that he would met Sidhu only after a public apology from him.Till Monday night, there was no apology or response from the new appointee on his demand.Amarinder has not put out a tweet or statement to welcome the changes so far whereas Congress’ other two CMs Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan) and Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) congratulated Sidhu on Twitter.Earlier, Sidhu arrived in Chandigarh in the morning and met former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, assembly speaker Rana KP Singh, former PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar and cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Razia Sultana and Charanjit Singh Channi. Jakhar, Randhawa and some MLAs joined him as he went around meeting other leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-in-chandigarh-but-no-meeting-with-capt-101626723630432.html
20-07-2021||Other||Day after Sidhu’s elevation as PPCC chief, his posters emerge in Ludhiana||A day after Navjot Singh Sidhu was named the president of Punjab Pardesh Congress Committee (PPCC), his posters have begun to emerge on the outskirts of the city. One such hoarding was placed near Ram Nagar Chowki following Sidhu’s elevation.Recently, Sidhu’s posters installed by Jasraj Grewal, a resident of Dugri, were found torn, triggering speculations that local Congress leaders were unhappy with Sidhu taking over the role ahead of the assembly elections slated for 2022. Meanwhile, the district Congress unit conducted customary celebrations after Sidhu’s elevation as PPCC chief but the legislators remained conspicuous by their absence.District Congress Committee (urban) president Ashwani Sharma said it was an informal programme. “We are in touch with the newly appointed PPCC chief and are planning for a grand reception once he arrives in the city. All the MLAs’ will also be present during the occasion,” said Sharma.Sidhu elevation has baffled opposition parties. And the selection of four working presidents has strengthened the party’s structure in the run-up to the elections.No hard feelings against Sidhu: PandeyWhen contacted for comments on the developments, Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey said the party has a democratic setup. “The decision high command is acceptable to all. The rest depends on a person’s work and results,” he said.Recently, Sidhu had courted a controversy when he questioned his own government’s decision of offering a government job, as Naib Tehsildar, to Pandey’s son Bhisham on compassionate grounds.Pandey had strongly reacted to this. “I still maintain that the job was well deserved. It was a goodwill gesture by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to honour the sacrifice my father had made for restoring peace in the state,” said Pandey.Terrorists had killed then MLA and towering Congress leader Joginder Pal Pandey (Rakesh Pandey’s father) in 1987.Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan, Ashu, Sanjay Talwar remained incommunicado. Kuldeep Vaid, Gurkirat Singh Kotli and Lakhvir Singh Lakha were visiting Chandigarh to congratulate the newly appointed PPCC chief.Before taking over the charge of PPCC chief, Sidhu had visited Gurkirat Singh Kotli’s house on Sunday. Kotli is also the cousin of Congress MP from Ludhiana, Ravneet Singh Bittu.Bittu has been critical of Sidhu and has been siding with the Amarinder camp.Both Kotli and Lakha introduced Sidhu to the party workers. Later both MLAs’, along with district planning board chairman MLA Malkit Singh Dakha, conducted a meeting.After an hour hour-long meeting Lakha and Kotli sang paeans of Sidhu and termed him a charismatic leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-sidhu-s-elevation-as-ppcb-chief-his-posters-emerge-in-ludhiana-101626723510248.html

The child, Agrima, a student of Class 4, was last seen leaving with her father, Bhupinder Bhandari, 40, in their car on July 17. On Monday, the driver of a Shatabi Express discovered his body after it was dragged for several metres by the train.A bag with an Aadhaar card was found near the body that helped the Zirakpur police identify Bhandari, following which the Panchkula police were alerted. “We have confirmed that the deceased is Bhandari. We are suspecting that he died by suicide, but the Mohali police will carry out investigation in the case as the body was found in Ghazipur area of Zirakpur,” said Arvind Kamboj, SHO of the Chandimandir police station.Mohali police have initiated inquest proceedings in the matter. Meanwhile, police sources said the post-mortem report of the child had revealed strangulation as the cause of death. The family originally hailed from Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Bhandari used to run coaching classes in Panchkula. The victim’s mother is a clerk with a Haryana power body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/murdered-panchkula-girl-s-father-found-dead-in-mohali-101626723450301.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Revised EWS housing policy: GMADA initiates process to construct 5K houses in Mohali||With the Punjab government notifying the revised economically weaker section (EWS) housing policy recently, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has initiated the process to construct 5,000 houses in the first phase. The Punjab cabinet had approved the policy in February. GMADA will construct a total of 22,000 houses. The process had been hanging fire for the last six years. Five years ago, the development authority had got back 230 acres of land from 46 builders in the district as part of EWS housing policy, but failed to build any dwelling unit. Pradeep Aggarwal, chief administrator of GMADA, said that they have floated a request for proposal (RFP) to engage a project management company (PMC) for construction of around 5,000 flats in the first phase. As per GMADA’s plan, four-storeyed houses will be constructed over 54 acres at four of its townships — Aerocity (13.49 acres), IT City (17.48 acres), Eco City-1 (3.6 acres), and Eco City-2 (20.17 acres). The flats will be sold to the financially-backward for around ₹10 lakh per unit. What the new policy states These houses will be constructed in reasonably-sized pockets with social infrastructure such as schools, community centres and dispensaries at convenient locations to ensure comfortable living. They will be constructed using latest brickless technology and offered to eligible families and financed by banks at affordable monthly instalment rates. Eligible applicants will have to furnish proof of birth in Punjab or of 10-year stay in the state. The family’s income should not exceed ₹3 lakh per annum from all sources, as revised by the central or Punjab government from time to time. The applicants, their spouse or minor child must not already own freehold/leasehold residential plot/dwelling unit in Punjab or Chandigarh, and the applicant will be required to self-certify on these counts. Policy revised thrice in 12 years In a 2008 cabinet meeting, the Punjab Housing and Habitat Policy was approved, under which EWS houses were to be built. But, most builders had shirked responsibility. Thereupon, GMADA took possession of the land earmarked for EWS houses from private builders. Currently, GMADA has 25 mega projects and more than 100 approved colonies under its ambit. Then, in its 2013 notification, the housing and urban development department told Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA) and other development authorities that if approved builders fail to make houses for the EWS category, they should transfer the land to the government. Again in 2016, it was approved that the land transferred to GMADA by builders may be utilised for other purposes, and the money earned should be used for constructing houses for the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/revised-ews-housing-policy-gmada-initiates-process-to-construct-5k-houses-in-mohali-101626723390562.html

20-07-2021||Other||Day after landslides in Mumbai, BMC and collector’s office pass the buck||Days before the onset of monsoon, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had written to the suburban collector’s office, expressing fear over casualties in case of heavy rainfall. BMC’s S ward, under which Vikhroli and Bhandup fall, had asked the collector’s office to make alternate arrangements for citizens residing on the hilltop, citing there are chances of an untoward incident, as monsoon was about to make landfall in the city.On Sunday, two landslides were reported in the city, of which one took place in Surya Nagar at Vikhroli, where boulders fell due to heavy rain. Around seven to eight houses collapsed in the landslide, killing 10 – including two minors – while one person was injured. Another landslide was reported in New Bharat Nagar area of Mahul at Chembur, that resulted in the collapse of at least five houses and 19 deaths, including of five minors victims. Five more people were injured in the incident. BMC claims S ward officials had written to the collector on June 7, warning of possible mishaps at the two areas where the landslides took place on Sunday, as the illegal structures are on the land owned by the suburban collector. According to the letter, the ward had asked suburban collector Milind Borikar to take the required measures, as monsoon was expected to hit the city anytime soon. Suburban collector Milind Borikar was not available for comment. However, a senior official from his office said, “As per the state government’s directives, it’s BMC’s responsibility to clear encroachment irrespective of title of the land. The deputy collector (encroachment removal) works under housing department and not under the collector. We’ve submitted our detailed reply in a petition in the Bombay high court.”BMC had also written to the disaster management authority, expressing concerns of an untoward incident in the hilltop, where the slums located. “Prepare a plan for rescue operation during any mishap such as landslide, collapse of dilapidated structure removal of material, firefighting measures, rescue of affected people etc and submit it to Hon’ble M.C (municipal commissioner) with your suggestions (sic),” S ward’s letter to the disaster management authority on May 24 read. Rescue operations at both Mahul and Vikhroli seemed difficult owing to the narrow lanes at the site. A civic official from S ward said, “We had written to all the required authorities in advance as around 400,000 people in the ward reside in slums that are mostly located on hilltops. We are ready to give the collector’s office all the support on where to shift citizens who are at landslide-prone areas. For now, we have shifted 30 citizens from Surya Nagar slums to safe locations in civic-run schools.”The suburbs have around 250 landslide spots, of which 150 are in S ward. According to a report prepared by BMC’s disaster management cell, areas around hill slopes in Ghatkopar, Bhandup and Kurla are more prone to landslides, and slum populations residing on these hill slopes are at high risk.Between 2011 and 2018, 16 incidents of landslides were reported in the Island city, while 58 in eastern suburbs and 20 in the western suburbs, in which nine people died and 26 were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-landslides-in-mumbai-bmc-and-collector-s-office-pass-the-buck-101626723096013.html

As per this plan, at least a single dose of Covid vaccine will be mandatory to attend the classes for both students and college staff.As per the data, the response from over 5,000 postgraduate students was received out of which over 50% students are yet to get vaccinated.For more than a year now, city colleges have remained largely shut. Some colleges reopened in November last year, but didn’t evoke much response from the students.When the first wave had subsided in February this year, the administration had decided to reopen all colleges. However, the second wave descended soon after in March, thwarting UT’s plan.UT secretary, education, Sarpreet Singh Gill said, “We have already started camps in colleges. We will issue instructions to colleges making vaccination mandatory for those who want to attend the college.”Covid vaccination camps are already operational at three city colleges, but it is likely that another camp for students may be started. A college principal, on condition of anonymity, said, “The number of students getting vaccinated is increasing daily. We are also urging students to get jabbed so that colleges can function in a hybrid mode.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/36-students-in-chandigarh-colleges-yet-to-receive-covid-shot-101626723095363.html
20-07-2021||Mumbai||Pankaja Munde skips BJP’s OBC morcha||Days after she openly voiced her dissent against state leadership of the party, Bharatiya Janata Party’s national secretary and former state minister Pankaja Munde skipped the party’s day long OBC morcha at its Mumbai office on Monday. Munde’s absence was conspicuous as she had openly expressed her discontent last week after her younger sister and Beed MP Pritam was denied inclusion in the central cabinet during its recent expansion and elevation of another OBC leader from her region, Bhagwat Karad, as a union minister. While expressing her full faith in party’s central leaders prime minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah, Munde had last week hit out, in her veiled attack, at leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. The former chief minister is believed to have played a key role in selecting the MPs inducted from Maharashtra in the Modi cabinet. She even had said that it was not time to quit the party and the decision would be taken at appropriate time. She was addressing her supporters gathered outside her Worli office to registered their protest for the ‘unjust’ decision.Munde is a key leader from the OBC which is the strong base of the BJP. She is the eldest daughter of the late Gopinath Munde, who played a significant role in building the party’s base in Maharashtra. He was also regarded as the most influential OBC leader in the state and is often credited with changing the earlier perception of the BJP that it was a party of a few upper caste communities. After her father’s death in 2014, Pankaja has been fighting to retain his legacy in state politics. Karad’s elevation into the cabinet is seen as an attempt by the state unit leaders of downsizing Mundes who enjoy strong support among OBC communities.Her keeping away from the launch of the OBC Chetan Abhiyaan has raised many eyebrows in the party. The drive was launched in the presence of national general secretary of OBC Morcha Sangamlal Gupta, leader of opposition in Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.Senior BJP leader and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said that Munde will remain in the party till her ‘last breath’. Another party leaders Chandrashekhar Bawankule too was away from the function.Both Munde and Bawankule had attended OBC Chintan Shibir in Lonawala last month along with Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pankaja-munde-skips-bjp-s-obc-morcha-101626723094003.html
20-07-2021||Other||Unsafe buildings pose threat to lives; Ludhiana MC, police fail to take action||The rising number of unsafe buildings in the city continues to pose danger to the lives of residents with the municipal corporation (MC) and police department failing to act against the same. According to a recent survey conducted by MC, the number of such buildings has increased from 113 in 2019 to 132.Many of the buildings are over 100 years old.Rather than taking action against the buildings and the occupants, the civic body has again written to the police department to get them vacated, stating that the civic body has no powers to do it themselves under Municipal Corporation Act, 1976. Further, notices have been issued to the occupants to vacate the buildings, else they will be responsible for any accident caused.Fearing that the buildings might collapse during the monsoon season, the MC has been writing to the police department on the onset of the rainy season for the last few years, but no concrete action has been taken yet.As per the recent survey conducted by MC, out of the total 132 buildings, 64 are situated in Zone A, 21 in Zone B, 14 in Zone C, and 33 in Zone D.The buildings are situated in Chaura Bazar area, Daresi road, Rarri Mohalla, Lakkar Bazar, Field Ganj, Iqbal Ganj Chowk, Moti Nagar, Amarpura, Dashmesh Nagar near Gill chowk, Jawaddi, Barewal, among other areas.One of the MC officials, requesting anonymity, said that many cases of unsafe buildings are sub-judice as owners and tenants are at loggerheads over vacating the building. Due to this, the MC cannot take action against the building. Despite notices served by MC, no tenant or owner vacates the building.A 70-year-old man, Gurcharan Singh, had in 2015 died after a part of an unsafe building collapsed in Thapran Mohalla. In 2018, a part of an unsafe building at Sanglan Shivala Mandir Road had also collapsed.Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust secretary Tribhuvan Thapar said, “Two such buildings are situated in Naughara Mohalla, where the house of martyr Sukhdev Thapar is situated. The buildings can collapse anytime, but the authorities have failed to take any action. They have only served notices to the owners. People do not even go near the buildings when a thunderstorm hits the city suspecting that it might collapse.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that the police department has to get the building vacated as the MC does not have the power to do so. “I will also take up the matter with the commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal,” said Sabharwal.Meanwhile, Agrawal said he will look into the matter as he has not yet seen the letter issued by the MC. “The civic body will also be involved as the unsafe buildings might have to be demolished. The police will assist the MC as these buildings pose danger to lives,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unsafe-buildings-pose-threat-to-lives-ludhiana-mc-police-fail-to-take-action-101626723092828.html

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Hindutva: BJP’s ammo in its fight against Shiv Sena||Amid heavy rain in Mumbai, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday afternoon drove to Pandharpur, the town in western Maharashtra that houses the temple of deity Lord Vithhal, which is visited by millions of devotees in the month of Ashadh as per the Hindu calendar. Thackeray’s travel to Pandharpur to perform the puja at the temple on Tuesday, which is traditionally done by chief minister of the state every year, comes at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to corner the Shiv Sena and question its Hindutva credentials over the curbs imposed on the annual wari (processions of devotees) to Pandharpur and the closure of places of worship due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The BJP alleges the Shiv Sena has diluted its commitment to Hindutva for political expediency—to come to power in Maharashtra with “secular” parties like the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Influential fringe groups like Shivprathisthan Hindustan led by controversial Sambhaji Bhide have also hit the ground over the curbs on the wari and sought the reopening of temples, which may add to the Sena’s difficulties. Like last year, the state has imposed curbs on the Ashadi pilgrimage to Lord Vithhal temple at Pandharpur due to the pandemic. Instead of millions of warkaris (as followers of Warkari sect are called) walking to Pandharpur with palkhis of saints, 10 palkhis will be taken by bus to the temple town in Solapur, with 40 devotees each. Last week, Warkari leader Bandatatya Karhadkar who tried to walk to Pandharpur in violation of these orders, was detained with some associates near Pune. “I do not agree with the excuse about the Covid-19 pandemic. Corona is a hoax meant to loot and scare people,” said Karhadkar, when contacted by HT. “The (Shiv Sena’s) Hindutva has lost its edge… the NCP has suppressed everyone. Thackeray seems to be helpless,” he claimed. Bhide, who has been accused of involvement in the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon riots, met Karhadkar at Karad, where he has been detained, to express solidarity. Bhide’s statements about Covid-19 mirror those of Karhadkar. Bhide, has kicked up a controversy by calling Covid a “hoax” and claimed that the wari must be resumed to end the pandemic globally. “The government could have allowed 50 warkaris to undertake the pilgrimage to Pandharpur. This is a centuries-old tradition that was not disrupted even during the reign of the Mughals, Nizam and the British,” said Acharya Tushar Bhosale of the BJP’s Adhyatmik Aghadi (spiritual front), while attacking the move to detain Karhadkar. Bhosale alleged that the Shiv Sena had diluted its commitment to Hindutva to ally with the Congress and NCP. The Shiv Sena, which was born as a sons-of-soil political party in 1966, made a sharp turn towards majoritarian politics in the 1980s. The use of political Hindutva helped the Shiv Sena cultivate right-leaning voters and the late Sena chief Bal Thackeray emerged as a right-wing mascot. This helped it grow into a pan-Maharashtra entity by expanding outside its traditional stronghold in the Mumbai-Thane belt, where its Marathi manoos agenda had a strong resonance. Now, as an ally of the Congress and NCP, the Shiv Sena is compelled to walk the tightrope on issues of religious assertion and identity to avoid alienating its voters. In October 2020, Governor BS Koshyari had written a scathing letter to Thackeray questioning the government’s decision to not open temples, and had asked him whether he had “turned secular” by abandoning Hindutva. This had prompted the chief minister to retort in a similar vein, stating that he did not need a certificate to validate his pro-Hindutva credentials. Reminding Koshyari that he had taken oath as the governor of the state on the constitution, Thackeray said secularism was the core principle of this constitution. “Bars and wine shops are open, but places of worship are closed. They can be opened at least once a week on particular days like Monday for Shiva temples,” said BJP spokesperson Atul Wagh. “The Shiv Sena is not a Hindutvawadi (pro-Hindutva) but an opportunist party... They strike compromises for power,” he said. A Shiv Sena leader from western Maharashtra, Bhide’s stronghold, said, “The organisation operates like a proxy front by making statements and undertaking activities that the BJP can’t take up directly.” Earlier this year, in the elections to the Pune graduates constituency in the legislative council, the organisation had supported the BJP nominee. A Sena leader admitted the BJP’s campaign about the Pandharpur yatra and the temples was putting the party in a quandary. “The BJP-ruled Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have called off the kanwar yatra over Covid concerns. We may also have to strike a balancing act on issues like the UCC and the family planning policies, which are being seen as reflecting the demographic concerns of the majority community,” the leader said. Arvind Sawant, Shiv Sena Lok Sabha MP and spokesperson, lashed out at the BJP for playing petty politics to cover up for the Central Government’s failures in tackling the Covid crisis, inflation, rise in fuel prices, unemployment and farm distress. PG Jogdand, political analyst and former head, department of sociology, University of Mumbai, said this was part of the larger attempts by the BJP to corner the Shiv Sena and Uddhav on the issue of Hindutva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hindutva-bjp-s-ammo-in-its-fight-against-shiv-sena-101626723034658.html

The overcast weather caused the mercury to plummet to 28.2°C, which is a record low for July. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) head department of climate change and agricultural meteorology Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu said the last time the mercury had plummetted to 28°C was 36 years ago on July 19, 1985. The minimum temperature in the city was 26.2°C. The cloud cover also increased the humidity, which was 84% in the morning and 82% in the evening. The PAU meteorological department said the rainfall received so far was short of the desired target. “The average rainfall seen during the month of July is 217mm, but so far the city has recorded only 72.2 mm of rainfall, which is well below the target,” Sidhu said, adding that the target had been met in June due to the early arrival of monsoon.“The shortfall does not bode well as proper distribution is rainfall is very important. It has been seen that the duration of rainfall has decreased, while its intensity has increased. Heavy rainfall in a few hours leads to waterlogging, which does not allow recharge the ground-water levels,” Sidhu said, adding that it drizzled at isolated places in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-records-36-yr-low-as-mercury-plummets-to-282c-101626723034221.html

This comes two days after municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had during a meeting pulled up building branch officials over mushrooming of illegal colonies. Two colonies each were razed by MC teams in Zone A, B and C, while one in Zone D. They were located in areas like Jassiyan Road, Kakowal Road, Giaspura, near Eastman Chowk, Tibba Road and Barewal. Further, three under construction illegal industrial buildings at Azaad Nagar, Bahadurke Road and Manna Singh Nagar, two under-construction illegal shops at Lohara Road and six illegal commercial constructions at Haibowal and Barewal areas were also razed. They faced resistance from locals in Haibowal, as they tried to stop the demolition drive by standing in front of the JCB machines. But, they were pacified by the police.MC joint commissioner and municipal town panner (MTP) Kulpreet Singh also inspected the demolition drive. Singh said, “Action has been initiated on the directions of Sabharwal and the civic body is also working to conduct a survey of illegal colonies in the city. The drive will continue in the coming days and the residents should also inform us if they have any information about any illegal colony being developed.” During the MC general House meeting on Wednesday, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bhartiya Janata Party councillors (BJP) had slammed the MC over its failure to take action against illegal colonies. They said that the residents living in their areas, especially outer wards of the city, are facing water shortage due to mushrooming of illegal colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-teams-raze-7-illegal-colonies-11-buildings-101626723033146.html

During an interaction with mediapersons, he said, “The descendants of Giani Sant Singh lived in this building. The family vacated the premises after getting compensation from the government in 1988. Nobody raised a hue and cry when the building was razed at that time.” “People should not make a noise over it as no one is constructing personal buildings on the site which will have a jora ghar (where shoes are kept), a gathri ghar (locker) and a two-wheeler parking for the devotees visiting the Sri Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple),” he said.He, however, did not clarify whether the structure should be preserved or not. The family’s ancestors, including Giani Sant Singh have been granthis, preachers and scholars of Sikhism. The family has demanded that the remains of the building be preserved owing to its historic importance. A meeting of Sikh bodies, thinkers and scholars will be held at the Akal Takht on July 26 to discuss sacrilege incidents happening frequently in Punjab, he said. Structure has Damdami Taksal link, says ex-jathedarAkal Takht former jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) executive member Charanjit Singh Jassowal on Monday linked the structure with the Damdami Taksal, a Sikh seminary.

20-07-2021||Mumbai||After season’s hottest day, rain brings down mercury in J&K||A day after witnessing the hottest day of the year so far, monsoon showers lashed parts of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday. With the mercury hovering over 30°C for the last few days, the downpour brought much-needed respite from the heat.  On Sunday, the maximum temperatures in summer capital, Srinagar, and winter capital , Jammu, were 35°C and 36°C, respectively – the highest so far. Kashmir’s Anantnag and Kulgam districts and Kathua in Jammu received heavy rainfall. Kulgam’s Khudwani recorded 81mm rain, Anantnag’s Batkoot 45mm and Kathua received 121mm rain. Jammu recorded 5.1mm rain, while Srinagar logged 0.5 mm precipitation.Flashflood damages homes in Anantnag “In Anantnag, a flashflood in Dadi Canal washed away many trees and damaged a few houses. It also caused a lot of soil erosion,” said a local Mohammad Abbas. Water also entered several houses at Pehru in Anantnag. “The maximum temperature dropped to 27.3°C in Srinagar and 28.2°C in Jammu,” an official of the weather office said. Sonam Lotus, director of the regional meteorological department, said heavy showers could be expected in the region till July 21. “The heavy rainfall may cause flashfloods, waterlogging and landslides,” he said. The weather office has predicted moderate to very heavy rainfall for two more days with the likelihood of it affecting preparations for upcoming festival of Eid-ul-Azha, to be celebrated in J&K from Wednesday. Thousands of sacrifical animals are bought during the festival, but the monsoon may affect sales. The weather office has asked people living at higher reaches to remain cautious while tourists and trekkers have been advised to avoid camping on mountain or riversides. The divisional commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir have also been alerted. The confluence of winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal is likely to cause lightning, thunder and widespread rainfall at most places in Jammu, mainly the Pirpanjal Range, and the Kashmir valley.“We may be celebrating Eid amid the rains. There may be a five-six degree drop in temperatures,” said meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir.The weather office said there may be temporary disruption of traffic mainly on Jammu- Srinagar highway, Srinagar-Leh highway, Doda- Kishtwar Road and Mughal Road.“There are chances of landslides and shooting stones at vulnerable places and water logging and minor floods over low-lying areas. Suspension of agricultural and horticultural operations during the above period is advised,” Mir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-season-s-hottest-day-rain-brings-down-mercury-in-jk-101626722973377.html
20-07-2021||Mumbai||Malaria tests dipped 37.2%, cases rose by 14% in 2020: BMC||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the detection of malaria cases has taken a backseat. The number of tests for malaria in 2020 fell by 37.2% compared to 2019, even as cases increased by 14% last year, as per data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Medical experts said drop in tests is likely to hinder the civic body’s antimalarial drive, which helped in attaining zero casualties caused by the mosquito-borne disease in 2019. In addition, malaria infection among Covid-recovered patients with compromised immunity can prove to be more fatal. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female anopheles mosquitoes. Every year, the city records around 5,500 cases of malaria. The highest number of cases is recorded during monsoon due to stagnant water which turns into breeding grounds for anopheles mosquitoes. Data provided by BMC shows that on an average, over 1 million tests are conducted every year to diagnose malaria patients. However, in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic started, only 882,771 tests were being conducted while, 1,405,758 tests were done in 2019, showing a 37.2% drop in testing last year. Dr T Jacob John, virologist and retired professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, said Mumbai has a long history of “urban malaria” cases and therefore ignoring it may lead to under-reporting of cases and related deaths.“Healthcare facilities are running only on one-sixth manpower. It is impossible for health departments to handle Covid-19 pandemic along with diseases like malaria, which is considered as a disease of the poor. But ignoring diseases like malaria, dengue and tuberculosis will bite the health system later,” said John.There are two types of malaria — Falciparum malaria, considered most dangerous affecting organs like brain, liver, adrenal gland, intestinal tract, kidneys, lungs, and the other is Vivax malaria which is considered non-deadly.Health activists warn that amid the pandemic, people already infected with Covid-19 have low immunity. So, post-Covid malaria infection may further worsen the health condition. “It is a ticking bomb. Recovered patients are still struggling with fatigue and low immunity. They cannot afford to contract malaria with such compromised health conditions. People in slums will be the most-affected ones,” said Brinelle D’Souza, senior faculty at Tata Institute of Social Sciences and co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan-Mumbai. “If BMC turns a blind eye to malaria cases, it would not only worsen the situation but also affect policy-level interventions. If cases go unreported, we may miss on the essential data which is required for policy planning,” she added. Data shows that since 2017, the lowest number of tests was recorded in 2020. In 2017, of 1,389,440 tests conducted 6,019 diagnosed with malaria. In 2018, 5,036 of 1,376,185 tests done tested positive for the disease. This year till May 31, 1,358 people have been diagnosed with malaria of 406,472 tested.In 2019, for the first time in a decade, the city recorded zero malaria deaths. Medical experts believe that fewer tests can hinder the anti-malaria drive of BMC.“With the gradual relaxation of lockdown, the movement of people outside has increased. Citizens are going to gardens and parks, which exposes them to mosquito bites. Also, construction sites have opened which become breeding grounds for mosquitoes due to stagnant water. So, we cannot ignore malaria which proves fatal if not treated in time,” said Dr Abhijit More, a health activist. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of BMC, said, “Last year, our priority was Covid-19, so we mostly focused on it. Due to the lockdown last year, many people could not reach hospital on time. But the situation has improved this year. We are doing enough testing.”As HT reported, last year monsoon-related illnesses except malaria and swine flu cases dropped by over 50% compared to 2019. In 2020, the city had reported 237 cases of leptospirosis, 128 dengue, 2,478 gastrointestinal and 259 cases of hepatitis. In 2019, 281 cases of leptospirosis, 920 dengue, 7,785 gastrointestinal, and 1,534 cases of hepatitis were recorded. Swine flu incidence in the city also saw a huge fall as the number of cases dropped to 44 in 2020 from 451 the previous year.“Now, as Mumbai is recording heavy rain, the number of malaria cases is likely to rise next month,” said Dr John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malaria-tests-dipped-37-2-cases-rose-by-14-in-2020-bmc-101626722971615.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Traffic Police demarcate lane for commercial vehicles at Jan Marg||The Chandigarh Traffic Police have reintroduced lane driving for commercial vehicles on Jan Marg – from the Sector 16 Cricket Stadium till the Punjab and Haryana high court.A lane has been demarcated with a yellow strip on the extreme left, to be used by vehicles with yellow number plates, including taxis, autos, trucks and buses.Private vehicles, including cars and two-wheelers, will move in the remaining two lanes on the right. Since July 15, a traffic police team has been deployed on the spot with loudspeakers to ensure motorists adapt to the new lanes.For now, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Traffic Administration) Palak Goel said, there will be only an awareness drive and no challans.Recently, there have been a string of fatal accidents in the city involving commercial vehicles like trucks and autos.“Commercial vehicles often move in a rash and negligent manner, changing lanes very often. Lane driving will keep their pace in check,” said Manisha Choudhary, senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic).Residents respond positivelyAppreciating the move, president of Chandigarh Traders Association, Sector 17, Kamaljit Singh Panchhi said, “The road is wide enough to try this and will aid movement of emergency vehicles as well.”Advocate Kuljinder Sra, who uses this road often to reach the high court, said tourists must also be made aware of this initiative and it must be ensured that residents don’t face harassment because of it.“Similar steps have been taken the world over. It will help the traffic move more smoothly here,” said Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, local area councillor.Also hailing the initiative, Kamaljeet Singh Soi, member of National Road Safety Council, said, “Although segregation is usually done between slower and faster vehicles, drivers of commercial vehicles have a different mentality compared to those of other vehicles. It is likely to reduce the number of accidents on this road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-traffic-police-demarcate-lane-for-commercial-vehicles-at-jan-marg-101626722971106.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Local bus fleet of Chandigarh Transport Undertaking to go smart by August 15||All local buses of the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) are set to go smart with the UT transport department’s Intelligent Transport System (ITS) ready for launch by August 15.The World Bank-sponsored project, costing the administration around ₹25 crore, aims to modernise the transport system and attract more passengers to the public transport.“All the preparations have been done and we are planning to launch the full-fledged ITS on the entire CTU fleet of local buses by August 15,” said Uma Shankar Gupta, director, transport. Currently, the system is being tested on the entire CTU fleet of 358 buses.In August last year, a trial run on 100 buses on 14 routes was launched by the UT administrator, VP Singh Badnore.Slew of security features introducedA slew of security features will be introduced in the buses. There will be four cameras inside each bus to monitor the behaviour of the crew and passengers. At a time, the central command and control centre will be able to live monitor 24 buses through these cameras.For additional security of passengers, particularly women commuters, a panic button will be available to solicit urgent help from the police and ambulance, if needed. Drivers will have a direct line of communication with the control room.The ITS will also allow live-tracking of the buses through a global positioning system (GPS), and the department authorities and commuters will be able to determine the exact bus locations.There will be a digital display of the bus timings at each bus queue shelter. Passenger information display screens have also been installed at different locations including the Inter-State Bus Terminals (ISBT) in Sectors 17 and 43, the railway station, and some bus queue shelters.For integrating all ITS services, including monitoring and tracking, a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system or central command and control centre has been set up at the Sector-43 ISBT.“In case a bus is late or not sticking to a designated route, or if it jumps a light or speeds, the ITS will alert the officials concerned so that immediate corrective measures can be taken. In the long-run, it will allow the department to rationalise the bus routes in line with passenger traffic,” said Gupta.Rates of smart card-based bus passes fixedAs the initial step towards launching the ITS, the transport department on Monday fixed the rates of smart cards, which will be shortly rolled out. Initially 10,000 smart cards will be issued free of cost, and only printing charges will be taken. Thereafter, ₹100 will be levied for buying a smart card. The minimum recharge will be of ₹100, up to a maximum of ₹4,900 with a cap at ₹5,000.For both the existing passes and the new smart card-based passes, the facilitation charges or printing cost per card basis (excluding the cost of smart card) will be ₹30 (inclusive of GST). For issuance of an anonymous smart card, the charges will be ₹20. For recharges or for any other operation for personalised and anonymous smart cards, the charges will be ₹10. Online recharges through a portal will be free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/local-bus-fleet-of-chandigarh-transport-undertaking-to-go-smart-by-august-15-101626722918218.html

BMC has advised that citizens continue boiling water as a precautionary measure for next two days.After the filtration plant went under water on Sunday, water supply was affected in several parts of the city.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also said that it has decided to construct a flood-retaining wall around the complex to prevent rain water from Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) entering the Bhandup filtration plant. According to BMC officials, the construction of the retaining wall is an extension of the existing wall that is constructed around the complex. “There is already an existing retaining wall but what we will construct now will be an extension in portions where there is no wall currently. This will prevent the rain water from entering into our filtration plant,” a BMC official said. BMC will also ask SGNP authorities to construct a separate drainage line or a canal that diverts all the rainwater towards Tulsi Lake instead of the Bhandup pumping station.“Currently, the rain water enters through a drain into the Bhandup plant, from where it goes to Tulsi Lake and gets filtered in an independent plant near the lake. However, now we are going to propose to forest authorities that they construct an independent storm water drain facility that takes water directly to Tulsi Lake, bypassing the Bhandup plant, as we cannot have waterlogging inside the plant in the future because it affects water supply in the city.” The BMC official said,The Bhandup plant filters 65% of the total 3,850 million litres of drinking water that BMC supplies daily to the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/water-supply-normal-wall-to-protect-plant-101626722916460.html

Capt cautioned the Congress high command that if Sidhu is given charge, the party could split and questioned his style of working. He also joined hands with his long-time bête noire Partap Singh Bajwa who held a meeting of nine party MPs on Sunday to throw their weight behind the chief minister as a last-ditch effort. But their punches hit thin air and Sidhu’s elevation has come as a jolt for the two-time chief minister who seemed well-entrenched till a few months ago. Capt, who is upset over the party’s handling of infighting, then refused to meet the Amritsar East MLA till he tenders a public apology for making “derogatory” tweets and remarks against him. A clear sign that the crisis is far from over.Till Monday night, there was no apology or response from the new appointee who went around calling on MLAs in Mohali and Chandigarh with a celebratory glint in his eyes and cameras tailing him. Sidhu later held a meeting with several of them at cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s bungalow, close to the chief minister’s official residence. Besides Sidhu, the high command has also named four working presidents to maintain caste and community equations, but Amarinder’s choices did not get in. “Capt has faced dissent before. There was a bigger rebellion in the party ranks during his first term (2002-07). He had the backing of the high command at that time and staved off the challenge. The shoe is on the other foot this time,” said a party leader. The signs of resentment against bureaucrats running the show and Capt’s lack of accessibility were there for some time and should have set alarm bells ringing. The opposition to the chief minister coalesced and grew around Sidhu over unfilled promises after a legal setback in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case three months ago, leading to his promotion. From the party’s standpoint, the appointment of Sidhu, a younger leader who is expected to bring energy to the party’s campaign, is part of a generational shift. Besides upending his calculations, the CM’s appearances before the three-member panel set up to resolve the crisis, 18-point to-do list handed to him and the subsequent changes have dented his standing. However, it is too early to count out the veteran of several political battles who is weighing his options, given that he is still to invite the new team for a meeting. All eyes are now on the cabinet reshuffle that was to follow the revamp of the state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhus-elevation-a-jolt-for-capt-all-eyes-on-cabinet-rejig-now-101626722850626.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s govt schools reopen to lukewarm response||Suspended since March this year, physical classes at Chandigarh’s government schools resumed for Class 9 onwards on Monday. Since it was the first day and due to factors like rain and unit tests, attendance remained on the lower side.School education director Rubinderjit Singh Brar said around 4,000 of the 40,000 students enrolled in Classes 9 to 12 attended school on Monday.The city has 53 government high schools (up to Class 10) and 43 government model senior secondary schools (up to Class 12).According to staff of various schools, attendance was higher at schools in the periphery than those within the city. Teachers said since many students reached school on their own, the showers in the morning acted as a deterrent. Further, unit tests are going on for some classes, so their students also didn’t show up.Pradeep, Aryan and Saurabh, students of Class 9 at Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 10, said they were able to study better in class and they also got their doubts cleared ahead of the maths unit test.“It was a refreshing experience to interact with students in person, but students who are not vaccinated yet remain at risk,” said a teacher at GMSSS, Sector 18. “There were just four students in Class 12 and one each student in Classes 9 and 10,” she added.A student, Kanika, said though only four students turned up in her class, she was quite excited to see her friends.On the other hand, a parent at GMSSS, Sector 10, said he assumed that attendance was mandatory, but as that was not the case, he will wait before sending his child to school again.Students attending physical classes need to bring a consent letter signed by their parents. Online classes will continue for those who opt out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-govt-schools-reopen-to-lukewarm-response-101626722731305.html
20-07-2021||Chandigarh||18+ vax drive resumes in HP; daily jabs capped||Even as the state government resumed vaccination of the 18-44 age bracket on Monday, it also capped the daily limit of jabs for each district.Himachal Pradesh National Health Mission director Hem Raj Bairwa said instead of inoculating different age brackets in separate sessions, everybody will be administered the vaccine at common sites.“All sessions will be created on CoWIN as regular sessions and not as “Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres” (special session), except in tribal areas and Dodra Kawar, to ensure session visibility for the general public on the application,” he said. The state has a stock of nearly five lakh doses and the supply of vaccines has also been smooth. On site slots will be decided by the district authority based on previous experience of session booking. For rural Covid vaccination centres, CoWIN allows to create sessions with any number of online slots. However, in urban areas at least 50% online slots have to be made available at the time of session creation. Districts may publish sessions for urban areas with minimal session capacity to limit online session booking based on previous experience and local requirements in consultation with district administration, he said. Sessions will be published between 12pm to 1pm, at least a day prior to the session. “Session capacity and a number of sessions is to be planned as per vaccine availability. However, district-wise daily capping limit for session planning has been set considering eligible beneficiaries for the second dose and population proportion for the first dose,” he said.Daily vaccination has been limited to 75,000 doses. Ongoing sessions will be extended to minimise vaccine wastage from the last open vial.In urban areas, in case online slots are not taken up, on-site slots will be increased to cater to the available cohort of beneficiaries, subject to vaccine availability for that day. The inoculation drive for the 18+ age group slowed down at the end of June and was completely stopped on July 14 due to a shortage of doses.So far, Himachal has administered around 44 lakh doses. Around 33.6 lakh people have been given the first dose, which is 62% of the total population.Similarly, around 10 lakh people have been given the second dose as well, which is around 22% of the total population. Over 12 lakh people of 18+ category have been given the first jab and the target population is over 30 lakh.Districts’ daily vaccination limit Himachal has limited daily vaccination to 75,000 dosesDistrict Daily limitBilaspur 4,100Chamba 5,500Hamirpur 4,600Kangra 16,000Kinnaur 1,000Kullu 5,000Lahaul-Spiti 400Mandi 10,800Shimla 9,500Sirmaur 5,800Solan 6,800Una 5,500||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/18-vax-drive-resumes-in-hp-daily-jabs-capped-101626722730133.html

The incident occurred following heavy rainfall post Sunday midnight and Monday morning. By Monday evening, BMC had drained out all the water using dewatering pumps. The public parking lot is located in the basement of a residential building and BMC had handed it over to a contractor for operations. Deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar said, “After rainfall on Sunday midnight and Monday morning, water entered the basement parking lot. It is a public parking lot, so any vehicle owner can pay and park here. BMC set up five dewatering pumps to drain the water out on Monday. By evening, all water was drained out and we started removing cars from the area.” In case of damage caused to property due to a natural calamity, the damages are paid to property owners by the city collector and not BMC, Shankarwar said. “As a panchanama (testimony) of the incident will be recorded, the police will take stock of the situation and the damages caused. Through the same procedure, the owners of these vehicles may be compensated. But BMC does not play a role in this procedure,” added Shankarwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/400-vehicles-in-mumbai-s-public-parking-lot-submerged-after-rainfall-101626722669602.html

Data for whether any record for the lowest maximum temperature in July has been broken wasn’t readily available with the IMD.While there was 18.6mm rain at the Sector 39 observatory of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), at the Chandigarh International Airport there was 55mm rain. More rain is likely on Tuesday.IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said, “During monsoon it is common to see different parts of the city get different amounts of rainfall. Similar conditions will continue on Tuesday, but Wednesday onwards, only light rain is expected.” The minimum temperature also went down from 30.2°C on Sunday to 26.3°C on Monday, but was still three degrees above normal. Over the next three days, the weather department has forecast that the maximum temperature will remain between 29°C and 33°C, while the minimum temperature may drop further to 25°C.Waterlogging complaints pour in While the rain was mostly at a pleasant pace, several city areas were still left inundated. Industrial Area, Phase 2, was the worst hit as the water under the Railway Bridge reached up to waist level. In Manimajra also, several streets were left waterlogged. Complaints were received from northern sectors as well, with waterlogging experienced along Madhya Marg in Sector 8 and at the Sector 20/21 roundabout.Power cuts hit professionals working from homePower cuts through the day also left residents harried, especially professionals working from home owing to the pandemic. Savita Dhawan of Sector 64, Mohali, said, “It’s sheer harassment when the internet drops right between a meeting. Even if there is back up, it takes time to reconnect and by that time, the narrative gets lost.” Panchkula resident Mayank Gautam said, “Sudden power cuts are routine during the rainy season, without any consideration for people working from home. Owning an inverter isn’t enough for long outages, so I am planning to buy a generator for a better solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/186mm-rain-cools-down-chandigarh-but-leaves-roads-inundated-101626722610927.html

The deceased – Harpal, 22, was a contractual sanitation worker from Mohali, and Gagan, 30, a construction labour hailing from Bihar. According to police, Harpal was sent to the Sector-62 site, where Home and Land Planners (HLP) Group is building the HLP Galleria mall, after MC received a complaint to clean the sewage pipeline.Around 6pm, as Harpal went down the sewer to carry out cleaning work, he fell unconscious. Working nearby, Gagan volunteered to take a water bottle to Harpal and help bring him up. But when he climbed down three-four steps using a ladder, he also fainted. Police reached the spot and rescued the two men with the help of a JCB machine. They were rushed to a private hospital, where they were declared brought dead.

Rainfall intensity has, however, markedly reduced, with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) monitoring station in Santacruz recording 70.4mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am Monday, and another 35.2mm of rain in the subsequent eight hours. At 1pm on Monday, IMD upgraded its orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain at a few places) for Mumbai to a red (storm) alert. However, an orange category alert remains in place till Friday. The city has so far received 920mm of rain this month, against the seasonal normal of 827mm. Since June 1, the city has received about 1,951mm of rain, which is about 88% of the seasonal normal up to September-end.“The southwesterly monsoon flow is expected to strengthen, and the rainfall distribution and activity is expected to increase over the region, parts of Konkan, Goa and the adjoining ghat areas of central Maharashtra,” an IMD statement on Monday read. This is due to a combination of multiple weather systems, including an off-shore monsoon trough at sea level running from Maharashtra to Karnataka along coast, which will persist for the next three to four days.There is also a cyclonic circulation lying over the south Gujarat region, about 3.5km above mean sea level, along with a low-pressure area over the northwest Bay of Bengal, which is expected to form around Friday. Due to active monsoon conditions, squally weather, with wind speed reaching 45-55 kmph (km per hour) and gusting to 65 kmph is likely to prevail along the Maharashtra-Goa coast, IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-under-orange-alert-till-friday-imd-101626722369493.html

Besides, there is no shortage of fertilizers and unlike last year, have not received complaints of inferior quality seed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-stays-rained-in-for-one-more-day-101626722011052.html

The private airport operator said the use of TaxiBots is part of its strategic initiatives to reduce carbon emissions by aircraft and also to become a ‘net-zero carbon emission airport’ by 2030. ‘Greening’ the aviation sectorAccording to international airlines global body International Air Transport Association (IATA), India is set to become the world’s third-largest air passenger market after China and the United States within the next 10 years.The government’s regional connectivity scheme, Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN), will contribute to emissions of carbon because more fuel will be burnt with the increase in flights. The 2015 Paris Agreement excluded the international aviation sector due to difficulties in attributing emissions – from complex international supply chains to individual countries.As a result, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) member states designed the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) with an initial target of achieving carbon-neutral growth for the sector from 2020. ICAO in 2016 had warned that the aviation industry needs to prepare for severe disruptions as a result of climate change and that it needs to make full use of clean technology and policy tools in order to reduce its carbon footprint along with other environmental impacts. While over 88 states agreed to pilot CORSIA scheme from 2021-2023, India is currently working with its own national targets for the aviation sector to remain compliant with its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and move towards carbon-neutral flying.In 2019, India came out with a white paper on National Green Aviation Policy, which was published with inputs from key aviation stakeholders, including the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC); Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas; the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), airport operators and airlines.In March, the then civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri informed the Rajya Sabha that his ministry had not formulated any policy on green aviation.“Air traffic management needs to be equipped with the latest technologies for best management of aircraft arrivals and departures so that they save on fuel,” said Mukesh Yadav, senior associate at Indian Institute for Human Settlements. Sustainable aviation fuelBack home, the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) initiative has brought together an Indian community of private and public institutions with a shared vision of scaling production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). CST India initiative established a specific goal to transport 100 million domestic passengers on at least 10% blended fuel with SAF by 2030.WEF in a blueprint titled ‘Deploying Sustainable Aviation Fuels at Scale in India’ in mid-June revealed that SAF is the most achievable and effective pathway to reducing aviation’s lifecycle emissions in the immediate future.It also proposed key methods, cost-sharing models, and economic and environmental benefits for accelerating the SAF industry in India.Yadav said controlling carbon emission is not very easy in India. “For a government to bring about a change in such an issue requires global help. Usage of biofuel is one of the most important initiatives that need to be undertaken in order to control carbon emission, but not much has been done by the government,” said Yadav.Biofuels typically refers to fuels produced from biological resources (plant or animal material). However, current technology allows fuel to be produced from other alternative sources, including non-biological resources.According to Yadav, biofuel supply is a major concern for India as there are environmental challenges. “The infrastructure required for biofuel is also a major challenge,” he added.India’s sustainable aviation initiativeTwo budget carriers, SpiceJet and IndiGo, in 2018 operated test flights determining the feasibility of using biofuels, which reduces emissions. However, there is no further update either by the airline or DGCA on these trial flights, said Yadav.“It seems that DGCA is not working on the goal with enthusiasm and doesn’t seem to have done anything ahead,” Yadav alleged.Sources in the aviation ministry said that while the existing airports are working towards making their airports greener, new airports are focussing on sustainability. An example of such an airport is the international airport coming up at Noida, which has recently submitted its plan, according to them.“It will be having electric vehicles and also work with the latest air traffic management techniques for better coordination to save ground time of an aircraft, thus reducing the consumption of fuel. It will also be equipped with autonomous taxiing using TaxiBot or WheelTug operations.” According to GMR, which runs airports in Delhi and Hyderabad, both the airports have taken a number of proactive measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. “Currently both these airports are working on major expansion projects in which significant investment is being done for technological upgradation. Once completed, these projects will result in state-of-the-art green infrastructures,” said a GMR Group spokesperson.The spokesperson added, “Both the airports are working closely with air traffic control (ATC), airlines, ground-handling agencies as well as other stakeholders in improving the overall operational efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and emissions.”Both the airports have adopted operational improvement measure – Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) – to reduce the holding time and delay, and saved significant amounts of emissions by avoiding unnecessary fuel burning, he emphasised.According to IndiGo, the automation of its ground support equipment has reduced the carbon emissions by almost 5% equivalent, which is equivalent to 1246 tons. “Apart from investing in the new NEO aircraft – replacing the older generation CEOs (current engine option), which reduces fuel usage by 15% and GHG emissions during flights – we adopted various innovative solutions in both passenger and freight services,” said the airline spokesperson.Sources said Indian airports are now adopting new ways to implement additions and changes looking at the foreign airports which include usage of renewable sources of energy.“Building green airports with environmentally-friendly infrastructure and renewable sources of energy is essential,” Yadav said, adding that in 2015, Cochin international airport became the first in the world to be fully powered by solar panels with the inauguration of a 12 MW (megawatt) solar power plant.In January, the airport commissioned a floating solar power plant having a capacity of 452 Kilowatt-hours (KWh), in a move towards self-sustainability of power. Airport designing too plays an important role, highlighted Yadav. “The government also needs to encourage airport operators and airlines towards sustainability. This requires good funds whereas the sector currently is in heavy losses due to the pandemic. It needs to introspect on what kind of infrastructure is required to make airports greener; how will the requirement of using less fuel or using biofuel be fulfilled,” Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sustainable-aircraft-fuel-a-safe-bet-for-green-aviation-101626721889514.html

The royalty was imposed on the firm, Brar Stone Crusher, which is registered in the name of Gurjant Singh Brar, son of MLA Darshan Singh Brar, after it failed to define the source of obtaining the minerals at the stone crusher. The firm was slapped two notices last year by the mining department citing violation of the Punjab Minor Mineral Rules, 2013. The department had alleged that the firm wrongfully obtained 1,30,298 tonnes of minerals and the royalty was pegged at ₹1,56,35,760. HT has copies of both the notices. Pathankot mining officer Gagandeep, who has additional charge of stone crushers in Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur districts, said: “The department asked the firm to deposit the royalty after it failed to define the source of the raw material.” The department had issued the first notice July 9, in which it stated that the firm had extracted gravel, minor minerals illegally. “In the event of your failure to comply with this notice, I shall proceed to access the royalty best of my judgment under rule 85 (5) of Punjab Minor Mineral Rules, 2013, and furthermore you will be liable to prosecution under Rule 76,” the notice reads. The second notice was issued on November 23, in which the royalty was imposed by the mining department and it had directed the firm to deposit it in government treasury on or before December 22. However, the royalty is yet to be deposited. “We have challenged the department’s decree of imposing the royalty. We had procured the raw material from a private firm. An appeal has been filed to the director of the mining department,” said Gurjant Singh Brar.MLA Darshan Singh Brar said: “We have filed an appeal against the department notice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-mla-son-s-firm-fails-to-deposit-1-56-cr-royalty-101626721711235.html

It took over 12 hours for the firefighters to douse the flames, however, no casualty was reported as the unit was closed at the time. Labourers working at a nearby factory spotted smoke billowing out of the godown and raised the alarm. Fire officials said they received an alert around 12.45am on Monday and rushed seven fire tenders to the spot. As per information, fire tenders had to be refilled at least 110 times to control the blaze. The operations ended around 1pm on Monday. Leading fireman Rajinder Singh said, “It took over 12 hours to douse the flames as the godown was around 50-ft long and 40-ft wide. A large amount of cardboard was stocked inside, and it was difficult for the firefighters to enter the building due to the smoke. High velocity winds added to the problem. We also had to bring down one of the boundary walls with a JCB machine during the operation.” Fire officials stated that the godown did not have proper fire safety arrangements. The unit did not even have a water tank due to which the firemen had to refill the fire tenders from a nearby dying unit and the sub-office of the fire brigade, due to which a lot of time was lost. “No casualty was reported from the spot as the factory was closed. But the material kept in the building was completed gutted. The building has also been damaged as the walls have developed cracks due to the mishap,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cardboard-godown-goes-up-in-flames-in-ludhiana-no-casualty-101626721710098.html

20-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC dismissed dera man’s plea against resending handwriting samples to lab||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday dismissed a Dera Sacha Sauda follower’s plea challenging the special investigation team’s move of resending his handwriting samples to match it with the writings on derogatory posters pasted at Faridkot’s Bargari village in September 2015 to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh.Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, a Dera Sacha Sauda follower, moved an application in HC demanding that the SIT be stopped from re-examining his handwriting samples. Sukhjinder is among four accused in the case, besides Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh and Baljeet Singh. In a desecration incident, three derogatory posters were pasted near gurdwaras of Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in Faridkot district on the intervening night of September 24 and 25 in 2015. On July 9, the HC restrained the SIT probing the sacrilege cases from submitting a chargesheet (challan) against accused and the court reserved order for Monday. The HC bench of justice HNS Gill said that indisputably the handwriting samples of the petitioner had been obtained by the probe team after the petitioner had given his consent in the presence of his counsel. “The petitioner’s counsel could not show as to what prejudice is caused to the rights of the petitioner by objecting to obtaining of his handwriting samples and sending them for comparison. Rather, by raising such an objection in the middle of the investigation, the petitioner is pre-empting his guilt,” he added. “It may further be noticed that the earlier handwriting samples of the petitioner had been taken in FIR 63 and not in the present FIR 117. Thus, the prosecution cannot be restrained from obtaining the handwriting samples of the petitioner in FIR 117. Besides, the order passed by the magistrate was never challenged by the petitioner,” the HC bench said dismissing the plea. On June 1 this year, the SIT collected samples of Sukhjinder to match them with the writing on the derogatory posters claiming that one of the posters was written by him. In the three posters, it was threatened that the “bir” of Guru Granth Sahib stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1 2015 would be torn if the now jailed Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim-starrer film Messenger of God (MSG)-2 was not allowed to be released in Punjab. The SIT led by then deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra in 2018 had claimed that the handwriting of the accused dera followers had matched with the ones on the posters. But the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in its closure report filed in a Mohali court in July 2019 said the handwriting samples of the accused dera followers it had sent to the CFSL in Delhi did not match with the ones on the posters. On CBI’s handwriting samples report, Gaurav Garg Dhuriwala, deputy advocate general, had told the court that the necessity to obtain the handwriting samples of the petitioner again has arisen in view of the fact that earlier samples had not been taken according to the set procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismissed-dera-man-s-plea-against-resending-handwriting-samples-to-lab-101626721410022.html

At present, people either pay challans online or at the traffic police headquarters in Sector 14A.“Three new centres will start operating at the offices of deputy commissioner of police (DCP) — Noida Sector 6, Surajpur, and Knowledge Park. People can pay challan amounts at any of the centres, depending on convenience and proximity,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).Online support for filing of e-challan has also been linked to the traffic police helpline number: 9971009001. “Queries for filing of e-challan will be redirected to the staff concerned. Outsiders, who got challaned here, will also be benefitted from these provisions. People can also file challans at the district court in Surajpur. A representative will be available to help people during the process,” Saha added.According to the officials, this will also ease the backlog of more than 1,600,000 pending e-challan in the district from 2018. “The most common excuse we hear for the non-payment of challan is the ‘inconvenience in going to traffic offices’. So, this will hopefully ease the situation,” said a traffic official, requesting anonymity.Residents in Noida, too, have welcomed the move. “People will definitely be benefitted. Nowadays, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, we do most of the work online. In case of technical issues, having a centre nearby will be very convenient for the residents,” said Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-to-get-3-new-centres-for-e-challan-filing-101626721109969.html

To meet this purpose, testing is being done at the district hospital and all the community and primary health centres,” said Sharma. Currently, the district is meeting 50% of the target set for conducting antigen tests per day and around 40% of the daily RT-PCR testing target.Sharma said the department aims to increase testing in the coming days. “Currently, the number of tests being done in the district is at an optimal level considering the positivity rate (samples that return positive out of the total samples tested for Covid-19) is 0.16%. We aim to increase the number of tests as well as ramp up contact tracing and tracking in the district,” he said.Another health department official said in rural areas, teams of accredited social health activists (ASHAs) and auxillary nurse midwives (ANMs) are going door-to-door to increase awareness regarding Covid-19 protocols and importance of maintaining social distancing. Talking about preparedness for the new variant of Covid-19, Dr Sharma said, “Delta or Delta plus variant of Covid-19 does not matter as long as we are prepared for the surge in cases”.He added,”As per our estimates, only 5% of Covid affected children need admission. So, for every 1,000 Covid cases ,about 120 will be in age group of 0 to 18 years and only six children will need admission to hospitals. We are prepared for the same, and even more, if needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-health-dept-told-to-ensure-children-too-are-tested-for-covid-101626721049367.html

It is 40 kilometres away from the Jewar airport project site, and the land use change was done from R&D to any kind of non-polluting industrial units in 2020-end.“We are completing all the formalities and will launch the scheme by the end of July 2021. We will check credentials and financial background of firms before allotting the industrial plots to them through a lucky draw, and then interview the firm owners to finalise the deal,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of IITGL.Mumbai-based developer, Shapoorji Pallonji, will develop the township near the Jewar airport project site. The Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), the special purpose vehicle of the state government, is developing the Jewar airport in Greater Noida, and the Switzerland company Zurich AG, the concessionaire of the airport project, is engaged in developmental and operational work of the airport project that is likely to become operational in 2024.The Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh had formed the IITG in Gautam Budh Nagar in August 2016, and the IITGL started allotting industrial plots in an integrated township spread over 747 acres to the developers from 2017. 50% of the total 747 acres available is earmarked for industrial usage and the remaining for residential and commercial purposes.The authority has already allotted land to several China-based home appliances companies, and they are setting up their units in the township.“We will offer tailor-made plots of 5 or 20 acres for allowing green units here. We will soon declare the launching date of the scheme. So far, we have got nearly ₹3,600-crore investment for this township. We hope that we will soon allot the remaining land, and we will be able to generate sufficient employment opportunities in this region,” Bhooshan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/iitgl-to-launch-industrial-plot-scheme-in-greater-noida-soon-101626721049905.html

But after the Covid-19 outbreak, they had to shut down most of their operations. They now provide home tuitions to some students in Sector 12. “We paid the monthly rent of ₹25,000 for each centre to our landlords till October last year from my savings. But after that, we lost hope due to the repeated lockdowns. Now we earn less than ₹50,000,” he said. Ramesh Kumar of Sector 49 used to run a coaching centre in a multi-storey building. Now, he works as an assistant in a private company in phase-2. The building he once rented is now a hotel. “I tried my level best to run the institute but could not manage the rents and fixed electricity charges. So, I surrendered. I’ve now started working at a call centre that gives me ₹ 20,000 per month,” he said. He earned ₹75,000 a month earlier from his mathematics and physics tuition classes for students of class 8 to 10. Nearly 700 coaching centres had been operating in the district before Covid-19 that employed 10,000 teachers to provide additional coaching in English, mathematics, the various sciences, accountancy and economics. Some even provided coaching for various competitive examinations like engineering and medical. Now, according to Suraj Kumar Singh, who runs a coaching centre in sector 62, there are just around 300 institutes left, of which most are big brands in this field. Most teachers, Singh added, have gone back to their native places. Jitendra Yadav still runs his coaching centre in Sector 18. He had decided to adopt online teaching method to counter the lockdown but said the response has been less than encouraging. “Before the pandemic, there were over 300 students registered to my coaching. But, now it has been reduced to 50. Since most of the students do not come from well-off families, their parents are paying only 50% of the monthly fees for online classes. We don’t have any association through which we can highlight our plights to the administration,” he said. Parents are not happy with the situation either. Dinesh Awana, a parent in sector 62, said that the online classes have hampered the academic and social growth of the children. “My son was a good student and badminton players. The pandemic has compelled him to be at home all the time, making his life monotonous. We really want to send our children to schools and coaching classes for regular classes, but the fear of successive waves of Covid-19 don’t permit us to risk their lives,” he said. Dipesh Rajput, a parent from sector 21, said that monotony after the Covid-19 outbreak has turned his daughter short-tempered. “She used to attend music classes but now she is getting only tips from her teacher online. She has given up practising. When I ask her to do so, she either starts yelling or crying,” he said. Even the students don’t seem much comfortable with online classes. Deepika Mishra, a class-11 students, said that online classes don’t give opportunity for exploring the subjects. “I usually solve mathematics and science questions from advanced books. When I raise some questions from those books, the teachers say that it’s out of syllabus. During regular classes, most of these questions were solved in group discussion with friends. Phone and computer can never be the replacements for regular classes,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nearly-400-coaching-centres-closed-after-covid-19-outbreak-in-gb-nagar-101626720990663.html

20-07-2021||Noida||Lukewarm response as Ghaziabad starts with Covid vaccination of pregnant women||More than two weeks after the Centre allowed pregnant women to get vaccinated against Covid-19, Ghaziabad on Monday started the inoculation process for such beneficiaries. However, several government-run vaccination centres witnessed a lukewarm response from would-be mothers for the drive, officials said.On July 2, the Union ministry of health and family welfare extended the vaccination drive against Covid-19 to pregnant women. The health ministry said that pregnant women can register on the Co-WIN portal or walk-in to the nearest vaccination centres for Covid-19 shots.The officials of the Ghaziabad health department said that the vaccination for this group was started after guidelines were received recently from the state government. At present, the district has about 100,000 pregnant women, they said. “After directions were received from the state health department, we started with vaccination of pregnant women at the 54 centres across the district. The centres have been directed that such women should be provided vaccine on priority and should not be made to stand in queues. Pregnant women can get vaccination by booking online slots or even by way of walk-in,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in Ghaziabad. Several government hospitals on Monday did not get a good response for the drive.“We started with the arrangement for pregnant women, but no such beneficiaries turned up for getting vaccinated. We feel that with more awareness, the pace will pick up in coming weeks,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital. There were no such beneficiaries either at the other centre at the District Women Hospital. “No pregnant woman arrived for vaccination on Monday. But we have started receiving queries from women about vaccination during pregnancy,” said Dr Sangita Goel, CMS of the hospital. However, at Gandhi Ideal School at Rakesh Marg in Nehru Nagar, the centre in-charge said that six pregnant women turned up for vaccination. “On Monday, we had six such beneficiaries. There were no adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) reported in any such case so far,” said Dr Pawan Kumari, in-charge of the Covid vaccination centre. When asked about the poor response, Ghaziabad chief medical officer, Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, said, “We have antenatal care centres in both rural and urban areas where pregnant women visit for normal immunisation. We will ask these centres to properly guide the pregnant women and encourage them to get vaccinated. We expect that pace of vaccination for this group will pick up in the coming days.”The officials said the count for vaccination of pregnant women could not be ascertained as there was no separate indicator on Co-WIN portal.Meanwhile, experts said that pregnancy is not a contraindication for Covid-19 vaccination. “We feel that by vaccinating the pregnant women, we are in fact securing two lives. The district administration should spread more awareness. On our part, we will soon be starting with online doubt-clearing sessions with experts. Besides, we will put up posters at hospitals, nursing homes and clinics indicating that vaccination is safe for pregnant women,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/lukewarm-response-as-ghaziabad-starts-with-covid-vaccination-of-pregnant-women-101626720869376.html

The accused were arrested following a tip-off. They were wanted in a case of cyber fraud lodged at the Hazratganj police station (in Lucknow).”The said case was lodged last year where the complainant informed police that ₹5.3 million ( ₹53 lakh) was stolen from his account fraudulently in an online transaction. The case was handed over to the cyber cell for investigation.The accused are residents of Dumka district in Jharkhand, he said, adding that they were being questioned about their activities by a team of the cyber crime cell.The accused were believed to have been involved in defrauding people to the tune of over ₹200 million ( ₹20 crore) in the last six years by posing as officials of different banks and financial institutions.The team recovered ₹1.2 lakh cash from the accused and was working to trace the accounts in which money taken from their victims was kept, the senior police officer said.The accused told police that they used the loopholes in available mobile applications of various banks to get access to the bank accounts of people, according to the Lucknow police.The accused used to buy information about bank customers and call them at random, asking for verification for the mobile application. Once this was done, the accused used this information to transact money from the account of the victim.“They targeted people across the country and kept changing their phone and SIM card to avoid detection. They also divided the work among themselves and kept a low profile,” said Thakur.The accused were booked for fraud and under various sections of the IT Act and sent to prison, he said, adding that police were looking for other members of the gang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cyber-crime-cell-of-lucknow-police-nabs-five-for-posing-as-bank-officials-101626720632425.html

20-07-2021||Noida||Rain lashes GB Nagar, dissipates heat||Incessant rain lashed the city on Monday, bringing much-needed respite from the hot and sultry weather but also heaping misery on road users who had to grapple with inundated roads and traffic congestion in several parts of the city.Residents, however, said the situation is not as worse as it was a month ago when waterlogging had brought traffic to a standstill in many places across the city.The last time when Noida received showers was on July 13, the day the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced the arrival of monsoon in the National Capital Region (NCR). The south-west monsoon hit the region after running behind schedule for 16 days.The downpour on Monday brought down the maximum temperature by nearly 10 degrees. The maximum temperature was recorded at 26.6 degrees Celsius (°C), 10 degrees below normal, and the minimum was at 25.6°C, according to the weather officials. Monday’s is the lowest maximum temperature for the month of July so far, they said. The maximum and minimum temperatures recorded in Noida on Sunday were 36°C and 28°C, respectively.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, the maximum temperature was 26.5°C, eight degrees below normal and minimum temperature was 24.2°C, three degrees below normal.“The maximum temperature will hover around 32 to 35°C and minimum around 24 to 26°C,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD.Weather analysts said that the monsoon trough line is currently hovering over Noida and adjoining areas, sustaining the possibility of light rains till July 21. According to IMD, the rainfall recorded at Safdarjung, considered average for NCR, till 5.30pm on Monday was 38.4mm. While Noida received 1mm of rainfall till 8.30am on Monday, the rainfall data from 8.30am to 5.30pm for the city is unavailable. An IMD official said Noida received “moderate rain” on Monday. “There are chances of light rain tomorrow and day after in Noida,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rain-lashes-gb-nagar-dissipates-heat-101626720569296.html
20-07-2021||Other||Prayagraj: Now UP women teachers assn demands ‘period leave’||Amid all the talks over ‘menstruation leave’ for working women, the Uttar Pradesh women teachers have now demanded that they too be allowed to avail three days ‘Period Leave’ or ‘Menstrual Leave’ every month over and above other leaves available to them akin to the facility that their counterparts in states like Bihar can avail when in need. They stressed that menstruating women experience pain and bleeding, both of which affect their mental and physical state. A delegation of women teachers under the banner of Uttar Pradesh Women Teachers’ Association has submitted this demand to Anamika Chaudhary, a member of UP Women’s Commission on Sunday in Sangam city and now plan to approach deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Senior vice-president of the association’s district unit Poonam Gupta said that the Bihar government was extending this leave to women employees for the past 30 years. “We want UP government to also extend three days ‘period leave’ per month for women teachers and employees,” said Poonam, who was part of the delegation that met Anamika Chaudhary and also had organisational secretary Durgawati Mishra and Indu Sharma along with district president Vithica Amarnath and general secretary Aparna Bajpai in it. “Anamika Chaudhary has promised to make the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath aware of our demand,” she said. UP Women Teachers’ Association’s Prayagraj unit president Vithica Amarnath said that their state president Sulochana Maurya had also submitted a memorandum in this regard to UP cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya in Lucknow. “All units are submitting similar memorandums to elected MLAs and ministers in their respective districts. Be it Azamgarh, Bareilly or Lucknow, the plan is to let every MLA and minister aware of our demands. In Prayagraj, we plan to submit a memorandum to deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya also,” she added. The demand comes at a time when Indian food delivery service Zomato’s decision to give female employees up to 10 days of ‘period leave’ per year has triggered a discussion about it across India and other South Asian countries. “A lot of private companies like Tata Steel provide the option to women workers to avail ‘period leave’ even in India. It is an optional leave at most places and hardly anyone misuses it. Today women teachers either have had to come to work on the most painful day of their menstrual cycle or make up some excuse. The leave cannot take away their pain and discomfort, but it can give them a break on the days they are most uncomfortable,” said Madhvi, a primary school teacher of Sangam city supporting the demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-now-up-women-teachers-assn-demands-period-leave-101626720329255.html

Senior officials talked to the agitating youths and asked them to calm down but the stir continued.“The administration gave the agitators time to clear the road but they continued to disrupt traffic,” said Magharia. Police officials deployed to control the agitation said many of these youths were selected for the job but no recruitment took place since 2019 because of a case pending before the state administrative tribunal. The agitators blocked the roads leading to the Alipore court, Alipore police station as well as other government buildings located close to Bhawani Bhawan.When they refused to clear the area, baton-wielding policemen chased them away, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/aspiring-police-constables-chased-away-by-real-ones-during-agitation-in-kolkata-101626720271315.html

The state, which is still battling the second wave of Covid-19 infections, had gone past 100,000 active cases on March 11 — the beginning of the wave. Even as the overall active case has come down, 10 districts in the state, which are rural parts of the state, are still showing higher number of fresh cases in comparison to the state’s overall average.Maharashtra on Monday added 6,017 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the tally to 6,220,207. It also added 66 deaths — lowest since July 12 — to take the toll to 127,097. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 403 new cases and 14 deaths. The city’s active caseload stood at 10,422 on Monday.Pune district tops the state with highest number of active infections with 15,768, followed by Thane district (13,632), Kolhapur district (10,538), Mumbai, Sangli district (10,014), and Satara district (6,566).Ten districts, including Raigad, Ahmednagar, Pune rural, Solapur rural, Satara, Kolhapur rural, Sangli rural, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Nandurbar, in the state have been reporting over 60% of the state’s total cases daily. However, state health department and district officials said that positivity rate in these districts, especially the rural areas, is reducing gradually.As per the state’s data, the rural areas in the 10 districts reported 66.61% of the total cases reported on Monday. While the urban areas, which were the hotbed of viral activity earler, including Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (excluding Raigad district), Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad, contributed 1,248 fresh cases or 20.74% of the total cases reported on Monday.On Monday, 904 cases were reported in Kolhapur rural, 795 in Sangli rural, 545 in Satara, 436 in Pune rural, 427 in Ahmednagar rural, 286 in Solapur rural, 224 in Raigad, 221 in Ratnagiri, 169 in Sindhudurg, the state data said. These areas reported 4,008 fresh cases or 66.61% of the state’s total cases on Monday.State health minister Rajesh Tope, who had reviewed the situation in Kolhapur district on the weekend, said, “Ten districts are showing higher cases than the state’s overall average. However, the positivity rate is coming down in these parts.” A senior health department official said the wave is showing gradual signs of ebbing in rural areas. “Viral activity follows different pattern in every geography. These districts have been an area of concern, but the cases are reducing gradually. The positivity rate is showing a drop there,” he said requesting anonymity. Kolhapur district was at the top in the state with 1,108 (904 in rural areas, 204 in city) fresh cases on Monday. The district administration said the positivity rate is seeing a decrease. “Our positivity rate which was in the twenties has now gone under 10%. Even the positivity rate in the city is around 7% now. We were in a state on complete lockdown, while other districts were open, which has helped in controlling the situation. The viral activity is reducing and we are confident the numbers will come down soon,” said a senior district official who did not wish to the named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-active-case-count-dips-to-below-100000-101626720150916.html

Punjab has 19,693 patients enrolled under the Tuberculosis Control Programme and officials say incentive under the “Nikshay Poshan Yojana” (National Nutritional Support Scheme) has not been disbursed over the last few months due to budgetary constraints. Ludhiana has a maximum of 3,473 patients under TB treatment followed by Amritsar (2,226) and Patiala (1,699).A 59-year-old patient from Bathinda said her six-month treatment began in December, but she has not received even a single instalment yet. Another patient being treated at a private institute said, “I have submitted my updated bank details, but the money for nutritional support has not been credited for four months.”Bathinda district tuberculosis centre (DTC) in-charge Dr Rosy Aggarwal said, “The district has 998 registered patients and most had been paid the money till March,” adding that the disbursement depended on the availability of funds.The head of TB clinic at Ferozepur Dr Satinder Oberoi said the delay was due to manpower being deployed on Covid-19 duty. “There has also been delay in getting money from the state headquarters,” she added.In-charge of Kishori Ram Hospital Dr Vitull K Gupta said hospitals and paramedical volunteers engaged in TB eradication programme were entitled to ₹1,000 per patient but they have not received the amount since December.Dr Jastej Kullar, state TB Control Programme officer, admitted that beneficiaries had not been paid, due to budgetary issues. “Exact data of the patients awaiting incentive is not readily available,” he added.“Normally, we make payment once in two months, but sometimes delays occur due to mismatch in bank account details or other issues. The money will be credited soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tb-patients-not-getting-nutritional-support-for-seven-months-101626720150319.html
20-07-2021||Mumbai||‘Mini cloudbursts’ increasing by 10% every year, particularly on western coast: Researchers||The morning after Mumbai got battered by record-setting rain — which flooded low-lying areas, triggering landslides, house collapses and electrocutions that killed at least 31 people — state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray attributed the deluge to “mini cloudbursts in a short span with full fury of nature”. Ongoing research by meteorologists indicate that mini cloudbursts — sudden, heavy rain spells of the kind that occurred over Mumbai early on Sunday — are increasing by around 10% every year. The scale of the weekend disaster can be better understood by looking at the civic body’s ward-wise hourly rainfall data for Saturday-Sunday. When almost all monitoring locations received barely any rain in the hour between 11pm and midnight, the subsequent two hours saw torrential downpours clocking between 100 and 150mm on average. Several locations saw between 90 and 110mm of rain in just a single hour, causing damage to live and property that would be akin to a cloudburst, even though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) didn’t declare one.The term “mini cloudburst” (MCB) was first used in 1999 by scientists CS Ramage and Thomas A Schroeder while studying high rainfall events at Mount Waialeale in Hawaii (one of the world’s wettest regions). However, Ramage and Schroeder did not actually quantify the amount of rainfall required for an event to be classified as such. This happened in 2018, when a four-member team from Pune’s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, defined MCBs as short-term, but intense rainfall events characterised by 50mm (or more) precipitation in two consecutive hours. The paper, led by principal investigator Nayana Deshpande, was published in 2018 in the International Journal of Climatology, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Meteorological Society. In light of the downpour in Mumbai recently, their findings and continued research hold warning signs for the city’s climate future. The same researchers, who spoke about the yearly 10% rise in MCBs, told the Hindustan Times on Monday that the frequency of such high-impact rainfall events seems to be increasing particularly over peninsular India, including the western coastline.Earlier analysis of hourly rainfall data between 1969 and 2015 across 126 rain gauges revealed that India records 200 MCB events a year on average, and that their frequency along the west coast seems to be increasing. Between 2005 and 2015, India saw roughly 1,100 MCBs, while Mumbai on average saw above five such events in a year.While Deshpande (and others) do not present similar data for subsequent years, ongoing work by her team indicates that the frequency of these events has been increasing even after 2015. This year alone, there have been at least three such events in Mumbai, on June 9, July 16 and July 18. “The specific number, location and intensity of MCB events in more recent years will be published in a paper sometime next year. However, we can say even after 2015, the number of mini cloudbursts in India seems to be increasing by an average of 10% year on year. This is only a marginal increase in absolute terms, taking into account inter-annual variability of rainfall and the fact that we are only considering four months of the monsoon. But it is nevertheless worrisome. We have seen two back-to-back events in Mumbai last week. As MCBs become more frequent in the long-term, it means more flash floods, more landslides, more problems for disaster relief and so on,” said Dr JR Kulkarni, one of researchers.The mini cloud bursts that lashed several parts of Mumbai on Sunday, Hindustan Times had reported, were the result of “convective precipitation”, triggered by a rapid “in situ” convergence of moisture-laden clouds that were formed as easterly winds in the mid-atmospheric levels transported dry air over warm and moist air in the lower levels, brought by westerly winds. The cloud structure responsible for the deluge touched a height of almost 60,000 feet -- more than twice the cruising altitude for most commercial airlines.While rainfall exceeding 100mm in an hour — a phenomena largely associated with cloud conditions in the Himalayan region and which leads to flash floods — has already been categorised as cloudburst events, according to the IMD, so far there have been no categories to define intense, but short bursts of rain.M Rajeevan Nair, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said, “This is certainly a plausible observation. We have also noticed that such kinds of extreme rainfall events, of 50mm or more in two hours, are increasing in multiple meteorological subdivisions. At the moment there is no need to introduce another official term, and when required it will be done globally by the World Meteorological Observation. But the important thing is that we are aware of the impact caused by such accidents. The IMD is working at various levels to fine tune flood warning systems to mitigate the damage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mini-cloudbursts-increasing-by-10-every-year-particularly-on-western-coast-researchers-101626719969250.html

Going by the name of Azad ki Shaurya Gatha, the exhibition will be the first big show since we relocated to the new location,” said Achal Pandya, head of IGNCA’s conservation and cultural archives unit. IGNCA member-secretary Sachidanand Joshi said that activities and exhibitions will be thrown open to the public next month. “We will also start storytelling sessions to make people aware of relatively lesser-known freedom fighters. Ordinary people who played a crucial role during the freedom struggle need to be taken to the masses,” said Joshi. Earlier this month, IGNCA relocated to Janpath Hotel, which will be their temporary home for at least two years as the Central Vista redevelopment project takes shape. The permanent campus is expected to come up at Jamnagar House.Joshi said that the premises will be thrown open to the public next month. “Even during the lockdown, we did not stop our activities. Starting from next month, we will allow visitors in compliance with Covid-19 protocols,” he said. Joshi also said that the IGNCA will continue to hold online activities alongside physical events, adding that there were also plans to adopt a hybrid model for holding events in line with the Covid protocols.“In the future, we are also thinking of doing activities involving children. We want to invite school children from both private and government schools for storytelling sessions once schools reopen.

There are days when we have administered more Covaxin first doses,” said a senior official from the district.The government stopped administering first doses of Covaxin after a shortage of jabs for those turning up for the second shot, after getting their initial shot in May, when the vaccination drive first opened up for everyone over the age of 18 years.The government resumed it, with a mandate that only 20% of the Covaxin stock be used to administer the first dose, only two weeks ago.Over 200,000 doses of Covaxin and 72,240 doses of Covishield were available with the Delhi government on Monday morning.It was unclear whether the government received a fresh batch of vaccine doses on Monday. The city had last received 60,000 doses of Covishield on July 17, according to the government’s vaccination bulletin.Delhi’s vaccination rates have been erratic since June 21, when the Centre took over control of purchasing and distributing vaccines to states. This was a change from the earlier policy, when states were buying doses for those aged between 18 and 45 at a higher price.In the three weeks since then, vaccinations peaked on June 26, when the city administered over 207,000 vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poor-stocks-slow-down-vaccine-drive-in-delhi-only-26-000-jabs-given-on-monday-101626719369183.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 4 hurt, 2 critically injured in after truck overturns on van in Wazirabad||Six people, including a one-year-old boy, were injured after a container truck overturned and fell on the van they were travelling in at north Delhi’s Wazirabad on early Monday morning. Two of the six sustained critical injuries in the accident, said police.A senior police officer said the accident took place when the van was headed to Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh via Ring Road. The passengers inside the van were identifed as Amrinder Singh, 33, his wife Anita, 28, and their one-year-old son; his sister-in-law Kavita, 35, and Prabhu Kumar, 25, a neighbour. Pranjul Kumar, 21, was driving the van, said police.As the van neared the CNG pump on the Ring Road at Wazirabad, a container truck coming from behind overturned while overtaking it, and fell on the van. All the six occupants were trapped inside the van. Passersby and locals rescued four of them, but the driver and Prabhat remained trapped inside the van, said police.“A crane was used to lift the container truck and the van. The rescue team cut the van’s roof with a gas cutter and rescued the two men. They were critically injured. All six were admitted to a nearby hospital. They are undergoing treatment,” said the officer, adding that the driver fled the spot after the accident.“A case has been registered and both the truck and the damaged van have been impounded,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-4-hurt-2-critically-injured-in-after-truck-overturns-on-van-in-wazirabad-101626719309166.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||Underground car parks among govt proposals to improve Delhi master plan 2041||Developing underground multi-level parking sites at parks, and allowing a floor area ratio (FAR) incentive to builders who surrender land for public use are among some of the proposals that the Delhi government has made as its feedback to the draft Master Plan for Delhi-2041, state urban development minister Satyendar Jain said on Monday.The DDA has prepared the master plan, and put it in the public domain seeking suggestions and feedback. Once notified by the Centre, the plan will act as a blueprint for the development of the Capital.On Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal chaired a meeting to review the master plan with different agencies such as the PWD, DJB and DTC, in addition to the power, industries and transport departments. According to documents shared by the administration, the suggestions are mostly to improve housing, economy, environment and parking in the city.“Parking is a common problem... To deal with the issue, the government has proposed that multi-level car parking lots may be allowed under existing parks within a colony or nearby areas. At such sites, public parks can be reconstructed on top of such structures and the cost...can be subsidised by allowing the construction of indoor sports clubs, community/multipurpose halls for public use... This will ensure parking within 300 metres of the residence,” said Jain, who is also Delhi’s PWD minister.To increase the number of public green spaces, the Delhi government has proposed an “FAR Regeneration Policy” where developers who surrender land for public use are incentivised by offering proportionate excess FAR. Floor area ratio is the ratio of a building’s total floor area to the size of the piece of land upon which it is built.For affordable rental housing, it suggests increasing the maximum ground coverage -- the construction on the ground floor -- from 33.33% to 40% and FAR from 200% to 400%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-govt-sends-dda-feedback-on-master-plan-2041-101626719249145.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||When it rains, it pours: Large parts of Delhi submerged, temperature drops 8°C||After a weeks-long wait, the hot, humid days in the national capital on Monday gave way to the season’s first spell of heavy rain, which proved a nightmare for motorists and commuters across the city, but pulled the mercury down by eight degrees, and broke the weather office’s spell of inaccurate forecasts.At least two drowning deaths in city amid rainThe city received 69.6mm of rain in 24 hours, a spell that led to the temperature dropping to 26.5 degrees Celsius, down from 36.4°C the previous day, and eight degrees below normal for this time of year. In fact, Delhi’s daytime temperature on Monday was the lowest for the season since July 30, 2014, when the mercury dipped to 24.9°C. The minimum on Monday was 24.2°C, three degrees below normal.The showers started early on Monday morning, and continued throughout the day.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Safdarjung observatory, the official marker for the city’s weather, received nearly 70mm rainfall between 8.30am on Sunday and 8.30am on Monday. From then onwards, the city received another 38.4mm of rain (classified as “moderate”) till 5.30pm.The Palam weather station recorded 99.3 mm 24-hour rainfall and 66.6 mm rain during the day. Lodhi Road station got 62 mm 24-hour rainfall while recording 34.1 mm during the day. Ridge and Aya Nagar stations recorded 58 and 51 mm 24-hour rainfall. These stations got 45.8 mm and 39.8 mm rainfall during the day.Showers wreak havoc in Millennium CityThe monsoon arrived in Delhi on July 13, after a 16-day delay, and a series of inaccurate forecasts by the Met department. After moderate showers on the first two days of its onset, the city got only “traces” of rainfall, despite predictions of light rain and thundershowers, and an “orange alert” that was issued for the weekend.After Monday’s dip, IMD officials said the temperature is likely to rise over the next few days.“Light rainfall is likely on Tuesday as well. However, the activity will slow down thereafter and may pick up again on July 23-24,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Independent weather forecasters said that with Monday’s rainfall, Delhi’s overall rain deficit of the monsoon season is 3%. “Between June 1 and July 19, Delhi recorded 180.4mm rain against the normal of 185.3mm,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private forecaster.However, Srivastava said rain at the Safdarjung observatory is now in the green for the month. “With the rainfall on Monday, July has received 220.4mm rainfall, while the normal for this month is 210mm rainfall,” he said.The rain brought traffic to a standstill at several arterial roads during the rush hours.Delhi Traffic Police said that in many areas, the early morning showers that continued throughout the day led to roads being inundated. While traffic was diverted at several places, some areas were barricaded because of a portion of the road caving in.There are around 150 waterlogging-prone stretches across the city, of which civic authorities consider five crucial — Minto Bridge, Pul Prahladpur, Zakhira, Moolchand and Peeragarhi.The Pul Prahladpur underpass was blocked for traffic after water started accumulating in it around 7.30am. “Eight pumps have been installed at the site and water was still being pumped out of the spot in the evening,” said a senior PWD official requesting anonymity.Traffic police data showed that 51 key stretches, most of which are from the list of flood-prone areas, were inundated and pumps were put to use. These include Vasant Kunj underpass, DND-Ashram, Cariappa Marg, Sarai Kale Khan to Barapullah, Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, Pul Prahladpur, Dwarka Link Road, Okhla Mandi, Lajpat Nagar Metro station, Mayapuri Metro station, Adchini, Spinal Injury Hospital, IP Estate and Tilak Nagar, among others.Residential colonies including Greater Kailash, Hauz Khas, East of Kailash, CR Park, Kailash Colony, RK Puram, Green Park, Alaknanda apartments, Saket, Jasola, Janakpuri, Karol Bagh, Pitampura and Laxmi Nagar reported incidents of waterlogging on the day.Civic bodies directed blame at PWD and the state’s irrigation and flood control (I&FC) department.“We have only four-feet-deep drains under our purview. We have completed de-silting ahead of the monsoon. These drains flow into the bigger drains under the PWD and I&FC that are not being cleaned,” said East corporation mayor Shyam Sundar Agrawal.A second PWD official said: “When there is a heavy downpour, areas get flooded and it takes some time for water to recede. The city’s drainage system has its own limitations and long-term plans are underway to improve the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/when-it-rains-it-pours-heavy-spell-of-rain-submerges-parts-of-delhi-mercury-dips-by-eight-degrees-101626719190624.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||'Govt to redesign Delhi’s drainage system': Kejriwal||The Delhi administration will redesign the city’s drainage system and identify more waterlogging hot spots so that area-specific interventions can be made to ensure smooth flow of traffic and people’s safety, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday.The decisions were taken in a monsoon review meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, and attended by the Delhi chief minister, Public Works Department (PWD) minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev, and other senior officers from agencies such as the municipal corporations (MCDs), PWD, flood and irrigation department and Delhi Jal Board (DJB).The announcement by the chief minister came on a day when a man drowned in the submerged Pul Prahladpur underpass -- one of the perennial problem points -- and at least 39 key road stretches were flooded after heavy morning rain. The stretches included Vasant Kunj underpass, Zakhira underpass, Mehruali Badarpur Road, Pul Prahladpur, Dwarka Link Road, Okhla Mandi, Lajpat Nagar Metro station, Adhchini, Spinal Injury Hospital, IP Estate, and others.Data from the state traffic police shows that at least 96 roads from a list of 150 stretches identified as “waterlogging prone” last month ended up with knee-deep water after showers on Tuesday, the day when monsoon officially arrived in the city albeit 16 days late.“Delhi, being the national capital, should have the best designed drainage system that unfortunately we do not have. There are a lot of places in Delhi where drains managed by the DJB and the MCDs converge, there is no coordination between them. I would like to suggest that PWD act as the nodal authority and redesign Delhi’s drainage system. If an excellent design is in place and all the agencies can work together on it, then we can implement it. Delhi should have a world-class drainage system,” Kejriwal said.The last drainage master plan was drafted by the Delhi administration in 1976. To be sure, Delhi was administered by a metropolitan council between 1966 and 1990. In 2016, the Delhi government commissioned a study of the city’s drainage system by IIT-Delhi. Following the study, a drainage master plan was compiled which had also pointed out to the fact that the city had no single agency to manage and maintain drainage. However, the plan could not be implemented.Kejriwal said once such a system is in place, then the agencies will have to de-silt or clean the main drains only once a year. “Also, the drainage system will be free of liability. So we should work on that prospect. We need to also popularise our grievance helpline numbers with the people of the city,” Kejriwal said.Senior officials who attended the meeting said Kejriwal praised officers for ensuring proper drainage at the Minto Bridge this year. “I am pleased with the work done by our agencies... In Delhi, it is said if Minto Bridge gets waterlogged, then monsoons have begun in the city. But, this time, Minto Bridge is the talk of the town for all the good reasons,” Kejriwal said.This year, Delhi government’s PWD identified 147 vulnerable spots that are most prone to waterlogging during the rains. Some of the vulnerable spots identified are Vikas Marg (Karkardooma courts, Laxmi Nagar metro station), Netaji Subhash Marg, Anand, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, etc.Asking officials to increase the number of identified flooding hot spots, Kejriwal said, “We know of 147 such vulnerable points. If we conduct extensive mapping, we can enlist all possible vulnerable points. If solutions for all vulnerable points are planned and worked towards like the Minto Bridge, then we can bring Delhi freedom from waterlogging.”PWD minister Satyendar Jain asked the agencies to be fully prepared as Delhi is likely to receive more rainfall this week. “In the next three days we are going to have excess rainfall, so we need to be fully prepared to handle the situation. We have to be alert during the day, and extra alert during the night. We have over 1,500 pump sets and we should deploy them all,” he said.Jain directed officers and engineers to be available and alert 24x7 for the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-drainage-system-to-be-redesigned-more-waterlogging-spots-to-be-identified-kejriwal-101626719190005.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||ITO, INA Market, DU campuses to be made friendlier for pedestrians||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has proposed a series of measures to make seven key areas, which include educational or institutional zones, traffic junctions, and important markets in the city, safe and friendly for pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles(NMV).The authority has come out with “walk plans” for ITO junction, INA market and Metro station, Hauz Khas/IIT-Delhi, Delhi university’s (north and south campuses), and Lajpat Nagar and Kamla Nagar markets. These plans are part of the DDA’s walkability policy, which was approved in 2019, and is aimed at providing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in the Capital. According to the policy, 34% of all daily personal trips, 58% of all trips to educational institutions, and 31% of business or service trips are “walk only”.The walk plans were approved last week by the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC), which is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.DDA officials said all the areas taken up have a high volume of pedestrians moving amid high-speed traffic, specially at ITO junction, Aurobindo Marg near INA, Ring Road, and Outer Ring Road.The agency plans to prepare 27 more walk plans, of which 15 are ready, including the ones approved last week. DDA officials said walk plans are being prepared for Nehru Place, Bhikaji Cama, all interstate bus terminuses, and Karol Bagh, market among others.“We have considered an area within a radius of about 500metres around the Metro stations to implement the plan. We will soon send the plans to Delhi government’s public works department (PWD), which can prepare a detailed project report and implement the project, a senior DDA official said, asking not to be named.However, when contacted, a senior PWD official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that they had not received any plan so far.DDA officials said the area-specific walk plans aim to address localised problems. For instance, the walk plan for ITO junction, one of the busiest traffic junctions in the city, talks about connecting the skywalk, which was made operational in 2019, with the foot overbridge at Tilak Bridge railway station. “A large number of people who work at ITO come on trains from nearby towns. In the absence of proper connectivity to ITO, people have to walk along the railway tracks to reach ITO. Connecting the overbridge at Tilak Bridge with the skywalk will provide thousands of people hassle-free access to ITO and Pragati Maidan Metro station,” said a DDA official in the know of the plan.Amit Bhatt, head of transport, World Resources Institute (WRI), India, said, “There is a need to calculate the influence area at ITO. Its influence area is between Delhi Gate and India Gate. Just improving the ITO junction won’t help. For significant results, a walk plan for a big area around ITO has to be prepared.”The walk plan also talks about providing a dedicated cycling path and continuous pavement of 500m around ITO Metro station.Experts have welcomed the DDA’s decision to prepare area-specific walk plans, but they said there is a need to have a comprehensive walkability plan for the city. Bhatt said, “The world over, cities which have good pedestrian infrastructure have city-level walkability plans, which are essential as they broadly indicate requirements such as minimum width of pavements, lights, shade, pedestrian-friendly crossings etc. For instance, a 2m wide pavement is required, especially on arterial roads. Area-specific plans can then be prepared or tweaked as per the ground situation.”The walk plans propose having pavement width of 1.8-2m in all the six areas.But Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said the width of the pavement should be determined by the pedestrian volume in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ddas-walk-plans-ito-ina-and-kamla-markets-to-be-friendlier-for-pedestrians-101626719129669.html

Residents alleged that worst affected are K and L blocks.Gurminder Singh Bedi (Micky), president of Kailash Fraternity, one of the residents’ groups in the area, said he has been receiving complaints from several households. “Initially, the water looked dirty too. Over the past few days, though the water appears clean, it stinks of sewage. It appears to be an issue with the pipelines, which often get mixed with the sewerage network. We are buying drinking water and using it for other chores as well,” he said.He added that he has raised the issue with authorities.“DJB (Delhi Jal Board) officials, who were supposed to visit the area to collect samples for testing, have not turned up so far. We have also been circulating the issue on the WhatsApp group the residents have with the local MLA, but there has been no response,” Bedi said.Mandira Mitra, a resident of the colony’s K-block, said that the water smells foul even after being boiled.“We have been boiling the water for domestic chores but the stench is just too bad. One of these days, we had to call for a tanker, because the water from the tap could just not be used,” said Mitra.A senior DJB official said they received a complaint and were looking into the matter.“The matter is being examined and normal water supply will be restored at the earliest,” said the official, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-kailash-colony-residents-complain-of-unusable-tap-water-101626719009205.html

For the second year, the palkhis travelled by MSRTC in wake of the tradition of the walking wari (pilgrimage) being cancelled due to Covid-19. As restrictions are in place only a limited number of warkaris and state government officials were allowed for the departure ceremony. Both palkhis reached Wakhri, a village before Pandharpur, in the evening. On Tuesday, Ashadhi Ekadashi, the warkaris along with the palkhis will walk to Pandharpur. Eight prominent palkhis of various saints from all over the state reached Pandharpur on Monday, also by bus. Every year hundreds of thousands of pilgrims walk from Dehu and Alandi to Pandharpur, all devotees of Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwar. Before the pandemic, annually, 0.4 million warkaris joined in several dindis (group of warkaris) and walked with the Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram palkhis from Alandi and Dehu villages, respectively, to Pandharpur. There are 250 registered dindis (group of warkaris) that accompany the palkhi to Pandharpur. Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray along with his wife Rashmi, drove to Pandharpur. The state’s official “Maha Puja” will be done by Thackeray and another warkari couple at 2 am on July 20, in the main Vittal Rukhamini temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/palkhis-reach-pandharpur-in-time-for-ashashi-ekadashi-101626715589430.html
20-07-2021||Pune||At ₹10 for a full-day fare, Punyadarsham leaves Pune commuters more than satisfied||PUNE Punyadarsham – the ₹10 full-day fare for a bus service launched by the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and the PMC on July 10, is making travel within the parts of the city easier.When HT boarded the bus on route number 5 from Swargate to Pune station, passing through Nana peth on a rainy Monday afternoon, passengers on board were really happy with the initiative. However, drivers have a few complaints. The bus journey from Swargate to Pune station saw less crowded, while the return trip saw more passengers getting into the bus. Standing passengers are not allowed due to Covid norms, however, the driver and conductor were left with no option and allowed a few to stand till the nearest stopTukaram Mote, an employee of the Maharashtra Security Force, on board the bus, said, “PMPML should expand such services to other parts of the city as well. Travelling for a whole day in ₹10 is saving a lot of money. One can travel hassle-free. Since its launch, I travel every day from Swargate to Pune station. Even if I have a double shift, now there is no need to spend more money for a double trip.”PMPML has launched 50 such buses on nine routes. Most of the buses are travelling distances of 5km.The bus has a CCTV which captures images from four directions.“I have to travel frequently between Nana peth and Pune station every day, almost five times. This ₹10 ticket makes things easier now instead of buying a new ticket every time,” said Anil Kumar, a carpenter from Jodhpur, on board the bus.Sandeep Pradhan, an officer of the agriculture department in Nanded, said, “I did not know about this service, when I came in the morning from Nanded. The conductor told me at the Pune station about this new bus service. It was safe and comfortable and even with the rain, all my work was done easily.”Bus conductor, Balasaheb PaygudeFootfall is increasing every day. Buses are running full in the morning session: 7:30am to 10.30am, and in the evening session, 3.30pm to 10.30pm. In afternoon there is a little less crowd.Continuous inflow of new passengers generates more revenue.If all passengers travel directly between the two main station (Pune station to Swargate), then one trip generates ₹220, as there are 22 seats in the bus.Narayan Kamthe, bus driver The bus service is no doubt a boon for the general public, but seating arrangements for the driver are uncomfortable, as there is no space for a foot rest. We have to keep the foot on the clutch all the time. The side rear view mirror should be placed a little higher. Whenever we start the AC, it impacts the speed of the vehicle. However, due to Corona we are not keeping the AC on and keeping the windows open instead. Chetna Kerure, joint managing director, PMPMLEvery day we are receiving a footfall of around 20,000 passengers. The aim of starting this service was to attract people to use public transport and reduce the number of private vehicles on roads, especially in the core areas of the city. On all the routes of the ATAL service (Aligning Transit on All Lanes for ₹5 for 5km) have been converted to Punyadarsham service. If we get a good response we may expand the same service to other parts of the city. Any government ID proof is allowed.

He issued these instructions to the officials concerned at a Covid-19 review meeting.“All administrative preparations in view of the festival of Bakrid should be completed. Considering Covid-19, not more than 50 people should gather at any place associated with the festival. Ensure that no cow, camel, or any other prohibited animal is sacrificed. The sacrifice must not take place at any public place and only earmarked places, or private spaces should be used (for sacrifice). Cleanliness should be paid special attention to. Issue detailed guidelines in this regard,” he said.CM orders action against substandard trauma centresChief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday ordered action against all substandard trauma centres that have mushroomed in different parts of the state.“No one can be allowed to play with public health. The state government is committed to providing quality medical care to people. It has come to the notice of the state government that (there are) trauma centres in the state that lack standards or are below standard. This is unacceptable. Launch an in-depth probe. Mark such centres and act against them,” he said to the officials concerned at the Covid-19 review meeting.Once again, no district in Uttar Pradesh reported new Covid-19 cases in double digits in the past 24 hours, he said.There was no fresh Covid-19 case in 55 districts while single-digit cases were reported in the remaining 20 districts.At present, the state has 1,188 active Covid-19 cases (patients under treatment). As many as 2.18 lakh tests were done in the past 24 hours and 40 people tested positive for Covid-19 while 99 patients recovered during the same period. The positivity rate has remained at 0.02% and the recovery rate is 98.6%“Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Shamli and Shravasti have no active cases,” he said and added that this indicated that the state’s policy of “trace, test, treat, and vaccinate” was working well.He also said that vaccination was going on well in the state with a total of 4.30 crore doses administered so far, including 3.38 crore first doses. He asked officials to further speed up the vaccination drive.6,400 PICU, 2,700 NICU beds in place Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state had put in place a total of 6,400 PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) beds at medical colleges and 2,700 NICU (neo-natal intensive care unit) beds at the health department’s hospitals. The work on creating more PICU and NICU beds for taking care of children’s health should be speeded up in all districts, he said. The steps have been taken in view of experts’ predictions of a possible third wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-no-cow-camel-sacrificed-on-bakrid-yogi-adityanath-101626712709092.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||Property feuds, extortion feed gangs of Delhi||March 25, 2021: Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, one of Delhi’s busiest government health facilities with a nearly 5,000 daily footfall, was abuzz with activity when gunshots rang around the building, and people outside the gate of the OPD building spotted a man running out with blood oozing out of his chest. Nearly 50 metres away from the gate, he collapsed. Almost the same time, another gunshot was heard near the main gate when two men threw a man and his wife off his bike and fled on the two-wheeler..It was a carefully planned operation by two fugitive dons to help Kuldeep Mann alias Fajja, who was in the hospital that day, to flee police custody, investigators have said. At least 17 criminals, in separate teams, were present inside and outside the hospital premises for the operation, according to the charge sheet filed in the case. Fajja was brought to the hospital from Mandoli Jail by a police team for a check-up at the surgery OPD when the suspects attacked the police team. Though one was shot dead in the hospital, and another was injured, Fajja managed to escape on the robbed bike.Less than 72 hours after the shoot-out in the busy hospital, police shot dead Fajja in an encounter in another gunfight -- this time at a residential apartment block in north Delhi’s Rohini, where the gangster was hiding in an associate’s flat. Fajja was named in 11 criminal cases, including five murders and three robberies, and was a key member of the Jitender Gogi gang.Gunfights have become more common between the police and criminals in the Capital. In the last three days, there have been three shoot-outs between police and criminals. To be sure, not all of them involve those associated with gangs.Sandeep Kala Jathedi, Neeraj Bawana, Kapil Sangwan, Jitender Gogi and Ashok Pradhan run one of the most notorious gangs active in Delhi. Except Jathedi and Sangwan, all others are currently in jail. However, the disclosures by the gang members, who are arrested in different cases, confirm that despite being behind the bars, these gangsters continue to run their activities, mostly extortion.According to the police’s annual crime data, over 100 people filed complaints alleging criminals and gangsters threatening them for protection money in 2020. Last year, police registered 120 extortion FIRs, while the number in 2019 was 179.This means, criminals and gangsters threatened at least 120 people asking for extortion or protection money. To be sure, the actual number of such people could be more because many complainants do not inform police and pay the money out of fear.The police in their press statements have in past few years mentioned that Delhi gangsters extorted sums ranging from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore.Land disputes and crime in Delhi’s wild westPolice officers who have investigated cases related to gang wars say that even though there are similarities between the Mumbai underworld and Delhi’s gangs, they differ in the fact that most of the Capital’s criminal groups have largely local interests. They added that due to constant pressure by the police, over the years, Delhi never had a big organised crime problem.The officers said there are at least 20-30 big organised criminal gangs in Delhi, whose members are mostly from the city’s urban villages located on the periphery of the national capital.When asked for specific examples, serving and retired police officers pointed out that Neeraj Bawana and Gaurav alias Monty, who was arrested last Friday, are the manifestation of the rise of the organised crime in Delhi. Both Neeraj and Gaurav are residents of Bawana village.In 1996, the Supreme Court ordered shifting of small scale industrial units from Delhi’s residential areas to the villages such as Bawana and Narela. Retired government officials said that for shifting the industries, the government acquired around 1,865 acres in Bawana at an estimated cost of ₹7 lakh per acre. This meant overnight riches for the local farmers.Arvind Kumar, a social activist in Bawana, whose family was relocated to the area in 2004, said, “When the government started buying land for industries, the original owners (village residents) became rich overnight. But for the industries that were shifted from the centre of the city to the fringes, the deal was not profitable. As failed industries started vacating the allocated plots, individuals and groups started using the opportunity to grab this land.”Kumar said poorly implemented industrial zoning; some families becoming millionaires over night; many youngsters seeing an opportunity around them to make quick money and property feuds led to the rise of a real estate mafia.Police officers say several local groups galvanised around their leaders, depending on their loyalty, and the property dispute they were related to.“Many local criminals found it lucrative to extort money from traders who had set up factories there. All Delhi criminals such as Neeraj Bawana, Ashok Pradhan, Sandeep Kala Jathedi specialise in extortion. In outer Delhi, traders were asked what was famous as Neeraj Tax (named after Neeraj Bawana). When the factory owners refused to pay, they were threatened or shot dead. In such cases, when the factory owners leave the factory, the criminals use their muscle power to grab the property. And then they fight among themselves for the land,” a police officer, who asked not to be named, said.Another senior officer who asked not to be named cited the murder of wrestler Sagar Dhankhad, in which two-time Olympic medalist, Sushil Kumar, has been arrested. He said the murder was a fallout of a dispute over a property in north Delhi’s Model Town area, adding that the case shows the deep connection between land and crime in Delhi. Though Sushil has not been linked with any gang, but Dhankhad was allegedly associated with Kala Jathedi, the police said.Jailed, but no barIn August 2015, two members of the Neetu Dabodia gang were travelling in a police van from the Rohini court to Tihar Jail. The other seven were from Neeraj Bawana’s gang, with the leader himself being present in the vehicle. As soon as the van left the court premises, the seven pounced upon the two and strangled them. Then, they stomped on their faces so hard that an eye of one of the victims gouged out. The alert van driver immediately took the vehicle to Mahavir Hospital on the outer Ring Road, where the two -- Paras Vikram and Pradeep Bhola -- were pronounced dead on arrival.And the terror of these ganglords has not diminished over the years.Recently, the police decided against shifting Sushil Kumar from Mandoli Jail to Tihar. The reason: Several members of Kala Jathedi gang are lodged in Tihar and the police felt that Sushil may not be safe there. The Intelligence Bureau also informed prison and police officers about a possible threat to him from another gangster prisoner, Lawrence Bishnoi, who came to prison after Kumar. Though prisoners have to spend 14 days in quarantine at Mandoli before being shifted to Tihar, the threat to Kumar was so high that Bishnoi was shifted to Tihar, away from Kumar’s cell in Mandoli, within a few days.A prison spokesperson, said, “Tenders have been floated to install two body scanners on a trial basis. The idea was proposed in 2011 but it took time to get permission. Tihar will be the first jail to get such scanners. Prisoners will not be able to smuggle weapons or phones, once it is installed.”The glamour of crimeAdvocate LN Rao, a former deputy commissioner of police, who led many police encounters over three decades, said, “In the 90’s most criminals were from western UP. There were gangsters like Ranpal Gujjar and Brij Mohan Tyagi, who were based in UP. Today’s youngsters have realised how easy it is to make money by extortion. They then use social media to spread their name.”Ashok Chand, a retired IPS officer, who headed Delhi police’s special cell and the crime branch, said,“We did not allow the Mumbai underworld to spread its tentacles here. The gangsters in Delhi in the 90s were mostly from western UP. Delhi had Kishen Pehalwan but even he did not have the aura that the current ones have. Delhi gangsters are being glamourised by the media. Maybe social media is also to be blamed for making heroes out of them.”To be sure, in most cases it is the gang members themselves who eulogise their leaders on social media. Many of these have presence on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and even Twitter. They even have fan pages. Gangsters like Lawrence Bishnoi, Neeraj Bawana and Kapil Sangwan have multiple fan pages.What the police sayA Delhi Police spokesperson said they maintain a close eye on the activities of various criminals and keep organised crime under check. “There are small local gangs operating in rural or semi-rural areas who indulge in fight among themselves. They may also indulge in extortion from small businessmen or traders to make easy money, but most of their gang leaders are behind bars. In fact their network of operation is very limited. Most importantly, ordinary citizens of Delhi are not much affected. We have arrested gangs operating in the name of Manjeet Mahal or Jitender Gogi or Dhillu gangs. 80% of all the gang members are now in various jails of Delhi NCR. Delhi Police does not allow organised crime to thrive.”The special cell and special staff teams have been tasked with keeping a check on any form of organised crime, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/property-feuds-extortion-feed-gangs-of-delhi-101626650526488.html
20-07-2021||Delhi||Villages set up own libraries with a little help from friends||It is a blistering afternoon, but as you enter the community library in Kalda village, located in the Panchayat Ghar in the midst of green agricultural fields, you are buffeted by a gust of cool breeze wafting through its high open doors. About a dozen youngsters sit hunched over books at brand new desks. The library’s iron shelves have books for various competitive examinations. Through its windows, one can see the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) in the distance. “It is the favourite place of youngsters in the village; they spend most of the time here preparing for various competitive exams,” says Arvind Nagar, a village volunteer, who helps manage the library, which opened in November last year with the money contributed by villagers.Kalda in Gautam Buddh Nagar district, about 45 km from Connaught Place, is not the only village to have set up a library—in fact, a rural library movement is sweeping across the country. In the past year alone, about 100 libraries with sleek, air-conditioned reading rooms have come up in the villages of Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr, among others as part of Gram Pathshala, a community initiative led by youngsters in these villages. It started last year when a few students in the village approached Lal Bahar, an inspector with National Human Rights Commission, who lives in Ganauli village in Ghaziabad, complaining of a lack of a place to study“I took up the matter with the villagers and the Gram Pradhan andsuggested that we should open a library in the village. Everyone immediately agreed. We collected 5 lakh rupees through donations from villagers and the library was opened in August last year,” says Lal Bahar.A month later, Bahar started reaching out to neighbouring villages to encourage them to build similar libraries. The villagers responded with great enthusiasm, and a brand-new library has since been inaugurated in one or the other village of these districts almost every week in Panchayat buildings, which had been out of use for years. On Sunday, Bahar attended the inauguration of the 100th such library in the region, which came up in Kailashpur village in Greater Noida in Gautam Buddh Nagar district.“Our mission is to open a library in every village of the country, and make Gautam Buddh Nagar the first district to have a library in every village,” says Bahar. “The villagers contribute anything between ₹100 to 20, 000 to set up the library. We only provide encouragement and advice. Now we are getting enquiries from villages in Bihar, Assam and Rajasthan and many other states,” adds Ajay Pal Nagar, who is part of the core team of Gram Pathshala initiative.A few km away from Kalda village is Koodi Kheda, another village, where about a dozen students are reading inside the library, which was inaugurated in February this year. Like the one in Kalda, this one is also located in the verdant surrounding of Panchayat Ghar, which was renovated for the library. The rustle of the trees is the only sound one hears inside its high-ceilinged reading room, whose walls are adorned with framed posters of national leaders, and many inspiring slogans, one of which reads, “When in doubt, come to the library”.“We decided to set up the library after the Gram Pathshala team approached our village and told us about their mission. Almost everyone in the village lapped up the idea,” says Arun Nagar, who is part of the village team that manages the library. Sunny Kumar, who is at the library preparing for the SSC GD examination for paramilitary services, adds, “I had no place to study at home. Lack of libraries and a place to study put students in villages at a great disadvantage. I am happy it is no longer the case in our village.”Indeed, these community efforts are important in a country like India where per capita expenditure on libraries is among the lowest in the world. The US, for example, spends, 35.96 dollars per capita annually on public libraries, but in India it is a meagre 7 paise. According to the 2011 Census, there were 70,817 libraries in rural areas and 4,580 in urban areas serving a population of more than 830 million and 370 million, respectively. While libraries were part of the Census for the first time in 2011, there was no precise information on their condition and service capabilities.While Ghaziabad-based Gram Pathshala’s movement’s objective is to give village students a convivial space to study, Noida-based organisation, Sarvahitey’s project Paper Bridge, aims to set up 1,000 libraries with the larger objective “to unify India culturally” and reduce a sense of alienation among the geographically isolated communities. Prem Prakash, the co-founder of Paper Bridge, says the organisation has set up over 300 libraries in villages in 11 states of the country, including the Northeast and Kashmir. “We have also set up about 150 libraries in the Naxal- affected rural areas of Jharkhand,” he says.The organisation runs book donation drives at schools, colleges, corporate houses and has so far collected over 200,000 books. “We encourage people donating books to write a message on them for the people in the region where the books are destined. These messages act as a soft bridge between people; that is why we have named the project Paper Bridge,” he adds.Among the villages where libraries have come up in the past few years, the most famous is Bhilar, near Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra. Famous as ‘Pustakanche Gaav’ or ‘Village of Books’, almost every house in this quaint hilly village has a library with about 1,000 books on a particular theme such as history, novel, short story, sports, among others. Large murals on the walls of the house depict the theme of the library it houses.The libraries in the village, also known as India’s Hay-on-Wye, after the famous Welsh village in the UK known for its literary festival, is a project started by the Maharashtra government in 2017 with the objective of promoting Marathi literature. “We provide books, shelves, tables and chairs to set up libraries in the drawing rooms of these houses. The villagers do not charge us any rent and are welcoming hosts. We keep adding new books to the collection,” says Vinay Mavlankar, the project manager, whose office is located in the Bhilar village, which also organises gala cultural and literary programmes.“Before Covid-19, we used to receive about 10 visitors a day. The library is part of our house, and so we get an opportunity to have long conversations with visitors about their lives, and literature, enhancing our understanding of other parts of the country and deepening our knowledge of books,” says Vaibhav Bhilare, whose house in the village is titled Kadambari-2, which is home to a library with Marathi novels.Bhilar has inspired many villages across the country.One of them is in Perumkulam, near Kollam, in Kerala. The villagers have put several sloped-roof, house-shaped glass bookshelves, with about 50 books each, across the village. Last year, well-known Malayalam writer MT Vasudevan Nair declared it a “village of books”.In the neighbouring Tamil Nadu, in the past few years, Shiva Shankar, a former professor at the Chennai Mathematical Institute and Asai Thambi Replong, English Literature professor at Pachaiyappa’s College, in Chennai, have been on a mission to set up libraries in Dalit villages across the state. So far, they have set up, 18 libraries in 15 districts, all of them with over 3,000 books. “We wish to create equitable opportunities for rural children and students, and our primary focus are Dalits. We approach the villages and all we ask for is a room in a public or private space and volunteers to run the libraries after we set it up. We want to create at least 100 libraries. Libraries, we believe, are an effective tool of social inclusion and empowerment,” says Replong.Agrees, Lal Bahar, the man who started the village library movement in western UP. “Libraries can be the key to the social, educational and cultural revival of villages,” he says. “Earlier, in our village when an elderly person saw a youngster loitering around, he would say, ‘what are you doing here, go home; now the elderly villager says, ‘do not waste your time, go to the library.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/villages-set-up-own-libraries-with-a-little-help-from-friends-101626637470382.html

Warehouse workers, who were considered essential, packed and shipped orders throughout the pandemic.Amazon disclosed in October that nearly 20,000 workers, or about 1.4% of its total workforce, had been infected with Covid-19 by that point in 2020.Vaccines began to roll out about two months later and in May, employees who uploaded a picture of their vaccine cards to an Amazon worker app were allowed to ditch masks in the work place if they chose.U.S. cases of Covid-19 last week increased by 17,000 nationwide over a 14-day period for the first time since late fall, and an increase in death historically follows a spike in illness. Much of the worsening problem is being driven by the delta variant first identified in India, that has since hit the United Kingdom and other countries, said U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy.Health officials said Tuesday that the delta variant of the coronavirus continues to surge and accounts for an estimated 83% of U.S. Covid-19 cases.News that Amazon would stop testing workers was first reported by The Information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-to-end-testing-for-covid-19-at-warehouses-this-month-101626798064932.html

In the video posted on Instagram, Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark, Wally Funk and Olive Daemen can be seen floating inside the space capsule that blasted off the New Shepard rocket from Blue Origin’s private launch site in the West Texas desert.“This is how it starts. #gradatimferociter,” wrote Bezos on Instagram, referring to Blue Origin's motto which means “Step by Step, Ferociously" in Latin.The 93-seconds long video clip shows the crew members experiencing zero-g outside the Earth’s atmosphere after they travelled above the Kármán Line, the internationally-recognised boundary of space. As they were performing somersaults in near-zero gravity, Earth was visible in the background through the huge windows of the spacecraft.“Fantastic...that’s great...I love it,” 82-year-old Wally Funk, who became the oldest person to have flown in space can be heard saying.A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)Also Read | Jeff Bezos back on earth after 10-min flight to space on Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraftThe first human spaceflight from Blue Origin safely touched down after about 10 minutes of flight. It was the first time in the history of a commercial company launching a privately funded and built spacecraft from a private launch range with astronauts on board."Every astronaut who's been up into space, they say that it changes them ... they look at it and they're kind of amazed and awestruck by the Earth and its beauty, but also by its fragility, and I can vouch for that," Bezos told reporters after the successful flight.This month has witnessed two successful crewed suborbital flights from private companies, with billionaire Richard Branson beating his competitors in flying above Earth’s atmosphere on his Virgin Galactic’s rocket ship. Branson congratulated the Blue Origin crew for the major milestone in commercial spaceflight."Well done @blueorigin, @jeffbezos, Mark, Wally and Oliver. Impressive!

20-07-2021||World||Research finds novel coronavirus, related to SARS-Cov-2 that causes Covid-19, in horseshoe bats in UK||A novel coronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 in humans, has been detected in horseshoe bats in the United Kingdom, a new collaborative research from the University of East Anglia, Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Public Health England (PHE) showed. The researchers, however, said that there is no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to humans, or that it could in future, unless it mutates.The new virus falls within the subgroup of coronaviruses called sarbecoviruses which contains both SARS-CoV-2, that causes Covid-19, and SARS-CoV, which was responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak.Researchers from the University of East Anglia collected faecal samples from more than 50 lesser horseshoe bats from places like Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wales. The samples were then sent to the Public Health England for viral analysis, the university’s website said.The genome sequencing of the bat samples has detected the presence of novel coronavirus in one of the samples. It has been named ‘RhGB01’ by the team. The sarbecovirus, SARS-related coronavirus, has been found for the first time in a lesser horseshoe bat and it is also the first to be discovered in the United Kingdom.Also, the researchers said that the bats would have “almost certainly” harboured the virus for a very long time and this is the first time that this has been tested and so has been found now. Unless the virus mutates, they are unlikely to pose a direct risk to humans, they added.The virus could mutate if a Covid-19 infected human passes it to an infected bat, the researchers said. They also asked anyone who comes into contact with bats or their droppings to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).“Horseshoe bats are found across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia and the bats we tested lie at the western extreme of their range,” said professor Diana Bell of the University of East Anglia. “Our research extends both the geographic and species ranges of these types of viruses and suggests their more widespread presence across more than 90 species of horseshoe bats,” she added.“Our findings highlight the need for robust genotype testing for these types of viruses in bat populations around the world. And it raises an important question about what other animals carry these types of viruses,” she further said.“Our findings highlight that the natural distribution of sarbecoviruses and opportunities for recombination through intermediate host co-infection have been underestimated,” said Prof Andrew Cunningham from the Zoological Society of London.Ensuring that the UK virus is not a threat to humans, Cunningham said, “But the problem is that any bat harbouring a SARS-like coronavirus can act as a melting pot for virus mutation.”“Preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to bats, and hence reducing opportunities for virus mutation, is critical with the current global mass vaccination campaign against this virus,” Prof Cunningham further said.The closest relative to the virus was found to be one discovered in a Blasius’ bat from Bulgaria in 2008, further analysis of the virus in comparison with others found in horseshoe bat species in China, southeast Asia and Europe showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/research-finds-novel-coronavirus-related-to-sars-cov-2-in-horseshoe-bats-in-uk-101626795475866.html
20-07-2021||World||EU says democratic standards under threat in Poland, Hungary||Democratic standards in the European Union are eroding in several member countries, particularly in Hungary and Poland where judicial independence is under threat, the EU’s executive commission said Tuesday in its annual report on adherence to the rule of law.The report also singled out Slovenia, which recently took over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Council, for attacks against the Balkan nation's media.“There are causes for serious concern in a number of member states, especially when it comes to the independence of judiciary,” said Vera Jourova, the Commission vice-president for Values and Transparency.The review, which is in its second year, was published a week after the EU’s top court ruled that Poland’s way of disciplining judges contravenes EU law and undermines judicial independence, telling the country’s right-wing government which introduced the system to change it.The European Commission has also started legal action against Poland and Hungary for what the EU’s executive arm sees as blatant disrespect for the rights of LGBT people.The wide-ranging audit found Poland deficient in the four main areas reviewed: national justice systems, anti-corruption frameworks, media freedom and checks and balances.According to the EU's executive arm, reforms of the Polish justice system carried out over the past six years by the current government continue to increase the influence of the government over the justice system, damaging judicial independence.The report also pointed out a risk of “undue influence on corruption prosecutions for political purposes" and noted a deterioration of working conditions for journalists, “with use of intimidating judicial proceedings."Hungary was criticized for its perceived inadequate anti-corruption measures and the report noted that media pluralism “remains at risk." The report depicted a bleak media situation in Slovenia, reporting online harassment and threats against journalists.The EU has repeatedly warned that democratic standards are being challenged in Hungary and Poland. At a June summit, EU leaders strongly clashed with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban over new legislation that bans the display of LGBT issues to children in that country.Earlier this year, the European Union’s executive arm also condemned Slovenia’s right-wing prime minister, Janez Jansa, for a series of aggressive comments about journalists.But the EU's criticism seems to have little effect. After the European Court of Justice's ruling, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki dismissed it as a “typical dispute of the doctrine” and insisted that the EU court has no authority on the shaping of the justice systems in individual member nations.Jourova said the commission has asked Poland to fully comply with the ruling by Aug. 16 or face financial sanctions and an infringement procedure.“EU law has primacy over national law. All decisions by the European Court of Justice are binding," she said.The aim of the report is not to sanction countries. To try to rein in member states they believe are at fault, EU institutions can use the so-called Article 7 procedure, but proceedings launched against Poland and Hungary have not been conclusive so far.EU lawmakers have been losing patience and threatened last month to sue the bloc’s executive branch if it fails to take action against countries allegedly violating democratic standards, notably Hungary and Poland. They urged European Parliament President David Sassoli to demand that the European Commission “fulfil its obligations” within two weeks, under a system tying access to some EU funds to a country’s respect for the rule of law.The system was included in the budget the EU approved last year covering the 2021-27 period and which also included a massive coronavirus economic stimulus fund. In March, the right-wing governments of Poland and Hungary filed a complaint with the European Court of Justice to challenge it.Both countries have submitted their plans to receive a share of the €800 billion EU recovery fund to finance the 27-nation bloc’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis, but the commission has yet to approve them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-democratic-standards-under-threat-in-poland-hungary-101626790426387.html

The founder of Blue Origin was accompanied by brother Mark Bezos, Wally Funk, and 18-year-old passenger Oliver Daemen."Congratulations to all of Team Blue past and present on reaching this historic moment in spaceflight history. This first astronaut crew wrote themselves into the history books of space, opening the door through which many after will pass," Blue Origin said after the capsule carrying the passengers touched down safely.The mission marked another milestone in the space race started by private companies. It was the first time in the history of a commercial company launching a privately funded and built spacecraft from a private launch range with astronauts on board.The astronauts boarded the crew capsule 30 minutes before the launch and the hatch closed six minutes later. They experienced three to four minutes of zero-g and travelled above the Kármán Line, the internationally-recognised boundary of space. Blue Origin's recovery team joined the four-member crew to celebrate their return from space. The successful launch and subsequent touchdown made Wally Funk, 82, the oldest person and Daeman the youngest to have flown in space.New Shepard, a fully autonomous spacecraft, didn't have any Blue Origin staff astronauts during its maiden human spaceflight.Billionaire Richard Branson, who recently went into space aboard his Virgin Galactic's rocket ship, congratulated Blue Origin crew on their achievement.

20-07-2021||World||China threatens to nuke Japan over Taiwan in video: Report||A video where the Communist Party of China (CCP) is threatening Japan with a nuclear bomb for interfering in its handling of Taiwan has gone viral on social media, Fox News reported. The US channel carried a report which claimed that the video was aired on a channel approved by the CCP.In the video, as claimed by Fox News, the CCP singled out Japan as the one exception to China's policy to not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear powers."We will use nuclear bombs first," the CCP says in the vide, according to Fox News. The report further claimed that China's ruling party threatened of using the nuclear bombs continuously "till Japan declares unconditional surrender for the second time."According to Taiwan's local publication Taiwan News, the 5-minute-long video was uploaded on Sunday on China's YouTube-like platform Xigua and quickly gained two million views. It was later deleted, but copies of the video, which were uploaded by some users on YouTube and Twitter, still exist.In the video, a narrator dares Japan to interfere when China liberates Taiwan, warning of a full-scare war if the island nation tries to do so, Taiwan News reported. The CCP video also talks about the tension between the two countries and atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers against the Chinese during Sino-Japan wars, Taiwan News further reported.The threats follow comments made two weeks ago by Japanese officials about Taiwan's sovereignty, with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso saying that Japan must "defend Taiwan", according to Japan Times.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US. China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.Japan has been seeking to expand and deepen security ties with other nations in addition to its chief ally, the United States, as China presses its claims to contested areas in the South China Sea and to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls Diaoyu.Britain said on Tuesday that it would permanently deploy two warships in Asian waters after its Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier and escort ships sail to Japan in September where China is vying for influence. This comes after Japan expressed growing alarm in recent months over China's territorial ambitions in the region, including Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-to-nuke-japan-over-taiwan-in-video-report-101626785921884.html

It also warned that the rebound from the pandemic is set to drive emissions of greenhouse gases to all-time highs."We estimate that full and timely implementation of the economic recovery measures announced to date would result in CO2 emissions climbing to record levels in 2023, continuing to rise thereafter," the IEA said in the report.The agency highlighted that spending plans the governments across the world on clean energy in this quarter is $380 billion making up just 2% of their total stimulus funds in response to Covid-19.This, the IEA said, is around a third of what is needed according to its estimates in order to put the world on course to reach net zero emissions by mid-century."(Countries) must then go even further by leading clean energy investment and deployment to much greater heights beyond the recovery period in order to shift the world on to a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, which is narrow but still achievable - if we act now," IEA chief Fatih Birol said.The lack of sufficient green spending means that global emissions could go past their 2018 peak as soon as 2023, said IEA. To keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world needs to halve its emissions by the end of the decade relative to 2018, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-recovery-to-push-emissions-to-all-time-high-says-iea-101626771821241.html

American space agency Nasa has said that an asteroid named '2008 GO20' is headed towards the Earth at 18,000 miles an hour, but there is nothing to worry.The asteroid will go pass Earth on July 24, according to Nasa. The space agency has categorised the flying object as a Apollo class asteroid; for common people, it is as big as a stadium, or thrice the size of the Taj Mahal.Though the asteroid will be very close to Earth, it will still be 0.04 au (astronomical unit) away from Earth, according to Nasa's calculations. That's a distance of 3,718,232 miles. To put it in perspective, the moon is approximately 238,606 miles from Earth.Asteroid 2008 GO20 won't come any closer than 2,605,509 miles miles, according to interactive map give by Nasa.However, it has still been classified as Near Earth Object by Nasa due to its close approach with Earth.What are asteroids?According to the Nasa, asteroids are "rocky remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago". There are currently 1,097,106 known asteroids. These are different from meteors, which are small bodies of matter that appear as a streak of light when entering the Earth's atmosphere.Chinese researchers have proposed sending large rockets to practice turning away a sizable asteroid - a technique that may eventually be crucial if a killer rock is on a collision course with Earth - news agency Reuters reported.Sometime between late 2021 to early 2022, the United States will launch a robotic spacecraft to intercept two asteroids relatively close to Earth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asteroid-the-size-of-stadium-to-fly-past-earth-on-july-24-says-nasa-101626765408094.html
20-07-2021||World||UK PM Johnson junked Covid lockdown, said only elderly would die: Ex-aide Cummings||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was not prepared to impose lockdown restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 to save the elderly and denied the National Health Service would be overwhelmed, his former top adviser said in an interview aired on Monday.In his first TV interview since leaving his job last year, excerpts of which were released on Monday, Dominic Cummings said Johnson did not want to impose a second lockdown in the autumn last year because "the people who are dying are essentially all over 80".Cummings also claimed that Johnson wanted to meet Queen Elizabeth, 95, despite signs that the virus was spreading in his office at the start of the pandemic and when the public had been told to avoid all unnecessary contact, particularly with the elderly.The political adviser, who has accused the government of being responsible for thousands of avoidable Covid-19 deaths, shared a series of messages from October that are allegedly from Johnson to aides.In one message, Cummings said Johnson joked that the elderly could "get Covid and live longer" because most people dying were past the average age of life expectancy.Cummings alleges Johnson messaged him to say: "And I no longer buy all this NHS (National Health Service) overwhelmed stuff. Folks I think we may need to recalibrate."Reuters could not independently verify whether the messages were genuine.A spokesperson for Johnson said the prime minister had taken "the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice".Britain's opposition Labour Party said the revelations by Cummings strengthened the case for a public enquiry and were "further evidence that the prime minister has made the wrong calls time and again at the expense of public health".Cummings told the BBC that Johnson told officials that he should never have agreed to the first lockdown and that he had to convince him not to take the risk of meeting the queen."I said, what are you doing, and he said, I'm going to see the queen and I said, what on earth are you talking about, of course you can't go and see the queen," Cummings said he told Johnson. "And he said, he basically just hadn't thought it through."Despite questioning Johnson's fitness for his role as prime minister and castigating the government's fight against Covid-19, Cummings' criticism has yet to seriously puncture the British leader's ratings in opinion polls. The full interview will be broadcast on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-junked-covid-lockdown-said-only-elderly-would-die-ex-aide-cummings-101626764042178.html

The government has imposed a strict lockdown starting July 20 till July 24 due to the growing number of daily deaths and infections.The full lockdown will begin at 5pm Oman time on July 19 and end at 4am on July 24. According to local media reports, buses will remain completely suspended from July 20 and will resume on July 24.All commercial activities, public Eid prayers, traditional Eid market activities, travel and family reunions during the lockdown period have also been restricted by the Oman Supreme Committee.The holy festival of Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic or lunar calendar. According to Quran, the holy book of Islam, it is celebrated in commemoration of Prophet Abraham's faithfulness to god after he was tested to sacrifice his son. During the celebrations, Muslims sacrifice and distribute the meat of the sacrificed animal to the needy as well as their family members.The surge in the latest Covid-19 cases in Oman has mostly been led by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. According to local media reports, the steady rise in Covid-19 cases has led to the healthcare system being overwhelmed. Covid-19 wards are full and medics are restricting admissions only to patients who need inpatient treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oman-to-observe-eid-al-adha-amid-strict-covid-19-lockdown-101626763435244.html
20-07-2021||World||Pak-Taliban upbeat, but the Afghan battle has just begun||At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers' meet in Tajikistan and connectivity conference in neighbouring Uzbekistan past week, it was quite evident that rapidly changing events in Afghanistan had taken top priority in the global diplomatic circuit. Yet, all the countries including US, Russia, China and neighboring Central Asian republics are in a wait and watch mode even as the deep Pakistani state handling the Taliban are conducting a psychological operation by trying to convince the world that the fundamentalist are unstoppable and it is a matter of time when Kabul falls to them.While the security advisors from New York to Dushanbe are concerned about the Republic of Afghanistan being turned into Islamic emirate, the Taliban today is projecting an image that it is equally adept at fighting guerilla war as also a powerful negotiator as it has forced the US on the dialogue table to concede on issues critical to their longevity.The Taliban under ISI spin doctors have succeeded to certain extent in spreading that Pakistan-based Haibatullah Akhundzada, Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob have matured with both a military and diplomatic plan as compared to 1996 when the Taliban under Mullah Omar (father of Yaqoob) seized power in Kabul by torture, mayhem and public executions through hanging and stoning. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in September 1996 but was ostracised by the global community sans mentor Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates who recognised the Islamic State. The Taliban are now playing a two-pronged game by waging war in Afghanistan and talking peace outside the country to ensure that US and the west grant recognition to the Emirate when they capture Kabul through force or a transitional government. Mentor Pakistan will also reap collateral benefits of this after all they brought the once political pariah Taliban to the negotiating table with possible relief from the FATF grey list.A perception is deliberately being created to say that Taliban 2.0 is a different force from its original version and the rapid fall of Badakhshan, once a citadel of revolutionary Ahmed Shah Masoud, shows that the decimation of Northern Alliance, the powerful counter force to the Taliban in 1990s. A similar narrative is being built by Pakistani deep state me in northern territories where Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum writ used to run by claiming that Afghan security forces have virtually surrendered to the Talib. The projection that Taliban now comprises of non-Pashtun commanders including Shias, Uzbeks and Tajiks and represents a cross section of Afghanistan rather than a puritan Sunni Pashtun force with Deobandi ideology of the 1990s is to show the so called inclusivity of the Islamic warriors. Rather than be in a hurry, the Taliban are playing a deliberate game by consolidating their gained positions and at the same time talking about ceasefire in faraway Doha with both US and Russia not having stomach for any more battles for Afghanistan. China is playing through its proxy Pakistan and will coopt Afghanistan under Taliban in the Belt Road Initiative (BRI) to exploit natural resources of the strife torn country. However, this is far distant from truth on the ground.Fact is that Taliban is still largely a Sunni Pashtun force and not all the 30 percent Pashtuns in Afghanistan are with the fundamentalists as they have developed other interests. The ISI backed Taliban has taken control of border crossings in Afghanistan including Spin Boldak near Kandahar as it spells money and weapons from the truckers crossing the Afghan-Pak border. The Afghan special forces and hardcore military elements have withdrawn not because they fear Taliban onslaught but for military consolidation. After Gen Bismillah Khan Mohammadi has been appointed as new Afghan Defence Minister, the security forces are not only retaking districts but also counter-attacking. Gen Khan, who was Army Chief of Afghan National Army from 2002 to 2010, has been able to iron out differences within the Kabul government and has a cogent military strategy. It is quite evident that the Afghan security forces will not only defend but also take the war to the Taliban in their strongholds.“The Taliban currently has talk-talk war-war strategy to project that they have changed. It is only a matter of time that war-war strategy of Taliban will be evident to the world particularly the US and Russia. The ISI spin doctors are projecting an imminent Taliban victory but the fact is that Afghanistan is heading towards a civil war as the Afghan security forces will pushback for Taliban still do not take prisoners but kill them,” said a former foreign secretary. The Taliban animal has matured in age and cunning but its stripes remain unchanged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paktaliban-upbeat-but-the-afghan-battle-has-just-begun-101626760945887.html

The palace is in the middle of a so-called Green Zone that is fortified with giant cement blast walls and barbed wire, and streets near the palace have long been closed off.The barrage comes as the US and NATO complete their final withdrawal from Afghanistan which has unnerved Afghans uncertain whether their war-ravaged country will fall deeper into chaos and violence. The withdrawal is more than 95% complete and the final US soldier will be gone by August 31, President Joe Biden said in an address earlier this month.Abdullah Abdullah, the No. 2 official in the government, returned on Monday from the first high-level round of peace talks with the Taliban in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar. The two days of meetings aimed at jumpstarting stalled talks ended with a promise for more high-level talks.Abdullah was at the palace at the time of the rocket attack. Those inside the palace, however, were far removed from where the rockets landed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-rockets-hit-near-afghanistan-presidential-palace-officials-101626757752459.html

It seems like the ‘unidentified sources’ have supplied information that has no factual basis and are far from reality,” the NSO Group said in a statement.“We firmly deny the false allegations made in their report. Their sources have supplied them with information which has no factual basis, as evident by the lack of supporting documentation for many of their claims. In fact, these allegations are so outrageous... that NSO is considering a defamation lawsuit.”An investigation by a consortium of media houses has alleged that phone hacking software Pegasus was used to target potentially thousands of people around the world, including 38 Indian journalists, and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, political strategist Prashant Kishor and former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa.In its statement, the NSO Group also said that it “has a good reason to believe the claims that are made by the unnamed sources to Forbidden Stories, are based on misleading interpretation of data from accessible and overt basic information...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reports-full-of-wrong-assumptions-says-nso-group-101626740609238.html
20-07-2021||World||China, Iran diplomats among people in Pegasus list: Report||A number once used by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and those of dozens of diplomats in India from countries such as China and Iran are among potential targets selected by users of the Pegasus spyware programme, according to media reports on Monday.Woman who accused ex-CJI of harassment in surveillance listParis-based Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International have gained access to a leaked list of more than 50,000 records of phone numbers that clients of the Israeli company NSO Group, the developer of Pegasus, selected for surveillance. More than 1,000 phone numbers in India were part of the list, according to 17 media outlets that examined the list. The records included at least one number once used by Prime Minister Khan and that had been selected by a NSO client for surveillance, The Washington Post and Le Monde reported.“Not surprisingly, Pakistan is the most scrutinised country,” Le Monde said in its report.Decoding the legality of ‘authorised’ surveillance in India“The numbers of Imran Khan and several of his ambassadors in India appear on the list as potential targets. Dozens of other Delhi-based diplomats and ambassadors are also included, from Iran, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Saudi Arabia,” the report added.Hari Menon, the India head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and one more foundation employee and two employees of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in New Delhi were also on the list, The Washington Post reported.There was no immediate response from Indian officials or the missions of the countries named in the reports. Khan didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.While surveillance of phone numbers of diplomats is not unheard of around the world, the matter continues to be very sensitive. For instance, Pakistan’s security agencies have been known to tap the phones of all Indian diplomats and officials as well as those of visiting Indian journalists.Given India’s currently strained relations with China and Pakistan, closer scrutiny of the diplomats of both countries would not be surprising, experts said. However, most of the other countries named in the Le Monde report are not perceived as security concerns.NSO Group has said all its clients are sovereign governments and that all exports are cleared by the Israeli government. It has also said Pegasus has been used by some 60 intelligence and law enforcement agencies in 40 countries and insisted that the spyware, which can access all data on a mobile phone and turn it into an audio or video recorder, is for use only against terrorists and criminals.The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied licensing Pegasus and it has denied all the news reports.However, the global investigative project has alleged Pegasus was used to target politicians, ministers, civil society and rights activists and journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-iran-diplomats-among-people-in-list-report-101626736108335.html
20-07-2021||World||UK celebrates ‘freedom day’ but Covid cases peak||Day-to-day pandemic restrictions were lifted in England on Monday as the country’s “freedom day” met with deep concern from scientists as coronavirus cases surge across the nation.The country has lifted legal mandates on social distancing, wearing masks and working from home, urging personal responsibility instead. Covid-19 travel rules and self-isolation for close contacts remain in place.Nightclubs reopened their floors to dancing for the first time since March 2020, while sports stadia, cinemas and theatres can now run at full capacity.But while businesses are jubilant, many are worried about the government’s decision to scrap restrictions at a time when Covid-19 cases are on an upswing as the Delta variant, first detected in India, sweeps parts of Europe and Asia.Cases topped 50,000 per day last week for the first time since January, although virus deaths remain comparatively low so far.The country added more than 54,000 new cases Saturday, and over 47,600 on Sunday, more than Indonesia, the pandemic’s current epicenter, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University,Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has dialled down talk of freedom in recent weeks, urged the public to exercise “prudence and respect for other people and the risks that the disease continues to present”.The Prime Minister was spending “Freedom Day” in quarantine, along with treasury Rishi Sunak, after contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.Johnson tested negative for the disease on Monday.British officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the U.K.’s vaccine rollout — 68.3% of adults, or just over half of the total population, has received two doses — will keep the threat to public health at bay.Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was “confident” the government was “doing the right thing” now, before any winter resurgence in respiratory disease.But scientists described England’s “Freedom Day” as a threat to the whole world, and 1,200 scientists backed a letter to British medical journal The Lancet that criticized the Conservative government’s decision.“I can’t think of any realistic good scenario to come out of this strategy, I’m afraid,” said Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester. “I think it’s really a degree of how bad it’s going to be.”The end of restrictions in England is a critical moment in Britain’s handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 128,000 people nationwide, the highest death toll in Europe after Russia. Other parts of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are taking slightly more cautious steps out of lockdown and keeping mask requirements for now.Globally, the World Health Organization says cases and deaths are climbing after a period of decline, spurred by the delta variant.European nations including Greece, the Netherlands and Spain have been forced to reimpose restrictions to battle new outbreaks recently.In the U.S., many areas abandoned face coverings when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people didn’t need to wear them in most settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-celebrates-freedom-day-but-covid-cases-peak-101626723666174.html
20-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada extends ban on direct flights from India until August 21||The Canadian government has extended the prohibition on direct flights from India by another 30 days. The ban was set to expire on July 21, but will now remain in place until August 21.It is the fourth time the ban has been extended since it was first imposed on April 22 due to fears in Canada over the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and concerns over transmission of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.A release issued on Monday from Health Canada noted that the extension of the ban was “based on public health advice”. Canada has also extended the requirement related to third-country pre-departure Covid-19 tests for travellers to Canada from India via an indirect route. Passengers from India connecting at another point of departure for Canada will require a mandatory pre-departure negative RT-PCR test before continuing their journey to the Canadian destination.That announcement came even as Canada announced a slew of measures relaxing travel restrictions to the country. On September 7, if “domestic epidemiologic situation remains favourable”, Canada will open its borders “to any fully vaccinated travellers who have completed the full course of vaccination with a government of Canada-accepted vaccine at least 14 days prior to entering Canada and who meet specific entry requirements”.As a first step in this direction, fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents will be allowed to enter the country for non-essential travel on August 9, as long as they have completed their inoculations at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.Fully vaccinated travellers will also not require a post-arrival test from August 9, while those not fully vaccinated, unvaccinated or vaccinated with jabs not recognised by Canadian health authorities, will continue to be tested.Starting on the same day, the Canadian government is eliminating its mandatory three-day quarantine requirement at a designated hotel while awaiting results of the test. Vaccinated travellers will be exempted from any requirement for quarantine, but others will have to provide a quarantine plan.The vaccines authorised for emergency use in Canada are those made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca (Covishield), and Johnson & Johnson.India had recently petitioned the Canadian government to scrap the bar on direct flights, with India’s high commission in Ottawa sending a letter in this regard to Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry.“Canadians’ safety and security always come first. With rising vaccination rates and fewer cases in Canada, we can begin to safely ease border measures. A gradual approach to reopening will allow our health authorities to monitor the Covid-19 situation here and abroad,” Canada’s minister of health Patty Hajdu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-extends-ban-on-direct-flights-from-india-until-august-21-101626720510048.html

The Ankleshwar plant is moving towards vaccine production as per the original schedule; but the Bengaluru facility faced some difficulties in operationalisation that led to the lag in Covaxin supplies. The production fell slightly behind of what was initially expected but now, we have been told, that the glitches have been sorted. These are unforeseen circumstances that crop up while executing such highly technical projects that involve tackling live viruses. But now they are on track,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during Union health ministry’s Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday. He added that the vaccine supplies were in the process of being ramped up, and till such time that happens, states need to plan their drive accordingly.“The supply if vaccines and the implementation of vaccination drive is an inter-related process; the state governments are informed in advance about the amount of vaccine that will be available in the coming two weeks. All states are expected to plan their drive accordingly. Sometimes there can crop up issues in coordination, as there could be slight variation in the volume of batches released by the central drugs laboratory in Kasauli that we get to know in real-time,” he added.Pawar, while replying to a question in Rajya Sabha on Covid-19 vaccine supplies, also said that as communicated by the manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII) will also increase monthly Covishield vaccine production capacity from the current 110 million (11 crore) doses per month to at least 120 million (12 crore) doses per month.From January, 2021, to July 16, 2021, 360 million (36.01 crore) doses of Covishield have been supplied by SII, 54.5 million (5.45 crore) doses of Covaxin have been supplied by Bharat Biotech for the National Covid Vaccination Programme.Also, a total of 3.3 million doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V (3 million first component and 0.3 million second component) have been imported till July 14 this year.Giving details of the MoU between Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech for Covaxin, Pawar said that it’s a non-exclusive license granted to commercialize the product within 2 year period.“Royalty obligations- 5% on net sales, to be remitted on half yearly basis. Intellectual property (IP) to be jointly owned by ICMR and Bharat Biotech International Ltd (BBIL),” Pawar replied.“ICMR agreed to hand-over the strain to BBIL due to the following reasons: - BBIL had a validated BSL-3 facility ready for use… Other companies with interest in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development like Serum Institute of India were not interested in developing indigenous vaccine. Other companies like Cadila, Biological E did not have a validated BSL-3 facility available…,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-output-to-increase-to-58mn-doses-per-month-rs-told-101626804936682.html

A party leader said the PM asked the MPs to ensure that the vaccination drive in their respective constituencies was carried out without glitches.“Since vaccination will be key in preventing infections, the PM said that not only should the MPs ensure that vaccine hesitancy is addressed, but also debunk any false claims made by the Opposition about the lack of vaccines,” the BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.Sharing details of the meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the PM expressed concern about the attitude of the Opposition, especially the Congress, which, he said, still believed that only it had the right to be in power. Modi said the Congress was in a “coma” and unable to digest the BJP coming to power, the first leader quoted above said on condition of anonymity.“Especially the Congress thinks power is their right and they work according to this mindset. PM wants discussions in Parliament to be fruitful; the Congress is showing most irresponsible behaviour by disrupting the Houses,” Joshi said.Also Read | PM briefs floor leaders on Covid management, 6 parties skip meetingThe principal opposition party has criticised the government for alleged its lack of preparedness for the second wave of the pandemic, which overwhelmed the health care infrastructure in the country. The opposition parties also demanded a statement from the government in Parliament on the issue. On Tuesday, while participating in a discussion on the Covid-19 situation, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that so far, only 5.33% of the total population had received two doses of the vaccine.At Tuesday’s meet, the Prime Minister said the government was willing to hold discussions in both Houses of Parliament, but the Opposition was displaying an irresponsible behaviour. He said that the Covid-19 crisis was not a political but a humanitarian issue and the government ensured no one went hungry, another leader said, asking not to be named.Such a pandemic has been witnessed by the world after almost 100 years; last time, in such a situation, people faced a severe food shortage, but this time the government ensured that no one slept hungry, Joshi said, quoting the PM.Another leader said the PM told his colleagues that the Opposition has not been able to raise issues based on “logic and facts” and has therefore opted for disrupting Parliament.The PM said that in Delhi, nearly 20% of frontline workers were still not vaccinated against Covid-19, the second leader said. He told his party colleagues that a deliberate attempt was being made to create a negative atmosphere in the country.Responding to the PM’s jibe, Congress said all these statements made by the PM are actually intended to “divert the attention” of people from the real issues including Pegasus spyware where the “right to privacy of citizens and also the national security” has been compromised.Shama Mohammad, spokesperson of the Congress party said, “ The government was trying to keep everyone in delusion by avoiding the issues that need an immediate discussion in the parliament.” She added that the government has neither denied nor accepted to have used the Pegasus spyware. “If they have not used it, then some other country’s government is snooping on us as Pegasus can only be used by the vetted governments,” she added.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-asks-bjp-mps-to-counter-oppn-on-covid-101626804695501.html
20-07-2021||India||Compensation for journalist: SC seeks Manipur govt’s response||The Supreme Court on Tuesday noted the “serious matter” of loss of liberty and sought the Manipur government’s response on a petition seeking compensation for a journalist who was detained for over two months under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) after an objectionable Facebook post. The direction comes a day after top court cited the fundamental right to life and ordered the immediate release of Leichombam Erendro, saying “we can’t keep this person in custody even for a day”. Erendro -- who was detained in May this year after he put up a Facebook post criticising state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders over their responses to Covid-19 -- was released from the Central Jail at Sajiwa in Imphal East district on Monday evening. On Tuesday, the bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah described the issue as a “serious matter” and observed that the journalist “lost his liberty since May”. The court gave the state government two weeks to respond to the plea filed by the journalist’s father L Raghumani Singh. “It is a serious matter. Someone has lost liberty since May,” the court said. Appearing for petitioner, advocate Shadan Farasat said compensation has been sought as five cases have been lodged against Erendro by the state since 2018, and not a single charge sheet has been filed in any of the cases. “The responsibility has to be fixed,” Farasat said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Manipur government, told the bench that the journalist had been released from detention and the case under the National Security Act 1980 revoked after the court’s order on Monday. He said the state did not defend the plea for release of the journalist, and the matter should be allowed to rest at that. The petitioner should “adopt a pragmatic approach” in acknowledging that the relief has been granted, he added. “This is a gesture the state has shown immediately. The matter should rest here. We will have to justify our order on merits. This could have been avoided (by petitioner) by adopting a little pragmatic approach,” the solicitor general said.To this, the bench said that it is the petitioner’s choice to seek relief from the court. It gave the Manipur government two weeks to file a response and posted the matter for hearing next on August 6. The bench said, “We issue notice on the compensation aspect and you (Mehta) can file a reply on this aspect”.Leichombam was booked under the NSA over his Facebook post on the death of S Tikendra Singh, a retired professor and Manipur BJP chief. “The cure for Corona is not cow dung & cow urine. The cure is science & common sense. Professor ji RIP,” Leichombam wrote. On May 13, Leichombam was arrested from his house on a complaint by Usham Deben Singh, vice-president of Manipur BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/compensation-for-journalist-sc-seeks-manipur-govt-s-response-101626804278323.html
20-07-2021||India||‘Sorry state of affairs’: SC pulls up Kerala over Eid relaxations||The Supreme Court on Tuesday rebuked the Kerala government for relaxing Covid-19 restrictions imposed in the state ahead of the Eid al-Adha festival, saying the state’s decision to give in to pressure by businesses to allow the relaxations reflects a “sorry state of affairs”.The bench of justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai, which had given an ultimatum to the Uttar Pradesh government to reverse its stand on permitting the kanwar yatra, did not issue a similar direction to Kerala since the three-day relaxation ended on Tuesday. But the bench put the Kerala government on notice, warning that the court will take action against those responsible if a surge in cases is reported.“If, as a result of the July 17, 2021 notification, any untoward spread in the Covid-19 disease takes place, any member of the public may bring this to the notice of this court, after which this court will take necessary action against those who are responsible,” said the bench.Kerala is currently the Indian state with the worst outbreak of the disease.On average, it has been adding 13,962 new infections daily for the last seven days – more than any other state in the country. In view of the upcoming Eid celebrations, the state government on July 17 allowed all shops to open in areas with 15% or less positivity rate for three days (July 18-20) and for a single day (July 19) in areas with TPR above 15%. Experts believe positivity rate -- an indicator of the spread of an outbreak within a population -- over 5% is cause for concern. Eid is to be celebrated between July 21 and July 23. The state’s announcement prompted Delhi resident PKD Nambiar to approach the Supreme Court against the relaxations and complain that it amounted to playing with the lives of people.Kerala chief secretary VP Joy, responding to a notice from the top court on Monday, defended the decision to ease restrictions, and cited expert advice and pressure from market associations.“To give in to pressure groups so that the citizenry of India is laid bare to a nationwide pandemic discloses a sorry state of affairs… This affidavit discloses a sorry state of affairs and does not in any real manner safeguard the Right to Life and Health guaranteed to all the citizens of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” the bench said.“Pressure groups of all kinds, religious or otherwise, cannot in any manner interfere with the most precious fundamental right of all the citizens of India,” the top court said.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for Nambiar, said it was shocking that the government had gone ahead to open up markets just to please traders for political reasons.CPI(M) leader A Vijayaraghavan said the government will go by the top court’s directive.The court also made a pointed reference to the relaxation granted in areas, which were reporting TPR of more than 15%, underlining that stringent restrictions were imposed in such areas (classified as Category D) by the state government on even opening of shops for essential items.The July 17 notification, however, allowed all shops in Category D areas to remain open for the entire day on Monday. Public were cautioned that “as far as possible” persons visiting shops may have one dose of vaccine and follow strict Covid-19 protocols.The bench observed: “Homilies such as “as far as possible” and assurances from traders without anything more, do not inspire any confidence in the people of India or this court. The relaxation for one day to a category D area was wholly uncalled for.”The court told Kerala to pay heed to its constitutional duty to protect life and health of citizens under Article 21 and Article 144, the provision by which all civil and judicial authorities in the country have to act in aid of the Supreme Court.At 126,396 cases, Kerala has the highest number of active cases in the country and it alone accounts for a third of all such cases. This is the second state to be pulled up by the top court in recent days. The Supreme Court last week took cognisance (on its own) of reports that the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to allow the kanwar yatra despite concerns that the pilgrimage could trigger a spate of Covid-19 infections. The court gave UP government a deadline to reconsider its decision and said the “yatra cannot go on – 100%”. Subsequently, the BJP-led UP government announced that the yatra has been called off by the kanwar sangh (pilgrim associations). The top court closed the matter on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sorry-state-of-affairs-sc-pulls-up-kerala-over-eid-relaxations-101626804156183.html

It was then, still is today,” Gandhi wrote on Twitter.The Narendra Modi government informed the Rajya Sabha during the ongoing Monsoon session of Parliament that there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave and it peaked at nearly 9,000 MT, much higher in comparison to 3,095 MT needed in the first wave. The Centre stepped in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states, it said.Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply that "however, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states and UTs,"."Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union Health Ministry to all states and UTs,” Pawar further said.Also Read: 'Harsh Vardhan made a scapegoat': Kharge targets Centre over Covid-19The government was replying to a query if a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave. Shantanu Sen of the Trinamool Congress said people dying on the streets due to a shortage of oxygen in the 21st Century is a “matter of shame”."Lancet, the oldest medical journal, WHO, Supreme Court and several high courts and even countries like Brazil, Canada and the UK have categorically criticised the Covid fighting policy of India. What can be a more shameful incident for us," he said.The Shiv Sena also hit out at the government for the "inept handling" of the pandemic. Sena MP Sanjay Raut criticised the government for sending vaccines abroad. However, parties like Biju Janata Dal (BJD) took a more diplomatic approach cautioning against the “politicisation” of the pandemic. "We cannot politicise this handling of the pandemic because no one is wiser. The relationship between the Centre and states and the cooperation is of paramount importance," Amar Patnaik of BJD said in the Upper House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-lack-of-oxygen-but-want-of-sensitivity-and-truth-too-rahul-gandhi-101626802060158.html
20-07-2021||India||Nagaland’s NDPP welcomes opposition NPF offer to form all-party govt||KOHIMA: Nagaland’s main opposition party, Naga People’s Front (NPF), has offered to join Neiphiu Rio-led People’s Democratic Alliance (PDA) to form an all-party government to pursue an early settlement on the vexed Naga political issue, party leaders said on Monday. NPF legislature party spokesperson Imkong L Imchen said the NPF legislators passed a resolution endorsing the concept of an opposition-less government in Nagaland at a marathon meeting on Monday evening. “We have passed a resolution and endorsed it to the chief minister for necessary consideration, in the interest of the Naga political solution,” Imchen said. He said political parties in the state were on the same page on resolving the Naga issue, for which the government of India and different Naga armed groups were engaged in political dialogue.Although Nagaland’s lawmakers are not directly involved in the peace talks, elected members over the years have held that they will play a facilitating role in the settlement of the issue.The senior NPF legislator said with the peace talks reaching a crucial stage, the party felt it was essential for lawmakers to come together in a common platform, transcending their respective political party lines.While the ruling PDA is yet to make any official statement on the move by the NPF, Imchen said the NPF is expecting a positive response.The Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and two independent MLAs, who comprise the PDA, are yet to discuss the NPF proposal, officials of the coalition said. But NDPP, the major PDA partner, has already welcomed the move calling for unity amongst the members of the 13th Nagaland Legislative Assembly.NDPP spokesperson Merentoshi R Jamir confirmed that the party leaders decided to welcome the NPF’s proposal at an emergency meeting on Tuesday but decided that since the party is part of a coalition, it will consult coalition partner BJP before taking the matter forward.Nagaland BJP leaders and party ministers were not available for comment.The only other time when Nagaland didn’t have an opposition party was in 2015 during the third tenure of the NPF-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) when the opposition’s Congress MLAs joined the government and subsequently merged their party with the NPF.This time, NPF MLAs insisted that they will not merge their party. “We are talking about an all-party government, a coalition, where we will maintain our respective party ideologies,” says a senior NPF legislator.Recently, the Nagaland government notified the formation of a parliamentary committee comprising the state assembly’s 60 lawmakers and two Nagaland MPs. This panel, led by chief minister Rio, deputy chief minister Y Patton and opposition leader TR Zeliang, was stated to act as facilitators in the ongoing peace talks between the Centre and Naga armed groups.At its first meeting on July 9, the committee committed that the elected members were prepared to “pave the way” when an inclusive, honourable and acceptable solution is arrived at.The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) entered into a ceasefire agreement with the government of India in 1997 and the two have been holding political dialogue since then. A conglomeration of seven Naga national political groups (NNPGs) also started talking with the Centre in 2017.The Centre had signed a “framework agreement” with NSCN (IM) in 2015, and an “agreed position” with the NNPGs in 2017. However, the NSCN (IM)’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution has been a delaying factor in signing a final deal on the Naga peace process. The talks were suspended in April due to the prevailing Covid-19 related situation and are yet to be resumed.Chief minister Rio and opposition leader TR Zeliang will hold meetings with leaders of the NNPGs and NSCN (I-M) over the next two days, leaders from the two parties said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagalands-ndpp-welcomes-opposition-npf-offer-to-form-all-party-govt-101626800976033.html

The CM’s advisor, Raveen Thukral, said reports of Sidhu seeking time to meet the chief minister are totally false and the latter’s stance on the matter remains unchanged.Thukral’s statement that he put out on Twitter came hours after Punjab minister Brahm Mohindra dismissed reports of any personal meeting with Sidhu till he resolved his issues with the chief minister. Mohindra said the party high-command's decision to appoint Sidhu as the state Congress chief is welcome, but Singh is the leader of the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) and he is duty-bound to follow him.The first such statements that came from Singh’s camp ever since Sidhu’s elevation reveal that the months-long crisis in the Punjab Congress is yet to come to an end ahead of the Assembly election slated to be held next year. Last week, Singh is said to have informed All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Harish Rawat, who is also in-charge of Punjab, that he will not meet Sidhu until he tendered an apology for his "derogatory" tweets against him.Earlier in the day, Sidhu went to Amritsar where he received a rousing welcome from his supporters and Congress workers. However, the cricketer-turned-politician was shown black flags by protesting farmers on his arrival at Bhagat Singh Marg in Ludhiana's Nawanshahr.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-won-t-meet-sidhu-until-he-publicly-apologises-for-personal-attacks-101626800257655.html
20-07-2021||India||House panel calls Home ministry, MeitY and DoT over Pegasus reports||The parliamentary committee on information technology, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, is expected to take up reports of snooping on politicians, journalists and others with Israeli-made spyware Pegasus at its July 28 meeting, a person familiar with the matter said.The panel will hear from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Department of Telecommunications regarding the alleged hacking of phones. “Evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Communications (Department of Telecommunications) on the subject ‘Citizens’ data security and privacy’,” said the notification of the panel, accessed by Hindustan Times. “GoI has denied resorting to unauthorised surveillance. The question this raises is, if #Pegasus is only sold to governments, which other govts (China/Pak?) are using it to snoop on prominent Indian citizens? Shouldn’t the authorities call for an independent investigation,” panel chair Tharoor tweeted on July 18. This is not the first time the panel has taken up the issue of the Israeli spyware. In 2019, after WhatsApp’s vulnerabilities surfaced, the panel heard from the respective departments regarding the issue.Also read: ‘Have details of Abhishek Banerjee’s phone calls’ - Suvendu amid Pegasus rowThe software, which is made by Israel-based NSO Group, said it only supplies to government clients. On Monday, reports revealed that aside from 38 journalists, former Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi, two of his aides, political strategist Prashant Kishor, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and Union minister Prahlad Patel were also allegedly hacked. The list also included 11 members of the friends and family, along with the number of the woman who accused former Chief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi of sexual harassment. The investigation by the consortium of media houses also named public health experts Gagandeep Kang and M Hari Menon and diplomats from at least five countries as potential targets of Pegasus software manufactured by Israeli firm NSO Group. Also on the list were the woman who accused then CJI Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in 2019 and her relatives, election strategist Prashant Kishor, and Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Abhishek Banerjee.Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who defended the government in Parliament hours before being named a potential hacking target, and Jal Shakti minister of state Prahlad Singh Patel were the high-profile government names.The consortium published on Sunday that 38 Indian journalists, including three current Hindustan Times staffers and one from sister publication Mint, were among 180 journalists potentially targeted worldwide, including Financial Times editor Roula Khalaf, and reporters from The Wall Street Journal, CNN, The New York Times, and Le Monde.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The government denied any involvement. The opposition, however, has called for a probe into the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-calls-home-ministry-meity-and-dot-over-pegasus-reports-101626800197274.html

Mankind hasn't seen such a pandemic in the last 100 years," the release quoted Prime Minister Modi as saying. It further stated that the Prime Minister also spoke about the efforts being made to ensure that every district across the country has at least one oxygen plant.He also briefed the leaders about the increasing pace of India's Covid-19 vaccination program, the release further noted. "The first 10 crore doses took around 85 days, while the previous 10 crore doses have taken only 24 days," PM Modi said, also expressing concern for a "significant" number of healthcare and frontline workers who, he said, have not been vaccinated even after more than six months of the commencement of the nationwide vaccination drive.PM Modi, the release stated, also stressed on the need to stay vigilant looking at the current pandemic situation in various countries.The release also noted that leaders across parties, including former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, thanked and lauded PM Modi for his efforts during the pandemic. "They also highlighted the situation in various states, as well as the vaccination drive in their respective states," the release said.The briefing also saw Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan give a detailed presentation on the issue. "Only eight states have more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases with the majority of the caseload being in Kerala and Maharashtra. Only five states have a positivity rate of more than 5%," Bhushan said, according to the release.Additionally, the health secretary informed the leaders that Prime Minister Modi held 20 meetings with the chief ministers, while the Union health ministry had 29 interactions with states. He added that the Union cabinet secretary briefed chief secretaries 34 times while 166 central teams were deployed to assist 33 states and Union territories in managing Covid-19.In the last 24 hours, India registered 30,093 new Covid-19 cases and 374 related deaths, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) dashboard on Tuesday.

20-07-2021||India||‘International conspiracy to defame India’: Assam CM on Pegasus row||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday termed the Pegasus Project report as a well-designed international conspiracy to defame India’s democracy and also to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing journalists on the sidelines of the ongoing assembly session, Sarma accused Amnesty International, which collaborated with several international news organizations in revealing details of alleged phone surveillance, of encouraging Left-wing terrorism in India and demanded its ban. “At a time when India effectively controlled the second wave of Covid-19, it was expected that Parliament will take stock of the situation and make recommendations on how to control the third wave or discuss on the road ahead to revive the economy,” said Sarma. “But on the eve of the parliament session, a news story about phone-tapping called Pegasus Project was broken. A database of phone numbers of some people was released and it was mentioned that potentially those phones could have been hacked,” he added. The CM stated that no forensic examination was done to verify whether these phones were hacked. He asked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose name also appeared in the list, to file an FIR and hand over his handset to the police for forensic examination. Terming the release of the database as a conspiracy to weaken India, Sarma questioned the role of Amnesty International, a partner in the project. “We all know the role of Amnesty. They are all along encouraging Left-wing terrorism in India. They are working overnight to defame India and we know about their credibility. I want to caution Amnesty against creating disturbance within the country and defame India’s democracy. I demand that their activities should be immediately banned within India,” he said. “This is a well-designed international conspiracy to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indian parliamentary system and is also a deliberate attempt to create dissatisfaction among the people. The people of India are with the PM and believe in him. These international conspiracies will fail and we will not allow them to succeed,” added Sarma. Condemning the release of the database, the CM said that everyone involved in it should be examined and brought under the law because the phone numbers of those allegedly put under surveillance by using the Israeli software Pegasus were released without any evidence. Sarma said that there is a proper system of phone tapping or telephonic surveillance in India. He accused the opposition parties of creating a disturbance in Parliament even after the Central government categorically stated that nothing is being done to affect the privacy of citizens. “Opposition parties, mainly Congress, are creating a ruckus inside Parliament. But what is their record (on this issue)? In 2013, in a reply to an RTI query, the then UPA government had admitted that they are doing surveillance of over 5,000 phones and 500 email accounts,” he said. “Congress government in Rajasthan has been criticised by court for infringing upon people’s privacy. Congress’s own track record is within radar and their integrity and respect for privacy are under question. Today, the same party is accusing others of doing something in which they have got a doctorate degree,” Sarma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-conspiracy-to-defame-india-assam-cm-on-pegasus-row-101626796355634.html

The feat was accomplished in less than a month's time due to an increase in stock, officials said. Maharashtra hit the three-crore mark on June 26, while the number of doses administered had crossed the 2-crore mark on May 13.Maharashtra has frequently reported a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines doses ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced universal adult vaccination against the viral infection.Even as Maharashtra remains the state with the highest number of vaccinated people, its health minister Rajesh Tope had last week informed the Assembly that stocks were depleting that led to many of the districts halting the inoculation drive on days after they ran out of supplies.Mumbai recorded 351 new cases in the last 24 hours, while 525 patients recovered during the same period taking the overall recovery rate to 97 per cent. At present, the total number of active cases in the country’s financial capital stands at 6,161.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-doses-available-mumbai-halts-vaccination-drive-on-wednesday-101626795296439.html

"We reserve the order," the top court bench headed by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman said.The plea was filed by Brajesh Singh, a Nalanda-based lawyer, who sought initiation of contempt proceedings against CEC Sunil Arora, Bihar’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) HR Srinivas, KC Tyagi of the ruling Janata Dal (United), Jagdanand Singh of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Abdul Khalik of the Loktantrik Janata Party (LJP), Randeep Singh Surjewala of Indian National Congress (INC) and BL Santhosh of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The petition accused these political parties of not complying with a direction issued last year on February 13 by the apex court to publicise details of criminal antecedents of candidates in widely circulated newspapers, social media platforms, and their respective websites. “Our orders have to be followed with," a bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and also comprising Justice B R Gavai said.Singh’s contempt petition stated that most political parties published details of criminal cases against their candidates in newspapers with low circulation instead of leading dailies in Bihar. Alleging that this amounted to contempt of the court orders, which required publicity to be done through widely circulated newspapers.Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and CPI(M), tendered an "unconditional apology" during the course of the hearing today for failing to follow through.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-reserves-verdict-on-plea-about-2020-bihar-assembly-elections-101626794401884.html

The next hearing is scheduled on August 6.Appearing for Erendro’s father L Raghumani Singh, advocate Shadan Farasat told the top court that five cases were lodged against his son since 2017 and the state hadn’t filed a charge sheet in a single case.The bench said it was a “serious matter” that Erendro had “lost his liberty since May”.Leichombam Erendro was arrested on May 13 this year for his Facebook post which said that cow dung and urine is not a cure for coronavirus disease as its cure is by science and common sense. The post followed the death of state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Tikendra Singh. He was arrested after local BJP leaders filed a complaint against the social media post.In the petition, Erendro’s father said his son’s statement was made in the context of the death of the president of the Manipur BJP due to Covid-19, “as a criticism of the unscientific position taken and misinformation being spread by several BJP politicians regarding cow urine and cow dung being effective in preventing/treating Covid-19”. He said the post was deleted soon after being posted on May 13.“The present case is a shocking instance of misuse of preventive detention law to stifle completely innocuous speech that is fully constitutionally protected and was made in public interest,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-pragmatic-says-manipur-on-erendro-s-compensation-plea-for-3-months-in-jail-101626794075392.html

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will be inaugurating the elevated hospital on July 24, officials said. The primary health centre was catering to thousands of poor patients and its destruction was in the news then. Later, UAE-based VPS Health Care group, owned by NRI businessman Dr Shamseer Vayalil, promised to rebuild it. Built at the cost of ₹10 crore, the new hospital and laboratory will be equipped with all modern facilities, said district medical officer NK Sakeena, adding that it will cater to at least 2 lakh patients in a year.The hospital, which is built in a remote village in Vazhakkad, was designed by the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and students of the School of Architecture and Planning of Thrissur Engineering College. The technology used in the hospital’s construction is Glass Fibre Reinforced Gypsum panel, also known as Rapidwall, which can withstand natural calamities easily, said people at VPS Health Care.“It has all modern facilities. Experts from many fields rubbed shoulders with local people to set up such an initiative,” said VPS Health Care chairman Shamseer Vayalil. The hospital has an advanced laboratory, modern imaging department, oxygen beds, concentrators and stabilization unit to attend to those suffering from oxygen saturation, said the group in a statement.What makes it different is that it is being made of eco-friendly technology eliminating the usual brick and cement structure with an aesthetically pleasing design, the statement added.Three years ago, floods ravaged many parts of Kerala claiming 500 lives, it was often dubbed as the flood of the century. After the disaster, the government showcased an initiative called ‘Rebuild Kerala,’ to piece together the state’s damaged infrastructure and livelihood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floodhit-primary-health-centre-in-kerala-turns-into-high-tech-hospital-101626793655676.html

The political and religious leaders of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, which comprises 16 per cent of the state’s population and the largest vote base for the BJP, promised their support to Yediyurappa following the meeting. The Lingayat community is back in the focus with speculations of replacing Yediyurappa. The chief minister has been the face of the Lingayat community in the party and has enjoyed large electoral support from its members.Several of the mutt leaders who attended the meeting have warned the BJP against any move to dislodge the 78-year-old leader. Veera Someshwara Shivacharya Swami said any move to replace Yediyurappa will have huge consequences for the BJP.“Friction is common in politics, let anyone say anything, but we have confidence that BS Yediyurappa will continue as the chief minister and complete the term. If there are any shortcomings in this, it will have big consequences for the party,” he said. Muruga mutt seer Sri Shivamurthy Sharanaru held a press conference in Chitradurga district on Tuesday in support of Yediyurappa. “Yediyurappa may belong to the Lingayat caste and religion. But he is a leader for all. He is a mass leader who treats everyone equally. He has worked for the development of people of all castes and religions equally. That is why it is important that he continues as the CM of the state,’’ the seer said “Yediyurappa is a grassroots level leader. He has built the party from the scratch. He should not be disturbed. We are here to support him and express solidarity with him. The party will suffer if he is removed,’’ the Muruga mutt seer added. On Monday, senior Lingayat leader in the Congress party and the former minister MP Patil said the Lingayat community would be upset if the BJP high command removed Yediyurappa from the post. “Surely, the Lingayats will be displeased with the BJP’s central leaders if they remove the Lingayat leader BS Yediyurappa from the post of the chief minister,” Patil tweeted.Another Congress leader and president of All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (the largest group within the Lingayat community) Shamanuru Shivashankarappa, who met the chief minister on Monday, said the latter should continue with the post.Shivashankarappa, who met Yediyurappa at his residence for over an hour, told media that the Veerashaiva community was with Yediyurappa and any efforts to dislodge him would not go down well with the community.“If they dislodge Yediyurappa, the BJP will suffer what happened when Nijalingappa and Veerendra Patil were removed. The BJP must think about this history before venturing into any adventures. It is BB Shivappa and BS Yediyurappa who toiled hard and built this party. If they remove him, they will be ruined,” he had said.As the speculations continue, Yediyurappa has called the legislative party meeting on July 26. This decision comes after he returned to the state after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda in New Delhi last week.On his return, he had told the media that the central leadership has asked him to continue. “The central leaders have asked me to continue as the chief minister and strengthen the party. It is our duty to follow their instructions from time to time. There is no question of leadership change,” Yediyurappa told reporters on his return from Delhi.However, since returning to Karnataka, Yediyurappa has not issued any statements denying the rumours of his replacement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lingayat-mutts-leaders-rally-behind-yediyurappa-amid-speculations-of-his-removal-101626791195545.html

20-07-2021||India||Kerala minister Saseendran in trouble for ‘trying to settle harassment case’||Kerala minister A K Saseendran is in trouble again after an audiotape of his purported conversation with the father of a woman, who has levelled sexual harassment charges against a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), surfaced. The minister is purportedly heard advising the father to settle the issue somehow. The minister admitted he talked to the father, but he said when he came to know that harassment charges were involved, he stopped the conversation abruptly. But the father alleged that the minister called him several times and forced him to withdraw the complaint and settle the issue amicably. Saseendran was in 2017 forced to resign after his obscene conversation with a woman journalist surfaced. He was reinduced as a minister after the journalist withdrew her complaint. The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sought the minister’s resignation saying he violated the oath of office by now forcing a sexual harassment victim to withdraw her complaint. But the minister defended his action saying he called up the father since both (accused and complainant) were members of the NCP and he wanted to know about the issue. He claimed that he backed out after he came to know harassment charges were also involved. Also Read | ‘Alarming,’ says SC on Kerala’s decision to open markets despite Covid surgePolice said the woman filed a police complaint on June 28 in which she alleged that NCP state executive member G Padmakaran caught hold of her hand and tried to molest her inside the hotel of the accused in March. She said he wanted to know why she joined the BJP when everyone else in her family belonged to the NCP. She alleged that he caught hold of her hand suddenly saying if she joined BJP for money, he could have given it. The woman said initially she did not have the courage to take up the matter but when the accused started making abusive comments on social media, she decided to file the police complaint. In the audio, the father purportedly mentions the NCP leader’s behaviour towards his daughter. At this point, the minister is heard saying “settle it in a good manner.” The father was heard again saying his daughter is in the BJP, not in the NCP now. He was also heard asking the minister how can he settle such issues amicably? Later both, the woman and her father claimed that they were pressurised to withdraw the complaint. Saseendran denied the allegations. “Since both belong to the NCP, I made an inquiry. I never pressurised either the father or daughter,” he said. Ruling Communist Party of Indian (Marxist) acting secretary A Vijayarghavan said he was unaware of the issue and will react only after studying it. . The Congress sought Saseendran’s resignation. “He has no right to continue in power,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. Youth Congress leader Veena Nair met Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and sough Saseendran’s removal. BJP state president K Surendran said, “He (Saseendran) has violated his oath of office forcing the victim to withdraw a sexual harassment case.”NCP state president P C Chacko dismissed all charges against the minister and said he was only trying to ascertain facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-saseendran-in-trouble-for-trying-to-settle-harassment-case-101626788075276.html
20-07-2021||India||Covid-19: Seroprevalence in fully immunised people higher than unvaccinated ones, says ICMR||The seroprevalence in people who were fully immunised with two doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was found to be higher than those who had received only one dose of the vaccine and those who are yet to receive even one dose, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Tuesday.“In unvaccinated the prevalence was 62.3% and with one dose of vaccine it was 81% and if they had received both the doses it was 89.8%,” ICMR director-general Dr Balram Bharghava told reporters during a press briefing by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday evening.The data from the ICMR was shared following the fourth national sero survey for Covid-19 to estimate the prevalence for antibodies against the Covid-19 disease. The survey was conducted between the last weeks of June and the first week of July, according to ICMR.Also read | Fourth serosurvey finds 67.6% have antibodies, 40 crore Indians still vulnerableIn contrast with the previous three such surveys done, the fourth one included children between six and 17 years of age, said ICMR chief, adding that 28,975 people of the general population were considered for the survey. The survey was conducted across the same 70 districts in 21 states, in which first three rounds were carried out.Among the 20,276 adults considered for the survey, 12,607 were not vaccinated and 2,631 people were fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, 5,038 people had taken one dose of the vaccine.As far as the healthcare workers (HCW) are concerned, 7,252 were considered for the study of whom, 10.5 per cent didn’t receive a vaccine and 76.1 per cent had received both doses. Also, 13.4 per cent had reported taking a single dose of the vaccine.“The way forward is that we need to ensure full vaccination of all healthcare workers as soon as possible. We need to accelerate vaccination coverage in vulnerable population groups,” Dr Bharghava said during the briefing.Member of Niti Aayog Dr VK Paul, who was also present at the briefing, said that the second wave of infections in the country due to the Delta variant of Covid-19 and the vaccination coverage has helped in the rise of seropositivity. He further said that the ICMR data also showed that the vaccine is adding to the sero prevalence among the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-seroprevalence-in-fully-immunised-people-higher-than-unvaccinated-ones-says-icmr-101626787680366.html
20-07-2021||India||IMA president urges Kerala govt to rethink ‘controversial’ Covid-19 lockdown policy||The Indian Medical Association on Tuesday said that inflow of international tourists and interstate movement were the main reasons behind the rise in Covid-19 infections in Kerala and Maharashtra. The president of the medical body Dr JA Jayalal also noted that the mortality rate in Kerala, however, is much less than the national average.“Kerala and Maharashtra are receiving more international tourists and there is [a] lot of interstate movement. It is a major reason for [the] rise in Covid-19 cases. Despite the rise in cases in Kerala, mortality rate is much less than the national average,” news agency ANI quoted Dr Jayalal as saying, earlier on Tuesday.On Monday, 9,931 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Kerala as the total confirmed cases reached 3,170,868, a bulletin from the state health department showed. In the 24-hour-period 58 people succumbed to the viral disease, taking the death toll to 15,408. The state currently has over 120,000 active cases (121,708 exactly).Also read | Sorry state of affairs: Supreme Court on relaxation in Covid-19 curbs in KeralaThe IMA president also said that the Kerala government should rethink its “controversial” lockdown policy. “The way in which they adopted the lockdown is very controversial. They are giving intermittent lockdowns for two days. There are somewhere 15k to 16k people getting infected daily and the economy also depends upon when a patient gets infected. The family of the person who gets infected is indisposed for two to three weeks. They cannot go to their jobs, they are isolated and the best way is to prevent this from happening,” ANI quoted Dr Jayalal as saying.“We are definitely not saying that the entire lockdown has to be enforced. But if a policy of two days of lockdown is undertaken and the rest of the days are free, a rush is natural. Instead of that, you can evenly distribute it and ensure people are wearing the mask,” he further said.Earlier on Sunday, the IMA had released a statement urging Kerala to withdraw its order easing the lockdown in the state for Bakri Eid. It said the relaxation was “unwanted and inappropriate” during the time of medical emergency. “The government is considering the situation and they are in discussion with the officials and other stakeholders. The case is coming up in the Supreme Court. We are waiting for the response on this issue,” Dr Jayalal said.The Supreme Court on Tuesday warned of actions if Covid-19 infections in Kerala spread due to the relaxations in lockdown. “Kerala government buckling under pressure from traders to open up shops for Bakrid in high Covid-19 infection areas shows the sorry state of affairs and failure to protect life and health,” ANI quoted the bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-president-urges-kerala-govt-to-rethink-controversial-covid-19-lockdown-policy-101626786377554.html
20-07-2021||India||India's excess deaths during Covid-19 pandemic up to 4.9 million: Study||India’s excess deaths during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic could be as high as 4.9 million, according to a new study, suggesting that millions more may have lost their lives to the deadly virus than the official death toll. The report by Central for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank, used three different data sources from the start of the pandemic through June 2021 to estimate excess mortality during the period. However, the study doesn’t ascribe all excess deaths to Covid-19.The first estimate was from extrapolation of the state-level civil registration data from seven states - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. It suggested that the excess deaths could be around 3.4 million. The study, however, acknowledged the issues with the extrapolation of data from seven states to an all-India estimate, saying it was possible that the Covid mortality in the “rest of India is different from the seven states.”The second estimate was based on combining Covid-19 seroprevalence data and international estimates of the age-specific mortality rate. It implied the excess death toll was around 4 million - 1.5 million and 2.4 million during the two Covid waves respectively. The authors noted that even though the data from the second wave of infections encompassed three months compared to 11 months for the first one, the death toll was significantly greater given the higher rate of infections.Read | India did not see 5-7 times excess Covid-19 deaths. Govt explains whyThe third data source showed the worst-case scenario with up to 4.9 million excess deaths. The estimate was based on the survey data of the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) conducted by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). The survey constitutes information gathered from interviewing roughly 177,000 households every four months. The CPHS has been recording the data since 2014 and according to the study, it is the “only survey data collecting death information for all of India for the entire pandemic period.”“True deaths are likely to be in the several millions not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India’s worst human tragedy since partition and independence,” the report, co-authored by India's former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, said.India’s official Covid-19 death toll is around 414,000, the third-highest in the world, but the study suggests a huge undercount. A report by The New York Times had earlier claimed that the most conservative estimate puts India’s Covid-19 deaths at 600,000 and several times higher in the worst-case scenario. But those estimates were dismissed by the government.“For every country, it's important to capture excess mortality - only way to prepare the health system for future shocks & to prevent further deaths. It's also why we need to invest in strong civil registration & vital statistics, so policies can be adjusted based on real data,” Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization, said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-excess-deaths-during-covid-19-pandemic-up-to-4-9-million-study-101626785505459.html
20-07-2021||India||‘Alarming,’ says SC on Kerala’s decision to open markets despite Covid surge||The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up Kerala for allowing markets to open for an entire day on Monday ahead of the Bakrid festival that falls on Wednesday, despite the surge in Covid-19 cases.The state government’s decision of July 17 to enable all shops to open in areas with 15% or less test positivity rate (TPR) for three days (July 18-20) and for a single day (July 19) in areas with TPR above 15% was challenged before the Supreme Court in an application filed by Delhi resident PKD Nambiar. The state filed an affidavit justifying its decision to open the markets citing expert advice and pressure from market associations. The TPR is the percentage of coronavirus tests turning positive.The bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai was shocked to note how the state gave in to pressure from trader groups and risked the lives and health of citizens of India. “To give in to pressure groups so that the citizenry of India is laid bare to a nationwide pandemic discloses a sorry state of affairs….This affidavit discloses a sorry state of affairs and does not in any real manner safeguard the Right to Life and Health guaranteed to all the citizens of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.”Kerala has been reporting high figures of Covid cases ever since the state came under lockdown three months ago. The average TPR in the state went up to 11.08% on Monday, the highest in 17 days. The application argued by senior advocate Vikas Singh submitted that by granting this relaxation, the state government was playing with the lives of the citizens of India. The court also warned the state that “if as a result of the July 17, 2021 notification, any untoward spread in the Covid-19 disease takes place, any member of the public may bring this to the notice of this court, after which this court will take necessary action against those who are responsible.”The bench noted in its order that prior to July 17, the state was divided into four categories based on TPR. The most critical spread areas with TPR above 15% were classified under Category D. In these areas, stringent restrictions were imposed even on opening of essential items shops. The notification allowed all shops in Category D to remain open for all of Monday. Also Read | Supreme Court refuses to postpone CLAT 2021 scheduled to be held on July 23The bench observed, “Homilies such as “as far as possible” and assurances from traders without anything more, do not inspire any confidence in the people of India or this Court. The relaxation for one day to a Category D area was wholly uncalled for.”The affidavit by Kerala Chief Secretary VP Joy stated that the Crisis Management Group, in consultation with the chairman of the expert group of medical officers, considered the plea of traders and allowed exemption to Category D areas. In Category B and C areas, with TPR between 5-10% and 10-15%, three days’ exemption was given for all shops to function. Prior to the notification, only a certain category of essential goods shops was allowed to remain open in these areas.The court directed Kerala to pay heed to its constitutional duty to protect life and health of citizens under Article 21 and Article 144, the provision by which all civil and judicial authorities in the country have to act in aid of the Supreme Court.An almost similar order was passed by the same bench on Monday which took suo motu cognizance of the Kanwar Yatra taken out by Uttar Pradesh. The application against Kerala government’s decision to relax lockdown restrictions was filed in this case. Last week, the court told UP government that religious sentiments should be subservient to the fundamental right to life of citizens. Neighbouring Uttarakhand and Delhi had already cancelled permission for the Yatra while UP had permitted symbolic processions.Following the SC’s stern approach, Kanwar Sanghs decided to postpone the Yatra for this year. Subsequently, the court closed the suo motu proceedings on Monday and told authorities to ensure “untoward incidents which directly affect the lives of the public” or face prompt and stern action from Court. The Kerala government was also asked to follow this direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarming-says-sc-on-kerala-s-decision-to-open-markets-despite-covid-surge-101626785855006.html

The Prime Minister never accepts his faults, never takes the blame. He always finds a scapegoat, and in this case (Covid-19), it was the health minister,” Kharge said in Rajya Sabha during a debate on Covid management.Vardhan was among the 12 ministers who were dropped from Modi’s council of ministers on July 7.Kharge said Modi appealed to people to clang utensils and light up candles during the pandemic. “People trusted him and did all of it. He did not fulfil his promises but disappointed them. Modiji, people of this country believed in you, but in return all you gave them was a betrayal. Why did you betray them, Modiji? Why did you break their trust?”Also Read | PM Modi asks BJP MP’s to counter Opposition claims of poor Covid prepKharge said he and other Congress leaders including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi wrote letters to Modi with suggestions to improve the Covid-19 situation in the country. He added Modi did not respond to any of the letters and suggestions. Kharge said people lost their loved ones and employment because of the government’s mismanagement of the crisis. He also blamed the government for inflation and nose-diving economy while asking it to take responsibility. “(Covid-19) lockdown was announced overnight, just like (the 2016) demonetisation. The government did not prepare for it. There were no trains for people to go back home. The livelihood of people was impacted. The government should be held accountable.”Kharge said the government did not show any concern over the plight of migrants. “They are responsible for all the migrant lives that the country lost. It is the result of their short-sightedness.” Kharge accused the government of underreporting Covid deaths. “I pay tributes to Covid warriors including doctors and paramedics.

The former Union minister for civil aviation, who has since the Cabinet reshuffle, earlier this month, assumed the charge of petroleum and natural gas ministry was speaking at the Rajya Sabha.Taking an indirect dig at the opposition parties the Union minister said India imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020, as a measure to check the spread of the virus. "On one hand we are told lockdown is too severe & at the same time you want to have the cake & eat it too," news agency ANI posted on Twitter quoting the minister.Puri hailed India as one leading manufacturers of vaccines against Covid-19 and said the Centre would be able to meet the domestic demand of the immunisation drive. "As of yesterday (Monday), we had administered 42 crore doses," the minister told the Upper House.India’s cumulative Covid-19 vaccination coverage touched 41,13,55,665 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-capable-of-meeting-domestic-covid-19-vaccination-demand-says-hardeep-puri-101626781184005.html
20-07-2021||India||Afghan army chief’s India visit an opportunity to assess security situation||Afghan army chief Gen Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai’s visit to India next week will provide an opportunity to the two sides to hold consultations on the security situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of a campaign by the Taliban to capture territory.The visit, though scheduled several months ago, comes at a time when Afghan forces are engaged in fierce fighting to take back districts and key centres captured by the Taliban in a campaign that has coincided with the speedy drawdown of US and NATO forces.Ahmadzai’s visit during July 27-30 is expected to provide an opportunity to the two sides to assess the security situation in Afghanistan and to look at ways to enhance military cooperation in areas such as training, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Tuesday.Also Read | Pak-Taliban upbeat, but the Afghan battle has just begunThe Afghan side is not expected to raise issues such as military support during the visit, the people said.Besides holding talks with his Indian counterpart, Gen MM Naravane, Ahmadzai is also expected to meet National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other top security officials, the people added.India plays a key role in training Afghan military personnel – some 300 cadets are currently training in the country – and Ahmadzai is expected to travel to Pune to meet some of the cadets. Pune is home to the National Defence Academy and several other military training facilities.India is also playing a role in the medical treatment of injured Afghan military personnel, with a number of them being treated in hospitals across the country.Ahmadzai was appointed last month as part of a shake-up of the higher echelons of Afghanistan’s security set-up, during which President Ashraf Ghani also replaced his defence and interior ministers as part of efforts to sharpen the fight against the Taliban. Casualties among Afghan forces have mounted in recent weeks as spread to 28 of the 34 provinces in the country.In an interview with Tolo News channel after his appointment, Ahmadzai acknowledged shortcomings in protecting remote districts and pledged his priority is to safeguard major cities, border towns and highways from the Taliban. He added the Taliban want to cut supply routes before launching offensives on districts and cities.For India, a key security concern is the presence in Afghanistan of more than 7,000 Pakistani terrorists from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. These fighters are fighting alongside the Taliban in many areas.After years of sticking to a policy of only providing non-lethal support to the Afghan military, India provided four Mi-35 attack helicopters to Afghanistan in 2015-16 and four more Mi-35s, which were refurbished by Belarus under a tripartite agreement, in 2019. India also provided three Cheetah light helicopters to Afghanistan in 2016 and had pledged almost $3 billion for reconstruction and development projects.The Afghan army chief will also visit India at a time when Afghanistan’s relations with Pakistan have come under fresh strains, especially after the Afghan envoy’s daughter was briefly abducted and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad last week. Afghanistan recalled the ambassador and senior diplomats from Pakistan after the incident.Ghani also criticised Pakistan recently for not preventing the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month” and pushing the Taliban to join peace talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-army-chief-s-visit-to-india-opportunity-to-assess-security-situation-101626784835197.html

Members of his extended family have served in both the British and Indian armed forces over the decades.A Leading Engineering Technician serving in the @RoyalNavy and on-board #CSG21 in the Indian Ocean, Jagjeet Singh Grewal is proud to be part of a family that has served both the British army and Indian Air Force - 🇬🇧🇮🇳 #LivingBridge pic.twitter.com/zYZoOwUsa7“My grandfather and grandfather-in-law served alongside the British Army in World War 2 and received a Mention-in-Dispatches, Burma Star, Africa Star, War Medal and Defence Medal,” he said, referring to decorations and medals given by Britain.“My father served in the Indian Air Force, and currently my wife’s brother and uncle are serving in the Indian Navy,” he added.The UK carrier strike group recently entered the Indian Ocean as part of the country’s most ambitious naval deployment for two decades, and will soon conduct joint exercises with the Indian Navy as part of Britain’s efforts to enhance its profile in the Indo-Pacific.Grewal works in the marine engineering department and is responsible for maintaining aviation fuel to the highest standard. He also maintains fuelling pumps on the flight deck of the HMS Queen Elizabeth so that F-35B jets, Merlin helicopters and other aircraft can operate to their optimum capacity.“I am focused on doing my job to the highest standards, but it is good to know I am maintaining my family links while working with the Indian military,” Grewal said.As the UK carrier strike group currently sails in the Indian Ocean, engaging with allies on its 26,000-nautical mile maiden deployment, Grewal feels a special delight in being part of the crew and training in waters near his ancestral home.Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson have referred to “living bridge” of people, ideas, arts and culture between the two countries, and especially the role of Indian-origin people in the UK. This includes an Indian diaspora of more than 1.5 million people in the UK, with contributions to Britain’s politics, business, academia, medicine and arts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/royal-navy-personnel-on-uk-carrier-shares-family-bond-with-indian-military-101626784654846.html
20-07-2021||India||‘Only 47% of total UDAN routes currently operational: Icra||The second wave of Covid-19 has not only led to operational losses for airlines and airports but has also impacted future developments in the aviation sector. According to ratings agency ICRA, the target of operationalising 100 airports under ‘Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik’ (UDAN) will see a delay of two years from 2024 to 2026 due to the impact of the pandemic.The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) launched the UDAN scheme in 2016 as a Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) to enhance regional connectivity. However, as per the ICRA, only 47% of total routes and 39% of airports (unserved and underserved) have been operationalised under UDAN as of May 31, 2021.The number of new RCS routes which started operations increased at a healthy pace and stood at 102 in the financial year (FY) 2019 and 120 routes in FY2020. They, however, declined to 77 new routes in FY2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICRA said that during FY2018 – FY2021, Rs. 3,350 crores have been incurred by the central government towards the UDAN scheme and the budgeted outlay for FY2022 is ₹1,130 crores.Moreover, the slow progress of UDAN implementation is not only attributable to delayed upgradation of infrastructure at some of the RCS airports, delays in securing necessary regulatory approvals, low demand on few routes awarded, but also to the adverse and unpredictable weather conditions that lead to inconsistent operations and also resulted in the closure of operations by airlines in a few cases.“The second wave of the pandemic, which started from mid-March 2021 will further impact the UDAN scheme going forward with aviation being one of the worst-hit infrastructure sectors,” said Shubham Jain, SVP and group head, corporate ratings, ICRA.The civil aviation ministry set a target of operationalising 100 unserved and underserved airports and starting at least 1,000 RCS routes by 2024. Of this, 52 unserved and underserved airports and 357 routes are operationalised as of May 31, 2021. To improve the RCS network and achieve its target by 2024, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) launched UDAN 4.1 as a special bidding round under UDAN 4.0 in March 2021 to award 392 routes.“The award and implementation of UDAN 4.1 may get delayed significantly due to the second wave of the pandemic in India and its effect on the Indian aviation industry. We expect the target of operationalising 100 airports under UDAN by 2026, with a delay of two years,” Jain said.He added, “The weak credit profile of domestic airlines is expected to have an impact on the existing routes under the UDAN scheme, particularly for smaller airlines given the stretched liquidity position, low utilisation in some of the routes and will also impact future bidding of routes under the scheme.”Moreover, there has been a significant impact on the financial health of airline operators due to the Covid-19 pandemic.According to ICRA’s estimates, Indian airlines will report a significant net loss of approximately 210 billion in FY 2021 and an estimated net loss of ₹127 billion in FY2022, with the industry debt level increasing to around Rs. 500 billion in FY2022.“While some airlines have sufficient liquidity and/or financial support from a strong parentage, which will help them sustain over the near term, there are other airlines, which are already in financial stress. Until the cash inflows improve, the airlines will require funding support to meet their expenses,” ICRA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-47-of-total-udan-routes-currently-operational-2nd-wave-to-cause-further-delay-icra-101626784595879.html

20-07-2021||India||India reported over 45,000 black fungus cases so far, says Mandaviya in RS||As many as 45,432 cases of mucormycosis or black fungus have been reported by states and Union territories (UTs) across India as of July 15, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. Of the 45,432 cases, 21,085 people are currently receiving treatment and a total of 4,252 have succumbed to the condition, Mandaviya said in the written reply.He further stated that a large majority of the black fungus patients, constituting 84.4 per cent, had a history of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Among the most common presentations of mucormycosis are Rhinocerebral (77.6 per cent), Cutaneous (4.3 per cent), and Pulmonary (3 per cent).Mandaviya pointed out that mucormycosis and other fungal infections are most typically noted as an opportunistic infection. These are detected in individuals with low-level immunity such as those suffering from cancer, diabetes or as a side effect of prolonged or irrational use of certain drugs like steroids for management Covid-19 and other disorders.The health minister said that although mucormycosis is not a novel disease, its true incidence during the second wave of Covid-19 was unknown as at the time it wasn’t a notifiable disease. Following this, the health ministry had urged all states and UTs to declare the disease as a notifiable one under the Epidemic Disease Act to derive an objective analysis of the same.Precisely, mucormycosis is a fungal infection that targets people with medical health problems, and cuts down their abilities to combat environmental pathogens. According to a Twitter post shared by former Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, the symptoms of the disease include fever, pain or redness around nose or eyes, coughing, headache and altered mental status, among others.Mandaviya’s written reply noted that in early June, the health ministry, after discourse with the National Task Force on Covid-19, intimated a detailed advisory on managing and treating Covid associated mucomycosis (CAM).When asked whether the central government has taken cognisance of the shortage of Amphotericin-B injections supply, which are used for the treatment of mucormycosis, the minister said that both first and second line drugs for managing the disease are currently available in ample numbers in Indian markets.Furthermore, Mandaviya said that treatment of mucormycosis and all other fungal infections are provided free-of-cost in all central government hospitals and autonomous institutions under the Union health ministry.This development comes after doctors in Rajasthan recently showed concern over rising cases of mucormycosis among children in the state. In the previous two months, five children were affected with mucormycosis, and of them, one died within only two days of hospitalisation. Meanwhile, the state has reported more than 3,000 cases of mucormycosis and 167 related fatalities in the last four months.Last week, government data revealed that Delhi had 952 active cases of mucormycosis till July 6 – which is more than the number of active cases of Covid-19 in the national capital at the time. According to the data, till July 6, the city’s overall tally of mucormycosis stood at 1,656.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reported-over-45-000-black-fungus-cases-so-far-says-mandaviya-in-rs-101626781531292.html

In the age group of 18-44 years, it was 66.7 per cent and in 45-60 years, it was 77.6 per cent.He said there was no difference in seroprevalence in men and women and rural and urban areas. "Among those who have not received any vaccine against the virus, the seroprevalence was 62.3 per cent, while those with one dose of the jab, it was 81 per cent. In those who received both the doses, it was 89.8 per cent," Dr Bhargava was quoted as saying in ANI.As part of the survey, 7,252 healthcare workers were studied. "Ten per cent of these workers had not taken the vaccine, while the overall seroprevalence among them was 85.2 per cent," he said.Dr Bhargava said implications of fourth serosurvey clearly showed that there was a ray of hope, but no room for complacency. "We must maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour and community engagement. National level serosurvey is not a substitute of state/district-level serosurveys," he added.Regarding opening of schools, the top doctor said antibody exposure also similar in children as among adults. "We know clearly that children can handle viral infections much better than adults. Some Scandinavian countries did not shut their primary schools in any Covid waves," he said.Once India starts considering opening schools, Dr Bhargava said it will be wise to open primary ones first before opening secondary schools. "All the support staff whether it be school bus drivers, teachers and other staff in the school need to be vaccinated," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40-cr-indians-don-t-have-covid-anti-bodies-vulnerable-reveals-4th-serosurvey-101626779228818.html

Kundra, the husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested by the Mumbai Police late on Monday along with 11 other people.The case involves alleged creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some apps.Also Read: What we know about the case against Raj KundraThe crime branch of the Mumbai Police claimed before the Esplanade Court that Kundra was making financial gains through this illegal business by taking subscription fees from the users of these apps. They also said that there are several WhatsApp chats that revealed Kundra (45) was involved in the financial dealings of the app and its contents.Watch: What police said on case against Raj KundraKundra has been named as the key conspirator by the police in the case and booked under sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 292 and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.The police also claimed that three women have come forward with complaints in the case, saying they were "forced to act in pornographic movies", adding that the accused took advantage of struggling models, actors and other workers.Also Read: Raj Kundra's old tweets go viral after his arrestKundra's lawyer Aabad Ponda and advocate Subhash Jadhav opposed the police's plea for remand and said the investigation into the case can be carried out without custodial interrogation. Ponda argued that the police ought to have issued summons to Kundra first and recorded his statement, instead of arresting him directly in the case that was registered in February this year.Another person, identified as Ryan Thorpe, was arrested on Tuesday. He was working on a senior position with an app firm, the police said.This is the second case that Kundra faces in connection with alleged creation of pornographic content. He had applied for anticipatory bail last month in connection with a case registered earlier by the Maharashtra cyber police in 2020. In that case also, the cyber police had registered an FIR against various platforms, which, they alleged, were involved in showcasing pornographic content.

The projections were made on the Asian Development Outlook report released for July.In the report, the ADB further said that the economic projection for the financial year 2022 has been upgraded to 7.5% from the previous 7%. “The projection for FY 2022, by which time much of India’s population is expected to be vaccinated, is upgraded from 7.0% to 7.5% as economic activity normalizes,” the report showed.According to the ADB report, the country’s GDP growth recovered to 1.6% during the last quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, which narrowed the contraction to 7.3% while it was expected to be at 8%. “Then a second wave of the pandemic induced many state governments to impose strict containment measures. New COVID-19 cases daily peaked at more than 400,000 in early May, then fell to a little over 40,000 in early July,” the report showed. It also said that the early indicators showed economic activity to resume quickly once the restrictions measures in place are eased.Also read | ‘Tapering second wave, aggressive vaccination brightened near term prospects'﻿As far as inflation outlook is concerned, ADB said that it raised India’s inflation forecast by 0.3% for the current year while it remained unchanged for FY 2022. “This Supplement raises the inflation forecast for India in FY2021 by 0.3 percentage points to 5.5% while keeping the forecast for FY2022 at 4.8%,” the report said.Meanwhile, the GDP growth forecast for the whole sub region of South Asia has been downgraded in the ADB report to 8.9% from the 9.5% projected in the previous report. However, as is the case with India, the projections have been upgraded to 7% for 2022 from the previous 6.6%.“The economic outlook for South Asia is dampened by new waves of COVID-19 hitting the subregion from March to June 2021. The adverse economic impact of these new waves is expected to be limited, with businesses and consumers better able to adapt to the pandemic and containment measures now than they were a year ago,” the report said.ADB said that while recoveries continued to gain momentum in “developing Asia,” recent Covid-19 outbreaks, driven in part by the advent of new variants, dragged the growth in several economies. Developing Asia refers to 46 members of the ADB. The GDP growth projection for the current year has been slightly revised down from 7.3% in April 2021 to 7.2% currently. The projection for 2022 is also slightly upgraded from 5.3% to 5.4%, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asia-development-bank-downgrades-india-s-economic-growth-projection-to-10-for-2021-22-fiscal-year-101626778545289.html

People trusted him and did all of it. He didn't fulfill his promise but disappointed them. Instead of taking its blame, he made the health minister a scapegoat,” the Congress' leader of party in Rajya Sabha said in the Upper House.The Congress leader also hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders for flouting Covid-protocol while campaigning for assembly elections in states in April this year. “Government asked people to wear masks and maintain social distancing. But what were they doing, during the elections in different states? You are breaking your own rules. They should be given credit for flouting Covid norms,” he added.Kharge made a direct comparison between the coronavirus lockdown and demonetisation, insisting that both were imposed overnight and the government was unprepared for it. "Lockdown was announced overnight, just like demonetisation. The government did not prepare for it. There were no trains for people to go back home. The livelihood of people was impacted. Government should be held accountable,"Kharge also paid his tributes to Covid warriors and thanked individuals who came to others aid during the second wave.“I pay tribute to Covid warriors including doctors and paramedics.

20-07-2021||India||Parties scramble for support of Brahmins ahead of 2022 polls in Uttar Pradesh||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati’s announcement of a series of Brahmin meets from July 23 has triggered a scramble for seeking the support of the community ahead of the 2022 polls in Uttar Pradesh.Opposition parties have highlighted alleged atrocities on Brahmins, who are believed to account for around 11% of the state’s population, in the run-up to the elections. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought to counter this by having leaders from the community talk about initiatives undertaken for it.The BSP, which formed the government on its own in the state in 2007 with support from Brahmins, has rushed Nakul Dubey to Ayodhya to oversee arrangements for the party’s first Brahmin meet on Friday.“Ram...belongs to all,” said Dubey when asked about the choice of Ayodhya, where the Ram Temple is being built in place of the demolished Babri Mosque, for the first Brahmin meet.Congress leader Aradhana Mishra said her party is the only one to have given Brahmin chief ministers to Uttar Pradesh. She wondered if any political party would declare a Brahmin as the chief ministerial candidate.Bhagwan Parshuram Trust, an organisation backed by Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Abhishek Mishra, has begun the construction of Parshuram temples in each district of Uttar Pradesh. Parshuram, a Brahmin saint, is believed to have been an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath last year criticised the Opposition over its ploy to project Parshuram as a Brahmin, saying both “Ram and Parshuram were incarnations of Lord Vishnu.”Also Read | Liquid lessons: What can we learn from the world’s oldest water?Abhishek Mishra said some of the temples have already come up, where priests are conducting rituals. “Once temples are constructed in all the districts, we plan to build 108 feet statue of Lord Parshuram.” He said in 1993, the SP government declared a holiday on Parshuram’s birthday.BJP leader Sunil Bharala too has announced Brahmin meets under the aegis of his the Rashtriya Parshuram Parishad.Adityanath, a Kshatriya, will lead the BJP in the polls. Akhilesh Yadav, an Other Backward Class (OBC) leader, is the SP’s face, and Mayawati, a Dalit, that of the BSP.Kshatriyas account for about 9% of the population while OBCs are the single largest voting bloc (50%). Dalits and Muslims comprise 20% and 19% of the state’s population.In the 2017 polls, the Congress initially projected former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, a Brahmin, as the party’s face before it forged an alliance with the SP.Aradhana Mishra insisted the Congress does not believe in caste politics. “It is not in our DNA, but we would like to know which other political party, apart from the Congress, has given Brahmin chief ministers.”The late ND Tiwari, a Brahmin, headed the last Congress government in Uttar Pradesh in 1989.Also Read | Cyber crime cell of Lucknow police nabs five for posing as bank officialsMayawati last year announced the BSP will set up hospitals in the name of Lord Parshuram if the party is voted to power.Aslam Raini, who was among the seven BSP lawmakers to be suspended for the party last year, questioned Mayawati’s strategy. “There was a time when Brahmin leaders like Brajesh Pathak were with Mayawati. Now, she does not have any support of Brahmins who are backing the SP now,” said Raini.Pathak, who is among nine Brahmin ministers in the state government, was the first convenor of BSP’s Brahmin Sabha set up in 2004.In 2017, when BJP won 312 seats in a 403-member House, 58 Brahmin lawmakers won on the party’s tickets. The number is more than the strength of SP (47), BSP (19), and Congress (seven) in the assembly.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted Ajay Kumar Mishra, a Brahmin from Uttar Pradesh, in his council of ministers this month. Adityanath too is expected to induct Brahmin Jitin Prasada in his ministry.Prasada in 2020 floated Brahmin Chetna Parishad to highlight alleged atrocities on Brahmins under Adityanath’s rule. He has since defected to the BJP from Congress.Umesh Dwivedi, a BJP lawmaker, said they plan to introduce a host of measures for Brahmins. “...fund education of children from poor Brahmin families, help community members fight cases registered against them,” he said. Dwivedi’s Akhil Bhartiya Brahmothan Mahasabha will back the initiatives.BJP Member of Parliament Harish Dwivedi called Mayawati attempts to reach out to the Brahmins a futile effort. “Brahmins are with the BJP and 2022 (elections) would prove that again.”Political observer Irshad Ilmi said among upper castes, Brahmins appear to be a top priority for all parties. “I would not be surprised if the community gets sizeable tickets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-parties-focus-on-brahmins-ahead-of-uttar-pradesh-polls-101626775654692.html
20-07-2021||India||Assam builds youth team to help 'control' population in Muslim-dominated areas||Assam is readying a ‘team’ of youth who would visit the lower parts of the state to create ‘awareness’ on measures to control population and supply contraceptives after chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday termed population explosion as the “root cause of economic disparities and poverty among minority Muslims” in the state.Speaking at the state assembly, Sarma said around 1,000 youths from the riverine sand bars of lower Assam would be roped in to fight what he called “population explosion”. They would also be tasked with supplying contraceptives among the community members in the region.“We are also planning to create a separate workforce of ASHA workers who shall be responsible for creating awareness about birth control and also supply contraceptives,” news agency ANI reported quoting Sarma as saying at the assembly.The Assam chief minister drew parallels between the population growth of two primary religious communities in the state to say, "if population growth among Hindus in Assam was 10% from 2001 to 2011, it was 29% among Muslims."BJP-ruled states such as Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Lakshadweep have been mulling to bring population control policies that would limit government benefits to people with more than children. Lakshadweep wants to bring legislation that would bar any person with more than two children from contesting panchayat polls or even make them ineligible from becoming a member of the village council.However, veteran Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh had last week questioned the rationale behind the move and called the motive "purely political and communal."Sarma, meanwhile, brushed aside the criticism of the Congress and called for delinking on delinking of the population issue from politics.The Assam chief minister stressed that the drop in population growth among the Hindus in the state led to an improvement in their lifestyle and education level while "with a 29% growth rate, the Muslims are currently in a state of crisis."He said he sought the cooperation of the opposition Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in fighting population explosion for the prosperity of all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-builds-youth-team-to-help-control-population-in-muslim-dominated-areas-101626773789531.html
20-07-2021||India||Tejashwi may be elevated as RJD acting national prez; restructuring likely||Even as the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has launched a campaign to protest fuel hike and galloping inflation, a change of guard in the party’s organization seems to be on cards with the leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav likely to be made the acting national president of the party, HT has learnt.The speculation of Tejashwi taking a bigger role in the party in the coming days has gained currency with the 31-year-old Yadav scion and state president Jagdanand Singh camping in New Delhi where they have met ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad.It is said Singh, a close aide of Lalu and a party strategist, has mooted the idea of elevating Tejashwi to a new role as a precursor to take the mantle of RJD’s national presidentship in view of the frail health of the RJD chief. Lalu Yadav is recuperating at his eldest daughter Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi for the past several months. The RJD chief was released on bail in multiple fodder scam cases in April.On 22 November 2017, a month before RJD chief Lalu Prasad was incarcerated in fodder scam cases on 23 December 2017, it was Singh who proposed Tejashwi’s name as the party’s chief ministerial candidate – a move seen as propping the young Yadav scion as a number 2 in the party during the RJD’s chief absence from mainstream politics and preempt internal squabbling over leadership.The gamble has paid off with Tejashwi emerging as a youth face in the party in the last many years and throwing a stellar performance in the 2020 assembly polls in which RJD won 75 seats on its own.Meanwhile, Singh sounded ambiguous on the speculations that discussions were going on to elevate Tejashwi as the acting national president of the party. He said he had called on the ailing RJD chief to enquire about his health and other party related affairs.People privy to the development said Singh is also camping in New Delhi in connection with a legal case filed in the Supreme Court related to non-disclosure of criminal cases by several party MLAs in the last assembly polls.“I do not know from where these reports of Tejashwi becoming acting national president is coming. But if something happens, you all will know,” Singh said on Tuesday, on phone. His assertion suggests that a possible restructuring in the party’s top organizational hierarchy may happen.Party’s top leaders said elevating Tejashwi as acting national president would not be difficult as such powers are vested on the RJD national president, as per the party’s constitution.“Though there is no such post as acting national president in the party’s constitution, the RJD national president can do it by exercising his powers. But any such decision would have to be approved by the national executive,” said senior RJD leader and former MLA, Bhola Yadav. Yadav. He, however, said he was not in the know of any move by the party to create a post for Tejashwi.Incidentally, there are also speculations that there could be a reshuffle in the state party unit with Singh, who has been holding the post since 2019 November, likely to make an exit and be replaced with a senior party leader. There are murmurs in the party that Singh is feeling uncomfortable in holding the post of the state president following the recent attacks against him by Lalu’s elder son and Hassanpur MLA Tej Pratap Yadav.“It is true, Singh is not feeling comfortable after recent attacks against him by Tej Pratap. His Delhi visit and meeting with the RJD chief could be related to that also,” said another senior RJD leader. People familiar with the matter said former MP Alok Mehta and few other leaders were in reckoning to be appointed as RJD state president in coming months.On the foundation day event on July 5, Tej Pratap had taken a dig at the veteran party leader by addressing him as “Jagnandand Uncle” and saying the latter seems to be always angry with him. A few days later, reports of Singh tendering his papers surfaced in the media though it was denied by both Singh and Tej Pratap.People familiar wit the matter in the party said a formal announcement of Tejashwi’s possible elevation as the acting national president could be made in the coming weeks after the ailing RJD chief returns to Patna.Meanwhile, BJP state spokesperson Nikhil Anand on Tuesday said the possibility of Tejashwi becoming the working national president has gone on predictable lines portraying how the RJD believes in ‘family rule’ and dynastic politics.“RJD is a party run by a single family. It does not have an idealistic base and its politics is only to patronize one family of Lalu and Rabri. Tejashwi taking up the mantle in the coming days only reflects how RJD believes in dynastic politics like the Congress. But Tejashwi’s elevation is injustice to his elder siblings, Misa Bharti and Tej Pratap, who have a rightful claim on the RJD chief’s legacy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-might-be-elevated-as-rjd-s-acting-national-president-state-unit-restructuring-likely-101626774755556.html

Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is currently on a two-day visit to New Delhi, oversaw the signing of the agreement along with Union minister of coal and mines Pralhad Joshi on Monday. The MoU will help the government assess its mineral resources and establish its mineral inventory. The MoU is seen as a step towards the government restarting mining through its own state-run corporation after the Supreme Court ruled that if mining is to restart, fresh leases will have to be allotted, which now involves an auction. In March this year, while presenting the state budget, Sawant announced that the state government would set up its own mining corporation in a bid to break the logjam that has resulted in shuttering of state’s mining industry since 2018. The inventory would also help the Goa government explore the possibility of opening fresh leases and having them auctioned in a bid to bypass the legacy leases that are stuck in a legal quagmire. Goa’s several mining related cases are pending before the Supreme Court, most notably a plea challenging the Central government’s Mines and Minerals Development Act converting Goa’s mining concessions granted by the Portuguese into leases as well as a plea to retrospectively grant 50-year validity to mining leases till 2037, which the mining companies claim they are eligible for.Meanwhile, during his Delhi visit Sawant also called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited him to inaugurate the historic Aguada Fort that has been beautified under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme. He also met home minister Amit Shah, Union minister of tribal affairs Arjun Munda, minister for environment, forest and climate change Bhupendra Yadav, and Ashwini Vaishnaw, minister of information technology among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-signs-mou-with-mineral-corp-to-take-stock-of-iron-ore-101626752314412.html

20-07-2021||India||Schools should be reopened in staggered way, suggests AIIMS director||Schools in the country, mostly shut since March last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread, should be reopened in areas that have fewer coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria has said. "I am a proponent of opening up schools in a staggered way for districts that are seeing less virus circulation. It [reopening of schools] can be planned for places having positivity rates below 5 per cent," Dr Guleria told India Today in an interview on Monday.Guleria, a member of India's Task Force on Covid-19, told India Today that these districts should explore the option of bringing children back to schools on alternate days and look for other ways of a staggered reopening. He also said that if surveillance hints at the spread of Covid-19 cases, they can immediately close schools again.Also read | Covid-19 antibodies last at least nine months after infection, here's how"The reason is not just a normal life for our kids, but also the importance of schooling in the overall development of a child should be looked at," Guleria said.The top doctor said many children in India have developed natural immunity against Covid-19 and have been exposed to the coronavirus. Schools have been shut for a long period of time and the limited access has affected children adversely, he added.Authorities can ensure protocols such as wearing masks, social distancing and proper ventilation to reopen schools.Also read | Vaccine trials for kids: 2nd dose of Covaxin to be administered next weekGuleria also pointed to the digital divide as classes are being mostly held offline and many students do not have access to an internet connection. "Covid-19 has reaffirmed the need to bridge the gaps in Internet access. The digital divide exists across borders, fields, and generations, impacting virtually every aspect of life," he was quoted as saying.In June, Guleria said that authorities should work aggressively on strategies so that schools can be reopened. “I personally feel that we should aggressively work on opening schools because it has really affected the young generation in terms of knowledge and especially the marginalised ones who can't go for online classes," Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.India’s cumulative tally of Covid-19 now stands at 31,144,229 and 414,108 people have succumbed to the coronavirus disease, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The number of Covid-19 cases has been coming down after a peak in April and May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-should-be-reopened-in-staggered-way-suggests-aiims-director-101626749103176.html
20-07-2021||India||Intense wet spell over NW India likely to continue today||It continued to rain in many parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and parts of Delhi on Tuesday. Widespread rain is likely to affect northwest India till Wednesday, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). Heavy rain lashed several parts of northwest India and the western Himalayan region on Monday. Delhi, too, had a wet day, with the IMD predicting moderate to intense showers in the capital in the next 24 hours as well. IMD said the weather conditions in the aforementioned regions will continue to remain the same until Wednesday. This was mainly because of the western end of the monsoon trough running over parts of northwest India and two cyclonic circulations causing convective activity over the region. Satellite images showed dense cloud cover over northwest India. Also Read | IMD forecasts heavy rains in Mumbai today, tomorrow; local train services normalThe west coast of the country is also receiving intense rain, mainly because of an offshore trough (area of low pressure) stretching from Maharashtra to the Karnataka coast, IMD said. Between Sunday and Monday, weather stations in Maharashtra that recorded over 7cm rainfall were: Uran-45cm; Thane-28cm; Ulhasnagar-20cm; Sanpada-24.8cm; Matheran-27cm; Mormugao and Harnai-19cm each; Panjim and Ratnagiri-15cm each; and Bulsar and Mahabaleshwar-10cm each. In Delhi, too, Mungespur -10cm, Najafgarh-9cm, Safdarjung-7cm, and Palam-10cm recorded over 7cm rainfall in the corresponding period. “The western end of the monsoon trough is passing close to Delhi. There are also two cyclonic circulations, one over southwest Uttar Pradesh and another over north Pakistan. The combination of these features is bringing widespread and continuous rain over NW India. Both radar and satellite images are showing convective activity and dense cloud cover over the region stretching from Punjab to north Madhya Pradesh. It’s an intense patch,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre. “There is very strong wind convergence along the west coast and an offshore trough is also affecting the region bringing heavy rains,” she added. The western end of the monsoon trough is running close to its normal position and is likely to shift gradually northwards from July 20 when more rain is expected along the Himalayan foothills, scientists said. Its eastern end is lying north of its normal position and is likely to continue there for the next two days and shift southwards thereafter. A low pressure area is likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal around July 23. An offshore trough at mean sea level is running from the Maharashtra coast to the Karnataka coast. It is likely to persist for the next 3-4 days. The current spell of heavy to very heavy rain is likely to continue till July 20 with widespread and very heavy rain very likely over the western Himalayan region (Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and adjoining northwest India (Punjab, Haryana, east Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh and northwest Madhya Pradesh).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intense-wet-spell-over-nw-india-likely-to-continue-today-101626749913205.html

20-07-2021||India||Assam doctor infected with two Covid variants||A woman doctor in Assam was infected with two different variants of Sars-Cov-2 virus at the same time, tests at regional medical research centre (RMRC) in Dibrugarh of Indian Council for Medical Research has shown.Despite being fully vaccinated, the doctor got infected by both the Alpha and Delta variants of the virus a month after taking the second dose. She had mild symptoms and recovered without hospitalisation.“A double infection happens when two variants infect one person simultaneously or within a very short period of time. It occurs when someone gets infected with one variant, but gets re-infected with another variant within 2-3 days of the first infection and before antibodies could develop,” said Dr B J Borkakoty, senior scientist at RMRC. He said that during the initial phase of the second wave in Assam around February-March this year, most Covid-19 cases were due to the Alpha variant. Then after the assembly elections in April, cases of Delta variant infections started to emerge.The RMRC lab detected the double infection in the doctor in early May.The woman’s husband, also a doctor, was infected by the Alpha variant.“While it is very common to get cases of infection with lineage A and reinfection with lineage B, there have also been quite a few cases seen of infection with lineage A + B,” Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-IGIB in Delhi, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-doctor-infected-with-two-covid-variants-101626749136771.html

20-07-2021||India||US eases travel advisory for India, urges citizens to reconsider travelling||The US has upgraded its travel advisory for India and urged citizens to reconsider travelling to the country in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The travel advisory has been lowered from the highest Level 4 to Level 3. The Level 4 restriction bans any travel from the specified country and the Level 3 restriction urges people to reconsider travel.The US state department issued a statement easing travel on Monday and said that the advisory encouraging travel to India comes in the wake of acknowledgement of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the region.Pointing at the high number of Covid-19 cases in India, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 3 travel health notice for India. "Your risk of contracting Covid-19 and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA authorised vaccine. Before planning any international travel, please review the CDC's specific recommendations for vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers," CDC said.The US, the advisory said, has limited ability to provide emergency services to its citizens in rural areas from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal as US government employees must obtain special authorisation to travel to these areas.The advisory has also asked people to reconsider travel to India due to Covid-19 and exercise increased caution due to crime and terrorism. Review your personal security plans, and remain alert to your surroundings, the advisory read.The United States issued the Level 4 category advisory for India in May this year, which barred people from travelling to the country. The advisory came in the wake of the deadly second wave of coronavirus pandemic that gripped India as it reported more than 400,000 Covid-19 cases during that period. The pandemic, driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant, overwhelmed hospitals and medical infrastructure as people scrambled to search for medicines, beds and oxygen cylinders to save their family members and acquaintances.The US has also eased travel recommendations on Pakistan from Level 4 to Level 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-eases-travel-advisory-for-india-urges-citizens-to-reconsider-travelling-101626743422166.html
20-07-2021||India||Eid al-Adha celebrations to be subdued, states ban public gatherings||Millions of Muslims around the world are celebrating Eid al-Adha this week, a festival of sacrifice also known as Bakrid, which marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.Depending on the country the celebrations and dates for Eid al-Adha vary. In the Muslim majority countries, Eid al-Adha is a three-day festival, but in India, it is usually observed for one day. This year it will be celebrated on July 21 in the country. Whereas, in Saudi Arabia, the celebrations for Eid al-Adha will begin a day earlier on July 20.However, Eid al-Adha celebrations are expected to be subdued in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many state governments have imposed a number of restrictions in view of the rise in daily cases of Covid-19 and the imminent threat of the third wave.In most states, including Maharashtra, mass congregational prayers are prohibited in mosques due to Covid restrictions. But people in cities that have already opened the places of worship like Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kolkata, can gather at their local mosques in limited numbers.Andhra PradeshIn an official advisory for the Eid al-Adha, the state government has asked the residents to avoid large congregations. Prayers shall not be performed in Eidgah or at open places, the government also stated in the release. The state government has allowed prayer in mosques but the occupancy shall now exceed 50 per cent and strict adherence to the social distancing and face mask norms is mandatory.The government has also advised devotees to carry their own prayer mat to the mosque. Imams and khateebs have been requested to make the Eid khutbah (sermons) short.Uttar PradeshIn Uttar Pradesh, the government has banned the slaughter of cows, camels on the occasion of Bakrid. Apart from this gathering of more than 50 people at a place has also been prohibited. The government has also banned the sacrifice of animals in public places.AssamIn the official guidelines, the state government has advised all to celebrate Eid al-Adha at their homes. Namaz at Mosque is allowed with only 5 persons maximum including the religious head. The Assam government has also banned public congregations.KeralaIn a contentious order, the Kerala government relaxed Covid-19 lockdown restrictions from July 18 to 20 for the holy festival. Shops selling clothes, footwear, electronics, jewellery, etc, have been permitted to stay open.However, this has been challenged by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and the matter has reached the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the top court will hear an application against the Kerala government.Why is it celebrated?The holy festival of Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic or lunar calendar. According to Quran, the holy book of Islam, it is celebrated in commemoration of Prophet Abraham's faithfulness to god after he was tested to sacrifice his son. During the celebrations, Muslims practice the act of udhiya or qurbani, which involves a sacrifice and distributing the meat to the needy and to family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eid-al-adha-celebrations-to-be-subdued-states-ban-public-gatherings-101626745524023.html

Kundra has been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology Act.Raj Kundra has been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 292 and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays) of IPC besides relevant sections of the IT act and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.Also read: Actress Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra arrested in porn film creation caseKundra appeared before the property cell of Mumbai Police's Crime Branch on Monday and was later arrested in the case. He was taken for medical examination at JJ Hospital early on Tuesday and then to the Mumbai Police commissioner's office.Shortly after Kundra's arrest, Mumbai Police commissioner said the force has enough evidence against the businessman and his involvement in the case as a key conspirator."There was a case registered with the Crime Branch Mumbai in Feb 2021 about the creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some Apps. We’ve arrested Mr Raj Kundra in this case on 19/7/21 as he appears to be the key conspirator of this. We have sufficient evidence regarding this," the commissioner said in a statement.The racket of making and publishing pornographic content with Kundra's involvement was first busted in February this year when a woman approached the Mumbai Police against the businessman and alleged involvement in luring young women and men on the pretext of offering roles into web series and short films. They allegedly forced them to act in a pornographic film instead.Following this, the property cell raided a bungalow in the Madh area, Malad (West) and arrested five people in the case which led to Kundra's arrest on Monday.The arrested include Rowa Khan alias Yasmeen who claimed to be a producer-director; photographer Monu Sharma, and creative director Pratibha Nalawade along with and two actors, Arish Shaikh and Bhanu Thakur.After the FIR was registered, the case was transferred to the Crime Branch.

20-07-2021||India||Man hacked to death inside Bengaluru bank||Bengaluru: In a suspected case of gang rivalry, a man was hacked to death inside a bank in Bengaluru’s Koramangala on Monday. This latest incident comes despite police crackdown on criminals in the city. The murder took place inside the Union bank located in Koramangala 8th block around 1.30pm. The victim has been identified as Babli, who is in late 30’s. “He had to come to bank along with his wife and daughter in the afternoon. During this time, 7-8 men, who had covered their faces, barged into the bank and attacked him,” said S Murugan, additional commissioner of police, east. According to police, the victim Babli has been declared a rowdy sheeter by Adugodi police after he was caught in murder and attempt to murder cases in the past. Police suspect that one of his rival gangs committed the murder. Murugan added that special teams have been formed to nab the attackers. The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) officials and sniffer dog squad also visited the spot to collect evidence. “They are analysing the CCTV footage installed in the bank and surrounding buildings. Though Babli is a rowdy sheeter, there were no cases against him since 2011,” the ACP said. On July 10, the city police had raided around 2,146 homes associated with rowdies, and 1,548 people were taken into detention. The raids come on the back of a series of high-profile murders in the city in the last one month. An associate of Rashid Malabari, an alleged shooter in the Dawood gang, Kareem Ali, was killed on June 22. Rekha Kadiresh, a former BJP corporator was hacked to death on June 24. A financier named Madan and another named Krishna Murthy were killed on July 3 and 4 in the limits of various police stations. However, Bengaluru police commissioner had claimed that except for one murder, all others were not gang related and there was no rise in gang related crimes in the city. “There is no rise in gang related murders in the city and the police are keeping a close watch on all the gangs. We have been continuously cracking down on these gangs,” Pant said to HT during an interview on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-hacked-to-death-inside-bengaluru-bank-101626726749928.html
20-07-2021||India||SSLC exams begin in K’taka with all Covid precautions||Bengaluru: Students across Karnataka took the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination or Class 10 exams, which began on Monday, amid Covid concerns. As many as 876,000 candidates have registered for the SSLC examination this year. The next exam will be held on Thursday (July 22). The examination has been cut short this year due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections. On Monday, the examination for core subjects - science, social science and mathematics are being conducted. On Thursday, students will have to write three of their language papers such as Kannada, English, Hindi, Sanskrit. Several examination centres in the state set up a grand entry for students, with balloons, decorations and running lights in some places. This year, 4,885 exam centres have been set up across the state. At the request of the department of education, the transport department ran dedicated buses for SSLC students, which included buses to transport students coming from Kerala to Mangaluru. According to the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedure) released by the government, each class should only have a maximum of 12 students, one per bench, during the exam and each centre will have two rooms specifically dedicated to students who showed any Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, cough or cold. At least 58 students, who have tested positive for Covid-19 took the exams, said a communication from the department of education. According to the department, measures have been taken to ensure that students who have tested positive are allowed to write exams from a Covid care centre situated in their respective taluks.Health workers in PPEs ran nasal swab tests for students who travelled from Goa to their exam centres. Students in other places were checked for temperature and made to sanitise their hands upon entry. Scouts and guides teachers and students were seen at examination centres, helping maintain the safety protocols such as social distancing and hand sanitisation.While Covid posed the biggest concern for parents in several parts of the state, in the coastal region, which has been witnessing heavy rainfall, special services were conducted to Transport students. “In one case, boat services were provided to two students in Dakshin Kannada district… in many places, we had deployed government cars to transport students,” Karnataka education minister Suresh Kumar said. In another incident, in Kalburgi district, the road leading to a school was damaged due to heavy rains on Sunday. “In Chinamachooda village, officials worked day and night to repair the road and all students were able to attend the exam without any trouble. They have done a wonderful job,” Kumar said. In a separate incident, a fire broke out in the laboratory of a school near Ullal in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka on Monday. Fire service personnel rushed to the spot and extinguished the fire, police added. Talking about the incident, Kumar said that a short circuit caused the fire. “No harm was caused because of the fire incident. Our officials, fire department and senior police officers have visited the location and reported the same. Soon after all 34 students were shifted to a degree located next to the building and the examination was not interrupted,” he said. He also added that a 55-year-old man working with the police department too was among those who took the SSLC examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sslc-exams-begin-in-k-taka-with-all-covid-precautions-101626726389959.html
20-07-2021||India||Audio clip intensifies Karnataka leadership row||Bengaluru: Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Nalin Kumar Kateel on Monday dismissed as fake a purported audio clip in which he is heard hinting at a definite change of guard in the state. While denying any links to the tape, Kateel said he has written to chief minister B S Yediyurappa for an inquiry into the matter. In the audio clip that went viral on social media on Sunday, Kateel is allegedly heard saying: “Don’t tell anybody. The entire team of Eshwarappa, Jagadish Shettar (ministers in Karnataka government) will be removed. We are making a new team. Three names are there (for chief minister’s post) but they won’t be considered. They will be appointed from Delhi itself.” HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio tape. Eshwarappa, who was earlier the state BJP president, is currently the rural development and panchayat raj minister, while Shettar, a former chief minister, is the industries minister in the Yediyurappa cabinet. Reacting to the audio clip, Kateel told reporters in Mangaluru: “I am writing a letter to the chief minister urging for a complete inquiry into it. Let the truth come out through the inquiry. Several such incidents have happened in the past in politics, it is not right, let there be an inquiry… I have nothing to do with it (the tape). Let the truth come out through inquiry.”“Yediyurappa is the soul of our party, he is our unanimous leader and is senior to all of us. He has built the party to this level after several years of struggle. Also, Eshwarappa and Jagadish Shettar are like two eyes, under the guidance of such senior leaders, the party and the government will function,” he added. The purported audio clip surfaced two days after the chief minister, who is slated to complete two years in office on July 26, clarified after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief J P Nadda that there will be no change in leadership in the state. The 78-year-old said that “not a single word” on his removal was discussed during the meetings in the national capital last week. On Monday, the chief minister held a meeting with the senior members of his cabinet at Taj West End hotels.On speculation of leadership change in the state, senior Congress leader and former minister M P Patil said the Lingayat community would be upset if the BJP high command removed Yediyurappa from the post.The chief minister is believed to be the tallest leader of the Lingayat community who firmly stood behind him in 2013. “Surely, the Lingayats will be displeased with the BJP’s central leaders if they remove the Lingayat leader B S Yediyurappa from the post of the chief minister,” Patil tweeted. Another Congress leader and president of All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (the largest group within the Lingayat community) Shamanuru Shivashankarappa, who met the chief minister on Monday, said the latter should continue with the post. Meanwhile, Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka also dismissed speculations about a change in the state’s political leadership. “I think you are reading too much into his (Yediyurappa’s) visit to Delhi. From next month onwards, he will be visiting Delhi every month. He could not do it all these months (last six months) due to the pandemic,” he told reporters on Monday. Speaking about the legislature party meeting called by the chief minister on July 26, he said: “In my personal opinion, this (BJPLP) meeting is to celebrate two years in office and not for any leadership change per se in the state. BJP is in no way facing a leadership crisis either at the state level or at the national level. In both state and Centre, we have strong leadership.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/audio-clip-intensifies-karnataka-leadership-row-101626726329891.html
20-07-2021||India||Purpose of NIA defeated if bomb cases are treated as terror offences: Madras HC||The Madras high court recently observed that the objective of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 would be defeated if all cases involving scheduled offences were sent to special court notified under the Act.The observations were made by a full bench comprising Justices P N Prakash, V Sivagnam, R N Manjula on July 12. They were constituted to decide on questions formulated by Justice A D Jagadish Chandira given conflicting orders passed while processing bail applications for charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which is a scheduled enactment under the NIA Act.Questions such as whether an application against the order passed by the District and Sessions Judge in a matter concerning UAPA shall be numbered as a bail application or an appeal arose when Justice Chandira dismissed a bail application in December 2020 for charges under UAPA.The full bench considered the referred question and said, “In our considered opinion, the very purpose and object of the NIA Act would stand defeated if all and sundry run of the mill country bomb cases are treated as terrorist offences and sent to Special Courts/Sessions Courts for trial.”The court also noted statistics from the State Crime Records Bureau, which show in 2019, in Tamil Nadu, 139 FIRs were registered under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, read with other IPC offences like Sections 307 and 302. Offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 is a scheduled enactment under the NIA Act.“It is common knowledge that ordinary rowdy gangs have now graduated from using knives to country bombs which they find easier to carry and hurl than traditional weapons,” the court said. “Out of the 139 FIRs, only in two FIRs, the provisions of the UAPA were incorporated. If the state police were to go by the strict mandates of the NIA Act, all the 139 Station House Officers (SHOs) should have to be trained to inform the state government that the moment an FIR is registered under any of the scheduled offences of the NIA Act, our state should have to intimate the central government about the registration of such cases. Thus, the central government will be loaded with a plethora of such reports from various state governments all over the country, which they have to analyze and take a decision on a case-to-case basis as to which of the cases have to be dealt with by the NIA and which have to be left with the state police to proceed with the investigation.”The court added that sessions court, which was already overburdened with routine judicial work, would have to see the final reports of routine country bomb cases where UAPA has been invoked. “The very purpose of the NIA Act, 2008 is to expedite the trial of serious offences, enumerated in the schedule, which would be defeated if one court is jurisdictionally overloaded with several enactments conferring special jurisdiction. This is a practical issue, which, if not addressed with reasonable dispatch, would defeat the very purpose of having special courts.”Additional Solicitor General R Sankaranarayanan stated that he would bring the various issues on the matter to the attention of the law ministry and the court hoped that look into it with the seriousness it deserves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/purpose-of-nia-defeated-if-bomb-cases-are-treated-as-terror-offences-madras-hc-101626725789873.html
20-07-2021||India||Stalin rejects talks with K’taka over Mekedatu||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Monday ruled out any talks with Karnataka over the proposed construction of the Mekedatu reservoir across the Cauvery river. Stalin was in New Delhi to meet President Ram Nath Kovind and was responding to reporters when asked if he would participate in talks with Karnataka on the issue. “No scope for talks (with Karnataka). Our water resources minister (S Duraimurugan) has made that stand clear,” Stalin told reporters at the Delhi airport before returning to Chennai. “The Prime Minister has assured us. The Jal Shakti minister has also assured us (that the project will not be implemented). The issue is before the Supreme Court. We will face the issue legally,” he said. Stalin’s comments come in the backdrop of Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa writing to him on July 3 and inviting him for talks to clear apprehensions over the project. While responding to Yediyurappa’s letter, Stalin didn’t address the invitation for bilateral talks, but he registered Tamil Nadu’s strong opposition to the 9000-crore project. Successive governments in Tamil Nadu have challenged the project, stating that it would disrupt the natural flow of water from Cauvery, which originates in Karnataka and irrigates Tamil Nadu’s agrarian regions. Stalin held an all-party meeting on July 12 so that Tamil Nadu can speak in one voice as Karnataka is assertive in its plans to go ahead with the project. Tamil Nadu’s petition challenging the project in the Supreme Court in 2018 is pending. On July 16, the representatives from 13 political parties in Tamil Nadu, led by S Duraimurugan flew to Delhi to hand over a resolution to union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat urging him to not give Karnataka clearance for the project. Though the BJP is in power at the Centre and in Karnataka, the party’s unit in Tamil Nadu is siding with the state. The NDA government in Puducherry has also opposed the project. When asked if Tamil Nadu will hold talks with other lower riparian states such as Puducherry and Kerala, who have a share in Cauvery water, Stalin said that there was no necessity for it now. In his meeting with the President, Stalin denied having spoken about the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. He had written a letter to the President in May urging him to remit their life sentence and release them early. “We will face the issue legally as it is pending in the Supreme Court, and the DMK will voice for their release,” he said. Stalin was on his second visit to Delhi after taking charge as chief minister on May 7. He invited the President to attend the centenary year celebration of the Madras Legislative Council, established in 1921 under British rule. It would include unveiling a portrait of his father and five-time chief minister M Karunanidhi in the Assembly hall. Stalin also invited Kovind to lay the foundation stone for new projects that the two-month-old DMK has announced – construction of a library in Madurai, a super speciality hospital in Chennai and a memorial tower to mark 75 years of Independence on the city’s Marina Beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-rejects-talks-with-k-taka-over-mekedatu-101626725489828.html
20-07-2021||India||SC okays dropping 5 cases over Amaravati land deals||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday put an end to criminal cases against private buyers of land at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh, upholding the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh high court in January this year that quashed criminal cases against the purchasers.Dealing with six appeals filed by the Andhra Pradesh government against the high court judgment, a bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari said: “We are of the opinion that there is no perversity or illegality in the findings recorded by the high court while allowing the petition and quashing the FIRs and the proceedings pursuant thereto.”In March this year, the Andhra Pradesh challenged the high court order cutting short an investigation into the Amaravati land case which alleged that a group of private individuals allegedly bought plots of land because they had prior knowledge of the plan to set up the new capital in Amaravati. Without disclosing this fact, the buyers purchased land from the sellers and, thus, cheated the sellers, as the value of such lands was likely to increase manifold, the first information report (FIR) against the buyers stated.The FIR was lodged against several buyers for offences under Sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.The complaint was filed in September 2020, nearly six years after the transactions in 2014-15.The Andhra Pradesh government, represented by senior advocate Dushyant Dave and advocate Mahfooz A Nazki, argued that the investigation in the case was still on as there was possibility of establishing a case under IPC Section 418 (cheating with knowledge of wrongful loss) read with provisions under the Transfer of Property Act.The government argued that the high court should not have carried out an exercise to examine the facts of the case and incorrectly applied the concept of insider trading, a reference to the high court concluding that insider trading was an offence in the stocks and capital markets and not property deals.The apex court justified the approach of the high court to delve into facts to ascertain whether a case was made out. “What the high court has examined is as to whether the stated facts of the complaint make out any case of deception or not and thereafter has concluded that no case of constituting offences under Sections 420, 406, 409 and 120B of IPC is made out….without considering the facts of the case, the question as to whether the allegations in the FIR or complaint prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused, cannot be decided,” the two-judge bench ruledEven the concept of insider trading in property dealings has also been dealt with by the high court and found to be alien to the proceedings under IPC, being a concept related to the trading in company scripts and an offence only under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, the bench added. Right to acquire property was held to be a legal and constitutional right by the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-okays-dropping-cases-against-andhra-s-ex-law-officer-for-amaravati-land-deals-101626724171254.html
20-07-2021||India||Monsoon session gets off to a stormy start||Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prevented from verbally introducing his newly appointed ministers in Parliament on Monday, as opposition leaders rushed to the well in both Houses to protest rising fuel prices and other issues.Modi submitted the list of new ministers in both Houses and hit back at the Opposition, accusing them of being unable to “digest” the fact that “a large number of new ministers are women, Dalits, tribals and those from Other Backward Classes”.MPs of the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and other parties rushed to the well of the House with placards to shout slogans against price rise in fuel and demanding tax cuts on petroleum products. Some Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs joined the protest to demand special status for Andhra Pradesh and Trinamool Congress legislators raised both price rise and atrocities on Dalits.“What is this mentality?” he asked, and said it was for the first time he faced such a situation in the House. The Congress’s Rajya Sabha chief whip Jairam Ramesh pointed out that “in 2004, the BJP in Opposition had not allowed then PM Manmohan Singh to introduce his ministers.”The Opposition has called a meeting at 10am on Tuesday to decide whether to raise the Pegasus snooping issue the same day or later as the government has accepted their demand to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the House. “We have to see what other parties say on prioritising the Covid-19 debate over other issues,” said a senior Congress leader. Trinamool’s Lok Sabha floor leader Sudip Bandopadhay, however, added that the party will raise the snooping scandal in the House on Tuesday.As a ruckus erupted in the Upper House, leader of the Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal tried to remind the Opposition about the tradition of introduction of new ministers since the time of the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.In the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury prevented the PM from speaking and said his party has given notices to discuss issues, including the economy and (rising) prices. As other leaders also rushed to the well, Akali leaders Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Sukhbir Badal demanded repeal of the three farm laws enacted last year.Speaker Om Birla appealed for peace. “You have been in power too. You should not lower the dignity of the House. You are breaking a good tradition. This is the largest democracy, and you are setting a bad precedent.” But the protesting MPs didn’t relent.In the Rajya Sabha, chairman Venkaiah Naidu urged parliamentarians to rise above political considerations and make effective use of the Monsoon Session for effective tackling of the anticipated third wave based on the experience so far. He said MPs cannot “afford to let the people down in their hour of pain and suffering”.“Let us be conscious of the immense responsibility cast upon all of us…We all are on test, and I hope we acquit ourselves creditably by ensuring a productive monsoon session,” he said in his opening remarks on the first day of the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-gets-off-to-a-stormy-start-101626723166667.html
20-07-2021||India||Easing of curbs for Eid by Kerala govt under SC lens||Days after the Supreme Court asked the Uttar Pradesh government to reconsider its decision to allow the kanwar yatra amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the top court on Monday asked the Kerala government to submit a reply on its move to ease curbs for Eid festivities even as the state battled a surge in infections.The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday cancelled the pilgrimage for this year, citing a decision by groups representing the pilgrims. In a brief affidavit filed in the top court on Monday, Kerala said only people who have taken at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose will be allowed to visit shops as part of the three-day relaxations announced for Bakrid celebrations in the state. Kerala chief secretary VP Joy also underlined that the relaxations depend on the positivity rate being reported from the districts and those with a positivity rate of more than 15% will only get a one-day relaxation on Bakrid (Eid-ul-Azha) on July 21.Citing the condition that people who step out for Bakrid shopping must have had at least one dose, the affidavit said 45% of Kerala’s adult population has been vaccinated with one dose while 18% of the adults have taken both doses. Kerala’s defence of the relaxations, expected to be considered by the Supreme Court on Tuesday, comes even as the state reported 9,931 new cases on Tuesday. Kerala’s test positivity rate (TPR) also went up to 11.08%, its highest in 17 days.A bench of justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai had earlier in the day ordered the state government to file its response to an application filed by a Delhi resident PKD Nambiar who complained that the Kerala government was “playing with the lives of citizens” by relaxing the lockdown curbs on July 18, 19 and 20.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the petitioner, said Uttar Pradesh, which reported a positivity rate of 0.02% had called off the kanwar yatra while Kerala was going ahead with the relaxations that could seriously impact citizens’ health.The bench had earlier on Monday closed its suo moto proceedings on the kanwar yatra in Uttar Pradesh after the state government told the judges that the kanwar sanghs (organisations) agreed to voluntarily defer the annual yatra. The bench, which recorded the UP’s stand on Monday, reminded authorities at all levels to be conscious of Article 144 of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/easing-of-curbs-for-eid-by-kerala-govt-under-sclens-101626723093410.html

20-07-2021||India||SC raps Gujarat govt for delay in fire safety audit of hospitals||The Supreme Court on Monday said that lapses by private hospitals to comply with fire safety norms and building byelaws cannot be condoned at any cost as they result in human tragedies.Hearing a suo motu petition on the issue of proper treatment for Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies, a bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, “Hospitals have become a large industry. They survive on human distress. They cannot be protected at the cost of citizens whom they are meant to subserve.”The court’s remarks came while dealing with a decision of the Gujarat government on July 8 to allow private hospitals and nursing homes in the state to comply with the ‘building use certificate’ requirement by July 2022.After eight persons were killed in a fire at Shrey hospital, a Covid hospital, in Ahmedabad and another five were killed at another Covid hospital, Uday Shivanand Hospital, in Rajkot last year, the top court in December had ordered for mandatory fire safety audit of all hospitals across the country and the appointment of a nodal officer for every Covid hospital.“Once we have directed to take action against the hospitals not compliant with the building byelaws, we cannot allow you (state) to grant them protection till 2022,” the court said while taking note of the carte blanche protection offered to hospitals/nursing homes violating guidelines in Gujarat.Senior advocate Maninder Singh appearing for the state informed the court that most hospitals had complied with the building safety and fire safety norms and what remained was compliance with regard to building use.Singh made it clear that there was no attempt on part of the state to wriggle out from its duty to comply with the court orders.The bench remarked, “The impression that goes out to the common man is that the state wants to shield persons who are committing illegalities….We were shell-shocked to see how a person who recovered from Covid and had to be discharged the next day died in a fire at a Nashik hospital. Two nurses who went to the washroom were burnt alive. These are human tragedies which have unfolded before our eyes and yet we go on extending time to these hospitals.”The bench sought the state government’s reply within a week after it found the July 8 order to be “prima facie in breach of the Supreme Court direction”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-gujarat-govt-for-delay-in-fire-safety-audit-of-hospitals-101626722974465.html
20-07-2021||India||Journey has just begun, says Sidhu; no meeting with CM yet||Announcing that his journey has “just begun”, Punjab Congress’s new president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday pledged to work with every “member of the Congress family” to fulfil the “Jittega Punjab” mission, a day after being appointed to the key post after months of a bitter spat between him and chief minister Amarinder Singh.The 57-year-old cricketer-turned-politician, who had a busy day calling on leaders and ministers, thanked the Congress leadership for appointing him head of the Punjab unit, asserted he would strengthen the party’s organisation in the state.Assembly polls in the Congress-ruled state are due next year.“Today, to work further for the same dream and strengthen the invincible fort of the Congress in Punjab. I am grateful to Hon’ble Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi for bestowing their faith in me and giving me this pivotal responsibility,” he said on Twitter.“Will work along every member of Congress family in Punjab to fulfil the mission of ‘JittegaPunjab’ as a humble Congress worker to give power of the people back to the people through the Punjab model and the high command’s 18-point agenda ... My journey has just begun,” Sidhu said in another tweet.Sidhu, whose appointment was announced on Sunday night, spent the entire day visiting Cabinet ministers and other senior leaders of the party in Chandigarh and Mohali, but his much-anticipated meeting with the chief minister did not materialise even though they were within a few hundred metres of each other at one point of time.The new state Congress head was with leaders at Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s house, whereas the chief minister was having a meeting with MLAs from Patiala district at his official residence. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring had indicated earlier that the two leaders would meet.Sidhu returned to Patiala after meeting dozens of party leaders in the tricity and will travel to Amritsar on Tuesday. Both sides later said there was no meeting planned or requested.Monday’s developments are a sign that the crisis is still simmering. Amarinder, who had opposed Sidhu’s appointment, is furious with the Amritsar East MLA for making “derogatory” tweets and statements against him.The chief minister told Punjab affairs incharge Harish Rawat, one of the three persons tasked with resolving the crisis in the Congress, that he would meet Sidhu only after a public apology from him.Till Monday night, there was no apology or response from the new appointee on this demand.Amarinder has not put out a tweet or statement to welcome the changes so far whereas the Congress’s other two chief ministers, Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan) and Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh), congratulated Sidhu on Twitter.Earlier, Sidhu arrived in Chandigarh in the morning and met former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, assembly speaker Rana KP Singh, former PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar. The newly-appointed state Congress chief also met Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Razia Sultana and Charanjit Singh Channi. Jakhar, Randhawa and some MLAs joined him as he went around meeting other leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-work-with-everyone-to-fulfil-punjab-missionsidhu-101626722851101.html
20-07-2021||India||Delhi HC for CBI probe into email sent from I-T portal||The Delhi high court on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe an email allegedly sent from the income tax (I-T) department’s e-filing portal to a private firm granting them an adjournment after a senior tax official denied sending the email and said it could be a forgery.The bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla observed that this was not the only instance where people claimed to have received similar emails. It cannot be a coincidence that similar emails granting adjournments to assessees from the I-T’s e-filing portal were forged, the HC said. “This Court directs the Central agency, namely Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to enquire as to whether the email dated May 31, 2021 had been issued to the petitioner or not, and if so, by whom...," it said.Three C Homes Pvt Limited, a Noida-based real estate developer, moved HC against a June 1 assessment order by the I-T department, insisting that it was granted an adjournment in an online assessment on May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-for-cbi-probe-into-email-sent-from-i-t-portal-101626722309486.html
20-07-2021||India||Imran Khan, diplomats, employees of US CDC on Pegasus list||New Delhi A number once used by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and those of dozens of diplomats in India from countries such as China and Iran are among potential targets selected by users of the Pegasus spyware programme, according to media reports on Monday. Paris-based Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International have gained access to a leaked list of more than 50,000 records of phone numbers that clients of the Israeli company NSO Group, the developer of Pegasus, selected for surveillance. More than 1,000 phone numbers in India were part of the list, according to 17 media outlets that examined the list. The records included at least one number once used by Prime Minister Khan and that had been selected by a NSO client for surveillance, The Washington Post and Le Monde reported. “Not surprisingly, Pakistan is the most scrutinised country,” Le Monde said in its report. “The numbers of Imran Khan and several of his ambassadors in India appear on the list as potential targets. Dozens of other Delhi-based diplomats and ambassadors are also included, from Iran, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Saudi Arabia,” the report added, without giving details. Hari Menon, the India head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and one more foundation employee and two employees of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in New Delhi were also on the list, The Washington Post reported. There was no immediate response from Indian officials or the missions of the countries named in the media reports. Khan didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. While surveillance of phone numbers of diplomats is not unheard of around the world, the matter continues to be very sensitive. For instance, Pakistan’s security agencies have been known to tap the phones of all Indian diplomats and officials as well as those of visiting Indian journalists. Given India’s currently strained relations with China and Pakistan, closer scrutiny of the diplomats of both countries would not be surprising, experts said. However, most of the other countries named in the Le Monde report are not perceived as security concerns. NSO Group has said all its clients are sovereign governments and that all exports are cleared by the Israeli government. It has also said Pegasus has been used by some 60 intelligence and law enforcement agencies in 40 countries and insisted that the spyware, which can access all data on a mobile phone and turn it into an audio or video recorder, is for use only against terrorists and criminals. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied licensing Pegasus and it has denied all the news reports. However, the global investigative project has alleged Pegasus was used to target politicians, ministers, civil society and rights activists and journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imran-khan-diplomats-employees-of-us-cdc-on-pegasus-list-101626722249992.html
20-07-2021||India||Pegasus: Woman who accused ex-CJI of harassment in surveillance list||The list of phones potentially targeted using Pegasus software has the name of a Supreme Court staffer who had accused former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment, according to reports.Justice Gogoi, who retired as CJI in November 2019, is currently a nominated Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha. The verified phone numbers on the list brought out by a global collaborative investigative project has named the staffer, her husband, and her brothers-in-law, whose phones were targeted with the spy software around April 2019, the same time when the woman staffer had levelled allegations against the former CJI, a report in The Wire said. HT could not independently verify this.In all, 11 phone numbers of the woman complainant and her family were targeted, the report said, adding that surveillance on three phone numbers belonging to the woman began days after she went public with her allegations in a sworn affidavit issued to SC judges on April 19, 2019.In her complaint, she alleged that as a junior court assistant in October 2018, while working in the office of CJI, she was sexually harassed and later told by the judge not to reveal it to anyone.The allegations were denied by CJI as “absolutely false and scurrilous” and as part of a bigger conspiracy to “destabilise the judiciary”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-who-accused-ex-cji-of-harassment-in-surveillance-list-101626722189502.html
20-07-2021||India||Congress slams BJP over Pegasus leak, calls it ‘Bharatiya Jasoos Party’||The Congress party on Monday demanded the removal of Union home minister Amit Shah and a probe into Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s role after reports suggested that the phone numbers of party leader Rahul Gandhi and other Opposition leaders, Cabinet ministers and bureaucrats were listed as potential targets for snooping by a military-grade Israeli spyware.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and the party’s floor leader Adhir Ranjan Choudhury accused the government of playing with security. Surjewala dubbed the ruling BJP as the “Bharatiya Jasoos Party”, while Chowdhury said that instead of “Digital India”, PM Modi has started “Surveillance India”.Both Kharge and Chowdhury said that the party will raise the issue in Parliament and take other Opposition parties on board.Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay told HT that his party, too, wants to raise the issue in Parliament on Tuesday.Even as the government rejected all charges and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw categorically stated that any form of illegal surveillance is not possible, Surjewala showed papers to claim the spy software maker NSO sold its products only to the government and its agencies.“Modi government has used Israeli spyware for spying on political leaders, judges, an election commissioner and even on his own ministerial colleagues. The Modi government has launched an attack on the country,” he said.“And the person responsible for it is none less than the home minister of India, Amit Shah. Of course, it could not be done without the consent and concurrence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” the Congress leader said, alleging that in May 2019, Facebook and CERT, a central agency, had alerted the government that a vulnerability has been reported in WhatsApp that can be exploited by a remote attacker.Posing questions on why “the Modi government is spying on its citizens and political leaders before and in the run-up to the 2019 general elections and thereafter”, the Congress demanded answers on “Who in government purchased and deployed the illegal spyware ? Who – the PM or HM – authorised the purchase of illegal spyware Pegasus? How many hundred or thousand crores were spent?”Demanding Shah’s removal, Surjewala said, “if government was aware of the illegal purchase and deployment of the Pegasus spyware since April-May 2019, why did it chose to stay mum?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-slams-bjp-over-pegasus-leak-calls-it-bharatiya-jasoos-party-101626722130574.html
20-07-2021||India||‘Understand chronology’: Shah links leak to Session||Union minister Amit Shah on Monday blamed reports of the Indian government allegedly using Israeli software Pegasus to potentially target the phones of journalists, activists, ministers and politicians as an operation by global “disruptors” in collusion with domestic “obstructors”, and said forces unable to digest India’s progress would “not be able to derail the development trajectory through their conspiracies”.Shah, who issued a statement hours after opposition parties did not allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to introduce his new Cabinet colleagues in Parliament, questioned the timing of the reports on the eve of the Monsoon Session. “In what seemed like a perfect cue, late last evening we saw a report which has been amplified by a few sections with only one aim -- to do whatever is possible and humiliate India at the world stage, peddle the same old narratives about our nation and derail India’s development trajectory,” Shah said. “People have often associated this phrase with me in lighter vein but today I want to seriously say - the timing of the selective leaks, the disruptions… Aap Chronology Samajhiye! (understand the chronology). This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress. People of India are very good at understanding this chronology and connection,” he added.Asserting that Parliament session will nonetheless bear new fruits of progress, Shah said: “The people of India have high hopes from the current Monsoon Session. Key bills for the welfare of farmers, youngsters, women and the backward sections of society are lined up for debate and discussion.”He also targeted Congress, saying the party has “good past experience in trampling over democracy and with their own house not in order, they are now trying to derail anything progressive that comes up in Parliament”.An international collaborative investigation involving 17 media organisations, including The Guardian, The Washington Post, Die Zeit, and The Wire, reported on Sunday that India is among the countries where Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus software was used to target the phones of journalists, activists, opposition leaders and ministers for snooping. A fresh report on Monday revealed that aside from 38 journalists, the numbers of former Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi, political strategist Prashant Kishor, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and Union minister Prahlad Patel were potentially selected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understand-chronology-shah-links-leak-to-session-101626722069996.html
20-07-2021||India||‘Attempt to malign democracy’: Centre slams snooping charges||Union minister for electronics and information technology (MeitY) Ashwini Vaishnaw on Monday said that reports suggesting India used Israeli spyware Pegasus to infiltrate phones of journalists, activists, Opposition leaders and ministers were nothing but an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”, with home minister Amit Shah slamming those “amplifying” the reports for “humiliating India”.Vaishnaw, who was making his first speech as the new MeitY minister in Parliament, said that the “highly sensational story” has made several “over the top allegations” but there is “no substance behind them”.His statement came barely an hour before he was named as one of the ministers who had been targeted, according to an investigation by a consortium of media houses, including The Guardian, The Washington Post, and India’s The Wire, that said phone hacking software Pegasus was used to target potentially thousands of people around the world.“It is not a coincidence that the reports have been published a day before the monsoon session of Parliament,” Vaishnaw said. “In the past, similar allegations were made about WhatsApp but there is no factual basis to these and have been categorically denied.”He also highlighted the protocols and checks and balances instituted by the government when it comes to lawful interception of data, under the Telegraph Act and the Information Technology Act. “No form of illegal surveillance is possible in India with the kind of checks and balances instituted by the government,” he said.The software, made by Israel-based NSO Group, said it only supplies to government clients. On Monday, reports said that aside from 38 journalists, former Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi, two of his aides, political strategist Prashant Kishor, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and Union minister Prahlad Patel were also potential targets for phone hacking. The list also included 11 members of the friends and family along with the woman who accused former Chief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi of sexual harassment.Vaishnaw added that there were inconsistencies in the reports. “One report clearly states that the presence of a number on NSO’s list does not mean it is under surveillance,” he said.“The consortium has accessed a leaked database of 50,000 numbers. The presence of the number does not indicate whether there was an attempted hack, or a successful one,” he said.The issue has snowballed into a political slugfest between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition parties. While the opposition parties are demanding a probe, and raised the issue in Parliament, the BJP has denied any link to the wrongdoing.Former IT and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that there is “not even a shred of evidence” to link the BJP or the Union government to the entire Pegasus snooping controversy and raised questions about the timing of the story coinciding with the monsoon session of Parliament.Responding to the Congress party’s demand for an independent probe into the issue, he said, “We strongly refute, condemn the baseless and bereft of political propriety comments of the Congress party. This is a new low in the political discourse of the party that has ruled India for 50 years.”Prasad also questioned the credentials of those behind the story.“Those who broke the story themselves said that the presence of a particular number in the database does not confirm that it is infected with Pegasus,” he said, questioning the timing of the story a day before Parliament’s Monsoon Session began on Monday.He brushed aside a question on the Congress’ demands for Shah’s resignation.“With the Congress shrinking and losing, the entire row is timed to disrupt Parliament and build a baseless agenda,” he said.He also accused previous governments of snooping. “One can go on and on about Congress’ history of infringing upon people’s privacy and freedom,” he said.Claiming that there was a conspiracy to target the Modi government as India developed under the Prime Minister’s leadership, he wondered if some people had become “supari agents” (hired agents) for such “international conspiracies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempt-to-malign-democracy-centre-slams-snooping-charges-101626722010460.html
20-07-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi, IT minister Vaishnaw, ex-EC in new Pegasus list, say reports||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and two sitting Union ministers were among prominent people potentially targeted by Israeli phone hacking software, an international investigative consortium reported on Monday, sparking a political storm on the first day of Parliament’s Monsoon Session.China, Iran diplomats among people in list: ReportThe investigation named public health experts Gagandeep Kang and M Hari Menon and diplomats from at least five countries as potential targets of Pegasus software manufactured by Israeli firm NSO Group. Also on the list were the woman who accused then chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in 2019 and her relatives, election strategist Prashant Kishor, and Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Abhishek Banerjee.Decoding the legality of ‘authorised’ surveillance in IndiaUnion information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw – who defended the government in Parliament hours before being named a potential hacking target – and Jal Shakti minister of state Prahlad Singh Patel were the high-profile government names.The consortium – which comprises 17 media organisations, including The Guardian, The Washington Post, Le Monde and Indian news website The Wire – published on Sunday that 38 Indian journalists, including three current Hindustan Times staffers and one from sister publication Mint, were among 180 journalists potentially targeted worldwide, including Financial Times editor Roula Khalaf, and reporters from the Wall Street Journal, CNN, New York Times, and Le Monde.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.The government denied any involvement.“Aap Chronology Samajhiye! [Understand the chronology] This is a report by the disrupters for the obstructers. Disrupters are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructers are political players in India who do not want India to progress,” Union home minister Amit Shah said in a statement.Vaishnaw told Parliament that the allegations were an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”. “Time tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur,” he said in his first speech as IT minister in the Lok Sabha.But the Opposition demanded Shah’s removal and a probe into the Prime Minister’s role. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala dubbed the ruling party Bharatiya Jasoos (spy) Party.“Modi government has used Israeli spyware for spying on political leaders, judges, an election commissioner and even on his own ministerial colleagues. The Modi government has launched an attack on the country,” he said.The Congress and TMC said they will raise the issue in Parliament on Tuesday.A highly invasive malware, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy. In some cases, it can be installed without the need to trick a user into initiating a download. In 2019, WhatsApp disclosed that 121 users from India were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities using Pegasus.The NSO group called the investigation “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories”, and said it sold its software “solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments”.The investigation is based on a data leak of around 50,000 numbers obtained by Amnesty International and Paris-based Forbidden Stories, a non-profit organisation. Amnesty International subsequently forensically investigated 67 of these phones, and found 23 hacked and 14 showing signs of attempted penetration. The Wire reported that 10 of the phones forensically examined in India showed they had either been hacked or signs of an attempted hacking.Gandhi’s phones were not among those examined because he no longer had the handsets he used during the potential targeting, mid-2018 to mid-2019 in the run up to the 2019 general elections. At least nine of his acquaintances and associates – including aides Alankar Sawai and Sachin Rao – were also named as potential targets by the portal.“If your information is correct, the scale and nature of surveillance you describe goes beyond an attack on the privacy of individuals. It is an attack on the democratic foundations of our country,” Gandhi told The Wire.Lavasa, who was appointed an election commissioner in 2018, dissented on key decisions of the watchdog clearing PM Modi and Shah of flouting the poll code. He left the election commission last year to join the Asian Development Bank. He was unavailable for comment and refused to participate in the investigation.Vaishnaw, whose number listed as potential targets for surveillance between 2017 and 2019, was unavailable for comment.The numbers of Patel, who was the former minister for culture and tourism, and at least 15 of his close associates, including his private secretaries, cook and gardener, were listed as potential targets by The Wire. Patel refused to comment.Also named were Pradeep Awasthi, former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s personal secretary, and Sanjay Kachroo, who served as officer on special duty to Union minister Smriti Irani in 2014-15. Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Pravin Togadia’s number was selected for targeting in 2018, reported The Wire.Kishor was first potentially targeted in the run up to the 2019 elections and again during the recently concluded West Bengal elections, when he worked with the eventual victor Trinamool Congress. “We used to suspect snooping but never realised hacking, that too from 2017 to 2021. Although I changed my handset five times, as the evidence suggests, hacking continues,” he told news channel NDTV. A forensic examination of his current phone showed it was compromised as recently as July 14, reported the Washington Post.“Two Minutes of silence for the sore losers!” tweeted West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Three phone numbers belonging to the Supreme Court staffer who accused former CJI Ranjan Gogoi of sexual harassment in April 2019 were selected as potential targets, as well as numbers belonging to her husband, brothers and relatives, reported The Wire. The portal said her number was added as a potential target the same week the allegations were made public. The woman and her family refused to participate in the investigation or comment.Kang, a virologist who was helping the Kerala government deal with a Nipah outbreak in 2018, told the Washington Post that she struggled to imagine why she would be deemed a target of surveillance. “I lead a very, very boring life,” she told the newspaper.Two employees of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in Delhi; Menon, the India country head for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as at least one other foundation employee were also part of the list, reported the Post.Le Monde reported that the numbers of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and several of his ambassadors in India appeared on the list as potential targets. Dozens of other Delhi-based diplomats and ambassadors, including from Iran, Afghanistan, China, Nepal and Saudi Arabia, were also targeted, the French newspaper added.Media outlets in the consortium said Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates accounted for most of the numbers on the list .They included several members of Arab royal families, at least 65 business executives, 85 human rights activists, 189 journalists and more than 600 politicians and government officials -- including heads of state, prime ministers and cabinet ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-it-minister-ex-ec-in-new-pegasus-list-say-reports-101626719489266.html
20-07-2021||India||‘Purpose of NIA defeated if country bomb cases are treated as terrorist offences’: Madras HC||The Madras high court recently observed that the objective of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008, would be defeated if all cases involving scheduled offences were sent to special court notified under the Act.The observations were made by a full bench comprising Justices PN Prakash, V Sivagnam, RN Manjula on July 12. They were constituted to decide on questions formulated by justice AD Jagadish Chandira in view of conflicting orders passed while processing bail applications for charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which is a scheduled enactment under the NIA Act.Questions, such as whether an application against the order passed by the District and Sessions Judge in a matter concerning the UAPA shall be numbered as a bail application or an appeal, arose when justice Chandira dismissed a bail application in December 2020 for charges under the UAPA.The full bench considered the referred question and said, “In our considered opinion, the very purpose and object of the NIA Act would stand defeated if all and sundry run of the mill country bomb cases are treated as terrorist offences and sent to Special Courts/Sessions Courts for trial.”The court also noted statistics from the State Crime Records Bureau which show that in 2019 in Tamil Nadu, 139 FIRs were registered under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, read with other IPC offences like Sections 307 and 302. Offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 is a scheduled enactment under the NIA Act.“It is common knowledge that ordinary rowdy gangs have now graduated from using knives to country bombs which they find easier to carry and hurl than traditional weapons,” the court said. “Out of 139 FIRs, only in two FIRs, the provisions of the UAPA were incorporated. If the state police were to go by the strict mandates of the NIA Act, all the 139 station house officers should have to be trained to inform the state government that the moment an FIR is registered under any of the scheduled offences of the NIA Act, our state should have to intimate the Central government about the registration of such cases. Thus, the Central government will be loaded with a plethora of such reports from various state governments all over the country which they have to analyze and take a decision on a case-to-case basis as to which of the cases have to be dealt with by the NIA and which have to be left with the state police to proceed with the investigation.”The court added that sessions courts, which were already overburdened with routine judicial work, would have to see final reports of routine country bomb cases where the UAPA has been invoked.“The very purpose of the NIA Act, 2008 is to expedite the trial of serious offences, enumerated in the schedule, which would be defeated if one Court is jurisdictionally overloaded with several enactments conferring special jurisdiction. This is a practical issue which, if not addressed with reasonable dispatch, would defeat the very purpose of having Special Courts,” the court stated.Additional Solicitor General R Sankaranarayanan stated that he would bring the various issues on the matter to the attention of the Law Ministry and the court hoped that it will look into it with the seriousness it deserves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/purpose-of-nia-defeated-if-country-bomb-cases-are-treated-as-terrorist-offences-madras-hc-101626719430641.html
20-07-2021||India||Govt eases curbs on pulses trading||The Centre on Monday relaxed limits it had imposed on how much quantities of pulses traders could store at their end, a provision invoked to cool prices of the commodity, an official statement said.Wholesalers, who could not stock more than 200 tonne, now can hold up to 500 tonne of pulses, while importers will be exempted from all curbs on stock limits but will have to continue declaring their quantities on a portal run by the consumer affairs ministry.The government on July 2 invoked the Essential Commodities Act to put curbs on the quantities of pulses traders could store. According to a revised order issued on Monday, wholesalers can stock up to 500 tonne provided there should not be more than 200 tonne of any one variety of pulses. Retailers will continue to stock no more than 5 tonne. Millers will be allowed to store quantities equivalent to an average of the last the 6 months’ national output of major pulses varieties or 50% of their annual installed capacity, whichever is higher, the new order stated.The revised stock limits are applicable on four varieties of pulses: tur, masoor, urad, and chana. They will be in force until October 21, 2021.“Considering the softening of the prices and feedback received from State Governments and various stake holders, Central Government has relaxed stock limits for Millers and wholesalers and exempted importers from the same,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-eases-curbs-on-pulses-trading-101626717389153.html
20-07-2021||India||SC orders the release of activist held under NSA||The Supreme Court on Monday ordered for the immediate release of activist Erendro Leichombam, jailed by the Manipur government under the National Security Act (NSA) since May 13 for a Facebook post on the death of the state Bharatiya Janata Party chief due to Covid-19. In that, the activist had remarked that cow dung and cow urine can’t cure the infection.“We can’t keep this person in custody even for a day. He cannot be made to stay in jail even for one night,” remarked the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and M R Shah while directing the state government to make sure Leichombam, 40, is released by 5pm on Monday.The bench turned down a request by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Manipur government and asked for a day or two to examine the matter.The court sternly refused. “No, no. We will order for his release immediately. These are all innocent statements. Mr Mehta, please ignore these statements. Let him be released today and we will hear you later,” the bench told the SG.The court recorded that any further incarceration of Leichombam will be in violation of Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution. It directed that the activist be released on furnishing a personal release bond of ₹1,000 and asked the registry officials in the Supreme Court to communicate the order to the prison authorities in Manipur without any delay.“The authorities will comply with the order by 5pm today,” the bench said in its order, asking state government’s standing counsel Pukhrambam Ramesh Kumar to ensure Leichombam, a 2012 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, walks out of jail by the evening.Earlier, representing Leichombam, advocate Shadan Farasat told the bench that this was an instance of the law of preventive detention being abused to stifle a completely innocuous statement which was not only protected by the Constitution but was also in public interest. “All I said that cow dung and cow urine aren’t cures for corona (virus),” Farasat added.The SG said in response that the case should be listed after two days so that he could look into the matter. At this, the bench said that it was not averse to listing the matter on some other day but Leichombam couldn’t be in jail for another day.Following the SC order, the Manipur activist said, “I have been targeted by the state government in the past and am sure it will happen again. But I am not afraid and will express what I think is right. I will continue to raise my voice and speak my mind.”After the court ordered for Leichombam’s release, Farasat emphasised that he would be arguing for compensation to his client for the “unlawful deprivation of his liberty”.Leichombam was booked under the NSA over his Facebook post on the death of S Tikendra Singh, a retired professor and Manipur BJP chief. “The cure for Corona is not cow dung & cow urine. The cure is science & common sense. Professor ji RIP,” Leichombam wrote.On May 13, Leichombam was arrested from his house on a complaint by Usham Deben Singh, vice-president of Manipur BJP. The complainant alleged that the post had “deliberately and wilfully insulted and outraged religious fillings and sentiments” of BJP workers and family members of the deceased.The order, dated May 17, to book Leichombam under NSA by Th Kirankumar, district magistrate, Imphal West, stated, “…I am satisfied that his activities are prejudicial to the security of the State and to the maintenance of public order.”The petition filed in court through Leichombam’s father cited the Supreme Court’s order on April 30, warning the states against any clampdown on information, saying any coercive measures for using online platforms is the “worst way” to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. It added that his detention is a reprisal for Leichombam’s criticism of the BJP leaders for advocating cow dung and cow urine as cure for Covid-19.(With inputs from Utpal Parashar from Guwahati)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-the-release-of-activist-held-under-nsa-101626717268994.html

20-07-2021||India||OPEC+ ups output but fuel prices to stay high in India||The Sunday agreement of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (together known as OPEC+) to gradually increase supplies in the market is not enough to meet the growing fuel demand of major global economies, hence it may not immediately lead to any significant reduction in domestic petrol and diesel rates, government officials and industry executives said.The move by OPEC+ is more to save the producers’ cartel, which appears to be a compromise reached between the two factions – the one that wanted to continue the squeeze for raising oil prices further and the other that pushed for raising output, they said requesting anonymity. Producers at OPEC+, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, on July 5 clashed over plans of raising output that disrupted the meeting and threatened the alliance.The meeting, which was reconvened on Sunday, agreed to boost supplies by 400,000 barrels per day every month from August till the halted output is fully restored. One of the key reasons for high domestic fuel rates in India is production curbs by the oil cartel.OPEC+, which includes Russia, on April 12 last year announced an unprecedented 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil output, a 10th of the global output, from May 1, 2020. The move was to check the free fall in oil rates after global fuel demand slumped due to the Covid outbreak. Later, when demand rose, they did not adhere to the planned restoration of supply.Commenting on the Sunday agreement of the cartel, RS Sharma, former chairman of the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said the squeeze by OPEC+ still continues. “The supply increase remains strong in favour of high prices,” he said.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said that the increase in output is insignificant compared to the growing demand.Citing the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), he said: “It is expected that global oil demand in Q3-2021 is going to rise by about 2.5% to 3% over Q2, 2021, and that would amount to about 2.5 to 3 million barrels per day.”“The announced increase of 400,000 barrels per day of oil by OPEC plus may rather help in pushing [up] oil prices due to high spurt in oil demand as also major economies like USA, EU, UK and other Asian countries have gone through substantial vaccination programs which helped increased economic activities thus resulting in a sharp increase in demand for oil,” he said.Debasish Mishra, Partner, Deloitte India, said: “This is a welcome move but the supply ramp up suggested by OPEC is inadequate as demand is coming back faster... Oil market supply situation is expected to remain tight well into 2022 and prices may continue have an upward bias, which is not very good news for India.”An oil ministry official said this is a move in the right direction as India has been asking producers to raise output. “We hope the alliance to increase supplies more to match the demand,” he said requesting anonymity.India has witnessed a record jump in petrol and diesel rates that crossed ₹100 per litre in several cities. So far, state-run fuel retailers have raised pump rates of petrol by ₹11.44 a litre and diesel by ₹9.14 since May 4. Exorbitant taxes are the other reason for high fuel rates in India. Through 2020, as global crude prices crashed below $20 a barrel, the central government had raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opec-ups-output-but-fuel-prices-to-stay-high-in-india-101626633380684.html
20-07-2021||Today's||Covid-19: Prepare for the third wave||Is a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic imminent? Will it be more severe than the second one? Can it be prevented? While it may be difficult to predict the exact timing and magnitude of the third wave, it is possible to estimate its impact, based on the experience of the first two waves. These estimates can then form the foundation for preparing resilient health infrastructure to tackle a possible third wave.The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019, has recently published a working paper on this issue. The paper’s estimates are based on the magnitude and timing of the second wave after scientific assessment, learnings from the experience of India and other countries, and advice from epidemiologists. It also recommends steps that the central and state governments must take to ensure adequate beds and oxygen for patients, if the next wave strikes.The paper has given three scenarios: Business as usual (where vaccinations in states will continue at the same pace and the third wave will occur after six months); optimistic (where the vaccination speed will increase and the third wave will occur after seven months); and challenging (where the vaccination speed will reduce, and the third wave will begin much earlier). However, in the case of a virus mutation, which nullifies the shield provided by antibodies formed in people due to prior infections and vaccines, estimates could go haywire.The numbers that might be affected in the third wave are also dependent on two other parameters: The people already affected, and those who may be vaccinated in the next few months. Assuming that these two categories will be at a minimum risk of infection, people who have neither been vaccinated nor have caught the disease will be most vulnerable in the third wave.Assuming that the peaks at the state level will be at different times, the oxygen demand is expected to vary between 6,200 MT and 8,500 MT per day. However, in the unlikely situation of a peak beginning simultaneously in all states, the oxygen demand may shoot up to between 13,800 MT to 20,600 MT per day. Therefore, the authorities must prepare for the upper end of the spectrum.Another significant projection is that Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh will account for approximately two-thirds of the oxygen requirement due to the high number of vulnerable people in these seven states.In the business-as-usual scenario, UP, Bihar, and West Bengal are expected to require the most oxygen at 3,076, 1,818, and 1,344 MT per day, respectively, out of the total 16,387 MT all-India requirement. Therefore, the plan to install Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen-generating plants across India must take this into account rather than distribute them evenly across all states. Further, states that do not have industrial oxygen production facilities must ramp up their oxygen capacity.The paper also suggests that only 60% of industrial oxygen may be reserved for the significant source states as they go on to add medical oxygen capacity. The rest, 40% oxygen, should be planned for allocation in deficit states. If this is not done, states, especially in the north and Northeast India, may find it challenging to add adequate capacity. All states, especially those with a higher estimated deficit, must use the time available to build up oxygen production capacity, intensive care units (ICU) and oxygen beds, and not be solely dependent on industrial oxygen. All states must try to achieve self-sufficiency for the worst-case scenario. While the epidemiological models could not predict the second wave, they were almost accurate predicting the peak two to three weeks in advance. This indicates that once cases start rising in any state, they have two to three weeks to prepare for the peak.Apart from creating additional oxygen sources, the emphasis must be on building supply chains for oxygen tankers, storage facilities, and cylinders. The hub-and-spoke model to receive oxygen in regional centres with proper storage facilities, along with sufficient distribution channels to deliver it from one location to another, need to be put in place now.Lack of a trained workforce to handle oxygen wards and ICUs may become a constraint in the third wave. In addition, health care providers require additional support. A supplementary pool of medical and para-medical students, aapda mitras, National Cadet Corps cadets, and Home Guards with a science/biology background can be trained to work under medical guidance. States can also build temporary hospitals in government-owned land, stadiums, community halls, semi-constructed buildings, and parking lots.Finally, an online health decision support system must be built. While the Centre and states have started many innovative digital interventions, a common national platform for citizens and decision-makers can provide teleconsultation, vaccination updates, and information about bed availability to citizens. It can also help decision-makers respond better by monitoring parameters for oxygen availability and requirement, movement of oxygen tankers, availability of workforce, and medicines. All existing systems and databases must be synergised in one place.Whether the third wave occurs or not, this is an opportunity for India to prepare the health infrastructure system for an efficient and quick response to such mega and unprecedented health challenges.Sandeep Poundrik is director-general, Coalition for Disaster Resilient InfrastructureThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-prepare-for-the-third-wave-101626707248590.html
20-07-2021||Today's||On China, the end of delusion and persistence of stalemate||The state of India-China ties is so parlous that any bilateral engagement between the two generates curiosity about what might be in the offing, and the results often underscore the fact that there is no getting away from the downward spiral.For decades, India and China managed to delude themselves and the world that their challenges are surmountable and that cooperation on wider global issues would be the antidote to bilateral differences, which continued to grow amid widening capability differentials. Now, as this façade is cracking under the weight of Chinese intransigence, New Delhi and Beijing are struggling to get the modalities of their bilateral engagement back on track.Last week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Dushanbe. And the outcome of the dialogue once again underscored the fundamental divergence between the approaches of the two nations. For New Delhi, it is China’s attempts at unilaterally changing the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that is at the heart of the problem, and, therefore, India insists that broader bilateral ties can only develop after full restoration of peace and tranquility along the border. As Jaishankar outlined, the continuation of the existing situation in eastern Ladakh was visibly impacting bilateral ties in a “negative manner”. The disengagement around the Pangong lake areas in February, following a series of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the standoff, was supposed to generate conditions for resolving other outstanding issues, but Beijing seems to be in no real hurry to move forward. As a consequence, problems remain unresolved in disputed areas such as Depsang, Demchok, Gogra and Hot Springs.Though the two foreign ministers agreed to hold the next round of military dialogue at the earliest to discuss all the remaining issues and seek a mutually acceptable solution, it’s not readily evident what the way forward is going to be. The next round of dialogue will only have meaning if the understanding arrived at, in earlier exchanges, is adhered to. Last year, in September, on the sidelines of another SCO conclave in Moscow, India and China had reached a five-point agreement for the resolution of the border problem; this included quick disengagement of troops and further steps to restore peace along LAC. But China’s approach contradicted the letter and spirit of the pact. During his recent meeting with Jaishankar, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, while agreeing that “relations still stay at a low level, which is not in the interest of either side”, insisted that the border dispute should be kept “in an appropriate position” and it should be addressed while both sides looked to “expand the positive momentum of bilateral cooperation and create favourable conditions for resolving differences through negotiation”. He repeated the usual Chinese trope that bilateral interaction “should still be seeking mutual benefits and complementarity, pursuing healthy competition and avoiding confrontation”.So while New Delhi wants the boundary issue to be resolved first, China wants to focus on other areas of cooperation and is in no hurry to move forward on the contentious issue. From Moscow, where India and China had laid out the parameters to sort out the border issue last year and which led to de-escalation at Pangong Tso, to Dushanbe, the trust deficit has only increased. In fact, there seems to be a long-term reorientation in Indian and Chinese force postures along LAC.In the absence of a diplomatic way forward, the military domain is becoming the most important instrument. China is busy building bunkers and permanent structures as well as moving additional forces, tanks and long-range artillery to the LAC. India is responding in kind with a much-needed structural shift away from Pakistan to China in its defence policy. As troops and materiel amassed along the LAC grow, the border becomes ever more volatile, making it the “new normal” for the two neighbours. Soon after the Jaishankar-Wang Yi meet in Dushanbe, Jaishankar’s statement at the International Conference on Regional Connectivity of Central and South Asia, in Tashkent, also made it clear that sovereignty issues will dominate the discourse on China. Targeting China and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, he argued that “respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity are the most basic principles of international relations”, and that connectivity must be based on economic viability and financial responsibility, and should promote economic activity and not create debt burdens. India has been one of the most vocal critics of the Chinese model of connectivity projects and has no plans to tone it down.Recognising the failure of the earlier model, which privileged the appearance of normal bilateral ties at the expense of moving forward on difficult matters, Indian policymakers are now clear that without peace and tranquility along the border, the bilateral relationship can’t really move forward. For its part, Beijing’s insistence that the boundary dispute should not be privileged is a product of its past success, where it could continue to keep up the pressure on the border even as other aspects of engagement developed to its advantage. As this impasse continues, there is a real danger of India-China ties moving rapidly to a point of no return.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College London and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation, DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/on-china-the-end-of-delusion-and-persistence-of-stalemate-101626707188480.html
20-07-2021||Today's||Four deaths, the right to life, and the Jayaprakash Principle||The purpose of this column is to retrieve from the pages of history four episodes, among countless, of illnesses contracted by Indian prisoners and their subsequent deaths. The first three are of Indians in South Africa, imprisoned for participating in satyagraha campaigns between 1908 and 1913 for fundamental civil rights and self-respect.“Sammy” Nagappen was a young indentured labourer from the Madras Presidency. Imprisoned in 1909, he was sentenced to hard labour. Nagappen was made to work, in Mahatma Gandhi’s words, “as a prisoner on the African veldt in the bitter cold of winter, in the early morning when there was no sun”. One can imagine the young lad with DNA that intended him for a life under the Tamil sky, unable to withstand the South African chill and, what is more, labouring in it. Even after he took ill, Gandhi says, Nagappen “still held on…”. Released when death seemed imminent, Nagappen died on July 6, 1909.Harbut Singh, 75, was an indentured labourer from the United Provinces. He was jailed at Volksrust in 1913, with Gandhi. The Mahatma records that the man was “6 feet tall and of noble carriage”. Gandhi asked him why he had opted to participate in the satyagraha at that age with all the risks involved. The doughty Indian said: “In the evening of my days, I am content to pass the rest of my life in prison to deliver my countrymen.” Singh died of pneumonia on October 5, 1914.Valliamma, a Tamil girl of 18, was arrested for participating in the march and jailed with Kasturba Gandhi, among others, in Pietermaritzburg, with hard labour. She was released when she was ill. Gandhi, just out of prison, went with his associate, Henry SL Polak, to see her. “…we lifted her with the greatest care on to her carpet and tended to her”. Valliamma died on February 22, 1914. On the same date, but in 1944, Kasturba Gandhi died of grave illness in prison in Poona. The House of Commons was informed on March 2, 1944 “…She was receiving all possible medical care and attention, not only from her regular attendants but from those desired by her family.” To this, Gandhi, responded: “The deceased herself had repeatedly asked the Inspector General of Prisons for Dr Dinshaw Mehta’s help… Again the regular physicians Drs Nayar and Gilder made a written application for consultation with Dr B C Roy of Calcutta… The Government simply ignored their written request and subsequent oral reminders.” The House of Commons was also told that no request for her release was received by the government, to which Gandhi asked: “Would it not have been in the fitness of things if the Government had at least offered to her, me, and her sons, to release her?” And then said: “The mere offer of release would have produced a favourable psychological effect on her mind. But unfortunately no such offer was ever made.”Jayaprakash Narayan, imprisoned as the infamous Emergency was proclaimed in 1975, was released when his health collapsed. His release and subsequent medical attention, painfully slow as they were in coming, saved his death not very long thereafter from being attributed to his imprisonment.The government’s prerogative to prosecute is not to be questioned. Nor the court’s to punish. But this much can and needs to be said: No undertrial or convict should be rendered vulnerable and susceptible to disease or morbidity with the condition reaching the point of becoming fatal. He or she must, on sickness being verified, get medical aid promptly and professionally with the prospect of supervised release. The right to life demands this. No detention or sentence is meant to run concurrently with illness. A sick detenu’s right to medical attention with the release on bail or under a bond, if asked for and found to be justified, amounts to a principle, no less.

20-07-2021||Editorials||An attack on citizens||On Sunday evening, an international network of media organisations, assisted by a network of international civil society organisations, broke a story about State surveillance as a part of a series called The Pegasus Project. In India, The Wire reported that the phone numbers of 40 journalists (including three from this newspaper), two ministers (including the new minister for information technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw), three Opposition figures (including Rahul Gandhi), political consultant-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, officials (including former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa), a Supreme Court judge, and business figures were on a list of potential targets for surveillance at different points in the last four years. The phone devices of some individuals, subjected to forensic analysis, indicated the presence of an infection or an attempted hack. If the allegations of widespread surveillance are true, they represent an unacceptable and illegal invasion of the right to privacy, right to liberty, and the right to dignity of all those targeted; the series also throw up deeply disturbing questions about the source of the hack and represents a subversion of India’s constitutional democracy. Developed by the Israeli firm NSO, Pegasus is an extraordinarily sophisticated technology that can, once it infects a phone, gain access to calls (including on encrypted platforms), contacts, app passwords, browsing history, microphone and camera which can capture off-line conversations, and even plant evidence, as alleged in the Bhima Koregaon case. To be sure, the mere presence of a number does not indicate a hack. The list is only of potential targets. Forensic analysis has been limited, and also inconclusive in certain cases. The Government of India (GOI) has denied allegations of illegal surveillance, and claimed all interceptions are as per law and due process — though it does leave room open to ask if GOI has purchased Pegasus and deployed it. NSO, which maintains that it sells the software only to “vetted governments” for countering terror and crime, termed the allegation baseless, and claimed that the 50,000 listed numbers (internationally) may be for other purposes. But its chief executive, Shalev Hulio also said that allegations of misuse were concerning and if true, violate the relationship of trust with customers, ie governments.The gravity of the allegations and its implications for Indian democracy are enormous. If the Indian government has done this, it is a betrayal of the constitutional compact with citizens. If another government has done it, it is a cyber attack on India and its citizens. Either way, there must be a truly independent judicial enquiry to get to the truth and hold those responsible for this violation of fundamental rights accountable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/an-attack-on-citizens-101626706948470.html
20-07-2021||Editorials||Housing is critical for the environment||In Mumbai, on Sunday, 31 people died in a series of house collapses after a short burst of intense rain, a tell-tale sign of the climate crisis, triggered landslides. In Haryana’s Faridabad district, protests have continued at Khori Gaon since June 7 when the Supreme Court directed the municipal corporation to take “essential measures” to remove “encroachments” from forest lands. A common thread unites these events — housing poverty.Urban India has struggled with providing proper, adequate and legal housing to citizens that has electricity, water supply, sanitation, and sewage connections. In addition to the homeless, there is a slum population of roughly 65 million (or 17% of urban India). A 2020 Niti Aayog paper, titled Housing Conundrum, showed the housing market has a skewed demand–supply management. Housing backlogs coexist with stressed assets and vacant housing stock. The development of affordable housing is constrained by economic and spatial issues. Land use plans are unable to keep pace with rapid urban population increase and land development.A safe and climate-sensitive shelter can provide income, security and a future for inhabitants. For poor women in the informal sector, the home plays a critical role in their earning activities, making it a productive asset.
