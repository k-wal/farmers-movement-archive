The police are yet to ascertain how the boy fell into the pit.  Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said the Narela Industrial Area police station received a call at 1.18pm that a boy drowned in a pit and was taken to a nearby hospital. “A police team reached the hospital and learnt that the boy, identified as Govind, was dead,” said the DCP. The boy’s family told police that he left home in the morning and went to the field to attend to nature’s call. When he did not return, his family members panicked and started looking for him. A neighbour informed the boy’s father that his son drowned after falling into a pit near an agricultural field. Local residents rescued the boy and rushed him to the hospital, where doctors declared that he died of drowning.“Prime facie, it appears that the boy was passing by the pit and slipped. He may have not seen the pit since it was filled with rain water. An inquest proceeding under section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was initiated,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nineyearold-boy-drowns-after-falling-into-pit-in-outer-delhi-101626719251511.html

India as the largest open markets for digital video content and smartphones will benefit immensely from the indigenous development of converged 5G standards for direct to mobile broadcasting. In a future scenario, where both audio and video broadcast content can be directly delivered to smartphones and mobile-phones over a common broadcast infrastructure, India will also be able to establish global leadership in convergence between radio and television broadcasting. “With audiences increasingly shifting away from traditional broadcasting to OTT platforms and audio-video content consumption over mobile data, it is critical for the public broadcaster to be able to reach audiences directly on their mobile phones, smartphones and other smart devices. We see this research collaboration with IIT-Kanpur as critical to the development of an indigenous technology ecosystem for direct to mobile broadcasting.“We also look forward to India specific standards for 5G broadcasting to emerge from this technology trial. I am thankful to the Prasar Bharati Board for according its approval to this Center of Excellence. I am also thankful to the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting for its continued support to Prasar Bharati as we modernise our broadcasting infrastructure and take efforts towards realising the Prime Minister’s vision for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” said Shashi Shekhar Vempati, CEO, Prasar Bharati.“We are excited to work with Prasar Bharati in emerging technologies for broadcasting. The direct to mobile converged platform trial will enable the transition to the next generation technology deployment. The development of technologies such as automatic speech recognition for subtitling and archival content retrieval through audio and text query have significant potential of making broadcast content available in various Indian languages. We are grateful to Prasar Bharati for funding these projects towards collaborative translational research for developing indigenous eco-system,” said Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT-Kanpur.Three projectsThe research projects will be taken up by IIT-Kanpur in three areas, leveraging funding provided by Prasar Bharati:• Next Generation Broadcast Technology Trial (Direct to Mobile Broadcasting, Convergence with 5G)• Automatic Speech Recognition for Speech Subtitling (Making Broadcast Content in various Indian Languages Accessible)• Archival Content Retrieval through Audio and Text Query||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prasar-bharati-iit-k-to-collaborate-on-nextgen-broadcasting-tech-101626719250987.html
19-07-2021||Delhi||Low turnout at PTM in Delhi as rain keeps people away||A large-scale parent-teachers’ meeting (PTM) across Delhi government schools, along with teachers from institutions run by the city’s civic bodies, kicked off on Monday and will continue till July 31, a move that is part of the state’s efforts to bridge the learning gaps brought about by online classes during the pandemic.The turnouts across schools was, on the day, were lower than officials expected, likely due to the heavy downpour in the Capital, which received 69.6mm of rain till XXXpm. Officials in several schools in areas such as Trilokpuri, Rohini, Najafgarh, Badarpur, Janakpuri, Seelampur, and Lajpat Nagar said they expect more parents to arrive in the coming days.“Heavy rainfall in our area since last [Sunday] night affected the attendance. Even then, half the parents of students in Class 6 came for the session. Most of the parents wanted to know when schools will reopen... Many also asked for more online lessons that keep internet data and bandwith constraints in mind. We have taken these suggestions into account and will work on such localised study plans on different subjects and upload them on YouTube,” said Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8.Delhi deputy minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, thanked parents for attending the meets despite the rain.“Despite incessant rains, the enthusiasm shown by our teachers and parents for the PTM is commendable. This shows that our parents and teachers are committed to the education of children and their better social-emotional well-being,” said Sisodia in a statement.The state education department this year decided to include teachers in municipal teachers because around 170,000 students move from corporation schools — that offer education only up to Class 5 — to state government schools in Class 6. This was done to ensure that the transition of students from corporation to Delhi government schools is smoother because classes have been held online since March last year and parents did not get a chance to get acquainted with the teachers at Delhi government schools.On Monday, school authorities were seen operating helpdesks at the entrance of several schools before being ushered towards the classroom for a meeting with the teachers, with distancing and other Covid-appropriate protocols in place. Parents were also told about school management committees and the parent-outreach programme of these committees. Each teacher was asked to maintain a record of available smartphones among students.Naghma (first name), whose daughter studies in Class 7 at a Delhi government school in Badarpur, said, “Though we have a low-end smartphone, it belongs to my husband, who goes out for work every day. We have requested the school to provide worksheets instead of online lessons, but they insisted on continuing online classes, because they are more interactive.”Teachers involved with the PTM said despite asking parents to bring in the required documents and information on Monday, many were not able to do so. Neelam Raghuvanshi, a Class 6 teacher at a government school in Trilokpuri, said, “We have been apprising parents of various Delhi government schemes, including financial assistance under the Laadli scheme. We had asked parents to bring in documents related to these and those who could not bring in today, can bring in on Wednesday.”Her corporation school counterpart Anu Yadav helped in tracking students who transitioned from MCD schools. “Many students or their families are in touch with me or have my number. So, they reach out to me regularly. Tapping into that network, we were able to find the updated contacts of many Class 6 students whose old numbers are defunct.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/low-turnout-at-ptm-in-delhi-as-rain-keeps-people-away-101626719249789.html

The underpass was shut for all traffic on Monday morning due to the incessant rains, inundating several areas and resulting in long snarls on several important thoroughfares. Police barricades were placed to block the roads leading to the underpass, which was filled with rain water since morning. Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said the police received a call at 1.37pm reporting a drowning beneath the railway underpass at Pul Prahladpur. Fire department rescue teams and divers were called in for rescue efforts. However, after an hour-long operation, the man’s body was fished out of the underpass. The man was identified as Ravi Chautala, a resident of south Delhi’s Gautampuri in Jaitpur, around 200 metres from the underpass. The body was sent to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for an autopsy and the man’s family was informed about his death, said Meena. “Locals revealed that Chautala went deep into the water to take selfies or videos. Inquest proceedings are being conducted”, he added. Chautala is survived by his parents, four siblings, his wife and a 10-month-old daughter. He worked in a PPE kit-manufacturing unit in Okhla. His sister, Preeti, said that he left home in the morning for work and she last spoke to him around 11.40am. “I called to ask if he reached office and was carrying his lunchbox. Around 3pm, someone called on my father’s mobile number and informed that my brother had drowned. My parents and sister have gone to the mortuary,” she said. “I still don’t understand what he was doing at the underpass. He was supposed to be at his office. It’s very unusual because he never leaves his workplace like this. We don’t believe he came to the underpass to take selfies or shoot videos,” said Preeti, adding that her brother bought a new mobile phone just two days ago. Police said they were scanning the CCTV cameras to ascertain when and how Chautala reached the underpass and if anyone else was accompanying him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-rain-man-drowns-in-waterlogged-pul-prahladpur-underpass-101626719189224.html

In just one year, the group has employed 20 workers who are now working in their small factory manufacturing jeans.As the main tailor of the team (called a master in Hindi) Kamlesh Pal recalls, it was the first week of April 2020 when the effect of nationwide lockdown was felt by all. “I owned a small factory at Ullasnagar of Mumbai and with the staff of 16 persons, our world changed overnight. All the workers of my factory were either from my village Parsara or from Kaushambi and we all decided to return as suddenly all orders dried up and we had nowhere to sell the product,” said Pal. However, the situation was equally challenging for these expert tailors back in their village. But with the support of the NRLM block mission manager Ved Prakash Dwivedi, timely help arrived in the shape of a self-help group (SHG) of the block of which their wives were members. A loan of ₹7 lakh was provided to them and these expert tailors opened their workshop wherein their wives too were engaged. The first few months were fine for the group of 20 people who operated the factory, but the second wave of the pandemic brought back the challenging times.The team comprising of expert workers like Pravesh Prajapati, Ram Bahadur, Shiv Bahadur, Pramod Prajapati, Tej Bahadur Pal and Preetika Shukla among others are putting best of their efforts but lack an avenue to sell their jeans to a wider range of buyers and the sluggish pace of the retail market is posing huge problems for them. “We have prepared dresses for students at government schools as well besides the jeans. First, it was the problem of procuring the raw material and now is the finished product (Denim jeans) for which we are struggling to find a market. Today we have around 500 jeans prepared but there are no buyers,” said Kamlesh. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) block mission manager Ved Prakash Dwivedi said, “The need of the hour is that the final product of these expert tailors should get proper branding as their product is of top quality. The only problem is they should get exposure to the market in the city.” Gradually the branding will be done so that the goods will start selling well, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/this-group-of-skilled-workers-looking-for-buyers-for-their-locally-made-jeans-101626718769811.html

Chaudhari has been arrested by the central agency in the money laundering case registered by it connection with the Bhosari land deal.ED on Monday produced Chaudhari before the special court as his earlier custody remand ended. The agency, on August 28, 2019, booked Khadse, his wife Mandakani, Chaudhari and the owner of the land, Abbas Rasalbhai Ukani, in a money laundering case. ED’s enforcement case information report is based on a first information report (FIR) filed by Maharashtra anti-corruption bureau (ACB) against the Khadse family in 2017. ACB had later closed the case, but ED continued its investigation into the alleged financial irregularities in the land deal.The case pertains to the purchase of a 1.31-hectare plot at Bhosari village in Haveli taluka of Pune district on April 28, 2016 by Chaudhari and Mandakini for ₹3.75 crore, against the market value of ₹31 crore. ACB had alleged that Khadse and the other two had caused loss of ₹61.25 crore to the state exchequer by dealing with the land.In its remand application seeking extension in Chaudhari’s custody, ED had earlier stated that the piece of land was already acquired by Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) back in 1971, which developed and allotted it for different industries.It was further alleged that Chaudhari had purchased the land after securing finance of ₹2 crore from a company named Benchmark Buildcon Private Limited. During investigation, ED recorded statement of Benchmark Buildcon’s former director Manjunath Omkar on Tuesday. In his statement Omkar claimed he was offered ₹15,000 salary per month for becoming the director and that he has never seen any work being carried by Benchmark Buildcon and that it was just a paper company.“The source of funds for purchase the said land is not genuine and it has been routed through various companies. These companies which are used by Chaudhari to channelise funds for the purchase of the said land are nothing but shell companies which were used for layering of funds,” ED had claimed in its earlier remand application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-remand-of-eknath-khadse-s-son-in-law-extended-till-july-20-101626718470988.html

Raut added that this incident was the “biggest threat to the freedom on this country”. The Rajya Sabha MP and party’s chief spokesperson said there is an atmosphere of fear among the people and that several sections of people including politicians, journalists, editors have been living under shadow of fear for the past several years.He said that phone calls of over 1,500 prominent people from the country, including serving ministers, editors, leaders, some chief ministers, were tapped. “Still, names of many people whose phones were tapped are yet to come out. Mainly, journalists’ and editors’ phones were tapped this time around, and this is serious. For the past several years, politicians, journalists and editors are living under a shadow of fear that they are being watched and phones are being tapped. The PM and home minister must come forward to address the issue and clarify on it. If foreign apps are used to tap phones of prominent people then it is the biggest threat to the freedom in this country,” Raut said in New Delhi.International media on Sunday reported that more than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including that of two serving ministers, more than 40 journalists, three opposition leaders, activists in India could have been targeted for hacking through the Israeli spyware which is sold only to government agencies. The government, however, dismissed allegations of any kind of surveillance on its part on specific people, saying it “has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever”.Raut said such incidents of snooping are a sign of a weak government. “This is a sign that the country’s government and its administration are weak. We do not have stringent cybercrime law and therefore, anybody wakes up and taps our phones. Similarly, the government is not confronting these issues; therefore, there is an atmosphere of fear among the people,” he said.When asked if Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s phone was also tapped, Raut said, “I do not have the full list of the people whose phones were tapped. But I will not be surprised if the phone of Maharashtra CM was also tapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pegasus-snooping-allegations-won-t-be-surprised-if-cm-s-phone-is-tapped-says-sanjay-raut-101626718469111.html

HC judge SS Shinde observed that he was a wonderful person, and hence though they had very little time, he made it a point to attend the online funeral service. “Swamy’s service was gracious and while the legal matter against Swamy was a different issue, it was not expecting the death of the priest before it passed judgment on the bail application,” he said. The HC clarified that it had dealt with medical bail applications of Elgar Parishad accused including Swamy, Varavara Rao and Hany Babu on humane consideration by acceding to their request to be transferred to private hospitals of their choices despite vehement opposition from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Maharashtra prison authorities.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the application of Swamy, was informed by senior counsel Mihir Desai that he was seeking permission for Fr Frazer Mascarenhas to participate in the magisterial inquiry into the cause of Swamy’s death. Desai submitted that as the process for such inquiries mandated the participation of family members and as Fr Mascarenhas was permitted by the HC to meet Swamy while he was at Holy Family Hospital from May 28 till his death on July 5, he should be allowed to participate in the inquiry as well.However, NIA through advocate Sandesh Patil opposed continuation of the medical bail plea and said that issues pertaining to the inquiry could not be taken up in the same application, following which the court said it would consider the request of Swamy’s counsel on Friday (July 23).While referring to the criticism hurled at the HC and NIA for the cause of Swamy’s death, the bench said, “We ensured we remained fair while passing orders on Swamy’s medical bail application as well as the applications filed by the other co-accused in the Elgar Parishad case like P Varavara Rao and Hany Babu by permitting them to be shifted to the hospital of their choice, though there was vehement opposition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/have-great-respect-for-stan-swamy-s-work-says-bombay-hc-judge-101626718409090.html
19-07-2021||Mumbai||Institutes seeking fee revision will have to submit hard copy of proposal: Maharashtra FRA||After not working for months due to need of a new team, newly appointed members of the Maharashtra Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) recently got together to discuss the need for better mechanisms in place. For starters, the authority has discussed the need for institute fee proposals to be submitted in hard copies along with the online submission of soft copies. “Since there is no authenticity of documents submitted in online portal, three hard copies of the fee proposal will be asked from the institute along with relevant online proposal,” stated a document shared by FRA as part of the minutes of the meeting made public last week.FRA has also formed separate sub-committees to look into grievance redressal and to determine norms for charging fees by unaided private institutes in the 2022-23 academic year. In a statement released by the authority recently, they also suggested that they might charge processing fee from institutes seeking approval or an upward revision of fees to maintain routine expenses covered by FRA.“The regulating authority might charge processing fee for conducting Common Entrance Test (CET) and charges for fixation of fees, etc., as maybe decided by the authorities. The processing fee maybe be decided considering the day-to-day expenditure including salaries, allowances, administrative expenses, honorarium, infrastructural expenses in pursuance of its function,” said a statement released by the authority last week. It further states that the processing fee can range from a minimum of ₹15,000 to 0.05% of the annual fee charged by the institute, whichever is higher.Established in 2004, FRA is a quasi-judicial body responsible for regulating fees of all unaided private professional colleges in the state. Every year, institutes submit proposals for changing their fee structure to the authority, which considers a number of indicators such as nature of the course, number of students, teaching and non-teaching staff, infrastructure and other facilities at the college before fixing the fees. In March this year, the term of the previous members of FRA had ended and the new members took over only last month. “The newly formed sub-committees have one month’s time to submit their recommendations to FRA, following which permanent decisions will be taken and shared with the institutes,” said a senior FRA member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/institutes-seeking-fee-revision-will-have-to-submit-hard-copy-of-proposal-maharashtra-fra-101626718349681.html
19-07-2021||Mumbai||Pegasus link to Maharashtra: Congress seeks probe||Maharashtra Congress has demanded a thorough probe by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to find out if there was any Pegasus link in the state and why a team of its publicity department had gone to Israel during the Devendra Fadnavis regime which was in power till October 2019.The demand has been raised by the state Congress in the wake of the report that spyware Pegasus, which is sold by NSO Group of Israel, may have been used to conduct surveillance on around 300 Indians including cabinet ministers, opposition leaders, scientists and journalists. State Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the state government should investigate to find out if snooping and phone tapping took place in Maharashtra using Pegasus software during Fadnavis government.“The illegal and unauthorised phone tapping done by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, who headed state intelligence department during Fadnavis government, is being probed and the truth will soon come to the fore. But there are also doubts if there are any Maharashtra links to Pegasus leaks and if any IPS officer posted at Mantralaya was working on it. A few officials from the office of the director general of information and public relations (DGIPR) of the state had visited Israel during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The questions including if they got any training, by whose permission they had gone, did they submit any report to the government, how many times did they go to Israel, were there any scheduled meetings in Israel, had the government any correspondence with NSO or any presentation was made to the state government need to be answered. A probe into the issue will throw light on these questions,” Sawant said.He added that Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh had, in January 2020, alleged that a few officials in Maharashtra were involving in tapping. “We are now demanding a probe in this issue. The snooping and tapping of phones using Pegasus and alleged role of the Central government is very serious in nature. We suspect that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states would have been directed by the Centre on the similar lines. The tapping that took place during Fadnavis government is one of such routine practice in BJP-ruled governments,” he said.The Nationalist Congress Part (NCP) has slammed the Centre over revelations related to Pegasus hacking. State NCP president Jayant Patil on Monday said it is a breach of privacy if authorised by the Central government and if not it is a cyberattack on sovereignty of the country. “There is only 1 agenda. Did GOI authorize #Pegasus on any part of civil society? If yes - it’s a shocking state-sponsored breach of privacy & abuse of freedom. If not - it’s a cyber attack on India’s sovereignty which we must know & then fight together. Choose (sic),” Patil tweeted on Monday.Party’s national spokesperson Nawab Malik said there must be an investigation and responsibility be fixed on those involved in it. “Nothing is more serious than illegal snooping. The company (NSO Group) has clarified that they sell their software only to governments and not to private organisations. If it is not sold to a private organisation, which agency of the country snooped upon journalists, opposition leaders, ministers, judges, lawyers? This needs to be investigated. If done by the government, there’s nothing bad than this and if not, then the responsibility of those officers or agencies involved in it be fixed and action must be taken,” Malik said.The BJP, however, played it down. “The veracity of Pegasus-related reports has neither been proved nor the source of the information been revealed. When the source and validity of the original story is under doubts, there is no point in commenting on any side links related to it,” said Maharashtra BJP’s vice-president Madhav Bhandari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pegasus-link-to-maharashtra-congress-seeks-probe-101626718349138.html

An official statement from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) on Friday evening clarified that registration for the optional CET exam will begin at 11am on Tuesday and the window will be open until late on July 26.At present, only state board Class 10 students have received their results, while those from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) are still awaiting their results. State board officials clarified that all interested students can register for CET whether or not their results are announced. “Registration is being done to understand how many students are interested in appearing for the exam, so students from all school education boards can complete the process in this week,” said a senior official from MSBSHSE. Students can log on to http://cet.mh-ssc.ac.in to complete their registration process.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead formulate based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. While other boards are yet to announce results, MSBSHSE released SSC results on Friday (July 16) amid server crash issues. According to the circular released by the board on Monday, an optional CET exam based solely on SSC syllabus and consisting of multiple choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks will be conducted. This two-hour paper will be conducted in physical mode on August 21 from 11am to 1pm. Further details will be shared by the board soon.The latest circular also mentions subject-wise details of the topics that will be considered for CET exam. On Friday, the state board had announced that registrations for CET exam will begin online from Monday, which left students and schools in a state of confusion all day.“The state board informed us that a link for student registrations interested in CET exam will be released soon. And while the officials mentioned July 19 as the day for commencement of this process, no link for registrations had been shared by the board till evening,” said Rupa Roy, principal of Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar. This delay has left SSC students more anxious, especially after lakhs of them struggled to access their results on Friday due to a server crash. Scheduled to be announced on Friday afternoon at 1pm, the official results website crashed within hours, keeping lakhs of students across the state from accessing their results till Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-registration-for-fyjc-cet-to-begin-on-tuesday-exam-on-august-21-101626718289086.html

She actually wanted to be an army officer but didn’t get the proper guidance and access to books required to fulfil her dreams.Ten years later, Nisha, who is posted as a constable in Muzaffarnagar, has access to a good library set up by the efforts of SSP of Muzaffarnagar Abhishek Yadav. She is now preparing for the civil services and the library set up for police personnel and their families has come as a boon for her.A visibly happy Nisha said that she also motivated her husband and their 7-year-old son to join the library, and they became members immediately after its inauguration on Sunday. “My son is preparing for the Math Olympiad and he has received some good books from the library for preparation,” said Nisha.The police library, established in the police lines, was inaugurated by head constable Rajesh Singh’s 8-year-old daughter, Prakriti, on Sunday.SSP Abhishek Yadav, whose brainchild the library is, believes that books offer an exposure to the richness, beauty and brilliance of this world to all of us in a manner that is incomparable to anything else.“Children of police personnel miss the exposure due to the lack of well-stocked libraries which are easily accessible and cheap. Keeping this in mind, Muzaffarnagar Police has inaugurated its very own Police Library for its staff and families,” he said.“A lot of police personnel prepare for competitive exams while working and we have tried to create a storehouse of books to aid them in that process and also provide them a space to study peacefully since barracks are rarely quiet or peaceful,” explained Yadav, who had also opened a ‘Police Cafe’ inside the police lines to provide police personnel a comfortable, hygienic and stylish place to have food and snacks with steaming coffee.Constable Abhishek Tyagi has been given the responsibility to look after the library. According to him, the library is receiving an overwhelming response from Day One. “Fifty persons have joined the library on the very first day and more than 200 persons have visited it,” said Tyagi, who himself is fond of books and is also an avid reader.The SSP said that the library is stocked with more than 1,000 books from varied fields like school education, competitive exams, finance, health & fitness, self help, autobiographies and biographies, spiritual, fiction (Hindi and English), inspirational and others.

19-07-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s underpasses flooded, traffic movement disrupted||Four underpasses in the city, one each at Hero Honda Chowk and Iffco Chowk and two at Rajiv Chowk, were shut to traffic due to severe water logging following heavy rain on Monday that left the traffic flow across the city in a complete disarray. The underpasses at Iffco Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk and the bidirectional one at Rajiv Chowk were opened by evening, according to the district administration.Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said over 1,100 traffic police officials were deployed across the city from 5am. According to the police, a total of 4,500 personnel were deployed on city roads. A release issued by the district administration on Monday stated that 13 earthmovers were dispatched to various locations to deal with snarls.Despite the arrangements, the severity of water logging was such that traffic movement was disrupted on arterial roads due to the limited space available for vehicles on main carriageways, what with rainwater occupying most of the road space and pedestrians weaving between vehicles in an effort to stay clear of the waist-deep water on service roads.Throughout the day, Gurugram traffic police issued alerts social media, cautioning commuters to avoid severely waterlogged stretches in Suncity Township, Iffco Chowk, Naharpur, Hero Honda Chowk, Medanta underpass, Signature Towers, Iffco Chowk underpass, Galleria Market road, Kanhai Chowk, Wazirabad Chowk, Huda City Centre, Sector 4/7/9 Chowk, Himgiri Chowk, areas near the Mini Secretariat, Basai Road, Sheetla Mata Road, Bilaspur Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Narsinghpur and MDI Chowk.The worst-affected traffic stretches were Sohna Road, Sheetla Mata Road, Basai Road, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, Hero Honda Chowk, and Rajiv Chowk, where rainwater accumulation led to snarls, confusion and vehicle breakdowns.At the Iffco Chowk and the Rajiv Chowk underpasses, traffic police officials barricaded the entry points around 9am, while at the Hero Honda Chowk underpass, they stacked sandbags to prevent commuters from entering the underpass as all four structures were heavily inundated.Using motor pumps and suctions tankers, rainwater was cleared from the bidirectional underpass at Rajiv Chowk, Iffco Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk by evening and opened to traffic, said a release from the district administration.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the unidirectional underpass at Rajiv Chowk has higher rainwater accumulation than the other three and they are expecting to reopen the road around midnight.“Except for the Medanta underpass, all three underpasses have been opened. Dewatering operations at the Medanta underpass are ongoing and we are expecting to open it around midnight. All motor pumps at the four underpasses were operational. However, the intensity of the rain was higher than its outlet capacity, due to which there was heavy rainwater accumulation,” said Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI.With the Medanta underpass closed, and the CH Bakhtawar Singh Road and Rajiv Chowk flooded, vehicles could be seen travelling in all directions on each of the two carriageways of the CH Bakhtawar Singh Road and highway.On Sohna Road, most of the road space remained unusable due to the ongoing elevated corridor project. There was waist-deep rainwater on the stretch at places that not only rendered the city’s second most congested stretch unusable.As a result, traffic flow on the entire Sohna Road, from Vatika Chowk to Rajiv Chowk, was affected, which subsequently led to congestion on the stretches leading towards Bakhtawar Chowk.“From my balcony, I could see the entire Sohna Road under water, several broken down vehicles being pushed by drivers towards higher ground and traffic moving at a snail’s pace. Rainwater from Sohna Road also flooded my society roads and the service lanes outside. Due to a family emergency, I left my house and it took me nearly 45 minutes to reach the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway,” said Saurabh Kumar, a resident of Sector 47.Tomar said by 3pm, traffic flow started normalising on most roads.“By 3pm, traffic started returning to normalcy, barring three major stretches. On Sohna Road and Basai Road, there was heavy police deployment that ensured traffic congestion was not severe for more than two hours. However, on Sheetla Mata Road, the water logging was far too severe, due to which traffic movement was affected till late evening,” said Tomar, adding that the traffic police have written to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) regarding severe waterlogging on Sheetla Mata Road, requesting for more motor pumps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-underpasses-flooded-traffic-movement-disrupted-101626717634650.html
19-07-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram gets 39% of total rainfall in 33 hours, surplus by 88mm||Over the past two days, Gurugram received 185mm of rain, which is about 39% of the total average rainfall of 472mm that it receives each monsoon, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The rainfall over the past two days has been so heavy that the city is already rain surplus (as on July 19), even though monsoon reached Gurugram only last Monday, after a delay of 16 days.According to a bulletin issued by IMD Chandigarh on Monday evening, Gurugram (city) received 185mm of rain between 8.30am on Sunday and 5.30pm on Monday.Although the exact figures on the rainfall from late Sunday to Monday morning are not available, IMD officials said judging by the intensity, the downpour on Monday could be the highest daily rain recorded during monsoon in the city. An official with IMD Chandigarh said the weather department started maintaining records for Gurugram only from this year. “From Sunday 8.30am till Monday 8.30am, Gurugram received 145mm of rainfall and from Monday 8.30am till 5:30pm, the city received a further 40mm of rainfall. This is most likely the highest daily rainfall received by Gurugram during the monsoon,” the official with IMD Chandigarh, cited above, said on condition of anonymity. The official said Gurugram, at present, has received 88mm of surplus rainfall as compared to the seasonal average, from June 1 till present, which is 243mm. The average rainfall for the whole monsoon season (June to September) for Gurugram is 472mm, according to IMD Chandigarh. With 185mm, Gurugram on Monday achieved 39% of the season’s total rainfall, the official explained. Prior to the rainfall over the past two days, the city received 160mm of rainfall on August 20 last year and 100mm of rainfall on September 9, according to the End of Monsoon Season reports of the IMD. In August 2020, in around six hours of rain, widespread flooding of arterial roads and underpasses was reported in Gurugram. Three underpasses on the Golf Course Road at DLF Phase 1, Genpact Chowk, and Bristol Chowk, two in Cyber City next to Shankar Chowk and Cyberhub, two on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway at Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk were flooded and shut for traffic. In July 2019, the city received 80mm of rainfall, according to the End of Monsoon Season reports of IMD. Meanwhile, the meteorological centre in Chandigarh on Monday afternoon issued an orange alert for Gurugram for Tuesday, predicting, “heavy to very heavy rain with thunderstorms/lightning at isolated places.” As part of the orange alert, officials said there might be widespread water logging in low-lying areas, short-term disruptions of water and electricity connections, traffic congestion, low visibility and slippery roads. With continuous rain, temperatures in the city dropped on Monday, with a maximum temperature of 26.7 degrees Celsius (°C), which was eight degrees below the normal, and a minimum temperature of 23.2°C, which was three degrees above normal. According to the weekly forecast of the IMD, the temperature in the city is likely to reduce over the next three days owing to the rain. The maximum temperature is expected to remain at 32-33°C, and the minimum temperature is likely to remain at 23-25°C. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “As the Delhi-NCR has received heavy rain today (Monday), the intensity of rain is likely to reduce over the next few days. On Tuesday, the region is likely to receive light to moderate rain but after that, it will reduce gradually.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-gets-39-of-total-rainfall-in-33-hours-surplus-by-88mm-101626717633366.html
19-07-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram building collapse: Three dead, one severely injured||After a three-storey building collapsed on Sunday evening in Khawaspur village of Farrukhnagar, leaving three people dead and one severely injured, police on Monday detained the manager of the company that owned the building and its premises.Police said the structure was owned by Deluxe Cargo Logistics and served as a residence for its employees. It is located on the Pataudi-Farrukhnagar road, around 2.5km from the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway.The police said there were fewer residents than usual in the building as it was a Sunday. The unharmed residents are in a state of shock and they were shifted to different premises on Monday.The police said the debris was cleared after a 19-hour rescue operation but the reason for the collapse is still unclear. The three people who died were identified as Robin (34) (single name), Pradeep Sharma (39) and Tiny Bhardwaj (24). A fourth resident, Pradeep Choudhary (36), was rescued on Sunday evening with severe injuries.Based on a complaint from an employee of Deluxe Cargo Logistics, a case was registered against the company owner, Ravinder Kataria, and manager, Krishan Kaushik, under sections 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 34 (common intention) and 304 (II) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that carries a maximum punishment of 10 years at Farrukhnagar police station on Monday.The police said that Kataria is allegedly on the run and his mobile phones have been switched off since Sunday night. Teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams, civil defence, police and fire brigade carried out rescue operations even as incessant rain delayed work on Monday morning, officials said.Shri Niwas, an assistant commandant of NDRF, said so far, there is no report on the cause of the collapse but the building had required repair. “Our two teams, comprising 60 personnel, reached the site on Sunday night and the operations got over by 3pm on Monday. We faced challenges due to weather conditions and there was also no building plan, which further delayed our operations. Our canine squad played an important role in identifying the location where people were trapped under debris,” he said.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said they have formed a team to probe the collapse. He said NDRF and SDRF were contacted as soon as he received information of the collapse, around 7.30pm on Sunday. “Initially, we feared that over 20 persons were trapped under the debris, but preliminary reports and locals revealed that there are only four persons. Two others managed to escape before the building collapsed,” he said.Garg also already directed the Pataudi subdivisional magistrate to conduct a probe into the case. Vijay Kumar (35), a resident of Bhiwani, who has been working with Cargo Deluxe for the past year and is the complainant in the case, said the building was not in a good condition and they had already informed the manager and owner about this. “Around 7pm, my colleague and I were sleeping when we heard loud cracking sounds. We rushed out without a second thought and as soon as we stepped out, the building collapsed in front of our eyes,” Kumar said.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said they have recorded statements of the employees who resided in the building and strict action will be taken against those responsible. “Our teams reached the spot within 10 minutes of receiving the call and coordinated with other agencies. The area has been cordoned off,” he said.The police said the company owner, Ravinder Kataria, is a former chairman of the Nagar Parishad, Gurugram. Officials of the Deluxe Cargo Logistics did not respond to requests for comment.RS Bhath, the district town planner of the enforcement wing, said the department will look into the legality of this building and whether permission was taken to construct it. “The DTCP team remained on the spot during the entire rescue operation and supported the police and other agencies. A probe to identify the reasons behind the collapse would be conducted by the district administration, while we will look into the legality of the structure. As the building was old, there could be several reasons (for the collapse),” said Bhath.Niwas said they used live detector types 1 and 2, cutting tools and lifting bags in the rescue operation. “Bhardwaj’s body was retrieved from the staircase and it seemed that he tried to run from the first floor to the roof when the building collapsed on him,” he said.Dr Deepak Mathur, the forensic expert who conducted the autopsies, said that the trio died of excessive bleeding. “There were severe head injuries; multiple fractures all over the body,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-building-collapse-three-dead-one-severely-injured-101626717632382.html
19-07-2021||Other||Building collapse: ‘When I turned back, I saw the building breaking into pieces’||Six persons were inside a three-storey building in Khawaspur village on Sunday night, when one of them felt a mild tremor and a sound from the walls. He immediately raised the alarm and rain out to alert other colleagues; however, only two of them made it out safely.Twenty-six-year-old Vijay Sharma, of Bhiwani, who alerted the people inside, said that seconds after they stepped out, the building came down in a heap, trapping the four others inside.Sharma said that he woke up around 6.30pm as he suddenly felt tremors, following which he ran out of his room and raised the alarm. “I suddenly realised that the building was on the verge of collapsing and my colleague and I rushed out,” he said Before leaving, he knocked on the door of another colleague but he was fast asleep, he said. The six people worked the night shift and woke up around 7pm every day, Sharma, who is a shift in-charge, said. Sharma and Ajay Kumar Mishra (38) ran towards the exit and as soon as they stepped out, they saw the building come down in a heap. “When I turned back, I saw the building breaking into pieces,” he said. Sharma said the company had bought the warehouse around 18 months ago and had shifted their base here. The warehouse and the three-storey building were in the same compound and barely at a distance of 10 metres. “The employees of another company also slept in the same building. There were multiple issues here and substandard material was used in construction. There were incidents of plaster falling off many times and we had complained to the owner and manager several times, but they did not pay heed,” he said. Mishra, a native of Madhubani in Bihar, who has been employed with the company as a shift in-charge for the past six years, said that he was sleeping when the walls started cracking. There were four rooms on the first floor, of which three were occupied. One of the workers, Robin, was on the ground floor and we could not inform him. Sharma saved my life and I am indebted to him for risking his life while raising the alarm,” he said. Both Sharma and Mishra, who have been married for five years and have two children each, said they wanted to return to their families now. Sharma said that, however, they regret that they couldn’t do more to save the others. “I rushed to the security guard and informed the police control room and Farrukhnagar police station. A PCR reached within minutes followed by several teams. We were in our night suits and could not even pick up our belongings,” he said. The employees said they had no other place to sleep and were still waiting for their employer to check on them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/building-collapse-when-i-turned-back-i-saw-the-building-breaking-into-pieces-101626717630857.html
19-07-2021||Gurugram||Basements flooded, entry cut off in low-lying areas||Following heavy rains on Monday, residences in low-lying areas were inundated with rainwater, as basements flooded, while many societies were cut off from the main roads in DLF Phases 1-3, Malibu Towne, Essel Towers, Sector 47, Sector 37 and Suncity township.Residents said that the severity of waterlogging was such that arterial roads in the colonies accumulated rainwater up to the waist level.In DLF Phase 3, some residents had to leave their homes and take shelter in their neighbour’s homes.“Our entire drawing-room was filled with rainwater and water started seeping into our rooms as well. There is little else we could do and had to temporarily seek shelter at my neighbour’s house, located on the floor above. I finally returned home after seven hours, and practically everything in the house was drenched,” said Rahul Sharma, a resident of DLF Phase 3.In societies of Suncity on Golf Course Road and Essel Towers on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road, waterlogging was so severe that the entrances to their township and condominium were rendered inaccessible, forcing residents to stay indoors.“The entrance to the condominium was completely filled with rainwater. As it is the main entry and exit point, I waited for officials to clear the rainwater with motor pumps and finally, ventured outdoors in the afternoon,” said Tina Khanna, a resident of Essel Towers.Basement parking lots in sectors 37 and 47 were also underwater.“The entire colony road was flooded and the rainwater also seeped into the basement parking. My car was filled with rainwater and its battery has stopped working. I have no choice but to call a mechanic on Tuesday. Without any transport, I could not even procure daily food items and am relying on food deliveries,” said Anand Rungta, a resident of Sector 47.Dhruv Bansal, the spokesperson for Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of all RWAs in the city, said that the problem, especially with townships, such as Malibu Towne, DLF Phases 1 and 3, Suncity, is that the existing drains are outdated.“Drains were set up according to the occupancy in the 1990s and 2000s. The occupancy in these townships has nearly doubled or tripled. The existing drains, hence, cannot meet with the expansion and are severely outdated. As a collective group of RWAs, we will take up the matter with the MCG for redressal,” said Bansal.The office of the department of town and country planning (DTCP) in Sector 14 was also left in knee-deep water following the rain. In videos uploaded to social media platforms, DTCP officials could be seen carrying files amid knee-deep water to another location.Despite repeated calls, RS Batth, district town planner (DTP), could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/basements-flooded-entry-cut-off-in-low-lying-areas-101626717629739.html
19-07-2021||Gurugram||Heavy rain washes away Gurugram’s monsoon preparedness claims||Around 40mm of rain, from 8am to 5pm on Monday, left the city waterlogged to such an extent that four underpasses were shut, arterial roads rendered unusable, several residences and offices flooded, and traffic flow majorly disrupted.This was only the second heavy spell of rain this monsoon in the city and it has already exposed the chinks in the monsoon preparedness measures, and washed away claims of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) that steps were in place to prevent waterlogging.The city received 185mm of rainfall from 8.30am on Sunday to 5.30pm on Monday, according to the meteorological department.In several residential colonies, neighbours were cut off from one another, while on major roads, at Subhash Chowk and Rajiv Chowk especially, pedestrians held hands to navigate the waist-deep rainwater. Many parents were also spotted carrying children on their shoulders to school.Residents took to social media to highlight the water logging, with a post comparing Sohna Road — the city’s second most congested stretch after Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway — to a swimming pool. That post was widely shared by evening. In Malibu Towne, Suncity and condominiums on MG Road, in DLF Phases 1 and 3, as well as the government office of the department of town and country planning (DTCP) in Sector 14, flooding at the main entry and exit points trapped people on the premises.The rain started around 2.30am on Monday and continued with varying intensities till 5pm. By 7am, the district administration officials shared alerts on social media groups cautioning citizens that the city’s main stormwater drain, the Badshahpur drain, which carries nearly 70% of Gurugram’s rainwater, was up to its brim.“Badshahpur drain (running) at full capacity. Till its level comes down there will be waterlogging as it is the (main) source for drainage of water. Let’s hope rain intensity weakens or stops,” the alert shared by deputy commissioner Yash Garg said.With Badshahpur drain overflowing by 9.30am, most city roads were inundated and Gurugram traffic police officials issued regular updates on social media to caution road users. The inundated stretches included Suncity Township, Iffco Chowk, Naharpur, Hero Honda Chowk, Medanta underpass, Signature Towers, Iffco Chowk underpass, Galleria Market road, Kanhai Chowk, Wazirabad Chowk, Huda City Centre, Sector 4/7/9 Chowk, Himgiri Chowk, near the Mini Secretariat and Basai Road.By the afternoon, Sheetla Mata Road, Bilaspur Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Narsinghpur and MDI Chowk were also added to the list. Meanwhile, a portion of the roof of Ambience Mall near the Sirhaul toll collapsed and a part of an arterial road in Sector 65 also caved in.According to a release issued by the district administration on Monday evening, 113 pump sets, 32 tankers, and 14 earthmovers were deployed at 113 critical water logging points in the city and over 127 complaints were received from residents at the administration’s control room.Garg, in a release, said of the 113 critical places identified by the administration, Hero Honda Chowk, sectors 4, 7, 9, 9A, 10, 10A and 15, and Palam Vihar were the worst affected as they are located on an incline. The release said rainwater is being pumped out from these areas.At the two underpasses at Iffco Chowk and one at Rajiv Chowk, traffic police barricaded the entry points to keep motorists away, while at the Hero Honda Chowk underpass, they stacked sandbags to prevent commuters from entering, as all four were severely inundated.In the aftermath of a 196mm spell of rainfall on August 19 and 20 last year — which left seven underpasses, major roads and low-lying houses flooded — the MCG and GMDA jointly prepared a drainage plan for the city, to ensure that the situation does not repeat.After visiting several major waterlogging points, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja on June 24 said that the city is prepared for the upcoming monsoon.“The main reason behind the city’s waterlogging was due to the overflowing of the Badshahpur drain. With the drain running at full capacity for most of the day, there was no outlet for rainwater to recede. Hence, areas across the city were flooded,” said TL Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.Sharma said rainwater travels from east to west in Gurugram, with areas in the east, such as Ghata, Golf Course Road, located on the upstream and areas such as sectors 4, 7, 9 and 10, Laxman Vihar and Sheetla Mata Road located in the downstream.“More than 60% of upstream areas were cleared of rainwater by 6pm. In the downstream, we are anticipating that water will be cleared by midnight, provided there is no more rain. We are deploying extra motor pumps at all the affected areas and dewatering work is ongoing,” said Sharma.A ward-wise report was also sought from all MCG executive engineers, seeking explanations for water logging, the shortfall in measures and a list of motor pumps available with them, Sharma said.Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA, also said Badshahpur drain being at capacity was one of the main reasons behind Monday’s water logging. “The Badshahpur drain was overflowing since early morning, there was no outlet for rainwater to recede. Along with high rainfall, this led to severe water logging across the city. Our teams have been working since 7am and operations are still ongoing. By 8pm, except for Laxman Vihar/sector 4 area and a 200-metre portion of Sheetla Mata Road, rainwater was cleared from all major roads,” said Kumar.GMDA officials said that a Covid-19 care facility at Tau Devi Lal Stadium was also inundated with rainwater. In May, the facility was filled with rainwater following spells of rain, just days after it was inaugurated by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/heavy-rain-washes-away-gurugram-s-monsoon-preparedness-claims-101626717569921.html

The wholesale market on Sunday saw the arrival of 12 trucks, each carrying 120 tonnes of sweet potato, used by a large number of people on Ekadashi. Since the demand is high, prices of sweet potato went up from ₹25 per kg to ₹50 per kg on Monday. “The produce from the Karmala area (Solapur) fetched ₹300 per 10 kg in the wholesale market, while for retail, the price is ₹50 per kg. The sweet potatoes from this area are small in size and sweet in taste, hence, in great demand,” said Shrirang Choudhary, sweet potato farmer. According to Amol Ghule, vice-president of the Adate Association, along with sweet potatoes, potatoes and chillies are also selling well, at ₹12 to ₹14 per kg, wholesale. Shirin Patil, a housewife from Aundh said, “Sweet potatoes are being sold at ₹50 per kg, but they are very good to eat, not just as a fasting food, but there are many health benefits to eating it.” Ghule said, “Last year, due to lockdown, the market had not seen such a surplus produce or sale like this year. We have most of the sweet potatoes coming in from Undargaon, Manjargaon and some other villages in Karmala district, Solapur. The farmers are very happy to see the sweet potatoes get a good price, unlike sales that fell sharply due to corona. This year, however, there seems to be a demand.” On the other hand, prices of lady-finger (okra) and cauliflower fell sharply from ₹60 per kg to ₹40 per kg in the retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ashadhi-ekadashi-demand-sees-sweet-potato-prices-double-101626715530560.html

It is expected that the general body would approve at the next meeting. After that, execution will start on the ground.”To generate more revenue, PMC had decided to rent out flats owned by the civic body. PMC used to get various flats under various reservations and schemes. Usually PMC uses these flats for the rehabilitation of citizens affected by various circumstances.As many flats are given on rent to such people, the PMC scheme hopes to sell these flats to the tenants.PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane framed this scheme to increase revenue. “The rent amount is very nominal. There are very few chances that the PMC would be able to vacate these flats. Considering that, it would be better to sell them to the tenants. It would help to increase revenue for the PMC,” Rasane had said earlier.Opposition parties opposed the scheme as they claim that it is not wrong to give ownership of the flats to the tenants.

PMC currently pays ₹ 70 crore to Khadakvasla division for raw water.Normally, the state increases water charges once in three years. However, the order has not yet been issued. Manisha Shekatkar, superintendent engineer of the water supply department, said, “ At present, PMC pays ₹ 3 for 10,000 litres of raw water. The yearly amount goes to ₹ 70 crore. It would not affect to common public as PMC has already increased water taxes under the 24X7 regular and equitable water project.”She further said,” Earlier, the water resources department was increasing rates after every three years. But now, the department has decided to increase rates every year.”A senior official of the Khadakvasla irrigation department said,”The water resources department has limited resources with only one source of water charges. Over the last few years, we are facing revenue problems. Most projects are incomplete as we don’t have enough money. This year, the finance department has asked the water resources department to accommodate financial allocations for projects that have to be taken up in the next financial year, with a higher priority to those where around 80 per cent work has already been done.”PMC is demanding 18.50 TMC of water now. However, the Irrigation department has not approved this water quota for the city. They are still supplying only 11.50 TMC water as per an agreement signed in 2001.Pune draws water from the following sources: Khadakwasla dam, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar .The total ‘live’ storage of the all the four dams is currently 29.05 TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khadakwasla-to-charge-pmc-15-more-per-litre-for-water-101626715528754.html

Teachers, however, claimed that the student strength is improving.As per officials of the education department, the attendance on the first day (on July 16) in government schools was below 20% but now it’s improving in Karnal and Ambala.“On Monday, the attendance in government schools reached around 40%. In private schools, 65% of the 50% students allowed to attend classes reached schools,” said Karnal district education officer Rajpal.“The attendance is improving and students - especially those studying in board classes – are showing interest and their attendance (of the 50% allowed) remains around 70-80% in our school,” said Sheetal Sharma, teacher at a government senior secondary school in Yamunanagar.Total 1.05 lakh Class 9-12 students studying in 5,293 private schools of 1.62 lakh attended classes in Haryana by following Covid-19 guidelines on Saturday.As many as 2.06 lakh students of total 5.76 lakh studying in 3,369 government schools visited the school on Saturday, with 72% attendance.The official said 96 students were not allowed to enter the schools on Monday as their body temperature was not normal.School authorities have made consent letter from parents mandatory for attending classes but the poor response may create problem as the government is also planning to resume classes for students of Class 6 to 8 from July 23.The Ambala education department said at least 150 government and private schools have reopened for students but the kids are still confused on government protocol.Some parents were reluctant to send their children to schools as they fear that the third wave of Covid may hit in the next few months.“It is worrisome to send children to schools as there were reports that the third wave may target kids and vaccination of kids has not started yet. So, I am not sending my daughter to school even as she is in Class 12,” said Mamta Rani, of Chalaundi village in Kurukshetra.Shalini Kakkar, parent of a Class 12 girl, said she’ll think of sending her ward to school only after her daughter gets vaccinated.Ram Chander, of Rohtak, said he is sending his son to school since Friday after the government opened schools after three months.Ankit Kumar, a Class 11 student from Charkhi Dadri, said he joined school on Saturday and all students are taking precautionary measures during classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/attendance-improves-in-haryana-schools-response-remains-low-at-govt-institutions-101626713849753.html

In his letter to the Union minister, Soren underlined that his government was legislating law to provide 75% reservation to locals in the private sector, and the Union goverment should also promote giving jobs to locals at the said institute. “We have introduced the Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2021, wherein there is a 75% reservation in private sector jobs with salary of up to ₹30,000. Unfortunately, it has come to my attention that 90% of the security personnel at AIIMS-Deoghar are from outside the state of Jharkhand. This is not conducive to the public good. AIIMS Deoghar should be hiring locally as far as possible so that they get employees, who better understand the community they serve. In this way AIIMS-Deoghar would also contribute to the economic upliftment of the region,” Soren’s letter reads. The new campus of the state’s first AIIMS, that is coming up in Devipur area in temple town Deoghar, is yet to be inaugurated. The premier health institution in tribal-dominated Santhal Parganas division has, however, started its outpatient department (OPD) in a temporary building. The OPD building at the new campus was to be inaugurated earlier this month, but was postponed after controversy started over physical presence of local BJP MP Nishikant Dubey at the inauguration event due to Covid-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/hire-locals-at-deoghar-aiims-j-khand-cm-to-union-health-minister-101626711928404.html

The two legislators have been camping in the national capital for the past few days, meeting senior Congress leaders, Jharkhand Congress in-charge RPN Singh. The two leaders rushed to Delhi after the state Congress leadership told them it was prerogative of the Speaker to conduct hearing in a matter related to anti-defection law.“We discussed the issue of our membership with him, besides measures to strengthen the party organization in the state. Going by the approach of the central leaders, we are hopeful our case will be settled at the earliest,” Tirkey said on phone from New Delhi.Five-term legislator Pradeep Yadav and three-term legislator Bandhu Tirkey had joined the Congress after spilt in the JVM (P) as its president Babulal Marandi declared to have merged the party with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) within months after the assembly elections in December 2019. The BJP made Marandi its legislature party leader.While the election commission recognized the JVM(P)’s merger with the BJP, separate complaints were filed with the assembly speaker Rabindranath Mahto, seeking disqualification of Marandi as well as the two legislators who joined the Congress under the anti-defection law.The matter is being heard ever since by Speaker Mahto, who is from the senior ally JMM in the three-party coalition government. Marandi, Yadav and Tirkey are still treated as JVM(P) legislators in the assembly proceedings, including sitting arrangement. Citing the example from the previous government, a Congress leader said the then Speaker Dinesh Oraon had approved BJP membership for six JVM(P) legislators who broke away from the party and joined the BJP after the 2014 assembly polls. While raising the issue last week before the state leadership, Tirkey had also suggested that if the Speaker was taking time in deciding on the issue, they are willing to resign and contest again if the Congress leadership could assure them of party tickets.Congress runs signature campaign against fuel price rise at petrol pumpsContinuing its protests against spiraling prices of petrol and diesel, Congress workers led by state president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon on Monday conducted signature campaigns at the petrol pumps across the state. The Congress workers got signatures of people turning up at the petrol pumps to buy fuel, seeking their opinion over the issue.Oraon said BJP was drunk on power and hence it was least concerned with the sufferings of the common man.“They are drunk on power but people are not going to spare them. Since 1947, all decisions taken by the Congress was for the betterment of people. But this government is least concerned about people’s sufferings and not taking any corrective measures to check the rise of petrol and diesel prices. Sensing people’s anger, BJP has changed the petroleum minister,” said Oraon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/pradeep-bandhu-meet-cong-leaders-in-delhi-over-party-membership-status-101626711868992.html

Presenting the arrested accused, identified as Nirbhay Yadav and Pankaj Kumar, before media persons, East Champaran’s superintendent of police Navin Chand Jha said the duo had cheated over 5,000 women in five districts of East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi and Sheohar.“They would induce women with a promise of unrealistically high returns on their investments as well as a fixed monthly income of ₹ 2,500 and tricked them into taking loans from the finance companies,” Jha said, adding the scheme was being run for past three years. Police said Nirbhay Yadav and his associates used to run Mother Future Charitable Trust and Mother Future Finance Company, which had offices in the five districts. They would form a group of 20 women and helped each of them in getting the loan of ₹ 22,500 from a micro finance company. “The two then deposited the loan amount in the account of their own companies, promising to give each woman ₹2,500 per month for two years. In the meantime, they shut their offices and fled,” said a police officer. A press release issued by East Champaran police put the swindled amount at over ₹100 crore. According to police, a case was lodged in Madhuban on July 14, 2021, against four accused, identified as Nirbhay Yadav, Meena Devi, Raushan Kumar and Deepak Kumar (all residents of villages under Madhuban police station) on the basis of the statement of one Kaushila Devi, a resident of Khairwa village under Madhuban police station. “During preliminary investigations, we came to know they cheated ₹22,500 from over 5,000 women who either took the loan from Bharat micro finance company or invested their own money in various schemes of the company. To win confidence, the accused ensured lucrative returns for some of the women,” said the SP.

For millers, the limit will be the six months' production or 50 per cent of annual installed capacity, whichever is higher.For retailers, the stock limit will remain unchanged same at five tonnes."This relaxation for millers will have a down-streaming effect in terms of giving an assurance to farmers at this critical juncture of kharif sowing of tur and urad," the statement said.Importers, millers, retailers and wholesalers should continue to declare their stocks on the portal fcainfoweb.nic.In case the stocks held by them are higher than the prescribed limits, they should bring it to the prescribed stock limits within 30 days of issue of this notification dated July 19.The decision by the government was taken after a meeting with stakeholders on July 17.

Manjunath, who joined the force in 1993, showed no apprehension about sitting next to 15-year-old students and writing his paper."Back then, you could join the police even if you were educated only till fourth standard. However, in 1996, the department made the 10th standard a basic qualification (for promotion). Therefore, I'm happy that for the remainder of my service, I'll be eligible for promotion as a head constable," he said.Manjunath, who gave his exam at the Kolar Junior College examination centre, described his experience with a quirky smile. "Many eyebrows were raised when I entered the centre with a hall ticket in my hand and in my name. They were surprised even more when I entered the hall and sat on the seat assigned against the number on my hall ticket. The invigilator was more surprised than anyone else as he himself was younger than me," the examinee, who has a wife, children and grandchildren, said."They all encouraged me to write this examination. It is not just for my promotion but also for my own satisfaction of completing at least SSLC in academics," Manjunath said, thanking his family.Besides Manjunath, two other "unusual" candidates wrote their papers on day 1 of the two-day SSLC exams, which are being held despite concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.

19-07-2021||Pune||Bombay HC stays MCOCA investigation against gangster Sachin Pote, two others||Pune: The Bombay High Court (HC) has stayed the Pune police investigation into the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) case filed against gangster Sachin Pote. The court order came after Pote filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court, seeking quashing of the case lodged against him at Mundhwa police station in February 2021. Besides Pote, co-accused in the case, Ajay Shinde and Vishal Shelkar, have also petitioned the Bombay HC on similar grounds. Justices NJ Jamadar and SS Shinde in their order stated, “The investigation in the CRN 79 of 2021 registered with Mundhwa police station, Pune, is hereby stayed, till the next date. Issue fresh notice to Vishal Satish Modi – the first informant in the respective petitions and application, returnable on September 9, 2021.The petitioners and the applicant are at liberty to serve the first informant, Vishal Satish Modi, by private service and file affidavit of service.” The order further stated, “These connected petitions and the application arise out of peculiar facts. The incident in question, in respect of which, the first informant, Vishal Satish Modi, has lodged the report, allegedly occurred on the night intervening the 15th and 16th of June 2018. Evidently, the FIR has been lodged on the 4th of March 2021. There is a delay of more than 30 months.” “What accentuates the situation is the fact that in respect of the very same occurrence, initially, Nilesh Chavan, who was allegedly fired at, had reported the matter to the police on the 16th June 2018 to the effect that there was an incident of altercation and fisticuffs and the police had recorded a non-cognisable case,” the order read. “From a perusal of the FIR in question, it becomes evident that the incident allegedly occurred at the very same time and place. The FIR is not lodged by the person who was allegedly fired at. Nor is it the case that the police obtained the permission of the magistrate to investigate into a non-cognizable case which was registered on June 18, 2018. The situation which thus obtains is that not only is there a legal impediment for investigation into the said occurrence but there is an inordinate delay in lodging the FIR, in respect of the very same occurrence, by a person, who claims to be the partner of the hotel, where the incident occurred,” the order further said. The court will hear the petitions and applications on September 9 this year. Pote, through his lawyers - advocate Abad Ponda and advocate SM Nimbalkar, had filed a writ petition for quashing FIR number 79/2021 registered against him with Mundhwa police station, Pune, for offences punishable under sections 307, 392, 427, 323, 504, 143, 147, 148 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code; 1860 (Penal Code); sections 3 and 27 of the Indian Arms Act, 1878; and section 37(1)(3) read along with 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, and the order whereby the approval under section 23(1)(a) of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA Act) has been granted by the additional commissioner (crime), Pune. In the writ petition number 1641 of 2021, vide an order dated the 3rd of April 2021, the Bombay High court granted ad-interim relief in that no coercive action will be taken against Pote till the next date, on the condition that he extends full cooperation to the investigation which was directed to continue. The court order came after Pote filed a criminal writ petition in the high court, alleging that the Pune police had lodged a NC against him in June 2018 that was converted into a FIR, two years later. Meanwhile, assistant public prosecutor JP Yagnik submitted that the report lodged by the first informant, Vishal Satish Modi, clearly reveals a cognizable offence and with regard to the antecedents of the petitioner and members of the organised crime syndicate - which the petitioners and the co-accused allegedly formed - the invocation of the provisions of the MCOCA Act could not be faulted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bombay-hc-stays-mcoca-investigation-against-gangster-sachin-pote-two-others-101626710008169.html
19-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal minister repeats TMC’s promise to welcome Tatas but not in Singur||West Bengal industry minister Partha Chatterjee has reiterated that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government is ready to welcome the Tata Group to the state although the company was forced to shift its small car project to Sanand in Gujarat during the Left Front rule because of an anti-land acquisition movement at Singur by Mamata Banerjee who was then the face of the opposition. Chatterjee, the industry and information technology minister of the third TMC government, told news agency PTI during an interview that talks are on with the Tatas for big investments in the state. However, he clarified that agricultural land at Singur in Hooghly district will not be used for setting up engineering industries. “Why would the Tatas want to return to Singur? The land has already been given back to farmers. We are planning to come up with agro-based industries there as the area’s economy is based on agriculture,” said Chatterjee, referring to the farmland acquired by the Left Front. After coming to power in 2011, the TMC said that it was open to the idea of setting up industries in Singur but not without securing the interest of farmers. On June 14 that year, the assembly passed the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Bill 2011. Last month, Banerjee tweeted, “On this day, ten years back, the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Bill 2011 was passed in the WB assembly after a long & difficult struggle. We unitedly fought for the rights of our farmers & addressed their grievances, bringing in positive change in their lives.”Stating that employment generation is a priority for the TMC government, Chatterjee said the state is ready to offer incentives to companies if they create jobs. He said the government wants prominent industrial houses to set up two large manufacturing units. “We never had any enmity with the Tatas, neither did we fight against them. They are one of the most respected and biggest business houses of this country and also abroad. You can’t blame the Tatas (for the Singur fiasco),” Chatterjee told PTI.“The problem was with the Left Front government and its forcible land acquisition policy. Tata group is always most welcome to come and invest in Bengal,” said Chatterjee, who is also the TMC secretary-general.Chatterjee said the conglomerate has shown interest in setting up another Tata Centre in Kolkata to house its offices.“We already have the presence of Tata Metaliks, one Tata Centre and the TCS. But if they are willing to come up with big-ticket investments in manufacturing or other sectors, there is no problem. Our IT secretary recently told me they had shown interest in setting up a Tata Centre here,” said Chatterjee.Asked whether the state government will walk the extra mile to reach out to the Tatas, Chatterjee said he is already in touch with group officials to attract investment.Known for multi-crop farming, Singur made headlines after Tata Motors set its sight on the land in 2006 to build its cheapest car, the Nano. The Left Front government acquired 997.11 acres along the National Highway 2 and handed it over to the company. Former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee offered several incentives to the company as he wanted to create a hub of ancillary industries at Singur. Banerjee called a 26-day hunger strike demanding the return of 347 acres of farmland that was “forcibly” acquired.Following a two-year agitation by Banerjee and several litigations, the Tatas moved out in October 2008. The acquired land was subsequently returned to farmers in 2016.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-minister-repeats-tmc-s-promise-to-welcome-tatas-but-not-in-singur-101626709530475.html

No one can tolerate this fascist approach,” Majithia said, claiming that the AAP government had earlier demolished a century-old ‘Piao Sahib’ at Sheeshganj gurdwara in Delhi. Demanding that the church be reconstructed on the same spot at the earliest, Majithia said AAP was not only guilty of persecuting minorities but also involved in a sordid cover-up exercise. “The truth is that the church was demolished on the orders of the AAP government, without giving any notice,” Majithia alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/church-demolition-reflects-aap-s-anti-minority-bias-sad-101626709408794.html

Earlier in the day, an adjournment motion moved by SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, seeking discussion on the laws, was rejected by the Lok Sabha speaker. On Sunday, Harsimrat had called for all opposition political parties to support the motion for the cause of peasantry. On coming out of Parliament in protest, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal condemned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for turning down the motion, demanding repeal of the three farm laws in keeping with the sentiments of the farming community of the country. Sukhbir was joined by Harsimrat, along with the MPs of BSP, including party’s national general secretary Satish Mishra. They asserted the SAD-BSP alliance would continue to protest till the three farm laws were repealed.“The issues raised by the farmers be discussed in Parliament and accepted by the union government,” said Sukhbir, talking to reporters outside Parliament. He added, “Over 500 farmers have been martyred. It is unfortunate that obituaries were not paid to the farmers in Parliament.” Sukhbir claimed that instead of listening to farmers, the Centre had tried to defame and repress the peaceful movement. “Even now no attempt is being made to talk to farmers and resolve their grievances. Such an attitude does not hold well for a democracy,” he said. According to Sukhbir, the new farm laws were a brazen violation of the spirit of federalism as envisaged in the Constitution, because farmers feel that the laws were designed to pave the way for corporate takeover of agriculture.

The central jails released 1,122 people on bail and 380 people on parole in 2019, which too, was a fraction of the number of people released during the Supreme Court (SC)-mandated decongestion process in 2020. The state released more than 10,000 inmates on emergency parole and temporary bail. More inmates were released this year. Still, there are many people stuck inside jails as they are unable to fulfill the criteria mentioned in their conditional bail; either they do not have the money to pay for the bail bond or do not have a guarantor who will take responsibility. There are two private organisations working with the prison department to provide corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds in such cases. While a number of methods are in place to reduce overcrowding, the dire need for more prison space and for reduction in the number of days required to conclude court cases cannot be highlighted enough. In case of Mumbai Central Jail, the lease for the land on which it is built is coming to an end in 2024. Besides, the jail records the highest rate of congestion with a population of nearly 3,000 and a capacity of only 800. Hence, Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police (ADG), prison, Maharashtra, has stated the need for a new facility for the city at the earliest. A 15-acre plot owned by the Women and Child Development Department near the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Chembur, has been identified for the purpose. On July 13, ADG Ramanand had said that the chairman of the committee is the home minister. Also, because Mumbai Central Jail has no scope for extension, the jail department has proposed five new jails in Maharashtra — Mumbai, Gondia, Hingoli, Palghar and Pune. Home minister Dilip Walse-Patil, while releasing the statistics, discussed these proposals with ADG Ramanand on Saturday. Recently, Professor Vijay Raghavan of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) was granted permission by the Bombay High Court to approach the high-powered committee (HPC) formed to provide suggestions on jail reforms. The court did so after the professor suggested strict compliance with the rules of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 with a view to decongest jails.

As the Pegasus spyware scandal unravelled within and outside Parliament, the CM said, “It is an attack on individual privacy as well and a shocking attack on India’s democratic polity by the Union government, which has compromised national security.”The CM added said that with such snooping, which could not have been undertaken by the Israeli company without the central government’s go-ahead, the NDA government had put sensitive information into the hands of global agencies, governments and organisations, with the risk that such information could be misused against the country. “This is not only an attack on individual freedom but also on the security of our nation,” he said, urging the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and take action against the NDA government. “The Central Government cannot get away with this. They have committed a sin, and they have to be made to pay for it,” said Amarinder, adding that “nobody has the right to intrude into the lives of its people, leave alone enter their bedrooms, as this government has done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/national-security-individual-freedom-attacked-amarinder-on-hacking-scandal-101626706407820.html

He underwent surgery at Sassoon General Hospital for internal bleeding caused by liver injury, according to the police. “Chauhan works as a woodcutter in a warehouse and also as a watchman. His employer owns two warehouses. While he worked in one, a man named Sunil More (55) is employed at the other one. Sometimes they used to drink together.

19-07-2021||Jaipur||BJP demands ACB probe in alleged mine allotment scam in Rajasthan||The BJP has demanded to hold an anti-corruption bureau probe (ACB) in an alleged mine allotment scam, as reported by a daily. However, the Rajasthan government has denied all the allegations. The report published by a newspaper claimed that the state mines department allegedly changed limestone mines to marble to benefit a firm, bringing a loss of ₹1,000 crore to the state. Limestone mines come under the major mineral category and can therefore be auctioned under rules laid by the Government of India, whereas marble is a minor mineral and auctioned under state government rules. The report alleged that two mines of 74.29 hectares and 10.41 hectares respectively in Pratapgarh district were changed from limestone to marble and allotted to a firm, which brought a revenue loss of around ₹1,000 crore to the state. The survey conducted in 1983-85 called these blocks of limestone. Another committee in July 2019 placed the blocks in the limestone category. However, another committee, in February 2020, called it marble, instead of limestone. BJP spokesperson and MLA Ramlal Sharma accused the state government of allotting natural resources to satisfy its MLAs and said the BJP has already alleged that the head of Rajasthan (CM) is allocating the state’s natural wealth to satisfy MLAs and save the government. He said these allegations are now proving to be right, and the news reports are indicating the same – this seems to be the biggest mine scam of the state where the mine category was changed and mines worth ₹1,000 crore were auctioned starting from ₹5 crore. “The ACB, anyway, works on the instructions of the government by registering many cases and doing political torture; will the ACB try to probe the method of auction and register a complaint to bring the truth out?” he questioned. However, denying all the allegations, additional chief secretary, mines, Subodh Agarwal said, “the government has followed due procedures at every step and the mines were e-auctioned where four bidders participated.” He said limestone and marble have the same chemical composition, while marble fetches a royalty of ₹265 per/ton, limestone gets only ₹80 per ton. Therefore, the auction of the said mineral as marble instead of limestone fetches more than three times revenue. Hence, it is in the interest of the state. “No irregularity has been committed at any level,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bjp-demands-acb-probe-in-alleged-mine-allotment-scam-in-rajasthan-101626703348288.html

The NIA alleged that he was involved in an alleged Maoist conspiracy that led to caste clashes near the Bhima Koregaon village four years ago. The priest was being held at Taloja jail since October last year.A magisterial inquiry is being held into the death since he died while in custody.The judges also referred to the outrage directed at the high court and the NIA for Stan Swamy’s continued custody in Taloja jail since October last year, the bench said: “We ensured that we remained fair while passing orders on Swamy’s medical bail application, as well as the applications filed by the other co-accused in the Elgar Parishad case like P Varavara Rao and Hany Babu by permitting them to be shifted to the hospital of their choice, though there was vehement opposition.”The court also noted that the bench had been quick to accede to the request for shifting Fr Swamy on May 28 when senior lawyer Mihir Desai, who was representing Swamy in the high court, sought the permission and even thereafter when extension of his stay at the hospital was sought.Also Read: The life and death of Father Stan Swamy“Outside, we are speechless. Only you (Desai) can clarify this. You have said on record that you have no grievance with this court in the matter,” observed the bench.On Monday, Desai also sought permission for Father Frazer Mascarenhas to participate in the magisterial inquiry into the cause of Fr Swamy’s death. Desai submitted that the process for such inquiries mandated the participation of family members and since Fr Mascarenhas was permitted by the high court to meet Fr Swamy while he was at Holy Family hospital, he should be allowed to participate in the inquiry as well.The NIA, through advocate Sandesh Patil, opposed the continuation of Swamy’s medical bail plea and said the issues pertaining to the inquiry could not be taken up in the same application. The court said it would consider the request of Swamy’s counsel on Friday, July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/had-great-respect-for-stan-swamy-s-work-says-high-court-at-his-bail-hearing-101626703228133.html

The dialogue between the government and agitating farmers shall continue,” said Kumar, after meeting the people with grievances at the customary Janata Darbar at his official residence.The chief minister, however, appealed to the farmers who have been on dharna at Delhi’s borders for months to be considerate and call off the protest in view of a likely surge in the Covid-19 pandemic. “Everyone has the right to protest. But given the pandemic that the country and the world are grappling with, it is not good for the people to remain on dharna continuously for so long,” said Kumar.Also Read | Bihar gets 800,000 additional doses of Covid vaccines this fortnightThe Bihar chief minister stated that the farmers’ protest was confined to a few states, which reaped rich harvests and earned handsomely through procurement. “The new farm laws do not pose any issue for Bihar’s farmers. Farm productivity has increased in Bihar. The state government has toned up its procurement mechanism for the benefit of farmers. After paddy, we have now launched wheat procurement to ensure good return to the farmers of their produce,” said Kumar.Regarding a query relating to reported hacking of phones of some top journalists, leaders and bureaucrats by hiring an Israeli firm under Pegasus project, Kumar said that it was not good thing. “There are some bad aspects of technical evolutions. Sometimes, technologies, which are largely beneficial, can be misused also. But it is not good that the technology should be misused to trouble someone,” said the CM.To another query over rising prices of petroleum products, Kumar said, “I hardly cared about the hike in petrol and diesel prices, which I knew about from the newspapers. Appropriate action will be taken after discussion in the government,” said Kumar.About Shiv Sena’s demand that the Janata Dal (United) walk out of the National Democratic Alliance as it holds divergent views on the Uttar Pradesh government’s population policy, Kumar said he did not take notice of such people. “Every state government is free to adopt the policy that suits them to check population. I am of the view that the rate of reproduction comes down when mothers are educated. And this perception is based on nationwide research,” said the CM, while taking a potshot at Shiv Sena for pursing opportunistic politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/in-favour-of-holding-dialogue-with-agitating-farmers-bihar-cm-101626699687701.html

His family members, however, are not allowing him into the house without the naamkaran (naming) ceremony, HT has learnt. Naamkaran is a traditional Hindu naming ceremony to give a birth name to the newborn according to his or her lunar horoscope and is generally conducted on the 12th day after the birth. Surprised by the sudden return of 72-year-old Madho Singh Mehra on Saturday, his family decided that only after the naamkaran ceremony will he be given an entry into the house. The man’s last rites were conducted by the family thinking of him as dead after his disappearance nearly 24 years ago. “I was a child when our uncle (Tau) Madho Singh Mehra went missing and our family looked for him and waited for 10-year in the hope of his return. When he didn’t return, our family took the refuge of our ancestral deity and asked our priest, who also acts as an oracle, about it. He declared him dead,” said 38-year-old Ram Singh Mehra, nephew of Mehra. Mehra said Madho Singh, a resident of Janoli village on Ranikhet-Khairna state highway, went missing 24-year-ago when he was 48-year-old after a petty dispute within the family. The family looked for him and eagerly waited for his return. They waited for 10 years and then consulted their priest, who declared him dead. When he was declared dead, the search for him ended and the family performed his last rites. The male family members tonsured their heads too. Ram Singh said, “After declaring him as dead by the priest, our family lost all hopes of his return and performed his last rites. The male members also tonsured their heads according to our tradition.” During this period, Madho’s wife Jeewanti spent her life as a widow. She married her son and daughter. Madho Singh was suddenly spotted in the field of the village on Saturday in an emaciated condition. Villagers brought him in a palanquin to the village since he was unable to walk due to weakness. Kuber Singh Mehra, a resident of the same village, said, “He is not only weak to walk but also fails to tell how he reached the village or who brought him.” When asked by the family priest about his return, the priest said since Madho’s last rites had been performed, his naamkaran ceremony will be conducted before giving him entry to the house. Villagers have erected a tent at the courtyard of the house for his stay. Madho’s son works in a private company in Delhi. Ram Singh said, “We informed our family priest who is in Haridwar. He said since his last rites have been performed, so the naamkaran ceremony is necessary for his entry into the house. We are waiting for our priest, till then we have put him in a tent erected at the courtyard,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttarakhand-man-assumed-dead-for-24-years-returns-101626698727791.html
19-07-2021||Dehradun||U’khand assembly polls: After free power, AAP to announce more populist schemes||With months left for the next state assembly elections to be held in 2022, the Uttarakhand unit of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to announce more populist schemes after promising free power up to 300 units to each household in the state if it comes to power . The announcement about free power, which was made by Delhi chief minister and AAP president Arvind Kejriwal about a week ago in Dehradun, started a debate on political parties promising freebies in elections, with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and main Opposition Congress trying to play the announcement down by terming AAP irrelevant in Uttarakhand politics. AAP has now decided to come up with similar promises each month regarding education, water, health and other basic amenities. Also Read | Free 300 power units promise: AAP launches ‘Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card’ in UttarakhandAAP state president SS Kaler on the said, “The free power promise ahead of next assembly elections has surely rattled both the BJP and Congress as they didn’t anticipate this. Our party president Arvind Kejriwal will now visit Uttarakhand each month and make similar announcements about other basic amenities.” “They will include water, education, health and other basic amenities for the public which are necessary for any state. These won’t be mere announcements but promises which will be fulfilled if AAP wins the 2022 elections.” He said that AAP is the first party in Uttarakhand which is “working for the people”. “The existing parties, both BJP and Congress, have just taken turns to loot the state and do nothing for the people. We will change this by winning the elections in 2022 and work on actual development,” said Kaler. AAP state in-charge Dinesh Mohaniya, meanwhile, said that after the party’s announcement of free power, “Both Congress and BJP are after us.” “They are clearly rattled and calling it impractical. But we have already done that in Delhi and will show them how to do that here too. Not just power, but will work with similar initiatives in other domains also,” he said. Earlier on Saturday, the party’s state unit launched “Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card” under which party’s 10,000 workers would visit households in all the 70 assembly seats and urge the people to register for the free electricity service in lieu of which they would be given this card as a symbol of “guarantee that if the party comes to power, it will fulfil the promise.” The card was launched by Mohaniya in the presence of Kaler and senior party leader Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) during an event in Dehradun. The BJP and Congress, however, termed AAP irrelevant in Uttarakhand politics and said “none of their gimmicks will work in the state.” BJP state media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan said, “It is the modus operandi of AAP to make false promises which they can’t fulfil. They are doing the same in Uttarakhand too but they won’t succeed as people are here are aware of their despicable tactics.” The Congress termed such announcements a political gimmick. “They know that they have no political ground in Uttarakhand. Hence they are making such promises months before the elections to garner some votes. But, the people of Uttarakhand are smart enough to not fall in their trap,” said party state spokesperson Garima Dasauni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ukhand-assembly-polls-after-free-power-aap-to-announce-more-populist-schemes-101626698427617.html

19-07-2021||Pune||Prithviraj Chavan criticises Modi government on Covid vaccination “failure”||PUNE Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan, on Sunday, criticised the Modi government over a series of issues, including its “failure” on the coronavirus vaccination front and the rise in fuel prices.Chavan had also participated in the Congress party’s agitation over the fuel price and other issues.Speaking at press conference, Chavan said that in the last 186 days, since the country-wide vaccination drive began, the Centre has administered one Covid-19 vaccine dose to 360 million people, while only 81.5 million people have received both the doses.“With this pace, only 14-15 crore people will be fully vaccinated by December this year,” he said. According to him, even if the government doubles up the speed of vaccination, the count of fully vaccinated people won’t go above 250 million by the end of this year.“This is a clear failure of the central government. At this pace, it will take a long time for the economic revival,” he alleged. The former Maharashtra chief minister also accused the Modi government of adopting an “easy way” of increasing taxes on fuel to cover up the losses.“Fuel prices surged around 66 times in the last year. A major component of the fuel price is excise duty. When the Modi government came to power in 2014, the excise duty on petrol was ₹9.48 and now it is ₹32.90, which is an almost a 316 per cent increase in excise duty on petrol. For diesel, it has increased by 840 per cent,” he claimed, and added that due to this, the state-run petroleum companies were making a huge profit.The central government was selling the family jewels that are government companies to manage the deficit, he added.He hit out at senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, saying that he was misleading people by giving false information on the fuel prices and blaming the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for the rise in petroleum products in Maharashtra.“The state government charges the same VAT on fuel that was being charged by the previous Fadnavis government,” Chavan said. The Congress-led UPA government had brought 140 million people out of the BPL category with great efforts, but the present regime has pushed 230 million of them back to poverty, he alleged.“Coronavirus pandemic is not the only reason behind it. The situation was the same even before this crisis. According to figures from last seven quarters, the growth rate is coming down,” the Congress leader said. On the recent reshuffle of the Union council of ministers, Chavan said, “As per Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement, the government failed to handle the pandemic, hence, they were changing the health minister. Same is the case with the education minister. Modi government reshuffled the cabinet because the ministers were inefficient. My question to the PM is - why did it take seven years for you to realise that these ministers are inefficient?”He said that all the decisions are anyway taken at the PMO, so changing the faces (of ministers) would not make any difference.Replying to a query on the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) actions against various leaders, Chavan said, “Inquiries should be conducted to punish the wrongdoers, but by following the court procedures. Nowadays, raids, arrests and many more things are happening. However, there is no conclusion of these actions.”He alleged that the central government was using these agencies to blackmail leaders from the rival parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/prithviraj-chavan-criticises-modi-government-on-covid-vaccination-failure-101626694827270.html

19-07-2021||Pune||Stan Swamy was a wonderful person: HC while hearing his bail plea posthumously||The Bombay High Court on Monday, while hearing posthumously the appeals filed by late Jesuit priest Stan Swamy in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, said that he was a wonderful person and the court had "great respect" for his work. The observations were made by a bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar that had also presided over Swamy's medical bail plea on July 5, when the high court was informed about the 84-year-old priest's death at Mumbai's Holy Family Hospital that day following a cardiac arrest. "We don't have time normally, but I saw the funeral service (of Swamy). It was very gracious," Justice Shinde said. "Such a wonderful person. The kind of service he has rendered to the society. We have great respect for his work. Legally, whatever is there against him is a different matter," he said. The bench also referred to the criticism that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the judiciary had received following Swamy's death. It expressed regret over how, in several cases, undertrials languished in prisons waiting for the trial to begin. The bench, however, also said it had ensured to remain fair while passing orders on Swamy's medical bail plea, as well as on the pleas filed by his co-accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. "You came to us with his medical bail plea on May 28 and we acceded to every prayer, every time," the court said to Swamy's advocate, senior counsel Mihir Desai. "Outside, we are speechless. Only you (Desai) can clarify this. You have said it on record that you have no grievance with this court in the matter," the high court said. The high court further said nobody mentions that this is the court, which granted bail to Swamy's co-accused Varavara Rao in Elgar Parishad case , despite vehement opposition. "We allowed (Rao's) family to meet as we thought human angle has to be seen. In another case (Hany Babu), we sent to hospital of his choice (Breach Candy Hospital-a private medical facility)," the high court said."We never anticipated this (Swamy's death in custody) will happen. What was on our minds, we can't say now as we couldn't pronounce our order," the HC said referring to the pending medical bail plea of the late Jesuit priest. Swamy was arrested by the NIA in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case from Ranchi in October 2020. The tribal rights activist, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease and several other ailments, spent most of his time in custody at the Taloja prison's hospital in neighbouring Navi Mumbai. He was admitted to the state-run JJ Hospital in Mumbai on two occasions and was shifted to the Holy Family Hospital, a private medical facility, on May 28, following the intervention of the bench led by Justice Shinde. On July 5, the bench was informed by the hospital authorities that Swamy had suffered from a cardiac arrest two days prior and was put on ventilator support. He never regained consciousness and was declared dead by the hospital authorities about an hour before Swamy's medical bail plea was taken up for hearing by the high court, it was informed at that time. On Monday, following the high court's observations on it having passed fair orders, Desai said, "Let me say on record that I am extremely happy with various benches of the high court that heard this matter." He, however, urged the court to let Swamy's aide and another priest, father Frazer Mascarenhas, to participate in the magisterial inquiry that was initiated under Section 176 of the CrPC following the undertrial's death. He also urged the high court to direct the magistrate conducting the inquiry to adhere to the UNHRC guidelines on such inquiries, and to ask for a report of the probe to be submitted in the high court. Advocate Sandesh Patil, who appeared for the NIA, on Monday said the central agency was objecting to Desai's request since the high court was hearing appeals challenging a bail order and issues related to the inquiry could not be raised on the same pleas. "Time and again it is projected that the NIA is responsible for whatever has happened, and that jail authorities are responsible too," Patil told the court. The bench, however, told him there could be "no control on who says what outside on the matter". "You take instructions on how many witnesses, how long will the trial take. We have to look at it practically," the court said to the NIA counsel. "The concern is that for how many years can people be asked to languish in jail without a trial. Not only in this case, but the question will arise on other cases also," it said. The high court will continue hearing the pleas on July 23. The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The police had claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. The NIA later took over the probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/stan-swamy-was-a-wonderful-person-hc-while-hearing-his-bail-plea-posthumously-101626692541464.html

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Tackling tweens: A mom’s secret to a peaceful day||The morning starts with the buzz of the alarm clock. “Five more minutes, please,” whimpers my 10-year-old son. “It just takes 30 seconds to get ready for the online class, mom,” he says. I holler back, “Yes dear, you’re right. You hit the snooze button, and I’ll cut down 30 minutes of your PS (PlayStation) time in exchange.” Suddenly, I hear a thud and a jump. The not-so-little monster is up from his bed and on his way to the shower. Over the years, I’ve mastered the art of negotiation and can definitely qualify as a door-to-door salesperson (the extinction of the job is one of the primary reasons I did not apply). All thanks to my son. Instead of pleading and begging, I’ve switched to bargaining, which has not only got results but also given me time to focus on myself. Today, I’ve decided to share my secret will all moms out there to help them endure children 24x7 in these challenging Covid times. First, identify your child’s weaknesses, the more the merrier. Second, use it as a bargaining chip for activities such as bathing, eating green veggies, reading/studying, and going to bed on time. Third, in Sadhguru’s words: “Parents should start treating their children as equals.” Enough of bowing down to them, it’s time to rise to their level. This wisdom on how to get my kid to cooperate did not come overnight. Five years ago, at our routine dinner time at home, my son would throw a tantrum by throwing his vegetables as they were not made according to his taste buds. The not-so-calm me would huff and puff, giving him a piece of my mind. We wouldn’t realise that we would end up creating a scene in front of our extended family, who were not happy spectators. The grandparents were in tears for their innocent grandson and I turned out to be the evil mother. That night, I came up with a plan: Mission Impossible, methods to communicate with my son. The dossier included a list of my son’s favourite things to do during the day, some of which were watching TV, eating an ice-cream and being rewarded a star on his chart. On the other side, I made a list of things I wanted from him. Since that day, I’ve never looked back, exchanging treats for household chores, homework or interaction with adults, you name it and he does it. His behaviour improved remarkably and his outbursts went down to nil. The grandparents were pleased as they didn’t have to witness our fights anymore and I was accorded the Mother of the Year Award. Over the years, his interests have changed and so have my demands. As long as I keep updating my list, I am in a good place. I wish this knowledge helps all mothers who work hard all day to keep their kids happy and the house running.

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Are power purchase agreements useful?||Widespread, unannounced power cuts in the urban and suburban areas, industry closure for days on end and large-scale use of diesel gensets to rear the paddy crop reminded Punjabis of the era of power shortage in the state. For decades, power cuts in summer left domestic consumers, farmers, industrialists and shopkeepers fuming. Something had to be done. New generation capacity had to be added, quickly. For a financially challenged state like Punjab, rustling up ₹20,000 crore was out of the question. Even financial institutions would demand substantial equity contribution from the promoter/state. Large private investors had to be roped in. They had one query: Will the state give a commitment to purchase all the power produced? If the state shied away from the sovereign guarantee, the project was dead, ab initio. No bank would lend money to a power generator who did not have a 100% tie-up. Meeting export commitments at a cost The maximum demand in the summer months – April to September – was over 13,000 MW. The demand dipped to 3,700 MW from October onwards, when the air-conditioning loads of offices, homes and shops besides the agricultural demand fell. Was there a hope that industrial demand would pick up? If we examine the immediate flight of industrialists to meet the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, it would stand to reason that Punjab industry is in an expansion mode. If assured power could be supplied at reasonable rates, exporters and other manufacturers would expand capacities and new units would come up, too. To meet export commitments, press reports indicate that factories generated power with diesel gensets at ₹57 a unit when their cost of supply from the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) was around ₹6 a unit! Of course, the PSPCL tried to help by procuring power from the electric exchange even at 12.40p per unit. In peak season, prices will be sky high and they will get jacked up further when a large demand of Punjab gets known. On top of that, there was a constraint of transmitting power on the northern grid. Keeping all such scenarios in mind, the government of the day tendered for new power generating plants on the standard format approved by the central government. Even though I joined the power sector only after retirement in 2016, a check of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) records showed that the competitive guidelines issued by the Union power ministry were followed by two of the three power plants put up in Punjab. All states and the Centre followed the bidding procedure of this template. Only the plant at Goindwal Sahib was MoU-based, according to the earlier practice in the power sector and its power purchase agreement (PPA) is on a cost plus agreement. Why it’s the right strategy Was this the right strategy? Yes, if we look at the generation capacity of thermal stations in Punjab, it becomes evident that PSPCL can produce 3,000MW a day. These plants can produce 3,500 MW a day. From April to June, Nabha Power generated 1,204MW a day at ₹2.91 a unit. The Talwandi Sabo plant produced 746MW at ₹3.61 a unit. GVK produced 161MW at 4.04 per unit. The PSPCL plants at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat produced 196 units at ₹4.14 per unit. The state load despatch centre (at Patiala) schedules power based on a (price) merit order and it procured 90% of the power generated in the state from these IPPs at 25% cheaper prices. The benefit of cheaper purchase is naturally passed on to the domestic consumers, industries and farmers (for whom payment is made by the state subsidy). Can the state buy all its power from the exchange? The maximum import (available transmission capability) from outside Punjab is 6,400 MW; a large component of this is committed to drawing power from National Thermal Power Corporation Limited and other central government projects. Contracts can be made for sourcing power from the exchange and short-term purchases can be made. By carefully juggling the state generation and import of power, exorbitant purchase at over ₹10 a unit can be avoided. Capacity charges are inescapable A lot of discussion centres on the capacity charges. It’s not well known that this is the norm in the power sector. Capacity charges are paid for plants set up by the central and state governments. The PSERC tariff order points out that the capacity charges for the Ropar plant are normatively set up at less than 90p and for the Lehra plant at less than 80p, but since they may not be scheduled (being high cost producers), the state would end up paying around ₹2.90 and over ₹2.50 as capacity charges to these plants. Complaints are often aired that the PPAs are faulty because payment is made for 100% capacity and generation demanded is 80% or 85% only. All machines need overhauling and routine repair and maintenance. Let’s remember that even aircraft and railway engines don’t run 24x7x365 days. It can be safely concluded that capacity charges are inescapable if farmers, industrialists and domestic consumers want assured power at reasonable rates. State can’t renege on its commitments Can changes be made now? Yes, they can, with mutual consent. Can the state renege on its commitments and tear up a settled document because of perceived commercial interest? I don’t think it can happen; because any investor would knock the doors of the court. The judiciary may well refuse to go beyond written contracts; if a sovereign were to walk away from a solemn and signed contract, which investor will come to this state for any investment; ever? Some suggestions have been made that the PPAs can be amended by a “change in law”. If we examine the PPA, we will note that “change in law” refers to an event, which is seven days before the bid deadline. That is evidently over. The agreement provides for termination on the default of the seller if the plant is not commissioned in time; or abandoned by the seller; if the seller assigns the assets; or becomes bankrupt (Article 14.1). Since none of these conditions exist, the state will be well advised to use the assets created so painstakingly and in a fair and transparent manner, in the interest of power consumers of Punjab. The closest parallel to accepting capacity charges as a way of life is to imagine that you bought 3 ACs for your house with a bank loan and now you will have to pay the instalments of the AC every month, even though your family uses the ACs only in summer. dhanbirbains@gmail.com The writer is a retired IAS officer and former chairman of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission.

Out of the total beneficiaries, 16 per cent have been fully vaccinated with both doses.Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has the least number of beneficiaries covered as only 74,1561 beneficiaries out of the 2,275,679 have got the first shot which makes up only 33 per cent of the eligible population and out of the total, only 10 per cent are fully vaccinated.Out of the 3,963,765, Pune rural has vaccinated 1,533,880 people which makes up 39 per cent of the beneficiaries and out of this 13 per cent are fully vaccinated.The city was the first to start the vaccination process in the state on January 16. The month of June saw a boost in the numbers of vaccination as compared to May, however, July is yet to see a boost in the numbers and many citizens aged above 45 who are now eligible to get the second shot and have been allowed to get the dose through walk-in are not getting the vaccine and had to return due to shortage of doses.J Ponraj, a senior citizen residing in Hadapsar, said, “For the past five days we have been getting reminder messages through the Co-WIN app to get the second shot of the vaccine. We have visited our nearby centre daily for the five days for walk-in as we are unable to book a slot, but we have to return empty-handed as they do not have vaccines for walk-in beneficiaries.”Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister, earlier had said, “We have prepared our vaccination centres with infrastructure and staff to vaccinate over 1.5 lakh, people, daily if we get enough vaccines. We will also expand it to cover vaccination drives in housing societies and other such special initiatives only if we have enough vaccine doses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/less-than-50-beneficiaries-in-pune-district-have-got-first-covid-shot-101626692368197.html
19-07-2021||Delhi||Simple Vs dolled up: Settling the cake debate||Cakes are an integral part of the special moments and stories that people celebrate. As foodies began experimenting with baking amid the pandemic, the beauty and flavours of cakes have gone a notch higher. Anything and everything one sees around can now be designed into a cake in varied flavours. Some cakes look like a piece of art, making it difficult to imagine them as edible items. While many people find them appetising, others feel it’s too much for a cake. “We tend to ruin cakes in a bid to make them beautiful. When one takes the first bite they are supposed to relish the slice of cake and not the garnish. The lesser the garnish, the more one can enjoy the original flavour of the cake,” says Santosh Rawat, executive pastry chef, JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar. How a cake looks is important but how it is made is a game-changer, believes Jitender Kumar, chef at Pink Box. He says, “Baking a cake is an art in itself. The cake, from the sponge to the flavour, has to be blended in a manner that no ingredient overpowers the other and at the same time the flavour retains its authenticity.” For baker Bhumika Malhotra from bakewhiplove, using limited ingredients is the key. “I believe in minimalism. The subtle the cake, the better! I don’t like the idea of going overboard with decoration or overloading the cakes.” The basic ingredients of a cake includes flour (all purpose, gluten free), fat(oil, butters), leavening agents (baking powder, baking soda, eggs), and flavoring agents (fruits, vanilla, coffee, chocolate). Other than the ingredients, it is equally important to understand the oven beforehand. Malhotra says, “Before baking a cake one must know their oven, all its functions. Preheating your even on the same temperature which will be used while baking is essential. Do not peak the cake by opening the oven door over and over again, then will result in sinking of the cake base. Bake it well so the skewer comes out clean with no batter on it.” To not go overboard with the look, remember that less is more, says Juhi Pahwa, baker at The Better Binge, who is known for her refined sugar and gluten-free food items. “Use a mix of macarons, flowers, chocolate garnishes, fresh berries. I don’t like to do shapes and fondant work. I prefer to stick to what I know the best, healthy and delicious-looking cakes. I usually do ganache or yoghurt frosting. The one thing you must take care of is the colour of your frostings. It shouldn’t leave colour on your tongue after you’ve eaten the cake. Ganache must be firm enough to hold the cake yet soft enough to melt in your mouth,” says Pahwa. However, chef Abinas Nayak, winner of a cooking reality show, thinks differently. He loves to customise his cakes with flavours that are made naturally from fruits and compotes, and present them with edible flowers, crystals and decorations. “Sometimes, overdoing it creates the charm and beauty of the cake. So, the key is letting the flavour come out. Edible objects’ cakes are super fun and a piece of art in every slice, technical, as well as colourful,” says Nayak.Fondant cakes are indeed on the sweeter and costlier side. “If you’re not a fan of having a lot of fondant on your cake, you can always ask your baker to not cover the cake with it. The elements on the cake can be made of fondant while the base can be covered with buttercream or icing. Making of a fondant cake requires hours of hard work, precision and creativity, which goes into making the detailed characters and elements of the cake,” says Kumar. Sugar sheet cutouts are also a great alternative for fondant cakes.Recipe Chocolate CakeFor the cake 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour 3/4 cup cocoa powder1/2 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp baking soda 3/4 cup melted butter 1 cup caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract½ cup milk + 1tsp vinegar1 cup curdInstructions Pre-heat the oven to 180*CLine a baking pan with parchment paper. In a bowl add cocoa powder, flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder, mix well as set aside. In a bowl mix milk and vinegar and set aside Add melted butter and castor sugar in a bowl and beat together to incorporate air and add curd to the mixture later. Add dry ingredients in the butter-sugar and curd mixture, add milk-vinegar mixture in parts. Mix it all well till well combined without flour pockets. Add vanilla essence to the mixture and give it a final mix. Pour the batter into the pan and bake at 180*C for 25-30 minutesFor frosting 1 cup melted chocolate 1/2 cup fresh cream Instructions -Add hot fresh cream on melted chocolate and mix well. -Allow it to rest for 2 hours at room temperature.-Once the cake cools down. Cut it into desired layers and add chocolate frosting between the layers. - Finally, cover the cake with the frosting! For decorationAfter allowing the ganache/ frosting to set at room temperature for 2 hours, fill it in a piping bag with a start nozzle. Apply equal and constant pressure to the piping bag while making the start design. Repeat till you cover the top of the cake.By Bhumika Malhotra, baker Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/simple-vs-dolled-up-settling-the-cake-debate-101626691889019.html
19-07-2021||Pune||In my opinion: Why schools must not reopen without safety norms in place||A lot of people around the world have lost a lot to the coronavirus pandemic since its beginning. Many individuals lost their loved ones, relatives, friends, parents, and offspring. Millions have lost their jobs, their businesses and countless others have taken to the streets. But, the children suffered a big shock during this period; they lost their sweet childhood.The schools in Maharashtra closed on March 10, 2020. National lockdowns began on March 25. Accordingly, examinations up to Class 9 were cancelled and examinations for the Class 10 and 12 were postponed indefinitely again and again. For all the children there was no school, no going out because of the lockdown, no play, no fresh air, no visits to friend’s place, no birthday celebrations, and no enjoyment during last 14 months.Some of the schools in small and big cities started online; however, many students of the lower-middle-class parents, children from rural areas, villages and remote places could not relish the virtual classes for the want of internet and mobiles or laptops. In many parts of our state, the Internet and power needed for work is not available, so getting these facilities for modern means of education was out of the question.Many parents want the schools to reopen right away. The Department of Education is not sure what to do. The government should consider the following important points with respect to the reopening of schools.1. Corona is a medical disease and to control it, the crowded places are asked to be shut down in the very beginning. It is a medical option to limit the spread of the disease and has been followed all over the world in this outbreak. For this reason, schools were closed in March 2020. Thus, when schools are re-opened, the decision should only be made after taking into account the related medical facts.2. Currently the second wave of corona is receding, but not completely. Its downward chart has flattened out. 3. A third wave of corona is on the horizon, as the government frequently reports. It is also claimed that children will be most affected in wave three. Considering these three things, re-opening schools in the current situation will be like sacrificing the younger generation to the devil. In some European countries, schools were opened but had to be closed again because of the large number of children affected. Given all these facts, we would have to wait at least another six months to re-open the schools. It would be preferable for school activities to begin in the middle of January 2022. A large number of parents believe that a loss of a year and a half of their children’s education will have an impact on their future. These parents should realize that a six-month period is a small sacrifice compared to the risk of Corona and the serious consequences thereafter.Corona is a world-wide catastrophe, like a world war. Would you send your children to school if the bombing continues in your hometown? The only difference between the current corona situation and the World War is that there are no bombs on the side of the road in the pandemic. However, the corona infection that occurs is more severe and dangerous to children’s lives. Planning should encompass the following:VaccinationVaccination is the only way to keep children safe from coronavirus infection. No vaccine currently exists for children under the age of 18. Covaxin and Zycov (Zydus Cadila) vaccines are being tested for children between the ages of 12 to 18 years. Novovax is one more company that is prepared to introduce vaccines for the 2-12 and 12-18 age group. Vaccines will likely be available for children beginning in September or October, after completion of related trials over the next two to three months.According to 2021 statistics in Maharashtra, there are approximately 2.6 crore children under 18-years old. We may need 5.2 crore doses by December-January. If the campaign is planned properly to avoid mismanagement and political interference, we would be in a position to complete the vaccination before January 15. With students, teachers and school staff need to be vaccinated during this period.Prior to vaccination, there should be a meeting with parents explaining the importance of vaccination to their pupils. Vaccination must be carried out with parental consent on a national ‘consent form’. The Ministry of Education should make it clear that parents whose children are not vaccinated will not be allowed into school.All children should be immunised free of charge and under medical supervision. If a student suffers from post-vaccination problems, there should be a predetermined arrangement of physicians, hospitals, and ambulances for treatment.School should begin 15 days after the second dose of vaccine for all the students.Sanitation of schoolsEverything in the school must be sterilised before the school begins. The local government body should provide personnel and tools, chemicals, and medications required for disinfection. Everything in the school must be sterilized before school begins. The disinfection process needs to be repeated every few days; schools must pay attention to this.Daily checkup Every student should be checked for fever every day, before entering the premises. Sick children with fever, cold, and cough should be sent home. In pre-Corona schools, even sick children were forced to attend school. But from now on, the sick leave has to be permitted to the students. Attendance If the rules of social distancing are to be followed, the number of students in every classroom has to be reduced. If the class was of 50 students till last year, it should be now with only 25. This can be done with two or three shifts of the school. Disinfection It will be necessary to disinfect schools textbooks with UV rays.Corona is still not under control completely. The waves will keep on appearing. The answer is every student must be vaccinated and the school environment should be made 100 percent safe. After that only, the doors should be reopened.

19-07-2021||Jaipur||Black fungus cases rising among children in Rajasthan||In the last two months, five children affected with black fungus have been reported from Rajasthan, of whom, one died within two days of hospitalization, doctors said, expressing concern over increasing cases of mucormycosis or black fungus among the children in the state.In the last four months, Rajasthan reported over 3,000 cases of black fungus and 167 deaths. Recently, a 7-year-old child from Bharatpur suffering from black fungus was admitted to JK Lon Hospital, Jaipur. Senior doctor Kailash Meena said the child has been suffering from aplastic anaemia since birth, a condition that occurs when the body stops producing enough new blood cells. He was undergoing treatment and now swelling was observed on his face. The child’s RTPCR test was found negative but he had Covid-19 antibodies. He had been affected with Covid-19 and was asymptomatic. The child had a fever, followed by swelling on the face. In the MRI, evidence of black fungus was found. He will undergo surgery by ENT specialists in a day or two. Meena said initially the parents weren’t agreeing as the child’s jaw would be removed, they were counselled and have now agreed. “Further delay in surgery would affect the brain with the fungus. The fungus affects those with compromised immunity,” he said.Earlier, four cases of black fungus in children were reported in Bikaner Medical College. One of the children died. “In the last two months, four children suffering from black fungus have been reported. In all the cases, the patients’ immunity was compromised and Covid antibodies were present,” said Dr Gaurav Gupta, professor ENT department, government medical college, Bikaner. He said the first case was of a 1.5-year boy whose upper lips and nose had gone black because of the fungus. The child was suffering from blood cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. There was no Covid-19 history but antibodies were present. The second child was 3-years-old and was about to lose an eye due to the fungus but was saved through endoscopic orbital decompression. He also had antibodies. Third, a 3-year-old girl was brought late and directly admitted to the ICU. Her face and skin had turned black and she had breathing issues. She was brought in serious condition and passed away after two days. A 12-year-old boy had met with an accident and suffered from a secondary infection. He was cured with medicine, said Gupta. Last year, from August to December, around 24 cases were reported of black fungus. Before Covid-19, one or two cases were reported in a year. But this time, during the second wave of Corona, the cases are exploding, said a senior doctor of SMS hospital. The state government has notified Mucormycosis (black fungus) as an epidemic and announced free treatment of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/black-fungus-cases-rising-among-children-in-rajasthan-101626691468480.html

19-07-2021||Kolkata||13 years after Singur movement pushed Tatas away, Bengal minister says 'they are welcome'||West Bengal's Industry and IT minister Partha Chatterjee said on Monday that the Tata Group is always welcome to invest in the state, as the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) never had any issues with the business house."The problem was with the Left Front government and its forcible land acquisition policy. Tata group is always most welcome to come and invest in Bengal,” Chatterjee was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Chatterjee further elaborated that the TMC did not fight against the Tatas nor can they be blamed for what happened in Singur 13 years earlier. "We never had any enmity with the Tatas, nor did we fight against them. They are one of the most respected and biggest business houses of this country and also abroad. You can't blame the Tatas (for the Singur fiasco),” the minister said, according to PTI.Chatterjee’s comments assume significance because TMC came to power after dislodging the Left government in 2011 on the back of the anti-land acquisition movement in Singur. The movement forced Tatas to shift their Nano car manufacturing facility to Gujarat. The Left government’s Singur land acquisition in 2006 sparked protests by farmers, who alleged they were not paid adequately by the government.Also Read: SC scraps Singur land deal for Nano plant, asks Bengal govt to take possessionThe TMC leader claimed that Tatas have shown interest in setting up another centre, and that he is in touch with some officials from the group. "We already have the presence of Tata Metaliks, one Tata Centre besides the TCS here. But if they are willing to come up with big-ticket investments in manufacturing or other sectors, there is no problem. Our IT secretary recently told me they had shown interest in setting up a Tata Centre here," he said.The 1,000 acres of land acquired by the then Buddhadeb Bhattacharya government on behalf of the Tatas was handed back to the West Bengal government in 2019 after the Supreme Court ordered the Tatas to do so. A bench of Justice V Gopal Gowda and Justice Arun Kumar Misra declared the entire land acquisition process illegal, void and a fraud. “This action of the state government is grossly perverse and illegal and void ab initio in law and such an exercise of power by the state government for acquisition of lands cannot be allowed under any circumstance,” the court order read.Chatterjee told PTI that industrialisation and job creation is his party’s objective and was mentioned in the party manifesto and to that end the government is willing to extend help to any business house who can aid in job creation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/13-years-after-singur-movement-pushed-tatas-away-bengal-minister-says-they-are-welcome-101626688626467.html

Our target is to vaccinate maximum people in as less time as possible so that the Centre replenishes our stock of vaccines,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar.Bihar plans to first vaccinate the urban population, which is more willing to take the jab, before moving to the rural areas, where vaccine hesitancy is stronger. The state has so far administered 20.9 million vaccine doses against its target population of 72.2 million. Of this, 17.7 million have received the first dose, and 3.153 million have got the second dose.“The government’s focus is to first target the low-hanging fruits before moving up. We will shift our focus to the rural population, who are fast shedding their reluctance towards vaccination, once the willing urban population has been administered the first dose,” said a health official.Patna, for instance, hopes to administer the first vaccine dose to all urban adults by July 25.“We have achieved over 70% first-dose vaccination in urban Patna and hope to complete inoculating the remaining population by July 25, subject to [the] availability of vaccines. The thrust will then shift to rural areas,” said Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh.“In addition to the static session sites, we are deploying one vaccination van in each of the 75 municipal wards of Patna to complete the first-dose vaccination... by July 25,” added Singh.24% of rural Patna has received the first-dose of the vaccines, compared to over 70% in urban areas. Rural Patna has a target population of 2.912 million against 1.436 million in urban Patna.Patna, with a target population of 43.48 lakh (approx.), has consumed 11% of the total doses administered in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-gets-800-000-additional-doses-of-covid-vaccines-this-fortnight-101626678143407.html

They went to the hills by crossing the stream earlier in the day. However, due to heavy rainfall the stream got swollen, making it impossible for them to return. We managed to rescue all of them with the help of fire brigade personnel. No one suffered injuries in the rescue operation.” “We have deployed officials so that no one can enter the area. However, the hills cover a huge area at Kharghar, and our six to seven officials are not enough to watch over the entire region.

19-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The world is what it is||To be emotionally resilient to misfortune. To accept the moment as it presents itself.If you can be this, then you’re a stoic person.You may dig deeper by reading the complete Wikipedia entry on stoicism. Or you may come to Anand Vihar, at the Delhi-UP border, and gaze upon this face that looks the very essence of stoicism.The sculpture is installed in a small park. The eyes are half-open, the lips may be smiling a little, as if hinting at the person’s bemusement at the ways of the world—probably implying that the only way to get through is to stay detached from passing joys and griefs.This evening the world around the park—it is tucked in the middle of the Ghaziabad-bound highway—is milling with traffic and pedestrians. The bus terminus across the road is continually flushing out roadways buses headed to UP towns like Bareilly and Etawah. But the park is empty, except for a man asleep at the foot of the sculpture. Far behind, the sun is setting and the sky is bleached in various shades of red, pink and orange. The elevated metro track forms the sculpture’s imposing backdrop. Soon enough, two trains appear from opposite sides and pass each other noiselessly. The scene seems to symbolise the face’s two clashing emotions—pleasure and pain. They cancel each other, leaving the figure indifferent to both.A plaque underneath reveals the moortikar, the sculptor, to be Dr Lal Ratnakar, from Jaunpur/Ghaziabad. The artwork—titled Niharika—was unveiled in 2014 on the occasion of an art festival in Ghaziabad.To be sure, Delhi region is full of statutes and sculptures. Most statues lie in neglect, even though some are more interesting (like the Tolstoy’s statue, with his flowing beard in Janpath). Many sculptures in the city’s public spaces are so abstract that they are difficult to understand (like the one at Mandi House). But this face is easy to read. As the daylight fades, the face looks more like its own shadow, losing the solidity of its stoniness.Meanwhile, the sleeping man is still asleep, the traffic is becoming more chaotic, and the metro trains are appearing in swift intervals. The stoic face is accepting the world as what it is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-world-is-what-it-is-101626655012546.html
19-07-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad resumes demolitions in Khori village after a day’s halt||Faridabad authorities resumed the ongoing demolition drive in Khori village, which was suspended on Saturday, a day after Indian authorities replied to the United Nations Human Rights Council over a statement released by its six special rapporteurs that called for the drive to be halted.Last month, the Supreme Court directed the Haryana government and the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad to remove “all encroachments”, consisting of around 10,000 residential units, in the Aravalli forest area, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge in the rule of law” and talk of “fairness”.On Friday, experts from the United Nations Human Rights Council called on India to halt the eviction of around 100,000 people, including 20,000 children, from Khori village in Faridabad, which began last Wednesday, and said “it is particularly important residents be kept safe during the pandemic”.In response, the Permanent Mission of India to the Office of the United Nations issued a statement on Saturday, saying, “It is unfortunate that the special rapporteurs have chosen to issue a press release just two days after sending a joint communication to this Mission and not waiting for a response.”The police said that the demolition process remained peaceful. Around 2,000 police personnel were deployed in Khori village on Sunday.Garima Mittal, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, said the demolition drive was recorded through drone cameras.The deputy commissioner of Faridabad, Yashpal Yadav, said, “We have started full-scale demolition and we are implementing the Supreme Court orders in letter and spirit. All structures will be demolished as per the orders and not just those that have been vacated. The drive is being conducted peacefully and we have not faced any challenge so far, except people not cooperating.”Meanwhile, social activists and residents alleged that situation has worsened in Khori village and that there has been no let-up in the demolitions even after the United Nations’ experts urged an immediate halt.“On Sunday, demolitions started from the Durga temple side, and the number of police deployed there is much higher than what we had seen until now. They have encircled Khori Gaon from all sides and are restricting movement in and out. Volunteers and residents from Khori who have been distributing food are now stuck in this police blockade. They are not being allowed to leave,” said Neelesh Kumar, a social activist with Basti Suraksha Manch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-resumes-demolitions-in-khori-village-after-a-day-s-halt-101626654654972.html
19-07-2021||Delhi||Abducted Delhi man’s body found beheaded in Baghpat||A 52-year-old man was allegedly abducted from Delhi and killed in an agricultural field in Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh, where his headless and decomposed body was recovered by the local police on July 16, four days after the crime, police said on Sunday.The accused, Riyasat, allegedly killed Shahzad with the help of his nephew and a friend, after the victim failed to repay a loan of ₹25,000. Riyasat and his associate, Javed, have been arrested; his nephew, Nadeem, is still absconding, the police said.Riyasat told the police that he loaned ₹25,000 to Shahzad on three to four occasions on interest, and that the victim was required to return a certain amount per day over a fixed period, to repay the loan with interest. Shahzad last borrowed ₹4,500, and was to return ₹100 daily for two months as part of the loan deal, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.“Shahzad stopped paying the daily amount after 12 days. When Riyasat demanded his money back, Shahzad picked up a fight with him. To avenge his insult, Riyasat abducted Shahzad with the help of Nadeem and Javed,” the DCP said.Police said on July 13, Shahzad’s family members registered a report at the Seemapuri police station. They said Shahzad left home on July 12, but did not return and his mobile phone was also not reachable. He worked as a house painter.When the police and Shahzad’s family members were looking for him, a headless and decomposed body was found in a field in Baghpat on July 16.The Seemapuri police learnt about it and took Shahzad’s family members to Baghpat, where they identified the body by its clothes and the identification marks. The head was missing, the DCP said.“We registered a case of kidnapping, murder and destruction of evidence under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 365, 302 and 201 at the Seemapuri police station and investigation was taken up,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.During initial probe, the police suspected the role of Shahzad’s daughter-in-law and her family members, after learning that she filed a rape case against him and his brother last year. However, no evidence was found against them.Then, the police came to know that Shahzad used to borrow money from Riyasat, who lived in the same neighbourhood. It was also established that Shahzad was last seen with Riyasat. When Riyasat was questioned, he confessed to the murder and revealed the role of Nadeem and Javed.“We arrested Riyasat and Javed on Saturday night. Riyasat said that he lured Shahzad to Baghpat on pretext of providing him a contract to paint a house. Javed and Nadeem joined them on the way. They offered liquor to Shahzad, and when he was drunk, Riyasat and Nadeem took him to the field and killed him with a meat cleaver. They then severed Shahzad’s head and threw it in a canal near Muradnagar,” DCP Sathiyasundaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/abducted-delhi-man-s-body-found-beheaded-in-baghpat-101626653467178.html

19-07-2021||Delhi||Disaster body cancels kanwar yatra in Delhi||Delhi on Sunday cancelled the kanwar yatra, days after Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh called off the religious pilgrimage due to Covid-19 concerns.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in an order prohibited any gatherings, processions or celebrations related to the pilgrimage.“In spite of being banned /suspended by Uttarakhand government, there is an apprehension of gatherings/ congregations/processions during Kanwar Yatra 2021. Therefore, in view of persisting Covid-19 situation, it is decided that Kanwar Yatra 2021 should not be permitted in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Delhi..,” said the DDMA order, which HT has seen.The order also cited an existing DDMA direction which bans all religious, cultural, sports, political, academic and other similar gatherings in the national capital.This is the second year the yatra has been cancelled due to the pandemic. Last year too, the kanwar sanghs publicly announced they will not arrange camps.Months after the Mahakumbh drew 9.1 million devotees and seeded clusters of infections, concerns have grown over the kanwar yatra.The DDMA order came a day after the Uttar Pradesh government, citing a decision by groups representing pilgrims, said that the kanwar yatra will not take place this year. On Friday, when the UP government told the Supreme Court that it is looking forward to allow a symbolic yatra this year with restricted number of tourists, the top court shot down the suggestion.Last week, the Uttarakhand government called off kanwar yatra citing risks of potential spread of Covid-19.The annual yatra attracts around 30 million pilgrims who travel on foot from many northern and northwestern states to Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga and carry it back to their home towns. Uttarakhand, which too will vote in the assembly elections next year, has already cancelled the yatra and said it will not allow devotees to arrive in the state.Delhi too witnesses crowds every year joining the pilgrimage either from the Capital or people from neighbouring states to reach either Uttarakhand or Uttar Pradesh. “In usual years, the revenue department of the government is entrusted with arrangements for the pilgrims. They set up temporary tents and camps for them to take rest, toilets and facilities providing drinking water,” said a senior DDMA official||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/disaster-body-cancels-kanwar-yatra-in-delhi-101626652363875.html
19-07-2021||Delhi||Prices of vegetables in city go up on back of rain, fuel rates||With monsoon setting in across the country last week, and fuel prices on the up, the prices of meat, fruits and vegetables in Delhi have increased over the past few days.The retail price of onions touched ₹50-60 per kg on Sunday, against an average of ₹40 a week ago, the price of potatoes went up from ₹25-30 per kg to ₹40 per kg, and price of raw chicken touched ₹240 a kilo in some parts of the city, against last week’s ₹200-220.Prices of fruits and vegetables usually increase as monsoon covers the country, because of transportation and storage hurdles. This year, however, the record prices of automotive fuels, led to a hike in the price of vegetables even before large parts of northern India started witnessing monsoon rains, said traders across agricultural product markets in Delhi.“Soon the price rise will start reflecting in food grains. Edible oil costs more than usual in any case. Any further increase will make things very difficult,” said Ankita Aggarwal, a resident of Delhi’s Indra Vihar.“The prices have increased in the wholesale markets such as Azadpur, Okhla and Ghazipur. So, as a result, retail prices have increased as well. Prices usually go up in the monsoons, but this year prices have witnessed significant increase very soon,” said Sandeep Gupta, a retail vendor of fruits and vegetables in south Delhi’s Mehrauli market.Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agricultural produce market, said: “There has been at least a 20% increase in transportation costs over the past week.”Iqbal Qureshi, a poultry trader and vice-chairperson of the wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur, said, “We are paying higher transport costs for live chicken because of the increase in prices of petrol and diesel.”On Sunday, the cost of petrol in Delhi touched ₹101.84 a litre, and diesel was sold for ₹89.87.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/prices-of-vegetables-in-city-go-up-on-back-of-rain-fuel-rates-101626648696393.html

But he is shining bright for Ireland.On July 15, he became the first-ever cricketer to score an ODI century batting at the eighth position or lower. Singh scored a feisty 100 (not out) against a quality South African bowling attack in the third ODI at Malahide Cricket Club in Dublin. However, Simi’s efforts weren’t enough as South Africa overpowered Ireland by 70 runs to end the series at 1-1.Singh has played 30 ODIs and 24 T20Is for Ireland since making his international debut in 2017 against New Zealand. The 34-year-old cricketer surpassed England’s Sam Curran, who scored a valiant 95 against India in Pune earlier this year. Singh had quit cricket in India when he was not considered for the U-19 Punjab state team despite doing consistently well in the U-14, U-16 and U-17 levels. He had then moved to Ireland in 2005 to pursue a hotel management course along with cricket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohalis-simi-singh-scores-record-breaking-ton-for-ireland-101626641181857.html
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Attack on BJP leaders in Chandigarh: Party demands action against police negligence||The Punjab governor and UT administrator, VP Singh Badnore, will hold a high-level meeting on Monday to examine the attack on city mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and senior BJP leader Sanjay Tandon.UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “All aspects of the incident, including any negligence on the part of the police, will be examined in the meeting called by the administrator on Monday.”Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Arun Sood said, “We have requested the administration to take necessary steps so that Chandigarh is not turned into another Singhu border. If the administration fails to take remedial steps, the BJP will plan its strategy on the issue accordingly.”Earlier in the day, members of BJP took out a protest rally, planned from the party office in Sector 33 to Governor House, which was stopped by the authorities at Labour Chowk. The party leaders submitted a memorandum to the administrator through the sub-divisional magistrate.Sood said, “We have submitted three demands in the memorandum. First, the negligence of the police must be looked into. We had informed them well in advance about the video. The mayor before leaving the venue had again checked with the police and he was again assured it was in control. Second, due action must be taken against the perpetrators of violence. Third, don’t let the city’s law and order fall victim to these agitations.”The police on Sunday arrested three more protesters for attacking the vehicles of BJP leaders. Sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) were added to the FIR.The three accused include Rajinder Singh, Harpreet Singh and Malwinder Singh. They were presented in a court on Sunday and sent to judicial custody. The police, however, didn’t share their exact role.On July 17, 22 people were arrested during the protest, but were later bailed out. Officials said that the police were going over videos of the incident to identify violent protesters and those who attacked the vehicles of Tandon and Sharma.The members of Kisan Ekta Chandigarh Union on Sunday have decided to meet the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Chandigarh on Monday to demand immediate release of the three protesters.The decision was taken in a meeting held in front of Bestech Mall, Sector 66. Satnam Singh, one of the leaders, said, “In case our demands are not met, the farmers will block the UT barriers at Mullanpur and Zirakpur.”He added, “The UT police have falsely implicated us in cases. We were protesting there peacefully. The planted BJP goons were behind the attack.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/attack-on-bjp-leaders-in-chandigarh-party-demands-action-against-police-negligence-101626641122069.html

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Requests for elective surgeries increase at private hospitals in Chandigarh tricity area||With the daily Covid-19 cases dipping after the second wave of the pandemic abates, the private hospitals in the tricity of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali are witnessing a huge rush of patients for elective surgeries.Elective surgery is a procedure scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency.Even though international travel for medical tourism has resumed in India, not many foreign patients are approaching the tricity’s private hospitals for availing non-Covid medical facilities. However, the hospitals are trying to make up for the losses faced during the pandemic as the footfall of patients from other states has increased for non-Covid elective surgeries.Representatives of private hospitals believe that with the second wave flattening, this is the right time to provide treatment to patients with pending surgeries as further delay may deteriorate their health conditions and elective surgeries could turn into emergencies.A spokesperson of Max Super Specialty Hospital, Mohali, informed that the elective surgeries had dipped to around 70% during the Covid situation, but now when the surge had abated, the hospital was providing treatment to 20% more than the normal number of patients. The demand for elective surgeries had suddenly increased, however the footfall of international patients had not picked up pace yet.Elective surgeries resumed after govt guidelinesA spokesperson of Fortis Hospital, Mohali, said, “During the first wave, all elective surgeries and procedures were put on hold. While the emergency surgeries remained inevitable even during the peak of the pandemic, Fortis soon resumed elective surgeries after government guidelines. Our experts have performed over 10,000 emergency and elective surgeries for cardiac, neuro, cancer, orthopaedic and other specialties during the pandemic.”The hospital authorities added that during the pandemic, the hospital occupancy had dropped and elective procedures had come to a standstill. In addition, the Covid treatment was fixed at the rates defined by the government, which were either zero or at negative margins. “Fortis hospital had dedicated 150 beds for Covid-19 patients. But now when the cases are dipping, many patients are approaching the hospital to get their non-Covid elective surgeries done,” they said.Dr PS Maan, medical superintendent of the Alchemist Hospital in Panchkula, said, “During the Covid situation, the hospital was doing less than 50% of its routine work and elective surgeries had dipped drastically. However, we are getting a huge response from patients now and we are back on our normal track.”Meanwhile, Dr RS Bedi, who runs the Bedi Hospital in Chandigarh and is the former national vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, said that not only big corporate hospitals, but private clinics were also witnessing a huge demand of patients.“Since Covid cases have dropped in the tricity, this is the only time to provide medical facilities to non-Covid patients as they are more prone to getting infected with the virus in the possible third wave. The demand for elective surgeries has gone up since June this year, after the peak of the second wave started to flatten. Also, people have now resumed attending out-patient departments of private hospitals and clinics, which is a positive sign for the private sector,” Dr Bedi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/requests-for-elective-surgeries-increase-at-private-hospitals-in-chandigarh-tricity-area-101626638601402.html
19-07-2021||Mumbai||Over 30 dead as heavy rain batters Mumbai||Torrential rain from a thunderstorm, described by meteorologists as “monstrous”, hammered Mumbai in the early hours on Sunday, flooding low-lying areas, triggering landslides, house collapses and electrocutions that resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people, officials said.The island city received 235mm of rain in four hours (between 12am and 4am) on Sunday, according to weather officials, hours after a similar extreme weather event resulted in the season’s highest daily rainfall (253mm) on Friday.The suddenness and intensity of Sunday morning’s downpour made it one of the most intense rain spells since the 2005 cloudburst, when a record 944mm downpour was recorded in the country’s financial capital in a single day.The heavy rain, which environment minister Aaditya Thackeray labelled as a “mini cloudburst”, triggered two landslides — the first in east Mumbai’s Chembur where 19 people were killed, and the second in the suburb of Vikhroli, where at least 10 people lost their lives.In both instances, landslides crushed the houses with peoplesleeping inside. Rescuers were seen trying to dig through the debris using their hands in an attempt to find survivors, and officials said they feared more people may still be trapped. A 16-year-old boy was killed in a house collapse in the city’s Bhandup suburb, while one man was electrocuted to death in Andheri West, officials said.The first landslide was reported around 1am in the New Bharat Nagar area of Chembur, where a wall collapsed on several shanties. Around five houses, where people were sleeping, were the ones worst effected and a total of 19 people were killed, including four minors. Five people were reported wounded in the incident.Around 3am, another landslide was reported in the Surya Nagar area of Vikhroli, where seven-to-eight houses were crushed, resulting in the death of at least 10 people, officials said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) termed both the landslides as “natural calamities”, and said that the houses were “illegally built” on government land and that it had already appealed to citizens to vacate.Officials from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), municipal workers, fire brigade and police personnel were engaged in rescue operations at the collapse sites.At around 5am, a house collapse in Bhandup resulted in the death of a 16-year-old, officials said.Also at Bhandup, rainwater inundated a water purification complex, disrupting supply “in most of the parts of Mumbai”, civic authorities said. “Efforts are being taken to restore Mumbai’s water supply by restarting the water purification system in the complex... After supply is restored, the administration appeals Mumbaikars to boil water before drinking,” BMC said in a statement on Sunday afternoon.Later on Sunday morning, 26-year-old man was reportedly electrocuted to his death in a sweet shop at Andheri West.Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences and announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh to the families of those who died. State chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh for those who lost their family members on Sunday.The BJP on the other hand said blamed the alleged “mismanagement and corruption” in the BMC. Vinod Mishra, BJP corporator and party leader in the BMC said, “The BMC should stop playing with lives of citizens and every year we have this situation where people die during monsoon. The BMC should ensure that there are no such incidents during heavy rainfall.”State environment minister Aadtiya Thackeray labelled the event as a “mini cloudburst,” though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) did not term it as one. Experts said it was a thunderstorm event, but one whose impact is comparable to a cloudburst – which is described by IMD as an event where 100mm rain falls in a span of an hour over a 20-30sqkm region.“We have been talking about climate change and it is happening because since a few years we have been witnessing that in a few hours, excess rainfall is reported, which makes it even more for the administration to handle,” he said.Meteorologists said in Sunday’s thunderstorm, the cloud cover seems to have started forming late Saturday over Raigad district, where the hilly topography would have driven the formation of thunder clouds. The cloud cover – which touched a height of 18km (twice the size of Mt Everest) – then moved from the southeast to the northwest of Mumbai.“The cloud-top height is a good indicator of how intense a storm will be. Furthermore, the vertical wind shear is significant, which is prolonging the lifespan of thunderstorms,” Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, England. “Such thunderstorms are definitely uncommon for Mumbai or the west coast during an active phase of the monsoon, and in a month like July. The cloud top height of this monster thunderstorm is definitely comparable to the one that produced rains on 26 July 2005.”Despite the scale of the downpour, civic authorities said they received no warning of extreme weather from the IMD. “Our models did not see such an intense event, but an impact based forecast was put out at 1am warning people,” said Dr Jayanta Sarkar, head of the IMD’s regional meteorological centre in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-30-dead-as-heavy-rain-batters-mumbai-101626635616727.html

Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Gursher Singh said a special drive was recently launched against gambling activities and Mataur police received information regarding a racket operating from a house in Phase 3A. “A team, constituted under the leadership of inspector Manphul Singh, raided the house and discovered a gambling and betting ring. All accused were caught red-handed,” he added.Superintending of police (City) Harvinder Singh Virk said several dice, which were used to decide the numbers for gambling, were also found. “The entire racket was being operated online and through phones.

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Messy garbage bills by MC leave Chandigarh residents riled||Over six months after it started door-to-door garbage collection, the municipal corporation has not only failed to streamline the process but its garbage billing is also riddled with issues.Residents complain the corporation is overcharging them through arrears and also not providing clarity on how the charges are being calculated. While earlier MC was collecting these charges through POS machines, now it has started adding the amount to the water bills.In the latest cycle, Sector 22 residents have received combined bills, which they say are anything but transparent.Confusion is rife as along with overcharging, MC has failed to specify how arrears have been levied and in some cases, charges have been imposed even when residents have paid them already.Residents who used to pay ₹400 to ₹600 for four to six months, are now getting bills upward of ₹1,400.“How have the rates suddenly shot up from ₹100 per month? Arrears of six months should be ₹600, but MC has imposed a charge of ₹1,500. Charges are being levied arbitrarily,” said a Sector 22 resident, who didn’t want to be named.“MC is legally bound to mention on the bill how the rates have been charged. But there is no clarity. Worse, the garbage collection system is also replete with issues. MC vehicles just blow the horn and leave if they get no response,” said Rakesh Mittal, a retired chief engineer from the Punjab government, who also lives in the sector.Residents, who have already paid charges through POS collectors, have also received bills with arrears.“Since MC started collecting garbage, we have cleared all the bills. I have the receipts too. But now we have got a bill of ₹1,550. I will have to waste a whole day to get this rectified at the MC office,” said Anmol Mahna, a resident of Sector 22.Another resident of the sector, requesting anonymity, said MC learnt no lesson from similar goof-ups in other sectors, causing harassment to more people.The redress system, recently constituted by the MC commissioner, is also tardy, say residents. “The medical officer of health should organise door-to-door visits or localised weekend meetings through sanitary inspectors to settle such issues. A process is also needed for how to get the charges suspended if the house is unoccupied or garbage is not collected for a certain period. The current system is far from effective,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations. On MC’s part, medical officer of health Dr Amrit Warring said, “We are attending to each and every complaint promptly. We have received 250 complaints regarding garbage collection charges. Of these around 35 are for overcharging, while others relate to incorrect calculation of kitchens in a dwelling unit, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/messy-garbage-bills-by-mc-leave-chandigarh-residents-riled-101626638427053.html
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Delimitation Commission preparing draft report after J&K visit||Nearly a fortnight after its visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the Delimitation Commission has started working on a draft report on the proposed new shape of assembly constituencies that will be shared with its associate members before being put in the public domain, officials here said on Sunday.The commission headed by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai had visited the Union territory from July 6 to 9. The commission also comprises chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra as an ex-officio member and the Jammu and Kashmir electoral officer.The officials said the commission will compile the data received from deputy commissioners and nearly 290 delegations comprising 800 representatives of political parties and people from other walks of life whom its members met during their visit.A draft report will be prepared using these inputs and it will be shared with the associate members, which include three Lok Sabha members from the National Conference —Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Masoodi and Akbar Lone — and the BJP’s Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore Sharma. The National Conference had boycotted the first meeting of the commission.The officials said that after sharing the draft report, the Delimitation Commission will hold a meeting with the associate members to obtain their views before putting out the final draft for seeking public comments and challenges on redrawing of the boundaries.They said the commission is also looking at some districts where the jurisdictional boundaries can be realigned as the electoral constituency comprises segments from two districts.The delimitation exercise has attained an urgency amid indications that the Centre is keen to hold early assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir. There is speculation that the polls could be held in the next six to nine months.The commission has time till March 6 next year to redraw the boundaries and create new constituencies.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last month held a meeting with leaders of mainstream political parties from Jammu and Kashmir where he stressed that the delimitation exercise has to happen quickly so that polls can be held in the UT.Once the delimitation exercise is completed, the number of assembly seats in Jammu and Kashmir will go up from 83 to 90.Twenty-four seats of the assembly continue to remain vacant as they fall under Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Panun Kashmir objects to delimitation exercise based on 2011 Census
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu to steer Punjab Cong with 4 working presidents||Congress interim chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday appointed Navjot Singh Sidhu, 57, as the new president of the Punjab Congress, along with four working presidents, after weeks of speculations and wrangling in the state unit. Sidhu has been elevated to the top party position in the state with immediate effect despite strong opposition from chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. The four working presidents who have been appointed to assist Sidhu in the run-up to next year’s state assembly elections are Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel and Kuljit Singh Nagra. The five appointments will pave the way for the revamp of the organizational set-up that was disbanded by the Congress president in January 2020. “Before the formal announcement was made, the Amritsar East MLA had already started reaching out to cabinet ministers, legislators and other senior party leaders and is expected to hit the ground running. However, there is a feeling in the party that the announcement may worsen the rift as Capt Amarinder continues to be upset with Sidhu. Though he told AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat, who was in Chandigarh to inform him about the changes, that any decision of the Congress president would be acceptable to him, Capt refused to meet Sidhu till he tenders a public apology for making derogatory remaks against him. A former cricketer-turned-politician, Sidhu, a four-time MP, joined the Congress from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the 2017 state assembly polls. Though he was inducted into the state cabinet as the local government minister, tourism and cultural affairs minister, his relations with Amarinder were uneasy from the start. Sidhu quit the cabinet after his portfolio was changed by Amarinder in 2019 and went into a sulk before turning into a trenchant critic of the chief minister. However, he continued to have access to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra which, according to political observers, has worked for him. Capt opposed his elevation, citing his lack of seniority in the Congress and community equations as both are Jat Sikhs and belong to Patiala. He was advocating a Hindu face for the post. The Congress has tried to ensure caste and religious balance by appointing four working presidents. The appointments also bear Rahul’s stamp as both Nagra and Danny were part of his team of young leaders in the state.Gilzian, a three-time MLA from Urmar, belongs to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and remained sore over the neglect of legislators from the community. Danny, a first-time MLA from Jandiala, is a young Dalit leader with an MBA from London. His father Sardul Singh was a minister in Amarinder’s first tenure. Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Nagra is a Jat Sikh. He has been relieved from his present responsibility as AICC in-charge of Sikkim, Nagaland and Tripura. The fourth working president, Pawan Goel, is from the Hindu community. A lowkey leader, Goel, who hails from Jaitu, come from the family of traditional Congressmen. He is presently chairman of the Faridkot District Planning Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-to-steer-punjab-cong-with-4-working-presidents-101626637641491.html
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||3-day heavy rain prediction in J&K||The meteorological department on Sunday predicted heavy rainfall in Jammu and Kashmir between July 19 and 21. The showers may affect Eid-ul-Azha preparations and disturb tourist itineraries. Eid-ul-Azha will be celebrated in J&K on Wednesday with thousands of people buying sacrificial animals ahead of the festival. The weather office on Sunday advised people living on higher reaches to remain cautious while tourists and trekkers have been advised to avoid camping on mountain or riversides owing to chances of flash floods.“From Sunday night, we will see heavy rainfall in Jammu and moderate to heavy showers in Kashmir,” said meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir.Locals, who have been facing economic distress owing to lockdowns over the last two years are hoping that this year’s festivities go on without a hitch. “We are praying that this Eid brings emotional and economic respite. I was hoping to sell many sacrificial animals this year. I hope it does not rain,” said Mohammad Amin, who was selling sacrificial animals on the roadside in Old City.Weekend Covid curfew remains in force in four districts of the UT, while night curfew restrictions are in place in all 20 districts. “Sales are already down as few people will sacrifice animals this Eid due to the Covid,” said another meat dealer, Firdous Ahmad. The system is most likely to cause lightning and thunder along with widespread rainfall, primarily in the Pirpanjal Range and the Valley. “We may be celebrating Eid amid rainfall, though the mercury, which has been hovering around 34°C in Srinagar and 35°C in Jammu, may drop by around five to six notches,” he said. The weather office said that there may be temporary disruption of traffic mainly on the Jammu- Srinagar highway, Srinagar-Leh higwhay, Doda- Kishtawar road and Mughal Road. “There are chances of landslides and shooting stones at vulnerable places and waterlogging and minor floods over low-lying areas. Suspension of agricultural and horticultural operations during above period is advised,” Mir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3day-heavy-rain-prediction-in-jk-101626637401397.html
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of Eid, Covid containment curbs to continue in J&K||In the countdown to Eid ul-Azha, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday said it will continue with existing Covid containment measures for a week, with the exception that shops will be allowed to open an hour early two days before the festival. Eid-ul-Azha will be celebrated in Jammu and Kashmir on July 21. Last week, the administration had lifted the weekend curfew in 16 of 20 districts of the UT. The order had permitted shops to open on all days from 7am to 7pm with a daily night curfew from 8pm in these 16 districts. “It has also been seen that the daily cases in the past few days have shown an uneven trend. As such, there is a need to continue with the existing Covid containment measures in these districts,” said State Executive Committee chairperson and chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta’s order.“Deputy commissioners may allow shops to open at 6 am instead of 7am to avoid rush on July 19 and 20 as per their assessment,” the order said.Phased opening of educational institutions after July 31The government has also decided to allow phased opening of higher educational institutions after July 31 subject to vaccination of students and staff. The administration permitted public and private educational institutions to seek personal attendance of limited vaccinated staff for administrative purposes.“Higher educational institutes and skill development centres may be considered for phased reopening for on-site learning after July 31 subject to the vaccination status of the students and staff,” it said.In a review meeting on Friday, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha had directed officials be prepared to deal with a possible third wave of the coronavirus or any future health emergencies.Atal Dulloo, additional chief secretary, health and medical education department had said J&K’s positivity rate had reduced to 0.3%.“ Eighteen districts are in the green xone as per a new set indicators, with 99% of the population in the 45 and above age group now vaccinated with the first dose,” he said.

He further said Amarinder should seek apology from the Sikh Community for committing sacrilege of Gutka Sahib and playing hide and seek on the issue of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib as part of a “secret understanding with the Badal family”. He also owes an apology to the people of Punjab for letting loose ‘mafia raj’. “I would advise Navjot Singh Sidhu not to surrender as it’s the time to uphold the dignity of democratic values and the majesty of constitutional democracy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-owes-an-apology-not-sidhu-bir-devinder-101626636801554.html
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Protesting employees, pensioners clash with cops in Hoshiarpur||Employees and pensioners protesting against the Punjab government on Sunday had a scuffle with police when they tried to march towards the residence of Punjab industries and commerce minister Sunder Sham Arora.The protesters under the banner of Punjab UT Employees and Pensioners Joint Front alleged that they were lathicharged by the police. The officials, however, refuted the charges of cane-charge and said the protesters were only stopped from moving towards the minister’s residence. The union members marched towards Arora’s residence on Jodhamal Road after holding a rally but the police put up barricades a few hundred metres away to stop them. The protesters held a dharna on the road and insisted that either they be allowed to go to Arora’s house or the minister himself reach out to them to accept their memorandum. When they tried to break the barricades, they were confronted by the police. Turbans of a number of union leaders were tossed off during the scuffle.“The demonstrators tried to push through the barricades even though they were asked to send a small delegation to meet the minister. The cops simply prevented them from mobbing the minister’s residence. No one was lathicharged,” said senior superintendent of police Navjot Singh Mahal.Later, the union leaders issued a statement, warning a state-level agitation against the minister and the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesting-employees-pensioners-clash-with-cops-in-hoshiarpur-101626636743034.html
19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-BJYM Punjab chief defends remark against state leadership over farm protests||Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM)’s former Punjab president Mohit Gupta on Sunday defended his recent statements against the BJP’s state leadership over the ongoing farm protests while replying to a show-cause notice issued to him. Gupta, a state executive member of the BJP who belongs to Bathinda, said he never indulged in any “anti-party” activity, but always spoke about the party’s interests.“Is it indiscipline to talk about ‘arhtiyas’, industrialists, small traders and labourers? I neither spoke against the Centre’s farm laws nor against central leaders,” wrote Gupta in his reply, adding that he is a “committed party worker.”The notice was issued on Friday by Vinod Kumar Binta, BJP’s Bathinda district president, on the directions of state president Ashwani Sharma. Gupta was given two days to explain as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for his “anti-party” activities.When asked about his future plan, Gupta, who is also associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the saffron party, said he would continue to work for the party at the grassroots level.However, he made scathing attack at state president Ashwani Sharma for his inability to apprise the central leadership about the ground situation being faced by the party cadre on the political front. “Initially, farmers protesting against the three agriculture laws in Punjab had a few demands that could have been handled had the party unit made some efforts. The incompetent party leadership failed and when committed party workers express concern, the same leadership has started issuing notices. Just seven months are left for the assembly polls and it has become difficult for party workers even to come out of their homes due to the lingering agitation,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exbjym-punjab-chief-defends-remark-against-state-leadership-over-farm-protests-101626636741859.html

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Flurry of activities end with elevation of Sidhu||The Congress high command named former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu as the new president of Punjab Congress along with four working presidents on a day full of hectic political activity and uncertainty as the wait for the formal announcement was getting longer. Both warring factions in the state Congress held meetings of their supporters to fortify their positions on the revamp of the organisational set-up even as the present incumbent Sunil Jakhar called a meeting of party legislators and district unit chiefs on Monday for passing a resolution and facilitate a solution. The meeting has been called off following the announcement. The day began with Sidhu, who was tipped to take over as the Punjab Congress chief and met nearly 30 party leaders, including Jakhar, ministers and MLAs on Saturday, going from district to district and reaching out to MLAs in Patiala, Khanna and Jalandhar to demonstrate the support he is getting. The formal announcement of the former minister’s appointment was considered a formality but was stuck owing to strong opposition from chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. In Delhi, nine of the 11 Congress MPs from Punjab held a meeting and decided to throw their weight behind Amarinder. They also sought time from Congress president Sonia Gandhi for a meeting to push their case, said people aware of developments. The Congress MPs’ meeting, seen as a show of strength, was held at the residence of Partap Singh Bajwa who has buried his differences with the chief minister and had a dinner meeting with him at his farmhouse in Mohali on Saturday. Barring Ambika Soni and Amar Singh, all other party MPs, from the state, including Capt’s MP wife Preneet Kaur, were present. “Discussion with @INCIndia Rajya Sabha & Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab to devise a strategy on farmers’ issues in upcoming monsoon sesson of the Parliament,” Bajwa tweeted with photos. Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dullo, who attended the meeting, said there are a lot of things going on in the state. “We have informed the Congress president and sought time from her for a discussion on Punjab Congress affairs and other burning issues. I spoke to her and have sent a letter to her today, saying that if the party wants to retain power, a Dalit should head the state unit,” he said. Besides the party MPs, 10 MLAs, including three AAP legislators who recently joined the party, also issued a joint statement in CM’s support, urging the Congress leadership not to let him down as “because of his unrelenting efforts, the party stands well entrenched in Punjab”. “Sidhu was a celebrity and was no doubt an asset to the party, but condemning and critcising his own party and government in public has only created a rift in the cadres and weakened it,” they said in a statement released by Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who is among the three new entrants. Harminder Singh Gill, Kuldeep Vaid, Fatehjang Bajwa, Gurpreet Singh GP, Balwinder Laddi, Santokh Bhalaipur, Joginder Pal, Jagdev Kamalu and Pirmal Singh are among the MLAs who issued the statement. They also supported Singh’s decision not to meet Sidhu unitl he publicly tenders an apology for his “derogatory” tweets against him. Amarinder and Sidhu have been at loggerheads and the latter repeatedly targeted the CM through his tweets and a spree of interviews. While Sidhu is still to respond to Capt’s apology demand, dissenting cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa spoke out in his favour, stating that if Amarinder can forget (Partap Singh) Bajwa’s letters against him, then he should also forget Sidhu’s tweets in the interest of the party. “What MPs are saying does not matter as the state will go to polls next year to elect MLAs,” he told reporters. Jakhar’s bid to break the impasse As Sunday’s developments signalled the hardening of positions by both sides, Jakhar called all 80 party MLAs and district presidents for the meeting in Chandigarh to pass a resolution that whatever decision is taken by the Congress high command would be acceptable to all. Later, former Union minister Ashwani Kumar said the decision of the Congress high command to appoint Sidhu as the new party chief in Punjab should now be gracefully accepted by all in the interest of party. “This is a time to be united. There are no victors or losers. Reconciliation is the way forward,” he said, adding that magnanimity is expected on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flurry-of-activities-end-with-elevation-of-sidhu-101626636683692.html

CM Amarinder Singh was oblivious to the sufferings of the people and did nothing to help them when they needed electricity to sow paddy or run their factories and shops,” the SAD president said addressing party’s Hindu leaders in Chandigarh after he announced to appoint a community member as deputy CM in case the SAD-BSP alliance comes to power in 2022.Their government would revive trade and industry in the state by making investment-friendly policies besides reducing power tariffs for the sector, he said. Sukhbir said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal had tried to close down the thermal plants in Punjab by filing a petition in the Supreme Court after the power situation worsened. “Recently, he promised 300 units free and added that anyone with a bill of one more unit will have to pay the entire amount. Instead of befooling Punjabis, he should implement this in Delhi,” the SAD chief said. Those present included NK Sharma, Parkash Chand Garg, Sarup Chand Singla, Harish Rai Dhanda, Vishnu Sharma, Prem Valecha, Ashok Aneja, Harpal Juneja, Rajinder Deepa, Kabir Dass, Ashok Sharma, Ashok Manan and Keemti Bhagat and party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-doing-drama-to-replace-failed-cm-in-punjab-sukhbir-101626636682360.html

He was seen in the company of Congress leaders for the second consecutive day leading to speculations that he was cosying up to the Congress. Anil had been a minister in Virbhadra Singh’s Cabinet but had switched to the BJP ahead of the assembly elections. However, the saffron party had forced him to step down from CM Jai Ram Thakur’s Cabinet after the Congress nominated his son Ashray Sharma for the Lok Sabha polls. Ashray had lost to BJP’s Ramswaroop Sharma who was found dead at his official residence in Mandi necessitating a bypoll. Anil was also sidelined during the municipal corporation polls when the party did not seek his help in canvassing and chose to rely on the political acumen of minister Mahender Singh Thakur instead. Ashray has shown interest in contesting the Lok Sabha polls again, while the Congress is also persuading former health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur to contest from Mandi. Congress state general secretary and Kullu’s legislator Sunder Thakur’s name has also cropped up for candidature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjplegislator-anil-sharma-seen-cosying-up-to-congress-leaders-in-himachal-101626636562368.html

19-07-2021||Chandigarh||Politicking picks up in Arki after Virbhadra Singh’s death||Days after veteran Congress leader and former six-time Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh passed away, politicking has picked up in the Arki assembly segment that fell vacant after his death.Two-time BJP legislator Govind Ram Sharma, who had been denied a ticket during the last election has staked claim to the BJP ticket; while Virbhadra Singh’s loyalists hoping to contest polls from Arki have approached his wife, former Lok Sabha member Pratibha Singh. Around a dozen leaders met up at Darlaghat under the ambit of Arki Kalyan (Welfare) Society that is known for it biggest cement plant in north India on Sunday and projected Sharma as the BJP candidate for the bypoll. Leaders who pledged their support to Sharma included Zila Parishad members who had rebelled against the saffron party.Still a loyal soldier: BJP’s Govind Ram Sharma“I am still a loyal soldier of the party though I was denied a ticket. I have selflessly worked day and night for the BJP,” said Sharma, who called the meeting “non-political”.The meeting had been convened by Surinder Thakur, a non-gazetted officers’ association leader. “ We had invited people from all walks of life to put forth their views regarding the future political scenario in Arki. Most people supported Sharma,” said Thakur, adding that representatives from 70 panchayats and 350 people participated in the discussion. Also in attendence were Amar Singh Thakur, a Zila Parishad member and son of former minister Hari Dass, and Asha Parishar, the daughter of former BJP minister Nagin Chandra Pal. Many BJP workers skipped the meeting. In 2003, Sharma had lost to Congress’s Dharampal Thakur with a narrow margin of 522. Sharma was elected to the assembly in 2007 and then in 2012 but later the BJP denied him a ticket and fielded Ram Rattan Pal Singh against former chief minister Virbhadra Singh. Sharma was neither made chairperson of any board or corporation nor given in a position in the party. The constituency had attained a high-profile status after being represented by Virbhadra Singh, who had contested elections from Arki rather than Shimla (rural) to make place for his son Vikramaditya Singh, a first-time legislator.Cong wants to pitch Virbhadra Singh’s wife or son Supporters of Virbhadra Singh had recently met both Vikramaditya Singh and his mother Pratibha Singh at Padam Palace, Rampur. The delegation had invited Pratibha Singh to contest the Vidhan Sabha elections. The family was busy performing Virbhadra Singh’s last rites and said they had not decided on a future course of action. A section of Congress leaders want Vikramaditya to contest the Lok Sabha polls. With bypolls to the Mandi Lok Sabha and three assembly segments of Arki, Jubbal-Kotkhai and Fatehpur due in some time, both parties are weighing their options. The former CM had won the seat by 6,051 votes in the 2017 polls, which was much less than his margin of 19,033 votes from Shimla (rural) in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/politicking-picks-up-in-arki-after-virbhadra-singh-s-death-101626635422306.html
19-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 31 killed, 6 injured as rain lashes city over weekend||As heavy rain lashed the city since Saturday night, at least 31 people were killed and six injured in landslides and house collapses in Chembur, Vikhroli and Bhandup and a short-circuit at Andheri. The downpour also brought back Mumbai’s most infamous monsoon scenes – suspended railway services, diverted buses and citizens forced to wade through the flooded roads. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), several areas in the city reported more than 200mm of rain between 11pm on Saturday and 4am on Sunday, with Dahisar and Chembur receiving the highest amount of rainfall. The BMC termed both the landslides a natural calamity, as the Chembur and Vikhroli shanties were located on hillslopes. In both cases, the structures were built illegally on collector’s land and the BMC maintained it had already appealed to citizens to vacate their houses.Around 1 am, a landslide was reported in New Bharat Nagar area of Mahul in Chembur. Due to the landslide, part of a retaining wall collapsed on five houses. Nineteen people lost their lives, of which four were minors. Five, including a 15-year-old teenager, were injured. All victims were rushed to nearby civic-run Rajawadi Hospital.Officials said they had already asked the residents of the slums to vacate the houses. According to BMC, the land on which structures were built belonged to a suburban collector and all houses were illegal. Bharat Marathe, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “We had issued an advisory to the citizens residing in landslide-prone zones to vacate their houses and shift to safe locations. We had pasted notices in the area and also given advertisements in the newspapers appealing citizens to vacate their houses before the monsoon.”Marathe added, “The land is owned by the suburban collector, and they should shift the structures. However, on the directions of the municipal commissioner, we have decided to shift a few citizens temporarily in houses meant for project-affected persons. These will have to be vacated in the coming days. The mud and rocks, along with rainwater, came with force, which mainly resulted in the deaths.” Sandeep Saroj, who lives near the site, said, “My options are limited. I do not earn enough to rent another house. I will go back to my native place and stay with my parents until the monsoon ends. I will have to quit my job now.” Around 3am, a similar landslide was reported in Surya Nagar in Vikhroli, where boulders came crashing. At least eight houses collapsed, killing 10 and injuring one. Seven deaths were from three families in three houses. In this incident too, the land on which around 35,000 citizens resided belongs to a suburban collector. Vibhas Achrekar, assistant municipal commissioner, said, “We had done a survey and advised citizens residing on top to vacate their houses. We had displayed notices in the area and alerted the citizens thrice, but they did not pay any heed. The land is owned by a suburban collector but for now we are shifting around 40 citizens from the area to a civic-run school on a temporary basis. Of these 40 people, thirty are from the Vikhroli landslide zone and the remaining 10 people from Bhandup.” Dipu Tewari, who lived in Vikhroli with a family of eight, said, “We had two houses of which my one house collapsed. I had gone to work for my night shift and suddenly I got a call that there is a landslide. I have lost two of my relatives. All my family members were awake and ready to rush out. But everything happened suddenly.” At both the Chembur and Vikhroli spots, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) had to take assistance from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which carried out search and rescue operations for over a 12-hour period on Sunday.A house collapse at Bhandup killed a 16-year-old teenager around 5am. A 26-year-old man was killed in a short-circuit in a sweet shop at Andheri West.Between 11pm on Saturday and 4am on Sunday, the island city reported 167mm of rain, western suburbs reported 178mm of rain and eastern suburbs reported 177mm of rainfall.

The court also pointed out that the illegal structures later get regularised, resulting in the state government having to give up the ownership of the property.In an earlier hearing in another related issue, HC had noted that such government land was being considered as the state’s “paternal property” and the practice of unauthorised constructions should be stopped. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Harishchandra Mhatre – right to information (RTI) activist and employee of Ambernath Municipal Corporation – was informed by advocate Shriram Kulkarni that a large number of middle class families in Dombivli were getting fleeced by developers who were constructing buildings illegally on state and KDMC-owned land. The petitions stated that while Mhatre had been trying to highlight the issue by writing to various authorities since 2018, he had not received any responses and hence, he filed RTI queries pertaining to a few structures that had been constructed recently in Dombivli. Mhatre stated that the replies to the RTI query were given to him only after he filed appeals. The responses showed that the corporation had issued notices to some of the developers and project owners, but beyond that nothing had been done to safeguard the interests of the middle class families who had purchased flats in the these residential buildings. In light of these submissions, the petition sought directions to the corporation to conduct a survey of the alleged illegal/unauthorised structures and stay the constructions wherever they were on. The PIL also sought action against the officials concerned. After hearing the submissions, the state – represented by government pleader PP Kakade and advocate Nisha Mehra – informed the bench that they had written to the civic authorities in January, seeking information pertaining to the allegations made in the PIL, but so far they had not received any instructions. The court was then informed that the corporation was not represented, though it was served a copy of the PIL. “We note that the allegations as made in the petition, which are in regard to the unauthorised constructions on government and municipal corporation lands, as also some unauthorised construction on private lands, are quite serious,” said the bench and directed the respondents to file their replies and posted hearing of the PIL on July 29. In an earlier hearing of a suo motu PIL initiated by HC in light of the building collapse in Bhiwandi, which resulted in the loss of nearly 40 lives last year, the bench had taken up the issue of the recent building collapse in Malwani, which saw 11 deaths. The court had appointed an inquiry commissioner, and after perusing its report, which stated that most of the structures were illegal and were on government owned land, had observed, “It seems that the state-owned land is considered as paternal property by the executive.” The court took strict cognisance of the fact that as these unauthorised and illegal structures were provided protection under one or the other scheme, the land had to be written off, thus causing a loss to the state. The court had held that this needed to stop and had asked the state to consider setting up a separate body to oversee illegal constructions, especially those coming up on state or corporation-owned land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/respond-to-issue-of-illegal-structures-on-govt-land-bombay-hc-to-state-kdmc-101626635300713.html

Raut said that as votes cannot be sought in the upcoming state Assembly elections on the Ram Mandir issue, as it has been resolved, the proposed law is being seen as an experiment to divide Hindu and Muslim communities. He, however, also opined that such a law is an attempt to control the population of the country and should not be seen against any particular religion.“The Yogi Adityanath] government of UP is bringing a law to control the population of the state, which has created a political turmoil. As the Ram Mandir issue has been resolved, and it is difficult to seek votes in its name, this law is said to be an experiment to divide the Hindu and Muslim communities in the state,” Raut wrote in his column.On World Population Day (July 11), UP chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath launched a population policy which aims to incentivise couples who do not have more than two babies. The UP law commission that has formulated a population control bill said the policy would be voluntary and nobody would be forced to follow any rule. However, if any person decides on his or her own to not have more than two babies, they will be eligible for government schemes, while those who do not follow the policy, will face restrictions in government jobs, availing ration and other benefits.Raut also supported the law and said that it is in the interest of the country to control the population and any such move needs to be appreciated. He then cautioned people against looking at the bill through the prism of religion. “A law (The Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Act) was passed against Triple Talaq, which was much appreciated by Muslim women in the country as it has freed them from the shackles of slavery. Ending the tradition of Triple Talaq wasn’t against any religion, and any attempt to control the population should also not be seen against any religion,” the Shiv Sena MP, who has been critical of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after both the saffron parties snapped their ties in 2019.Earlier, the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had slammed the UP CM for his “much hyped” two-child policy. The state’s ruling party said that the UP CM is making a lot of noise over the policy, which is not new for Maharashtra as it has been in place in the state for the past 21 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sena-slams-bjp-on-population-control-bill-101626635063276.html

The central investigative agency had on Friday provisionally attached the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader’s assets worth ₹4.20 crore in a money laundering case. A team of six to eight ED officers, accompanied by a team of armed Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, reached the two houses around 7am on Sunday and started a search operation, which continued till 2pm. Both the houses were cordoned off by CRPF jawans. ED, which joined the investigation, last month arrested Deshmukh’s aides Kundan Shinde and Sanjeev Palande, and summoned Deshmukh and his family members. Deshmukh or his close relatives were not present in the houses at Katol and Wadvihira at the time of the raid, following which ED officers reportedly interrogated one Pankaj Deshmukh, diwan of Deshmukh family, and seized several documents. ED had also raided Deshmukh’s Civil Lines residence here last month and interrogated his wife Aarti and son Rishi. ED officers refused to divulge details of the investigation. Two days ago on Friday, one residential flat owned by Deshmukh in Mumbai’s Worli valued at ₹1.54 crore, and 25 land parcels in Dhutum village in Raigad district of Maharashtra with a book value of ₹2.67 crore were attached by the ED. The agency then also issued summons to his wife Aarti Deshmukh for questioning. Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that as a minister in the Maharashtra government, Deshmukh had asked suspended police officer Sachin Vaze and few others to extort ₹100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Following the allegations, the Bombay high court (HC) ordered a preliminary enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The agency later registered a first information report (FIR) against Deshmukh in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-raids-deshmukh-s-2-houses-in-nagpur-in-100-crore-extortion-case-101626634880723.html

All senior BMC officials need to be on high alert, identify sites with immediate possibility of landslides and shift residents at such areas to safe places. They have also been asked to start construction of retaining walls near landslide-prone sites and forcibly evacuate and rehabilitate people residing in extremely dangerous buildings. All senior officials will have to ensure that the operation of dewatering through pumps continues even at night, as on most occasions, rain intensifies at night. They have to identify the immediate possibility of landslide-prone sites and make announcements to shift residents to safer places during heavy rain to avoid accidents, CM said. “Forcibly evict the tenants from the C-1 (extremely dangerous) category dilapidated buildings,” he said.After landslides and waterlogging lead to 31 deaths following heavy rain, CM held a virtual meeting with senior officials from BMC, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada).

The monsoon session of Parliament starts tomorrow. Seeking the adjournment through a motion, to the Lok Sabha speaker, SAD MP from Bathinda Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that these three bills had been “pushed through the House in disregard of the opposition by the stakeholders – farmers, farm labourers and traders”. She also demanded that the House to include the names of the “martyrs of the farmers movement” and pay them tributes, when the obituaries are read out. “They have laid down their lives in a peaceful, democratic movement fighting for the just cause of the farmers and the farm labourers. The House must express solidarity with the farmers as well as regret the hardships faced and sacrifices made by them. This House must acknowledge their martyrdom,” she added. “The three farm laws are in brazen violation of the spirit of federalism as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Constitution of the country, as agriculture is a state subject,” she added. In her letter, Harsimrat pointed to the national outrage against these bills which have since been signed into laws despite opposition by millions of farmers of the country battling severe weather and adverse market conditions just to survive at the subsistence level. “Several hundred farmers and mazdoors have lost their lives in this struggle against the Central laws. The Central government has refused to show the sensitivity expected of a responsible and democratically elected government. Never in the history of free India has the country witnessed such outrage against a legislation passed by this House,” the letter adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sad-wants-ls-to-suspend-all-biz-repeal-3-farm-laws-101626634702767.html

Till Sunday evening, he hadn’t broken the news to his wife that she had lost her parents and two sisters to the wall collapse in Chembur, on Saturday midnight.Gawde’s in-laws—Pandit Godse, 50 and Chaya, 47 along with his two sister-in-laws—-Prachi Pandit Godse, 15, and Pallavi Dupargude, 32 were declared dead on arrival at the hospital. The body of his third sister-in-law Pratiksha Pandit, 18, was still missing till Sunday evening.“I can’t tell her that the monsoon she was eagerly waiting for has made her an orphan,” said Gawde.Gawde lives just 200 meters away from his in-laws in Chembur’s Bharat Nagar. On Saturday midnight, when the walls collapsed on their shanties, Gawde rushed to the spot within minutes but couldn’t find them due to the speed of the water flow.“My wife also rushed to rescue them but we couldn’t find them. We couldn’t find anyone since it was also pitch dark. After hours of search, when we couldn’t find them, she started having anxiety attacks and fainted. So, I lied to her that her family members are fine and undergoing treatment at the hospital,” said Gawde.Dupargude is survived by her husband and two children aged 10 and 12 years. Gawde is thankful to God that his nieces didn’t fall victim to the tragedy. “On Saturday, the children went to their tuition classes. While returning, they visited us when it started pouring outside. So, I informed Pallavi that the children will stay with us for the night. This helped to save the lives of the children,” he said.When asked if they know that they have lost their mother, Gawde said, “No, I have lied to them also. They don’t know anything, and hoping to meet their mother soon.”‘Don’t know who will take care of the child now’The landslide turned the 13-year-old Diksha Gautam Pardhe, into an orphan overnight. Her parents — Gautam and Sheela along with her siblings—Shubham, 7, and elder sister Shruthi, 18 were declared dead on arrival at Rajawadi Hospital. After post-mortem, their bodies were handed over to the family on Sunday evening for last rites.Pardhe was playing with Shubham in their room when a wall suddenly collapsed on their shanty. Before she could even realise anything, she was flowing away from her family by the gushing waters. While she was drowning, she was rescued by a local. In an unconscious state, she was rushed to Shiv Hospital, Chembur (East). When she opened her eyes, unaware of the fact that she has lost her whole family in the accident, her first question was, ‘Where is my brother?’.“Within a day, she has become an orphan. We haven’t told her anything. She is too young to even understand what has happened. We don’t know who will take care of the child now,” said Adhikari Ahera, her aunty while sobbing at Rajawadi Hospital.Her uncle Sunil Pardhe, who stayed just 300 meters away from Diksha’s chawl, has been taking care of the girl in the hospital. “She can sense something wrong has happened to her family. She keeps asking me about her parents and siblings. She is already in a shock, we don’t want to put more pressure on her by telling her the truth at present,” he said.Ahera said the state government should at least sponsor her studies until she turns 21.‘He will have to start his life from the scratch’Akshay Suryakant Zimor, 26, was lying silently on his bed at Rajawadi Hospital with injuries in his back, while tears welled out his eyes. On Sunday night, he pulled out the bodies of his parents and younger sister from the debris at the Chembur wall collapse. He is an orphan now. “I don’t know why I should live anymore. I have lost my whole family including my younger sister. Being a brother, it was my responsibility to save her but I was too late. It was too dark to see anything in the downpour,” lamented Zimor. His friends who stayed nearby, rushed to help him when they heard about the wall collapse. But it was too late. Amidst the chaos, Zimor successfully rescued two people including the 13-year-old girl, Diksha Gautam Pardhe who also became an orphan after losing her family to the accident. “By the time he could figure out his parents, it was too late. Then, he identified them and pulled them out of the mud and debris, including his only sister,” said Ganesh Mote, his friend. Akshay has sustained injuries in his back and shoulder but is stable now. “He is not talking to any of us as he is still in shock. He has not only lost his family but also his house and documents. He will have to start his life from the scratches,” said Mote who also complained that due to the short circuit from the electric boards in the rain, the water caught the electrical current which obstructed the rescue operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rains-wreak-havoc-in-mumbai-survivors-families-narrate-ordeal-101626634700721.html

The funds have been transferred to the accounts of the schools concerned.As per instructions, school authorities can design these parks in accordance with the space available on their campus. They can take the help of the arts and crafts teachers for this. If there is shortage of space for a park, authorities can set up the models in any of the rooms in the school. Information regarding all the two and three-dimensional models will be displayed in English and Punjabi.The school authorities can also get students to share their ideas to develop these parks. “Educational parks have a great academic significance and can inspire students, particularly in subjects such as Science, Maths and Social Studies.

19-07-2021||Lucknow||Open to alliance, have worked to strengthen party organisation: Priyanka||To go or not to go for an alliance is the question that appears on the top of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s mind as she gears up her party organisation for 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.This became evident at various informal interactions that Priyanka had with party workers and others before winding up her three-day tour here on Sunday.Those aware of the developments said Priyanka, at one such informal interaction with media persons here on Sunday, said, “I am open to an alliance.”“I have worked to strengthen party organisation to ensure it remains in place, if I move on,” said Priyanka informally. Her observations led to speculation that she, being national general secretary may be elevated and assigned a bigger role or charge of some other state. A Congress functionary, however, said there was no such move.She also indicated how the “ekla chalo re” (going it alone) route may help the Congress in strengthening the party in the long run, saying the party would not take any steps that may weaken, or harm it and her party’s main objective was to defeat the BJP in the 2022 polls.“Priyanka is well aware of the fact that it is too early to say anything on the issue. The alliances have not helped the Congress in the past, be it the party’s alliance with the BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) in 1996 or with the SP (Samajwadi Party) in 2017. So, it’s going to be tough call for the leadership,” said a party leader.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has often indicated that his party has had bitter experiences of allying with bigger parties (with Congress in 2017 assembly elections and with the BSP in 2019 Lok Sabha polls) and his party would, therefore, go for tie-ups with smaller parties. “The Congress cannot survive without any alliance in the 2022 assembly elections under the prevailing political situation in the state. Any alliance with smaller parties will not work. So, the Congress should negotiate either with the Samajwadi Party or the BSP for an alliance. An alliance with the SP will be in the interest of the Congress though the former will have its own terms,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.Priyanka also hinted that she would devote more time to the state to gear up the party organisation for the polls. She laid emphasis on making the old guard and youngsters in her party work together. Another party leader said Priyanka wanted the party to reach out to the veterans and senior leaders have been asked to treat them with respect. The Congress general secretary countered the BJP’s accusations that she was a political tourist and said she has been regularly visiting the state. She also said the accusation was part of BJP’s propaganda to project her and her brother Rahul Gandhi as non-serious leaders and she would not be cowed down by such accusations.She said the party workers had been asked to work harder to strengthen the organisation at the booth level now. “For the past one and a half years, our effort has been to take the Congress organisation (to the grassroots). We want to strengthen it further at the grassroots level now,” she said, addressing party workers on Saturday.She praised the party workers for extending help to people in fight against Covid-19 and said the Congress workers were the first ones to reach wherever there was any problem. She asked the partymen to work round the clock for the next seven months for the 2022 assembly elections.WITH AGENCY INPUTS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/open-to-alliance-have-worked-to-strengthen-party-priyanka-101626634522058.html
19-07-2021||Other||Few women on top: Time to STEM the gender gap||Few women make it to senior positions at the major science institutes in the country and fewer still hold chair professorships — the highest academic honour granted to faculty by an institute — data accessed from various institutes has revealed. At most science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) institutes, women faculty members constitute less than 20% of all professor positions. For instance, at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Madras, only 31 (10.2%) out of 304 professors are women. At IIT-Bombay (IIT-B), 25 out of 143 professors (17.5%) are women. None of the IITs have had a woman director. Neither have the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, or Mumbai’s Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Last month, IIT-B became the first institute in the country to set up a chair professorship for women. However, only four of its existing chairs are held by women. At IIT-Madras, three out of 53 chairs are held by women. Only one of the nine chairs at IISc is held by a woman scientist. Chair is a term for endowed professorships as recognition of a faculty member’s contribution to the university in terms of research and academics. Experts said that the number of women in senior positions is skewed because the women opting for careers in STEM are low. This problem is aggravated by the unconscious bias and lack of proactive measures by institutes to improve the number of women in the workforce, they said. “I believe that in the academic sector, differential treatment happens mainly through unconscious bias. I feel it is because our thinking and policies are not inclusive. There is a difference in policies being discriminatory — which is quite often conscious — and policies not being inclusive, as the latter is quite often unconscious,” Rohini Godbole, centre for high energy physics, IISc said. Last year, Godbole was recognised by France for her work towards improving the visibility of women in STEM and awarded the Ordre National du Merite, the highest distinction granted by the country. Entry point Godbole said, “I think the major reason [for less number of women in senior positions] is just that their numbers are small at the starting level itself. The cause is of course not helped by the fact that the institutions and administrations are not proactive about getting gender balance in persons in position of authority. This lack of awareness and a kind of ‘invisible’ bias is the second major reason for under-representation of women in leadership positions at academic institutions.” Various institutes are now taking affirmative measures to improve the number of women students. For instance, IITs have introduced the supernumerary seats to increase the number of women to 20%. While these steps have improved the number of women studying science, data shows that not many are retained in the field thereafter. According to a 2020 report by the United Nations, 43% of all graduates in STEM fields in India are women—the highest in the world. However, the report also found that only 14% of 280,000 scientists, engineers and technologists employed in research institutions in the country are women. Barriers in the way Science writer Nandita Jayaraj, who co-created ‘The Life of Science’ that journals biographies of women scientists, said, “Almost all challenges are due to systemic bias. Our website is full of evidence of this.” “Systemic discrimination is a very strong part of the problem. For example, the fraction of women hired by a faculty hiring process should match the fraction of women among those with the requisite qualifications. But this is mostly not the case,” said Prajval Shastri, a retired astrophysicist from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, who advocates intersectional feminism in academic spaces. In 2017, the Niti Aayog surveyed over 900 women and 500 women students in science. In its report, the Niti Aayog made recommendations for best practices for promoting entry and retention of women in science. It recommends flexibility in service continuity norms. “Career breaks need to be accommodated, as women scientists have dual commitments. Seniority based on total number of years of work experience or service rather than continuous service may help to retain talent and experience by allowing for re-entry of women scientists, which would otherwise be lost permanently,” read the report. Leaky pipeline The natural career progression for faculty members is to go from assistant professor to associate professor and then full professor. Numbers suggest that women faculty members fall out of this career path as they climb up the ladder. For instance, at IIT-Delhi, 23.1% of all associate professors are women, but only 14.3% of all professors are women. Only nine out of all 80 chairs are held by women faculty. Shastri said that there are several forms of inherent and systemic bias that can prevent the hiring of women or promotions to elevated positions. “Women are often assumed to be the primary caregivers of the family and are therefore liable to compromise on their professional commitments. There are hidden norms followed while hiring women or handing them senior positions. One such norm is that women spouses of already hired faculty, however meritorious, will not be hired,” she said. Way ahead Last year, the department of science and technology (DST) announced Gender Advancement Through Transforming Institutions (GATI), which is a pilot project aimed at improving diversity in higher education institutes. The institutes that sign the charter of GATI will conduct self-assessment and accreditation for adopting the principles of GATI within their policies, practices, action plans and institutional culture. However, even well-intentioned interventions are often steeped in patriarchy, said Shastri. “Interventions such as the mobility scheme offered by DST should not only be open to scientists of all genders and in a broader set of long-term relationships, their framing also needs to eschew patriarchy,” she said. Jayaraj said institutions have consistently failed to enact recommendations made by academies and social scientists. “While many solutions exist by policy, the implementation is abysmal. If you study closely, even recent schemes like GATI and Science, Technology and innovation Policy 2020 don’t convincingly promise any actual change,” she said. In 2019, the Gender in Physics Working Group of the Indian Physics Association formulated a charter for gender equity in physics that makes recommendations for institutes and departments to address the gender disparity. “The Hyderabad Charter for Gender Equity in Physics, which has the endorsement of over 325 physicists from India, is one possible first step. All institutional leaders and decision makers regardless of gender need to make equity and justice their cause, and build their awareness of discriminatory social processes within higher education. They need to undergo bias training, monitor and survey their own microcosms to learn about what might be going wrong, and involve external diversity experts as observers of their institutional processes,” said Shastri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/few-women-on-top-time-to-stem-the-gender-gap-101626634461832.html

According to the police, the accused had executed the crime with an intention of robbing the victim, Harjinder Singh. The trio was identified as Gurvinder Singh alias Rimpi of Buyani village, the main conspirator, Jatinder Singh of Lehal village and Arshdeep Singh alias Aasu of Koohli Khurd village. Police have recovered some money, a gold ring, a licensed .32 bore revolver, six bullets and a dummy weapon from Khatra Canal Bridge, where the accused had buried it.Deputy commissioner of police (DSP) Hardeep Singh said the trio knew that Harjinder, who lived in another village, used to come to Buyani frequently to inspect his ancestral house. As he was from a well-to-do family, the accused assumed the victim may have kept a huge amount of money in the house. Hoping to locate where he had stored the money, the accused slipped into his house on July 3 as soon as he arrived in the village.“Jatinder and Arshdeep waited inside the house while Gurvinder gave them minute-to-minute updates about Harjinder’s movement. As soon as Harjinder entered the house, the accused pounced on him and bludgeoned him to death with a brick. They dragged the body to the kitchen and fled after covering it with sacks,” the DSP revealed.Police had come to know about the murder on July 6 after the neighours grew suspicious of the foul smell emanating from the house. The body was found in a highly decomposed state.The DSP revealed that the three accused are already facing trial in different criminal cases, including drug peddling and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police produced them in the court on Sunday from where they were sent to two-day police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-buyani-murder-case-cracked-with-arrest-of-three-101626634461274.html

Local train services were disrupted on Central and Western Railway (WR) lines, and the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) had to divert its buses due to waterlogging in arterial roads, officials said.Local train services on Central Railway (CR) were disrupted on the mainline corridor between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan, while on the Harbour railway, services between CSMT and Mankhurd were disrupted, as railway tracks were submerged due to flooding at Kurla, Sion and Chunabhatti.“On Sunday morning, due to heavy rains and water on railway tracks at Kurla, Sion, Vidyavihar, Chunabhatti and Chembur, local trains were running cautiously, resulting in bunching on the mainline and Harbour line,” said a CR official.On WR, train services were disrupted on fast line due to waterlogging in railway sections between Prabhadevi and Dadar, Virar and Nallasopara. Slow services were operational between Churchgate and Borivli stations.Flooding on railway tracks has resulted in termination of 21 outstation trains on WR and 15 trains CR. Six outstation trains operating from the city were also cancelled. “Due to heavy rainfall last night and subsequent waterlogging at various locations between Prabhadevi-Dadar and Virar-Nallasopara, the services on WR were affected,” a WR statement read. Meanwhile, BEST diverted its buses on more than 37 routes including Milan Subway, Sheetal Cinema, SV Road (Bandra), Mankhurd station, Hindmata Cinema, Andheri Market, RCF Colony, Vakola Bridge and LBS Road (Kurla).According to the BEST officials, around 24 buses were stuck in waters and 10 had to be repaired following breakdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/public-transport-thrown-out-of-gear-in-mumbai-after-heavy-rainfall-101626634340688.html

The high cost of slaughtering, issues regarding transportation, and the failure to establish separate facilities for ‘Jhatka’ and ‘Halal’ meat, have kept the meat shop owners away.Though civic body authorities have been holding meetings with meat shop owners time and again to encourage them to use the facility, the response has been largely lukewarm.While in the initial few months, there were a few takers for the facility, footfall dried up completely in the months of May and June when the lockdown was in place. Though in July, the footfall improved, there is still a long way to go.Cashier of non-veg shopkeepers’ association, Rajesh, said, “The cost of slaughtering is very high. If a shopkeeper gets 2,000 birds slaughtered at the facility, he will have to pay ₹20,000 to the contractor. The same work can be done at a cost of ₹3,500-4,000 by hiring labour at the shop. Further, roadside vendors and small shopkeepers don’t have storage facilities to keep the slaughtered meat so they don’t prefer getting it done in advance.”Amandeep Singh, the owner of Friends Chicken in Dugri, said, “Though we have proper arrangements to dispose of the waste at our own outlet, we have started using this facility. It will take some time to streamline things. Roadside vendors and small shopkeepers are, however, reluctant to avail the facility.” An official, requesting anonymity, said the main reason why the facility has remained a non-starter is that the municipal corporation (MC) has been unable to check illegal slaughtering. “The city has around 1,000 meat retailers and 30 to 35 wholesale poultry sellers. At least 50,000 chickens are slaughtered in the city on a daily basis, but only around 400 are slaughtered at the MC facility. In March and April, shopkeepers cited the curfew and lockdown restrictions for not using the facility but even now, only a few shopkeepers are turning up, and that too, after the MC had initiated action against illegal slaughtering,” said the official, adding, “Apart from providing unhygienic meat to residents, the meat shop owners also dump the waste in MC sewer lines, which is harmful for the environment.” MC joint commissioner Swati Tiwana said, “We conducted meetings with meat shops owners and are working to find a solution for their problems, including the issue of transportation of meat. There has been a marginal increase in the number of shopkeepers showing up at the slaughterhouse and we expect the numbers will go up. Through this project, the MC wants to ensure that hygienic meat is provided to the residents.”Hanging fire for over a decade, the slaughterhouse project, worth ₹19.5 crore, was completed in January 2020 and operationalised in February this year. The facility can slaughter 2,000 poultry birds an hour, in two shifts of eight hours each, and 1,000 goats, sheep and pigs. The MC general house has fixed the rate of slaughtering a goat/sheep at ₹150, a poultry bird at ₹10 and a pig at ₹100. Officials said the facility also has an effluent treatment plant, a preservation and chilling facility, and a blood processing unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-slaughterhouse-facility-remains-a-nonstarter-101626634281923.html

In another related incident, three other Maoists from Odisha, who were involved in several encounters with the police, surrendered, dealing a double blow to the rebels.Senior police officials in Odisha said Sudheer alias Chikudu Chinna Rao, who was a divisional committee member and commander of Pedabayalu and Korukonda area committee of Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC) of Maoists, walked out due to sharp differences with non-tribals such as Gajarla Ravi, secretary of the above-mentioned committee, Aruna, Mahendra and Suresh. Sudheer himself is a tribal leader and a native of Pedabayalu Mandal in Andhra Pradesh, the officials said.The officials said that Sudheer has been questioning the non-tribal leaders over the killing of innocent tribals after branding them as police informers and accusing them of taking undue advantage of tribals’ simplicity.However, Aruna, secretary of Visakhapatnam East Division, claimed in a press release that Sudheer had been expelled from the party as he eloped with a girl named Mahita, deserting his wife and children.In other development, Talse Huika alias Talso, area committee member of Boipariguda area committee under Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee; Rame Podiami alias Sabita, commander of Maoists’ Palachalam local operational squad of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), and Raidhar Dhurua alias Raidhar, party member of the ultras’ Mahupadar local operational squad under DKSZC surrendered before Odisha police chief Abhay at Malkangiri on Sunday morning.Huika who hails from Narayanpatna block of Koraput district, joined the CPI (Maoist) organisation at the age of 13 in 2012 when she was inducted into the Jana Natya Mandali, the cultural troupe of Maoists in gross of child rights and depriving her of receiving formal education.Huika worked as a party member in 3rd CRC and protection team of central committee member Ramakrishna. She was promoted to area committee member in 2015 and worked in Pedabailu Area Committee till May 2021. Later, she was transferred to Boipariguda Area Committee and continued there till her surrender. She was involved in several cases of violence involving Maoists. Podiami had a reward of ₹2 lakh on her head and she had participated in many attacks on security forces in Sukma district.Similarly, Raidhar Dhurua alias Raidhar was given formal training of arms and IEDs by the Maoists and she conducted meetings to motivate villagers to join their frontal organisations and the militias.DGP Abhay said that in the last two years more than 20 active Maoist cadres and hundreds of active militias/Maoist sympathizers have surrendered in Malkangiri district. He said Maoist cadres willing to join the mainstream could take advantage of Odisha’s surrender and rehabilitation policy for the rebels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/major-blow-to-maoists-as-senior-leader-leaves-party-3-others-surrender-101626634102974.html

Yadwinder Singh, 80, who represents the 6th generation of Giani Sant Singh, a former head granthi at the Golden Temple, told HT on Sunday, “This is a tribute to Giani Sant Singh and was gifted by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who was happy at his supervision of the gold-plating of the Golden Temple. It was called ‘Sarad Khana’; these were underground rooms in the basement of a three-storey building. We were one of the four families, all of descendants, who lived there till 1988.” He added that this ‘Sarad Khana’ was attached with Gurdwara Jhanda Bunga in the shrine complex. “My forefathers used an underground path to perform their duties as granthis and give their discourse inside the Sri Darbar Sahib,” Yadwinder, who resides with family in Basant Avenue, added. “We got emotional to see the remains of the house where we spent years. My husband and daughter still find themself in the Haweli in their dreams,” said Yadwinder’s wife, Ranjit Kaur Giani.Yadwinder’s father Giani Harinder Singh Roop was an eminent Punjabi writer. “The building had a unique architecture spread over 1,200 square yard housing 50 rooms and a well. Even as the rooms were underground, light entered there. The government acquired it in 1988 to construct a Galliara (open walled space) around the Golden Temple for more control over it after Operation Bluestar.”  He added that the government did not touch the structure for a year, before destroying it and burying the underground rooms. “Three of our forefathers, including Giani Sant Singh, also headed Damdami Taksal, the Sikh seminary. Giani Sant Singh was a Sanskrit scholar and translated Ramayana into Gurmukhi. Sikh organisations have not given importance to our pedigree, which starts from Bhai Ram Singh who took ‘Amrit’ from Guru Gobind Singh at Sri Anandpur Sahib. The 10th Guru gave him title of ‘Giani’ and stated that his family would be known for this title. Giani Sant Singh was his grandson,” he added. “Despite accounts mentioned in history books about Giani Sant Singh, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) is seeking proof. Does it not follow history? Has it not seen relics and mention of Giani Sant Singh in Sri Darbar Sahib that it manages? If the SGPC follows Sikh history, it should preserve these rooms as rare relics of Giani Sant Singh,” Yadwindra claimed. The SGPC, on its part, has invited archaeological experts, historians and heritage experts to study the structures and give their opinion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/excavation-around-golden-temple-underground-building-a-gift-from-maharja-ranjit-to-our-ancestor-claims-amritsar-family-101626633983516.html

But Sunday’s downpour proved to be more widespread, with 19 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) monitoring locations (across 14 wards) recording extremely heavy rain — over 204.5mm — within just a few hours. While Colaba recorded only 13mm of rain on July 16, both Santacruz and Colaba monitoring stations saw rains over 195mm on Sunday. Most of the rainfall was received between 12am and 2am, ward-level data shows. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray even labelled the event as a ‘mini cloudburst,’ though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) did not term it as one.Experts on the other hand said it was a thunderstorm event, but one whose impact is comparable to a cloudburst — which is described by the IMD as “any event where 100 millimetres of rainfall have fallen in an hour over a region that is 20-30 square kilometres in area.”Meteorologists were once again stumped by the scale of the downpour, which is distinct from typical monsoon showers. Like Friday’s event, the one that took place in the wee hours of Sunday was not triggered by large-scale weather systems typically associated with monsoon rains, such as a deep layer of winds from the west over Mumbai, a monsoon low-pressure system over east or central India, or a vigorous offshore trough.“Such rainfall, known as stratiform precipitation, is relatively steady and continuous on a day,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University Of Reading, England.Rather, the events observed in Mumbai were due to “convective precipitation”, triggered by a rapid “in situ” convergence of moisture-laden clouds that were formed as easterly winds in the mid-atmospheric levels transported dry air over warm and moist air in the lower levels, brought by westerly winds. “This is ideal for convective instability, particularly given the daytime heat,” said Deoras.This analysis was seconded by Dr JR Kulkarni, a retired meteorologist from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IIMT), who said, “There is a wind trough persisting from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal passing through Mumbai in which easterly and westerly winds are flowing, causing favourable condition for continuous convection at the low level over Mumbai and even parts in the southern Konkan belt. Because there is no low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, and because the monsoon trough is also not in its normal position, such events are difficult to predict.”In the case of Sunday’s thunderstorm, the cloud cover seems to have started forming late Saturday over Raigad district, where the hilly topography would have driven the formation of thunder clouds, meteorologists said. The cloud cover — which amassed in size to touch a cloud-top height of 18kms (twice the size of Mt. Everest, and about 25,000 feet higher than the cruising altitude of commercial airlines) — then moved from the southeast to the northwest of Mumbai, causing much wider rainfall than the downpour on early Friday.“The cloud-top height is a good indicator of the intensity of a storm. Furthermore, the vertical wind shear is significant, which is prolonging the lifespan of thunderstorms,” Deoras said, adding, “Such thunderstorms are uncommon for Mumbai or the west coast during an active phase of the monsoon, and in a month like July. The cloud top height of this monster thunderstorm is comparable to the one that produced rains on 26 July 2005.”Despite the scale of the downpour, civic authorities said they received no warning of extreme weather from the IMD. “Our models did not see such an intense event, but an impact based forecast was put out at 1am warning people,” said Dr Jayanta Sarkar, head of the IMD’s regional meteorological centre in Mumbai. Experts, however, once again criticised the IMD for the poor functioning of its doppler radar in Colaba, which could have been used to provide actionable information to civic authorities. However, the radar is currently producing images at intervals of between one to two hours (as against the optimum 15 minutes), which is too late for real-time disaster management.At 10:30pm on Saturday, for example, the IMD put out a thunderstorm warning with chances of “moderate to intense spells of rain” for the Konkan coast. However, the Nowcast was based on a doppler image produced at 9:30pm. “It does not help stakeholders since they can’t figure out anything from such radars, except for looking into the past,” said Deoras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thunderstorm-dumps-235mm-of-rain-as-mumbai-sees-back-to-back-extreme-weather-events-101626633920759.html

This accounts for just over 85% of the seasonal normal up to end September, which stands at 2,205mm, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, up to July 15, the city had received only 58.7% of this amount. Thus, in the last three days alone Mumbai has received a total of 661.5mm of rain, thus meeting the 30% monsoon rainfall target.IMD data shows an increasing frequency of high-intensity rainfall events in Mumbai in the past 10 years. Of seven such incidents, three have occurred since 2019, and two of these in the past three days alone. Though experts said that further investigation is required before conclusively linking such incidents to climate change, they agreed that anthropogenic warming in the environment may very likely have a role to play.“Enough studies have shown that a warming atmosphere means more availability of moisture. A warming ocean and earth’s surface essentially provides convective weather systems with more energy to intensify rapidly. Moreover, peninsular India is expected to get more rainfall as a result of climate change-related processes, and this can also be seen clearly in the current monsoon. From Gujarat to West MP, East MP, Haryana and Punjab, they show significant deficient rainfall so far. But that’s not the case with southern Indian meteorological subdivisions,” said Dr JR Kulkarni, retired meteorologist from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, which is under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.The intense spell of rain early Sunday also helped Mumbai surpass the seasonal normal for the month of July alone, which stands at 827mm. As of 5.30pm on Sunday, the city has received 849.6mm of rain (in July).However, despite receiving 235mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Sunday, the city received only a meagre 2.8mm in the subsequent eight hours, contrary to IMD’s announcement of a red alert for the city. Mumbai is currently placed under an orange category storm alert up to July 22.Dr Jayanta Sarkar, head of IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, said that there will be widespread distribution of rainfall across the Konkan coast, with a very likely chance of “extremely heavy rain at isolated places,” over the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-meets-30-of-monsoon-rainfall-target-in-three-days-101626633860641.html

After draining out the logged water, cleaning the system and repairing technical faults throughout Sunday, BMC restarted the water supply to the city for the evening cycle on the same day. Mumbaiites will receive a municipal drinking water supply as usual on Monday morning. However, BMC has urged citizens to boil drinking water before use.Following heavy rainfall on Saturday night, rainwater entered the Bhandup complex, forcing BMC to shut down the water purification system and electric supply, as a precautionary measure.Excess stormwater (rainwater) from the Bhandup complex drains into Vihar lake. Since the lake also overflowed on Sunday morning, it did not accept stormwater accumulated inside the complex. This logged water accumulated and inundated the complex building.Ajay Rathore, chief engineer of BMC’s hydraulics department said, “Rainwater entered the purification system at the drinking water complex. We immediately shut down the system and switched off the power supply as a precaution. We then began draining the water, and cleaning the system.”Following this, the Island city and the western suburbs did not receive the regular municipal drinking water supply on Sunday morning. Water supply to parts of the eastern suburbs was also affected.In a statement on Sunday night, BMC said, “The rainwater that entered the Bhandup water complex was pumped out on a war footing and the filtration and pumping system was cleaned. Necessary repairs were made after inspecting the plant, and the pumps were started in phases. Soon after, the water level in Bhandup Main Reservoir started rising. Since then, water supply has been restored in many parts of the city, including the western suburbs and island city, since [Sunday] evening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/heavy-rain-inundates-purification-complex-water-supply-in-mumbai-disrupted-101626633742391.html

In February 2021, Pawar had said that a report has been submitted to the Central government regarding the new site for the International Airport to be constructed in Purandar. The originally proposed site for the international airport was changed because of the opposition from the villagers in Purandar. Then a revised proposal, with a change in the location, was submitted to the centre for approval.Stiff opposition has emerged from locals to the new site as well. Farmers from affected villages in the newly proposed site have started a campaign against the proposed airport in their villages. Earlier this week, villagers, after their meeting with Sharad Pawar, claimed that the NCP had made it clear the site had not been finalised yet. “Our villages are not drought prone anymore. We have invested a lot in our farms to make the land fertile and to ensure a good crop. If this land, which is our only source of income is taken away from us, then how will we survive?

19-07-2021||Lucknow||Feelings of kanwar sanghs should be respected, says Yogi||A day after the state government announced that the kanwar sanghs (associations of pilgrims) have cancelled this year’s kanwar yatra, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said, “The feelings of kanwar sanghs should be respected.”“It’s appropriate that in the matters of faith, the society should itself take decisions,” he said.The yatra was not taken out last year as well due to Covid-19.This year, the yatra was scheduled to start on July 25. The state government has to reply on Monday to the Supreme Court on its decision on the yatra in Uttar Pradesh.Since Friday, soon after the Supreme Court nudged the UP government to reconsider the state’s decision to hold the yatra despite Covid-19 concerns, the Uttar Pradesh government engaged kanwar sanghs in the state in talks and made an appeal to them to cancel the yatra the way they did last year, said a senior state government officer.The top court had asked the state government to inform it by July 19 whether it would reconsider its decision to hold a “symbolic” kanwar yatra.“The state government respects the faith of all the people. The kanwar sanghs, after talking to the state government officers, decided to cancel the holy kanwar yatra of Shravan month. It is appropriate that in the matters of faith, the society should itself take decisions. The feelings of kanwar sanghs should be respected,” Yogi said at the Covid review meeting on Sunday.The kanwar yatra is an annual pilgrimage held in the Hindu holy month of Shravan. It involves devotees of Lord Shiva generally walking barefoot with pitchers of holy water from the Ganga or other rivers hung on kanwars (bamboo or wooden slings) and then offering the water to the deity at Shiva temples.On Tuesday, the Uttarakhand government cancelled this year’s yatra, but the UP government had said the annual pilgrimage was allowed in Uttar Pradesh with Covid safety protocols. Following this, the Supreme Court took cognizance of the issue and, on Friday, asked the UP government to reconsider its decision to allow the kanwar yatra in the state with a limited number of pilgrims. The apex court asked the government to consider a complete ban on the physical movement of kanwariyas in the state. Haridwar in Uttarakhand is the main centre for the kanwariyas to collect Ganga water for “jalabhishek” of Lord Shiva. Traditionally in UP, many devotees, instead of going to Haridwar, collect Ganga water from various places in the state itself, such as Unnao, Bijnor or fetch the Saryu water from Ayodhya. Earlier on Saturday, many kanwar sanghs (organisations) in Saharanpur district of western Uttar Pradesh expressed their helplessness in ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour during the yatra and decided not to organise camps for the pilgrims this year.They took this stance while the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country, urged devotees not to take out the yatra this year too due to Covid-19.ABAP president Mahant Narendra Giri said that human life was as important as religious practices and thus the best option was that the kanwar yatra was called off this year as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/feelings-of-kanwar-sanghs-should-be-respected-says-yogi-101626633622435.html

Unless the land layout is ratified by the district collector, registrations will not be done, the order, issued on Sunday stated.The GR states that it had been observed that many buyers were directly registering a minimum of one or two gunthas, as part of a larger parcel of land, in violation of the law. “Only smaller pieces of land which have a proper legal layout as envisaged by the government and approved by the district collector and competent authority can be can be registered,” the GR stated.However, developers have opposed the GR. A member of a developers’ association in Pune, on condition of anonymity, claimed that if one or two gunthas of land cannot be directly registered, it would affect a large number of middle-class citizens, who cannot afford to buy flats measured by square feet. “Citizens who are poor and small landholders can construct their own houses on one or two gunthas of land at affordable costs,” the developer said.The state government in March passed the “gunthewari scheme” bill to regularise unauthorised small plots by December 31, 2020, which will legalise constructions 20-years old under the scheme, a move that will largely benefit the recently merged villages in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. The state government had first introduced the “gunthewari” scheme on January 1, 2001, under the Maharashtra Gunthewari Developments (Regulation, Upgradation and Control) Act.The government then took a decision at a state cabinet meeting to revive the scheme in a new format and regularise gunthewari construction up to December 31, 2020.Gunthewari is known as a method invoked to measure land as per the Gunthewari act. The practice of creating small plots of agricultural land in multiple gunthas (1,089 sqft) was illegal and hence, carrying out constructions on “gunthewari” land was also illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ig-bans-direct-registration-of-plots-less-than-2-gunthas-in-size-101626633620613.html

19-07-2021||Noida||Noida gets relief even as rain keeps away||Noida: Sunday turned out to be a little soothing for residents in Noida and its adjoining areas as the drop in the maximum temperature and easterly winds provided some respite from the hot and humid conditions the city has been experiencing over the last few days, although it did not get enough rain. Despite the weather department’s prediction of heavy to moderate rainfall in the city on Sunday, it was the fourth day that the city did not receive adequate showers, barring a few places, though the sky was overcast by the evening with cold easterly winds bringing some relief to the residents. An official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, “There are chances of moderate rainfall from Monday to July 22. The temperature is likely to dip further and hover around 32°C.” According to weather analysts, though there is “no clear explanation” behind the current rainfall pattern, as even moisture laden clouds failed to bring any showers to the city, some influences like vegetation and winds have some role to play. “Chances of rainfall were high in Noida and Delhi and there is still a possibility of showers over the next three days. The monsoon trough passed over the area, but instead of Noida or Delhi, where some areas received traces of rain till Sunday evening, it rained in southwest areas of the National Capital Region (NCR). The trough has been oscillating in south and west of Delhi, but there are chances that it may shift northward on Monday, leading to rainfall in the region... There are some hypotheses about vegetation, winds and moisture in the area that might be influencing the rainfall pattern over certain patches,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.The last time Noida received showers was on July 13, the day the IMD announced the onset of monsoon, which arrived after running behind schedule for 16 days. On Sunday, the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded in Noida were 36°C and 28°C respectively, against 39.5°C and 28.8°C recorded the previous day. The Safdarjung monitoring station, which is considered to be representative of the National Capital Region, recorded a maximum temperature of 36.4°C and a minimum of 28°C, both one degree lower than the season’s average. The humidity levels hovered between 61% to 81% on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gets-relief-even-as-rain-keeps-away-101626633141384.html

A guard spotted the cat stuck in the DG-set and informed the members of the resident welfare association. Hundreds of residents gathered at the spot but could not find ways to rescue the cat. “We called up several departments for help but none of the officials responded. Finally, we called up the police and they sent a PCR-van. However, they too could not do much as they did not have any devices to cut the thick metal sheet to rescue the cat,” said Yatendra Nagar, president of the RWA. Mahavir Singh, SHO of Vijay Nagar police station, said the police got a call from the residents about the cat. “Our PCR van went to the spot, and they were there till it was rescued,” he added.“We have four DG-sets. Due to frequent thefts, the door of one of the sets was kept open and the cat inside it. When it tried to exit through the cable opening, its head got stuck,” said Nagar. Residents said due to lockdown, the shops and markets were closed and no vendors could be contacted who could come and rescue the cat. “Finally, we called a local mechanic who repairs LPG stoves. He arrived with a gas cutter and cut open the two holes of the cable chamber. The cat pulled its head out and ran away,” said Abhishek Singh, a resident of the high-rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-residents-rescue-cat-stuck-in-dg-set-for-2-hours-101626633140691.html

On questioning, the investigating officer took two hours to explain that it was an unintentional mistake and won’t be repeated in the future... The officer also took 30 minutes to locate keys and remove the boy’s handcuffs,” said Aneet Bhagel, member of Gautam Budh Nagar JJB.The teenager has been sent to judicial custody till July 26 for allegedly snatching away a cellphone from a person, along with two other men, in Sector 12 on Saturday (July 15).“According to Supreme Court guidelines and JJ Act Section 8, no suspect — whether minor or adult — should be handcuffed when being produced in court, and police officers should not be in their uniform. However, the rules are often violated. It is a clear violation of basic human rights. Special juvenile police units (SJPUs) must ensure that these rules are not being violated. We have written a letter to the Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner, urging him to investigate the matter and ensure that such incidents don’t happen in the future,” according to Bhagel.Senior police officers have taken a note of the matter.“We are probing the incident.

19-07-2021||Lucknow||CISH developing ‘healthier’ mango varieties||: Experts at Central Institute of Subtropical horticulture (CISH) are developing mango varieties which not just look and taste good but also have bio-active compounds which provide an array of health benefits for humans.According to experts, while the king of fruits is known for its luscious taste and rich texture, it is not the first choice health wise.“The traditional mango varieties have very less concentration of bio active compounds which are known for their health effects. The institute has taken up this challenge of making native mango varieties healthier,” said Shailendra Rajan, director of Lucknow-based CISH.“On conducting studies and medical researchers on mango, we came to the conclusion that besides being a good source of Vitamin A, the fruit contains bio actives mangiferin and lupeol, two important components which have anti-cancer and healthy-heart properties. But these compounds are found in traces in different combinations in different varieties. We are trying to increase the presence of these compounds and make their presence uniform in known mango varieties,” explained the director.The experts at CISH have examined the composition of over 100 mango varieties found across the country to gauge the amount of bio actives. After identification of bio active compounds, the experts are in the process of developing hybrid mango variety with optimal amount of bio actives.“CISH has one of the world’s most diverse collection of mango varieties. We are in the process of developing hybrid varieties fortified with bio active compounds. It is a gradual process which takes time, but we are dedicated to develop a mango variety which is healthier than existing ones,” said Rajan.The institute is also working towards extracting bio active compounds from mango peels and to make products that can be consumed by people.Experts at CISH were earlier tasked with developing red-colored varieties in order to tap into the export market, which was dominated by red coloured mangoes from Brazil and other Latin American countries at the time. Almost a decade ago, only red-colored mangoes were known to the consumers in the United States and Europe.“The red colour of the fruit was the target trait for breeding, but as people became more aware of the medicinal properties due to presence of bioactive compounds, a new focus on developing bioactive compounds rich varieties has emerged. Our efforts are to keep the country among the front runners for having healthier variety of mangoes,” said Rajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cish-developing-healthier-mango-varieties-101626633021242.html

Now, RITES has completed its preliminary survey of five major traffic junctions in the city -- Kisan Chowk, Tilapata Chowk, Surajpur entry point, Pari Chowk and Honda Chowk. “RITES has suggested an underpass at Kisan Chowk. But for now, we will get rid of congestion at the five traffic junctions by improving the management with strict enforcement until the final report comes in,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.According to the officials, RITES will conduct a detailed survey, prepare a DPR and chalk out a strategy to take effective steps to decongest all the five busy traffic junctions. The mobility plan will be prepared keeping in mind the rise in population of the city in the next 10 years, they said. The city’s population, one million at present, is expected to rise to 2.5 million in the next 10 years, according to an estimate by the authority.The authority has hired the consultant for 20 years as the industrial city needs to be developed as ‘smart city’, said the officials. The authority officials said major traffic issues in Greater Noida include lack of pedestrian infrastructure, jams at major intersections and no designated space for hawkers, among others. Residents said that the authority should plan traffic infrastructure well in advance. “With only 25-30% flat occupancy in the Greater Noida West area, we witness perennial traffic congestion on roads with no dedicated lanes for cyclists or pedestrians,” said Vivek Raman, a city resident who is also the president of Greater Noida West entrepreneur association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/survey-suggests-underpass-at-kisan-chowk-in-greater-noida-101626633020640.html
19-07-2021||Kolkata||From cooperative banks to death of ex-bodyguard, Adhikari target of many probes||West Bengal’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) government has mounted pressure on Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the assembly, by initiating probes on several fronts.While the state government is probing the operations of several cooperative banks in which Adhikari is a member of the managing boards, the state criminal investigation department (CID) has started an investigation into the death of one of his bodyguards.Adhikari, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in December last year and defeated Mamata Banerjee at East Midnapore district’s Nandigram assembly seat, got some relief on Friday when the Calcutta high court ordered that there is no need for a special audit of the accounts of the district’s Contai Co-operative Bank Ltd of which Adhikari is the chairman since 2009.The special audit was recently ordered by the state government. The bank moved court, challenging it.Soon after Adhikari joined the BJP, ruling party leaders demanded an audit of the bank’s accounts and alleged that he was involved in corruption. On Friday, Justice Sampa Sarkar observed that there is no need for a special audit right now since the bank has sent audit reports to the government.A senior state government official, who did not want to be named, said that in June the administration started the process of removing Adhikari from the boards of several cooperative banks located in East Midnapore.Fisheries minister and senior TMC leader in East Midnapore, Akhil Giri said, “If the leader of the opposition wants to criticize the state government, he should do it after relinquishing the posts he holds in these banks.”TMC has alleged that Adhikari violated the law by getting elected as chairman of the board of the Contai Co-operative Bank four times in a row. He is also chairman of the Vidyasagar Central Co-operative Bank.Meanwhile, the CID has started a probe into the death of Adhikari’s bodyguard Shubhabrata Chakraborty who died from a gunshot injury in 2018. His family has now alleged foul play. The complaint has been filed by Suparna Kanjilal Chakraborty, the wife of the deceased.A CID team visited Adhikari’s residence on Friday and Saturday. They talked to the members of the family, including Dibyendu Adhikari, the BJP leader’s bother who is also the TMC Lok Sabha member from the district’s Tamluk Lok Sabha seat. Their father, Sisir Adhikari, is the TMC Lok Sabha member from Contai.The TMC had moved Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla seeking Sisir Adhikari’s disqualification under anti-defection law as he shared the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the recent election campaign. The speaker served a notice on Adhikari earlier this week.Suvendu Adhikari could not be contacted.Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal BJP, said, “When you are in the TMC you are god but if you are in another party you become a demon. The ruling party has turned itself into a laughing stock. This is vindictive politics.”These are not the only probes initiated by the state.In June, the Kolkata Police arrested an old associate of Suvendu Adhikari in a job scam case. Also, he and his youngest brother Soumendu Adhikari were booked in a case involving theft of relief materials in East Midnapore, the home turf of the Adhikari family.This is the first time since the BJP emerged as a formidable force in Bengal and took the TMC head on in the 2019 Lok Sabha and the recent assembly polls that a prominent saffron camp leader has been booked in a criminal case.In both polls – the BJP wrested 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats but bagged only 77 of 294 assembly seats in May– it was BJP that highlighted the alleged involvement of TMC leaders in chit fund scams and the Narada sting operation case during the campaign.The BJP became a target of the TMC on May 17 when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested three TMC legislators, including two cabinet ministers, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and the former mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee, who left the TMC last year, in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. TMC leaders accused the BJP of using the CBI to avenge its electoral defeat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/from-cooperative-banks-to-death-of-ex-bodyguard-suvendu-adihkari-target-of-multiple-probes-101626632484160.html

Rainfall activity is expected to intensify and cover more areas by Sunday night and Monday,” said a senior IMD official.Met recordings show that on Sunday the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, saw 7.2mm rainfall, while the Palam observatory received 3.3mm.The maximum temperature at Safdarjung was 36.4 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal, and the minimum temperature was 28°C.IMD on Friday declared an ‘orange alert’ for July 18 and a ‘yellow alert’ for July 19 to July 21 in Delhi, forecasting heavy rain and thunderstorms during the weekend. Met officials also said that with the four days of rain, the rainfall deficit in the city would likely be covered.As of Saturday, Delhi recorded a rainfall deficit of nearly 51%.Sunday marked yet another occasion when the IMD got its forecast wrong this season. The string of inaccurate monsoon forecasts began with the initial prediction that monsoon would arrive on June 15, which would have been the earliest ever onset in the Capital. The department then shifted the forecast to June 29. Then, from July 9 onwards, the Met forecast the arrival of monsoon “in the next 24 hours”, till it arrived on July 13.According to IMD, an orange alert is issued when there is a forecast of heavy rainfall that could disrupt the movement of people and traffic in a city. During a yellow alert, there are chances of light to moderate rains and government agencies are advised to “be on alert”.Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet weather, a private forecaster said, “There is a possibility of rains intensifying from Sunday night. Moderate rainfall is likely to continue through Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/little-rain-for-delhi-on-sunday-as-forecast-falls-short-once-again-101626632240688.html

19-07-2021||Delhi||Police ask farmers to reconsider Parliament protest||A Delhi Police delegation on Sunday met farmer leaders at Singhu border and asked them to reconsider their proposed July 22 march to Parliament, as all public gatherings are banned in Delhi under the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA’s) Covid-19 guidelines, senior police officers privy to the development said.The police have also asked the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to close Janpath, Lok Kalyan Marg, Patel Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Central Secretariat, Mandi House and Udyog Bhawan from Monday (July 19) onwards, if needed, till the Parliament’s monsoon session is over, to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament. The Metro has also been told to maintain extra vigil at all stations falling in New Delhi district in view of the protest call given by the Samkyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) – an umbrella body of more than 40 farmer groups – which is spearheading the agitation against the three farm laws.“We requested the farm leaders to reconsider their proposed protest at Parliament. They told us that theirs will be a peaceful protest and not more than 200 agitators will reach their proposed venue. We told them that following the DDMA’s Covid-19 orders, the Delhi Police will not give permission for the protest. Hopefully, they will review their decision and let us know in the next meeting we will have, maybe tomorrow (Monday),” said a senior police officer, who was present in the meeting, and asked not to be named.Emphasising that they don’t plan to gherao or forcibly enter the Parliament, farmer leaders described it as a “constructive meeting”.The police delegation led by joint commissioner of police (New Delhi range) Jaspal Singh met the nine-member coordination committee of SKM at a pre-decided place near the Singhu border protest site to discuss the proposed July 22 march to Parliament.They said the police apprised the committee about the current Covid-19 situation and the DDMA guidelines against holding all political rallies and cultural events in the Capital. They were also informed about the cancellation of kanwar yatra in many states.“When the committee members told us that 200 farmers will have a symbolic protest outside the Parliament, we only told them why 200, why not five. We did not offer any number or a protest venue in the city,” the officer who attended the meeting said.Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav said the meeting was “constructive” and the police officers heard them “carefully”.“We told them that SKM will issue ID cards to 200 protesters who will be reaching the permissible limit from the Parliament to carry out a protest. The details of the ID cards and the protesters will be shared every day with the police. The protesters will return to their respective venues (Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur) after the session is over. A fresh batch of 200 protesters will be sent every day till the monsoon session continues. We assured the officers that our objective is not to disrupt the Parliament session. They told us they will update us on their decision,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cant-allow-protest-near-parliament-reconsider-decision-police-tell-farmers-101626632180630.html
19-07-2021||Delhi||Water production at ‘all-time high’: DJB||After nearly a week of severe shortages, Delhi’s water production reached an “all-time high” on Sunday, said Raghav Chadha, vice-chairperson of the city’s water utility.As against the usual 910MGD (million gallons per day), Delhi’s water production on Sunday hit 955MGD, said Chadha, who is also the Aam Aadmi Party’s legislator from Rajendra Nagar.“Due to sufficient availability of raw water in river Yamuna as well as engineering solutions, we have managed to push our optimum levels,” Chadha tweeted.The boost in Delhi’s water production comes at the end of a week where several parts of the Capital fell short of supply, after water levels in the Yamuna fell to a “55-year-low”, according to the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), which said that neighbouring Haryana withheld Delhi’s legitimate share of river water supply.Last Sunday, the DJB also filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking directions for the Haryana government to release Delhi’s share of water.Among the areas worst affected by the shortage were Rajendra Nagar, Old Rajendra Nagar, Greater Kailash, Prem Nagar, Punjabi Bagh, Tughlakabad, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, Okhla, Raja Garden, Tagore Garden, Tilak Nagar and Subhash Nagar.The water utility said the level of the Yamuna River at the Wazirabad barrage in Delhi dropped from 674.5 feet to 667 feet.The situation got worse on Monday, when the level of water in Yamuna fell to its lowest since 1965, said DJB. The water utility said this drop was because Haryana withheld Delhi’s daily 120MGD share of water.Through the week, however, as monsoon hit Delhi and its neighbouring states on July 13, Haryana released 16,000 cusecs of water on Tuesday.“Water takes a few days to reach our water treatment plants.

19-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi BJP wants 10-day state assembly session||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has urged the speaker of the Delhi assembly to hold at least a 10-day session, arguing that the two-day session, due to start from July 29, is inadequate to discuss issues concerning the national capital.The speaker of the house, Ram Niwas Goel, said two days is “sufficient”, but did not rule out extending the session if required.Leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is also the BJP MLA from Badarpur, said, “Ever since the constitution of the seventh Delhi Assembly, Question Hour has not been held even once. And now in the two-day session, a curtailed Question Hour is being held….In a two-day session, the members will hardly get any time to ask questions or raise important issues. We have requested the speaker to extend the duration of the session.”BJP MLA from Rohini Vijender Gupta, who is the former chief of the party’s Delhi unit, said, “ This two-day session is just a formality. The [10-day] session can be held by adhering to the Covid-19 protocols.”Goel said, “Two days is enough to discuss all matters if the session is conducted peacefully, without any protest from the opposition party. They can raise their questions in the assembly. If need be, then the session can be extended. It has happened in the past.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-wants-10-day-state-assembly-session-101626632060611.html
19-07-2021||Delhi||Spate of burglaries the latest bane for Delhi||“You are a father of two. You have no criminal record. Why did you decide to rob and murder her?” a Delhi Police officer posted at the Vasant Vihar police station on Monday asked Suraj Budhe, 36, arrested for the July 6 murder of Kitty Kumaramangalam, 70.Budhe told the police that he joined his two friends in the robbery and murder -- laundryman Raju Kanojia, and another friend Rakesh Raj -- to cover losses that he suffered in his used car business due to the lockdown.The three men entered her house in Vasant Vihar’s A Block, smothered her to death with a pillow, and fled with cash and jewellery. Kumarmangalam, 70, was the wife of former Union minister PR Kumaramangalam.Less than 24 hours later, about 17km away, in west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar, five men entered the house of a businessman and held the family hostage. CCTV footage of the Uttam Nagar robbery, showed the five armed men inside the flat, holding guns, pointing them at family members, tying the hands of a man, and ransacking the house while a four-year-old child played on a sofa.In Tilak Marg, the police this week arrested a man involved in at least six burglaries in the New Delhi area over the past few months. Sonu Kumar, 28, told police that he quit crime and started working as contractual labour in Uttarakhand, but returned to committing burglaries after failing to find work due to the lockdown.The spate of burglaries has struck fear in the Capital’s residents, especially because many of the crimes are being committed by people who lost jobs during the pandemic, or suffered losses in the lockdown. As a result, they are not in police records and difficult to track.Though police do not maintain specific data, several senior police officers said the suspects caught for many of the recent burglaries took to crime after losing their livelihood in recent, pandemic-hit months.Fear in coloniesIn the first six months of 2021, 1,173 burglaries were reported, 40% more than the corresponding period in 2020. In all, 2,199 cases were reported last year, 3,026 in 2019 and 4,117 in 2018.The burglaries have left Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) worried, especially because many criminals break into houses during the afternoon hours, and don’t hesitate even if the home is occupied.“During the afternoon, often women, children and even senior citizens stay alone at home, and we fear for their safety. We have requested local police stations to conduct some safety workshops for residents to tell them ways about what to do when a stranger knocks on the door and insists on coming inside, even if it is a trusted service provider or a known person,” said Ramesh Kukreti, general secretary of the north Delhi wing of RWA Unity, a group of resident welfare bodies.At Shalimar Bagh -- where five men broke into a businessman;s house, held his 24-year-old daughter hostage and robbed cash and jewellery worth over ₹20 lakh on Tuesday -- residents installed barbed wires on the boundary wall and hired more security guards.BS Vohra, president of the Joint Forum East Delhi RWAs, said despite the lockdown in April, his team installed barbed wires on the gates and boundary walls to stop outsiders from entering the colony.“After Covid, many people from economically weaker sections do not have money and are willing to go to any extent. Residents are living in fear because these men are now not afraid to attack and kill you,” said Vohra.Experts say rising burglaries by younger people who have lost jobs or suffered crippling losses in business mirrors a global trend caused by economic devastation due to the pandemic. “Many youngsters who were on the edge financially, probably doing odd jobs that earned them some livelihood, are now unemployed with the burden of supporting large families. The government should expand social welfare net for financially weak families; work on employment generation, and skill development programmes,” said Murugan Palanichami, a sociologist from the University of North Carolina.Former Delhi Police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma, who headed the force between 1999 and 2002, said economic factors are always an important reason for crimes such as break-ins and burglaries.“We keep reading reports of jobless youngsters turning to crime. Not all out of job people resort to crime but even if a few of them have then, police have a tough job at hand. These people do not have crime records. It will be like finding a needle in a haystack,” he said.HT spoke to several Delhi Police officers who agreed with Sharma’s assessment.“It is easy to arrest a hardened criminal or bust an organised gang, but it is difficult to trace a person who has committed only one or two crimes. It is likely that a burglar steals a big amount in one heist and then goes underground. Maybe he/she decides to stop,” said an officer from crime branch who asked not to be named.Police agree that apart from crime fighting, social measures are needed to arrest the fresh rash of burglaries.“We are an enforcement agency but we run the YUVA programme to stop vulnerable youngsters from taking to crime. We run training programmes by tying up with different institutes to skill train such youngsters. Police has trained over 10,000 unemployed youth,” said deputy commissioner of police Chinmoy Biswal.He said the police had increased road patrols, random checks, pickets, mobile teams and emergency response vehicles. “Beat constables across the city coordinate with security guards under the Prahari scheme to make the colonies safer at night. Separately, our teams also monitor the activities of some suspected habitual burglars. There is a collection of criminal intelligence and surveillance on the activities of criminals has been stepped up. Delhi police has launched a crackdown on burglars, which is why the cases have consistently dropped over the years,” he said.Gangs of the pastThe phenomenon of unorganised burglaries by first-time criminals is fairly recent in Delhi, which was terrorised by gangs synonymous with violent crime till a decade ago.Notorious among them were the kachha baniyan gangs from Madhya Pradesh. Dressed in boxers and vests, the gang members would break into homes, steal, eat food from the refrigerator; and sometimes brutally beat their victims to death.“There were multiple murders across the city. It was done by gangs from Madhya Pradesh. TV shows were made …Delhi residents were terrified. These gangs would beat residents to death if anyone saw them in the act. They wore only vests and underwear, and oiled their bodies so that they could not be caught,” said retired assistant commissioner of police Narendra Chawla.“The fear among residents in south Delhi was such that people started hiring security guards, but even the guards were also afraid to do their jobs,” he said.In the space of two days in December 1998, the gang murdered two elderly couples in south Delhi’s Saket and Malviya Nagar, prompting then Union home minister LK Advani to take up the case.The last recorded crime by the kachha baniyan gang in Delhi was in July 2014, when five men murdered a woman in Narela, grievously injured her mother, and stole their belongings.Also infamous were the Pardhi gangs, who only targeted a specific house on a particular date. “Burglars today do not have a modus operandi. Anyone in need to money could do it when they feel like it,” said an officer. Chawla said in the 90s, more than 200 gang members were arrested.In recent years, police have faced criticism for stigmatising and targeting the Pardhi tribes, who hail from Madhya Pradesh and were classified as criminal tribes under antiquated colonial law. They are classified as denotified tribes and fight economic and social marginalisation.In the early 2000s, a new crop of gangs emerged. Notorious among them was Sanju’s burn-and-burgle gang that hit at least 100 government flats in south Delhi and set them on fire between 2007 and 2011. “Sanju mostly targeted locked government flats and set the house on fire after the burglary. It was his signature,” said a Delhi Police inspector who asked not to be named. Sanju was arrested in 2018.Social relations upendedThe recent spike in burglaries underlines a pervasive loss of trust that has upended social relations and left even traditionally safe parts of the city vulnerable. No case highlights this phenomenon more than Kumaramangalam’s grisly murder.Last year, Delhi Police conducted a survey and divided the city into red, blue, green and white zones in decreasing order of their vulnerability to burglaries. In the red zone were places such as Nangloi and Samaipur Badli, which recorded over 40 cases each in the first eight months of the year.In the white zone, and marked as the safest parts of the city was Vasant Vihar, where Kumaramangalam was murdered.One of her alleged killers, laundryman Kanojia, was a regular at her house. He suffered losses during the lockdown, needed to make a quick buck, and found two others who were ready to help him.“If a trusted service provider, who was working in the locality for over five years can turn rogue, then who can the residents trust. No matter how many gates or security cameras we install, how do we ensure that we are not going to be targeted?” asked Kumaramangalam’s neighbour, Suresh Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/spate-of-burglaries-the-latest-bane-for-capital-101626390493795.html
19-07-2021||World||Canadian lab says Amnesty’s technique in digging up Pegasus hack is ‘sound’||A multidisciplinary laboratory at University of Toronto has verified the methods used by Amnesty International in flagging phones that were infected with the Israeli-made spyware Pegasus that was reportedly used in several countries, including India.A release from Citizen Lab, based at University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, said Amnesty International and the non-profit journalism organisation Forbidden Stories requested it to undertake “an independent peer review of a sample of their forensic evidence and their general forensic methodology”.In their review, Citizen Lab found “Amnesty International’s core forensic methods for analysing devices to determine that they have been infected with NSO Group spyware are sound”.Citizen Lab was provided with iTunes back-ups of several devices and a separate methodology brief. “No additional context or information about the devices or the investigation was provided to us,” it noted.It “independently validated” the methodology that “correctly identified infections with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware within four iTunes back-ups”. Citizen Lab’s own research has “independently arrived at a number of the same key findings as Amnesty International’s analysis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-lab-says-amnesty-s-technique-in-digging-up-pegasus-hack-is-sound-101626718709780.html
19-07-2021||World||US, allies accuse China of Microsoft Exchange hack||The United States and its Nato, EU and Five Eyes allies on Monday jointly accused the Chinese government of using “criminal contract hackers” to carry out the hacking of Microsoft Exchange’s mail servers earlier this year that impacted tens of thousands of entities around the world.The White House has called the move “unprecedented”. This is the first instance of the Nato, a military alliance of 30 nations, condemning China for cyberattacks. The collection of countries in this effort is the largest to jointly denounce aggressive cyber operations by China. The EU has 27 members, and the Five Eyes is an intelligence sharing pact of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.It could not be immediately ascertained if India, which was also impacted by the Microsoft hacking, was invited to join or chose not to. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said “we’re expecting additional countries in the coming weeks”.The United States and its allies are “exposing the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit”, the White House said in a statement on Monday.It added that the US and its allies are “attributing with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors” of China’s ministry of state security, which is the country’s civilian intelligence agency, “conducted cyber espionage operations utilising the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server”, which was disclosed by the company in March. These were vulnerabilities in is Exchange Server email and calendar software. While they had been around for 10 years, Chinese hackers had been exploiting them since at least January.The US and its allies did not announce retaliatory measures of the kind used against Russia, such as sanctions. But while not ruling out further action against China, the senior Biden administration official said, “We really focused initially in bringing other countries along with us. And this is really an unprecedented group of allies and partners holding China accountable.”The official underlined “it’s the first time that Nato has condemned PRC’s cyber activities”.The US justice department has announced criminal charges against four MSS hackers addressing “activities concerning a multi-year campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defence, education, and healthcare in a least a dozen countries”. They refer specifically also to how the MSS hackers stole Ebola virus vaccine research and “demonstrate that the PRC’s theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, and confidential business information extends to critical public health information”.Separately, the US National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency of the department of homeland security, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a cybersecurity advisory of techniques that Chinese hackers used to target US and allied networks, including those used when targeting the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities.The US believes Chinese hackers are generally more closely tied to the Chinese government than the Russians are to theirs. On the Russian side, the US administration official said, “we sometimes see individuals moonlighting. And we see, you know, some connections between Russian intelligence services and individuals. But this kind of... use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally is distinct”.The Chinese hackers’ entire range of activities - cyber-enabled extortion and crypto-jacking - are intended, the official said, “for financial gain of PRC government-affiliated cyber operators”. The official added that the MSS “uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit”.The US is aware of instances in which PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have carried out ransomware operations against private companies and millions of dollars of ransom were demanded. No details were shared about these companies, which included an American firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allies-accuse-china-of-microsoft-exchange-hack-101626717749621.html
19-07-2021||World||Joe Biden urges Americans to get vaccinated for the economy||US President Joe Biden urged Americans on Monday to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, insisting that the economy is entirely dependent on getting the pandemic under control. "So please, please get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now."The vaccination drive in the US started to lag as the country is confronted with an ever-growing surplus of coronavirus vaccine and looming expiration dates while countries in the developing world are in dire need of more vaccine doses to counter a rise in infections.The US had been inoculating 870,000 individuals every day at the beginning of June, marking a sharp decline from the 3.3 million a day on average vaccinations it did in mid-April, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.States have tried to deal with vaccine hesitancy through million-dollar prizes, hunting rifles, marijuana, and free beer but states like Oklahoma, Tennessee, and North Carolina are showing signs of reducing vaccine demands. Oklahoma has not asked for new doses from the federal government for more than a month. Tennessee and North Carolina both have vaccinated less than half of their population, reported Associated Press.Biden had set a goal to administer at least one dose of the vaccine to 70% of the adults in the country by July 4, but it remained unfulfilled. The President had accused social media giants of peddling vaccine misinformation and “killing people” by allowing the posts to circulate. Facebook fired back after Biden’s remarks on Friday, declaring that the accusation was “not supported by facts”. “Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,” the company’s vice president of integrity, Guy Rosen, said in a blog post.The President attempted to smooth things over on Monday, asking the social media giant to not take things personally and to do something about the vaccine misinformation available on its site. “My hope is, that Facebook instead of taking it personally that somehow I’m saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation,” Biden said during a press briefing. “The outrageous misinformation about the vaccine, that’s what I meant.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-americans-to-get-vaccinated-for-the-economy-101626715472792.html
19-07-2021||World||US won't compel journalists to reveal sources: Officials||The US government pledged Monday to steer clear of legal orders that force journalists to reveal their sources, with only rare exceptions, reversing course after revelations of secret efforts to obtain information from the media.A statement from the agency said it would no longer use the "compulsory legal process" including subpoenas or warrants to obtain records or identify sources from journalists involved in newsgathering activities.The new policy comes following revelations that former president Donald Trump's Justice Department secretly obtained phone records of journalists investigating his administration, inducing from CNN, the Washington Post and New York Times.The statement said the policy shift was made "because a free and independent press is vital to the functioning of our democracy."It said the new policy applies to reporters, publishers, third-party service providers and others involved in newsgathering, and to physical or digital documents as well as phone records.Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the new policy in a memo and called for "a review process to further explain, develop and codify the policy."Monday's announcement comes after news that the Trump administration sought records of journalists investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, while obtaining "gag orders" to keep that effort secret.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that the use of such orders in leak investigations "is not consistent with the president's policy direction."The Garland memo said exceptions to the policy would be made if the journalist were the subject of an investigation, or was suspected of being a foreign agent or member of a terrorist group, or in cases of "imminent" risk of death or bodily harm.While the cases involving the Trump administration have drawn scrutiny recently, the policy change addresses a longstanding concern on press freedom and follows several cases where journalists have been threatened with jail for refusing to reveal sources."The attorney general has taken a necessary and momentous step to protect press freedom at a critical time," said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press."This historic new policy will ensure that journalists can do their job of informing the public without fear of federal government intrusion into their relationships with confidential sources."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-won-t-compel-journalists-to-reveal-sources-officials-101626712070812.html

"There has been a delay in arrival of INS Airawat reaching Tanjung Priok, Indonesia, carrying 300 oxygen concentrators & 100 MT of Liquid Medical Oxygen from India. Will keep you posted for further developments,” he said.“India stands with its partners in the fight against Covid," the minister added.Update: There has been a delay in arrival of INS Airawat reaching Tanjung Priok, Indonesia, carrying 300 oxygen concentrators & 100 MT of Liquid Medical Oxygen from India. Will keep you posted for further developments.India stands with its partners in the fight against Covid.Indonesia, which had provided oxygen support to India even two months ago when the latter was reeling under an intense second wave of the virus, is grappling with a serious shortage of oxygen supply at the moment. The world’s fourth-most populated country recorded 34,257 new cases of Covid-19 and 1,338 deaths in the last 24 hours, reported ANI.The Indonesian government has been reaching out to China, Australia and Singapore seeking help to address their oxygen crisis. It had sent around 3,400 oxygen cylinders and concentrators to India in May.Also Read: Indonesia tops Brazil in reporting highest daily Covid-19 deathsAccording to a Reuters report, the Indonesian government plans to set up nearly 8,000 new hospital beds and adopt newer measures to boost the number of health workers and oxygen supplies. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted the country’s poor and on Saturday, Luhut Pandjaitan, the minister leading the fight against the pandemic, apologised for the same saying "it (government policy) is not optimal".The health ministry’s vaccination spokesperson, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said the inoculation drive against the virus remained focussed on Java and Bali as it awaited an increase in production capacity of ready-to-use doses.Indonesia has distributed 73.6 million doses of vaccine across the archipelago. Jakarta has fully vaccinated 24 per cent of its 8.3 million people and southeast Sulawesi has administered doses to 6 per cent of its two million. A majority of the inoculations has been done with Sinovac shots sent by China.

She was abducted while riding a rented vehicle and was held for several hours before being released. She was found near F-9 Park area of the capital with torture marks on her body.Pakistan's Foreign Office in an overnight statement said the reported abduction and assault of the daughter of Afghanistan’s ambassador is being investigated and followed-up at the highest level on the instructions of Prime Minister Khan.Pakistan termed as "unfortunate and regrettable" Afghanistan's decision to recall its ambassador and other senior diplomats from Islamabad, and urged Kabul to reconsider the move.Meanwhile, Pakistan also called back its ambassador to Afghanistan for "consultations" on the alleged abduction and release of the Afghan envoy’s daughter in Islamabad, according to the Foreign Office.Ambassador Mansoor Ahmad Khan arrived here on Sunday to meet Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood.Mahmood on Monday met the Afghan envoy and highlighted all the steps taken by the government and re-assured him of full cooperation.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid told Geo TV on Sunday that the entire episode of abduction was the result of an "international racket" to defame Pakistan."She went to Rawalpindi on her own will... we have CCTV footage. This is a conspiracy," he said.In a statement issued on Saturday, Afghanistan demanded Pakistan “to identify and prosecute the perpetrators at the soonest possible time”.The Afghan foreign ministry also said it “expresses its deep concern over the safety and security of diplomats, their families, and staff members of the Afghan political and consular missions in Pakistan”.Pakistan and Afghanistan often trade accusations, with Kabul claiming Islamabad is sending thousands of militants to fight in the war-torn country and providing safe haven for the Taliban. Pakistan, in turn, claims that Afghanistan harbours the anti-Pakistani group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan - the Pakistani Taliban - and also the secessionist Balochistan Liberation Army.Afghanistan has seen an uptick in violence after US President Joe Biden’s announcement of the withdrawal of US and NATO troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paks-qureshi-assures-justice-over-abduction-of-afghan-ambassador-s-daughter-101626696560237.html

As per the team’s findings, 98.8 per cent of the residents that were found Covid-19 positive in February or March 2020 were found with detectable levels of antibodies in November 2020. The team used three assays, tests that detect antibodies that respond to different parts of the virus. “The results showed that while all antibody types showed some decline between May and November, the rate of decay was different depending on the assay,” the Imperial College London said.Also read | Boris Johnson urges caution against Delta variant as he self-isolatesMeanwhile, the antibody levels were found to have increased in some people, suggesting potential cases of re-infection by the virus and providing a boost to the immune system.“We found no evidence that antibody levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections differ significantly, suggesting that the strength of the immune response does not depend on the symptoms and the severity of the infection,” the lead author of the study Dr Ilaria Doreigatti, from the Imperial College London said. “However, our study does show that antibody levels vary, sometimes markedly, depending on the test used. This means that caution is needed when comparing estimates of infection levels in a population obtained in different parts of the world with different tests and at different times” the author further said.The infection status of household members was also analysed to estimate how likely an infected person is to pass on the infection within the household. A probability of about one in four that the virus is transmitted within a household. It also showed that most transmission (79 per cent) is caused by 20 per cent of infections.According to the team, the finding confirms that the majority of infections doesn’t generate further infections and only a minority of the infections caused a large number of infections. It also showed that physical distancing, limiting the number of contacts and wearing face masks continue to remain important measures in reducing the risk of transmission even in highly vaccinated populations.The data also showed that in the absence of case isolation and short lockdowns, manual contact tracing alone would not have been enough to suppress the pandemic, the Imperial College further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-antibodies-last-9-months-after-infection-claims-study-101626699724035.html
19-07-2021||World||Blue Origin all set to soar into space on Tuesday, Bezos asks crew to 'relax'||Blue Origin, the company founded by American businessman Jeff Bezos, is all set for a space mission on Tuesday. The passengers include Bezos, his brother, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer and a teenage tourist.The capsule is entirely automated, unlike Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic rocket plane that required two pilots to get him to space earlier this month.Explained: How to become a space tourist and the costAhead of the ambitious mission, Bezos appeared on CBS’ 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' where he told the fellow travellers to "sit back, relax, look out of the window, just absorb the view outside".The Blue Origin mission is yet another step by a billionaire to open the space frontier for tourists. Though the commercial operations are scheduled to begin from next year, Bezos and Branson want to be the leaders in the field.Blue Origin’s 60-foot (18-metre) New Shepard rocket will accelerate toward space at three times the speed of sound, or Mach 3, before separating from the capsule and returning for an upright landing. It will cross the Karman Line, 100 kilometres above, from where the limit of the space starts. The line has been set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space.The passengers will experience three to four minutes of weightlessness, before their capsule parachutes onto the desert just 10 minutes after lift-off.Ariane Cornell, director of astronaut sales at Blue Origin, said that the crew members will "experience the flight of a lifetime".Blue Origin's training programme, according to the company, includes safety briefings, a simulation of the spaceflight, a review of the rocket and its operations, and instruction on how to float around the craft's cabin after the capsule sheds Earth's gravity.Another billionaire businessman Elon Musk is also eyeing the space tourism sector, pledging to go even higher in September, sending an all-civilian crew for a several-day orbital flight aboard its Crew Dragon capsule.US space agency NASA and the American Air Force define an astronaut as anyone who has flown higher than 50 miles (80 km).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blue-origin-all-set-to-soar-into-space-on-tuesday-bezos-asks-crew-to-relax-101626698754208.html
19-07-2021||World||Thailand switching to Chinese vaccines due to lack of AstraZeneca supplies||Thailand plans to use more Chinese-made vaccines to fill the gap in supply from AstraZeneca Plc, with the country kicking off a world-first mixed dose regime amid an unprecedented flareup in its Covid outbreak.Thai health officials began administering Astra vaccine on Monday as the second shot to recipients of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s first jab to boost the defense against the more contagious delta variant that’s seen driving daily caseload to as high as 20,000 by next month. Under the revised vaccine regime, Thailand will use five million Sinovac shots per month, according to Opas Karnkawinpong, director-general of the Department of Disease Control.Thailand is chasing additional vaccine deals, after Astra, which was seen as the primary supplier for its national rollout, conveyed its inability to meet targets set by the government, citing the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker’s export commitments. The government is also working to procure more shots from manufacturers such as Pfizer Inc., according to Opas.Authorities are trying to ramp up vaccinations to reduce hospitalization and death rates as the surge of new infections overwhelms the nation’s public health system. The country reported 11,784 new cases on Monday, the highest single-day increase since the pandemic began, even as the country’s hotspots entered the second week of the most stringent containment measures in more than a year.Thailand’s latest vaccine strategy is a departure from its original plan of solely relying on Astra vaccine, which is being locally produced by Siam Bioscience Ltd., to administer 10 million shots per month. With two-thirds of local Astra output slated for exports, Thailand is expected to receive only about five million doses per month, forcing officials to find ways to bolster its supplies, including discussions of limiting exports.“The government has been working on assumptions based on the best case scenario and underestimated the situation. They didn’t have plans to reduce any risks or anticipate any uncertainties,” said Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn, a lawmaker from the opposition Move Forward party. “Deaths and economic losses could have been avoided with better planning and management.”Officials had earlier limited the use of Sinovac shots to its health-care and front-line workers, but later expanded it for regions with outbreaks or with plans to reopen for tourists.

The Chinese vessel eventually moved away from the area, the statement said.The foreign vessel sent a radio message identifying itself as “Chinese Navy Warship 189” and asked the Philippine ship tailing it to keep distance, the Coast Guard said.The two nations’ vessels have been locked in a standoff in the South China Sea for months, after hundreds of Chinese ships swarmed disputed territory earlier this year. The Philippines has repeatedly protested the ships’ presence and has been backed by the US, while Beijing has said its actions were normal and legitimate.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing Monday in Beijing that he was unaware of the matter and directed questions to other authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-challenges-chinese-warship-in-south-china-sea-101626687631055.html

Under a long-standing practice, Jews are allowed to visit — but not pray -- at the site, which they revere as the Temple Mount and which Muslims hold sacred as the home of the Al Aqsa Mosque.Palestinians and the site’s Islamic authorities fear that Israel is slowly trying to take control of the area and have complained in the past that Jews continued to pray at the site. Friction remains high there after unrest helped spark the 11-day Israel-Hamas war in May.Despite Bennett's phrasing, the status quo holds, according to an official in the prime minister's office who was not authorized to speak publicly and demanded anonymity.The clarification came after a tense day in which hundreds of Jewish pilgrims visited the compound under heavy police guard to mark Tisha B'Av, a day of mourning and repentance when Jews reflect on the destruction of the First and Second Temples. The hilltop compound, they believe, is where the biblical Temples once stood and is the holiest site in Judaism.Muslims revere the site as the Noble Sanctuary, home to the Al Aqsa Mosque and the third-holiest site in Islam. Earlier Sunday, Muslim worshippers briefly clashed with Israeli security forces at the flashpoint shrine.No injuries were reported, but the incident again raised tensions. It came just days before Muslims celebrate the festival of Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-change-to-ban-on-jewish-prayer-at-mosque-says-new-israeli-prime-minister-101626691984824.html

This is the right moment. But we’ve got to do it cautiously. We’ve got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant,” he saidThe UK government has decided to implement the final step from their four-step roadmap to end lockdown, Covid restrictions have now been replaced with guidelines urging citizens to deploy personal judgement and responsibility on face masks in indoor settings and caution in large gatherings.“We’re doing a big opening up, and that’s quite right. If we don’t do it now we’ll be opening up in the autumn and winter months when the virus has the advantage of the cold weather. We’ll lose the precious firebreak we get with the school holidays,” Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter on Sunday.Also Read: UK lifts Covid-19 restrictions amid anxiety over fresh surge“So please, please, please be cautious. Go forward into the next step with all the right prudence and respect for other people and the risks that the disease continues to present,” he added.Johnson will be self-isolating till July 26 as vaccinated individuals who come in contact with Covid-positive ones have to undergo a 10-day quarantine. Johnson and his minister Rishi Sunak had earlier announced that they will be taking part in a pilot project that will allow them to continue working from Downing Street despite being contacted by the National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace system to self-isolate following Javid’s positive Covid-19 test. However, he announced on Sunday’s video that the project was scrapped. “We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme, which allows people to test daily, but I think it’s far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules and that’s why I’m going to be self-isolating until Monday 26th July,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-urges-caution-against-delta-variant-as-he-selfisolates-101626691927813.html

According to Sher Khan who was in charge of the rescue team at the site, some of the injured were in critical condition.

"God willing, our prayers will be accepted."My whole body is shivering," she told AFP as she stood among the other emotional pilgrims, wearing the ihram, the traditional seamless white garment worn during the hajj.Worshippers described a sense of tranquility descending on the mountain, also known as the "Mount of Mercy"."To be one of only 60,000 doing hajj ....I feel like I am part of a (privileged) group that was able to reach this place," said Baref Siraj, a 58-year-old Saudi national.The hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam and a must for able-bodied Muslims with the means to travel at least once in their lifetime, is usually one of the world's largest religious gatherings.Hosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam's holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.But barring overseas pilgrims has caused deep disappointment among Muslims worldwide, who typically save for years to take part.Participants were chosen from more than 558,000 applicants through an online vetting system, with the event confined to fully vaccinated adults aged 18-65 with no chronic illnesses.Safety firstAuthorities are seeking to repeat last year's successful event which took place on the smallest scale in modern history with just 10,000 participants, but which saw no virus outbreak.Saudi health authorities said Sunday that not a single Covid case had been reported amongst the pilgrims this year.The kingdom has so far recorded more than 509,000 coronavirus infections, including over 8,000 deaths. Some 20 million vaccine doses have been administered in the country of over 34 million people.The hajj, which typically packs large crowds into congested religious sites, could have been a super-spreader event for the virus.But Saudi Arabia has said it is deploying the "highest levels of health precautions" in light of the pandemic and the emergence of new variants.Pilgrims are being divided into groups of just 20 to restrict potential exposure, and a "smart hajj card" has been introduced to allow contact-free access to camps, hotels and the buses to ferry pilgrims around religious sites.Black-and-white robots have been deployed to dispense bottles of sacred water from the Zamzam spring in Mecca's Grand Mosque, built around the Kaaba, the black cubic structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.Ibrahim Siam, a 64-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who comes from Dammam in the east of the country, said that high-tech procedures introduced to manage the hajj "have made things a lot easier."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilgrims-ascend-mount-arafat-near-mecca-in-high-point-of-pandemic-era-hajj-101626679704652.html

In a recent video shared by News For All on Twitter, the man can be seen being handled by a bunch of angry passengers.The World Health Organization (WHO) recently said that there is a “strong likelihood” of more virulent and dangerous variants of the coronavirus emerging in the days ahead, which may be more challenging to tackle. At such a time, following Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance has become even more important.The video shows the passengers, almost all of whom can be seen wearing masks, expressing disapproval of the maskless young man boarding the carriage. At the beginning of the video, a passenger can be seen stopping the man from going further into the train. Soon after, two women push him towards the door as commotion unfolds inside the carriage.Although the maskless man shows some resistance, he is eventually forced to leave the train after passengers continue to push him and point towards the door. Interestingly, the video shows that when the man is kicked out of the train, he goes to one corner near a bench, and continues to wait for the next train without wearing a mask.Notably, the Spanish government lifted the mandate to wear masks outdoors from June 26 onwards. The country followed the decision by France, which also ended the compulsory wearing of masks outdoors due to falling Covid-19 infection rates, Reuters reported.However, as per El Pais report, the governments’ guidelines approve going maskless in outdoor spaces only if a safe distance of 1.5 metres can be maintained. Individuals are required to carry masks, and wear them if there is a crowd. The rules also mandate wearing a face mask when on public transportation such as buses, underground metro, and trains, among others. Individuals can only remain unmasked if they’re able to maintain the 1.5 metres safe distance or travelling alone on a private vehicle.The video on Twitter has already got more than 260,000 views. Netizens were divided between their opinions on the incident. Under the comments section, while some supported the passengers, others criticised the way the man was treated by them.🚨🇪🇸 | NEW: Passengers throw a guy off a train in Spain for not wearing a mask pic.twitter.com/CQNPidJHxkSpain’s coronavirus situation has been worrying lately with the European nation’s 14-day cumulative contagion rate rising to 537 cases per 100,000 inhabitants on July 16, Reuters reported citing the country's health ministry data.Spain has been seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases since June-end, with the latest 14-day contagion rate being the highest since February this year.According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the number of Covid-19 patients has almost doubled in the span of 14 days.

19-07-2021||World||Norovirus outbreak in UK: All you need to know about the infection||The United Kingdom, which has relaxed the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions, is now reporting an outbreak of norovirus. Public Health England (PHE) recently issued a warning after finding a jump in norovirus cases during a routine surveillance.In the five weeks since the end of May, 154 cases of norovirus have been recorded in England, according to PHE. The health body said that this is is a three-fold increase in cases over the same time period during the previous five years.And in a more worrying development, the PHE reported increase in norovirus cases in educational settings, particularly in nursery and childcare facilities.What is norovirus?According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. The PHE calls it a "winter vomiting bug".According to CDC, people with norovirus illness can shed billions of virus particles. And only a few of them can make other people sick.How can someone contract norovirus?This increase in cases of norovirus can be a reason of concern for England as well as the world which is already grappling with the spread of Covid-19.According to CDC, a person can contract norovirus by coming in direct contact of an infected person, consuming contaminated food or water and touching contaminated surfaces and then putting your unwashed hands in your mouth.So, the spread is very similar to the way other viruses enter the human body.What are the symptoms of norovirus?The CDC has listed following symptoms of norovirus: diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain. It can cause inflammation of stomach or intestines - called acute gastroenteritis.Other symptoms include fever, headache and body aches.Most people develop the symptoms within 12 to 48 hours of contracting the norovirus, and they can last upto 1 to 3 days.Can someone contract norovirus many times?Yes, says the CDC because there are many different types of noroviruses. And infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types, the health body further said.Though there is a possibility to develop immunity against certain types of norovirus, experts are not yet able to determine how long that immunity lasts.How can the spread of norovirus be stopped?By practicing proper hand hygiene - a method which is very similar to stopping the spread of Covid-19. The health experts say it is essential to wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers, before eating, preparing, or handling food, and before giving yourself or someone else medicine.The experts say that norovirus can stay in human faeces and vomit for two weeks or more, even after a person starts feeling better. Alcohol-based sanitisers are recommended.Treatment for norovirusWell, there is no specific medicine. Experts suggest drinking plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norovirus-outbreak-in-uk-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-infection-101626675876464.html

"One year and a half has passed, but there is no prospect of the trial being held."The two men, who had faced up to three years in prison, pleaded guilty and made a tearful apology to the court last month, saying they regretted their role in smuggling Ghosn out of Japan hidden in a box aboard a private jet from the Kansai airport at the end of 2019.Prosecutors said the Taylors received $1.3 million for their services and another $500,000 for legal fees.Ghosn remains a fugitive in his childhood home of Lebanon, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with Japan.In Japan, he faces charges he understated his compensation in Nissan's financial statements by 9.3 billion yen ($85 million) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East.Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive charged with helping Ghosn hide his compensation, is also on trial in Tokyo. Both Ghosn and Kelly deny the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-father-son-duo-jailed-for-helping-former-nissan-boss-carlos-ghosn-flee-japan-101626673703363.html

According to a 2021 Hurun Global Rich List data, China has over 1,058 billionaires, more than any country on the planet including the United States. With the rapid rise in the ultra-wealthy people in the country, income disparity has also seen a jump, triggering the communist government to force billionaires to make donations for various causes.In June, the founder of food delivery giant Meituan, Wang Xing donated shares worth about $2.27 billion to his personal charity to promote scientific research and education. In March, the founder of e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, Colin Huang, announced he was stepping down as chairman after last year giving away 2.37% of his shares, worth $1.85 billion for education.He Xiangjian of the Midea home appliances empire and Xu Jiayin of the Evergrande real estate empire have also donated roughly $975 mill and $370m respectively to poverty alleviation, medical care and cultural programmes. In May, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming gave around $77 million for education to his hometown of Longyan in Fujian province.The government in China has a firm grip on the political economy of the country and the recent rise in economic inequality has alarmed the government that it could threaten the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The move to force billionaires to make such gestures also comes as the Chinese government has brought companies under the scrutiny of its anti-trust regulator.According to Min Zhou, director of the Asia Pacific Center at the University of California, Western-style philanthropy first took root in China a decade ago. In 2010, American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates visited China for charitable activities. During the trip they praised the move by the Chinese government, Zhou also informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-tackle-income-inequality-china-teaches-billionaires-lesson-in-generosity-101626667866110.html
19-07-2021||World||UK lifts Covid-19 restrictions amid anxiety over fresh surge||The British government on Monday went ahead with the reopening plan and lifted all pandemic restrictions, including mandatory wearing of face masks, even as Covid-19 cases grew exponentially amid concerns of a possible third wave worldwide.From midnight 2300 GMT Sunday (local time), nightclubs, cinemas and other indoor venues in England are allowed to run at full capacity, while legal mandates covering the wearing of masks and working from home have been scrapped. Residents of the UK, who have been fully vaccinated, returning from "amber list" destinations in Europe will no longer have to quarantine.The move to reopen the country aims to revive the economy battered by its deepest recession in 300 years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the decision saying, "If we don't do it now, then we'll be opening up in the autumn, the winter months when the virus has the advantage of the cold weather."In a video message for the nation, Johnson also said that "If we don't do it now, we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it? So this is the right moment, but we've got to do it cautiously."Over the last few weeks, Britain has been facing a new wave of infections as the daily number topped 50,000. The surge has been mostly led by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. With this, hospitals in the UK are also facing rising admissions as they jumped to the highest since late March, multiple news agencies reported. However, hospitalisations have been at a slower pace than new infections.While many have dubbed this as "Freedom Day," epidemiologists and other critics have expressed grave concerns and say the move is coming too soon. Medics also warned that even if Britain is suffering far fewer deaths than in previous waves, such a caseload would still put severe pressure on the National Health Service (NHS) and risks seeding new variants, according to an AFP report.Bloomberg cited a poll for YouGov Plc saying that 60 per cent of British residents are feeling increasingly nervous about the lifting of the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lifts-covid-19-restrictions-amid-anxiety-over-fresh-surge-101626661154510.html
19-07-2021||World||Taliban leadership says ready for a political solution in Afghanistan||The Taliban's supreme leader said Sunday he "strenuously favours" a political settlement to the conflict in Afghanistan, even as the hardline Islamist movement pushes a sweeping offensive across the nation.Hibatullah Akhundzada's announcement came as representatives of the insurgents and the Afghan government sat down for a new round of talks in Qatar, stirring dim hopes for a revival of long-stalled peace talks."In spite of the military gains and advances, the Islamic Emirate strenuously favours a political settlement in the country," Akhundzada said in a statement ahead of next week's Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha."Every opportunity for the establishment of an Islamic system, peace and security that presents itself will be made use of by the Islamic Emirate," he added."We fully assure neighbouring, regional and world countries that Afghanistan will not permit anyone to pose a security threat to any other country using our soil."For months, the two sides have been meeting intermittently in the Qatari capital, but have achieved little if any notable success. The discussions appear to have lost momentum as the militants made enormous gains on the battlefield.The head of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah said the two sides were to meet on Sunday evening, but ducked journalists' questions about a possible joint statement.There were no signs of an imminent breakthrough.'Resolve it ourselves' Taliban leader Akhundzada said his group remained committed to forging a solution to end the war, but slammed the group's opponents for "wasting time"."Our message remains that instead of relying on foreigners, let us resolve our issues among ourselves and rescue our homeland from the prevailing crisis," he added.The insurgents capitalised on the last stages of the withdrawal of US and other foreign troops from Afghanistan to launch a series of lightning offensives across the country.The group is now believed to control roughly half of the nation's 400 districts, several important border crossings, and has laid siege to a string of vital provincial capitals.A spokesman for the Afghan security forces said that pro-government fighters had conducted 244 operations, killing 967 "enemy" fighters -- including key commanders."We have recaptured 24 districts so far, our goal is to retake all the territories... We are ready to defend our country," Ajmal Omar Shinwari told reporters.The Taliban have long appeared to be united, operating under an effective chain of command and carrying out complex military campaigns despite perennial rumours of splits within their leadership.But questions remain over how much control the Taliban's leaders have over commanders on the ground, and whether they will be able to convince them to abide by a potential agreement if signed.Despite coming days ahead of the Eid holiday, the leader's statement notably made no mention of a formal call for a ceasefire.Over the years, the Taliban have announced a series of short truces during Islamic holidays, initially spurring hopes for a larger reduction of violence.However the group has been criticised for using the temporary ceasefires to resupply and reinforce their fighters, allowing them to launch withering onslaughts on Afghanistan's security forces once the truce expires.Temporary ceasefiresIn another sign of the threats facing the Afghan government, on Sunday it said it was recalling its ambassador to Islamabad and all senior diplomats over "security threats".The top envoy's daughter was briefly kidnapped in the Pakistani capital this week.Islamabad has touted a conference of regional leaders to address the violence after the Eid al-Adha holiday, due to start Monday.Many in Afghanistan are planning for a subdued Eid festival."This year we will not be slaughtering" sheep or goats, as per tradition, said Abdullah, a resident of Jalalabad in Afghanistan's east."It's because the situation of our country is not good. The fighting is ongoing. We are concerned," he added."People are poor and most of them are worried about the increase in violence."The US-led military coalition has been on the ground in Afghanistan for nearly two decades following an invasion launched in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.Fears are growing that Afghan forces will be overwhelmed without vital coalition air support, allowing for a complete Taliban military takeover or the start of a multi-sided civil war in a country awash with weapons following nearly four decades of fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leadership-says-ready-for-a-political-solution-in-afghanistan-101626660650352.html

Leichombam was picked up from his house on May 13 for his post on Facebook on the death of BJP’s Manipur unit president S Tikendra Singh due to Covid-19. In his post, Leichombam also stressed that cow urine and dung isn’t a cure for the infection.“I have been targeted by the state government in the past and am sure it will happen again. But I am not afraid and will express what I think is right. I will continue to raise my voice and speak my mind,” Leichombam told HT, moments after his release from an Imphal jail.Leichombam also underlined that journalist Kishorechandra Wangkhem who was also arrested on May 13 after a post on the state BJP leader’s death, is still behind bars. “I have mixed feelings following my release as my friend Kishorechandra is still in prison. I would have been happier if he was also out,” Leichombam said.Leichombam, who has worked with World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), co-founded Peoples’ Resurgence and Justice Alliance outfit along with activist Irom Sharmila and unsuccessfully contested the 2016 Manipur elections from the Thangmeiband seat.A bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah had ordered Leichombam’s release on a petition by his father L Raghumani Singh, telling the authorities to ensure his release by 5pm.“We are of the view that continued detention of the petitioner before this court would amount to violation of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the bench held. The court directed that Erendro should be released forthwith subject to filing of a personal release bond and a surety of ₹1000. “We approached the Supreme Court as we felt that there were sufficient grounds to secure Leichombam’s release as the provisions of NSA were incorrectly slapped on him. The SC order has come as a relief,” said Leichombam’s lawyer Victor Chongtham over phone from Imphal after his release. In July last year, Leichombam was booked for sedition for a Facebook post on Manipur’s titular king, Sanajaoba Leishemba, greeting union home minister Amit Shah after the former’s election to the Rajya Sabha. “Wangkhem is still behind bars. We have not yet decided on what approach we will take to secure his release. But based on Leichombam’s order we are hopeful that he will also be out soon,” said Chongtham.Wangkhem, a popular TV journalist, was first arrested in November 2018 for uploading a video on social media which was critical of the government of Manipur chief minister N. Biren Singh. Several charges under IPC that included sedition and National Security Act were slapped against him. He was released in April 2019 after the Manipur high court revoked his detention. He was again arrested in September 2020 on charges of sedition and promoting enmity between different groups on social media. Wangkhem was released in December 2020 following which joined Frontier Manipur and started hosting a talk show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-continue-to-speak-my-mind-says-manipur-activist-erendro-leichombam-released-on-sc-order-101626718470492.html

19-07-2021||India||Stalin says no talks with Karnataka over Mekedatu project||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Monday ruled out any talks with Karnataka over the proposed construction of the Mekedatu reservoir across the Cauvery river. Stalin met President Ram Nath Kovind in Delhi on Monday and he was responding to reporters when asked if he would participate in talks with Karnataka on the issue.“No scope for talks (with Karnataka). Our water resources minister (S Duraimurugan) has made our stand clear,” Stalin told reporters at the Delhi airport before returning to Chennai.“The Prime Minister has given us an assurance. The Jal Shakti minister has also assured us (that the project will not be implemented). The issue is before the Supreme Court. We will face the issue legally,” he said.Stalin’s comments come in the backdrop of Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa writing to him on July 3 and inviting him for talks to clear apprehensions over the project.While responding to Yediyurappa’s letter, Stalin didn’t address the invitation for bilateral talks but he registered Tamil Nadu’s strong opposition to the 9000-crore project. Successive governments in Tamil Nadu have challenged the project stating that it would disrupt the natural flow of water from Cauvery which originates in Karnataka and irrigates Tamil Nadu’s agrarian regions.Stalin held an all-party meeting on July 12 so that Tamil Nadu can speak in one voice as Karnataka is assertive in its plans to go ahead with the project. Tamil Nadu’s petition challenging the project in the Supreme Court in 2018 is pending. On July 16 representatives from 13 political parties in Tamil Nadu, led by S Duraimurugan, flew to Delhi to hand over a resolution to Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat urging them to not give Karnataka clearance for the project.Though the BJP is in power at the Centre and in Karnataka, the party’s unit in Tamil Nadu is siding with the state. The NDA government in Puducherry has also opposed the project. When asked if Tamil Nadu will hold talks with other lower riparian states such as Puducherry and Kerala that have a share in Cauvery water, Stalin said that there was no necessity for it now.In his meeting with the President, Stalin denied having spoken about the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. He had written a letter to the President in May urging him to remit their life sentence and release them early. “We will face the issue legally as it is pending in the Supreme Court, and the DMK will voice for their release,” he said.Stalin was on his second visit to Delhi after taking charge as chief minister on May 7. He invited the President to attend the centenary year celebrations of the Madras Legislative Council established in 1921 under the then British rule. It would include unveiling a portrait of his father and five-time chief minister M Karunanidhi in the Assembly hall.Stalin also invited President Kovind to lay the foundation stone for new projects that the two-month-old DMK has announced - construction of a library in Madurai, a super speciality hospital in Chennai and a memorial tower to mark 75 years of Independence on the city’s Marina Beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-says-no-talks-with-karnataka-over-mekedatu-project-101626716609467.html

19-07-2021||India||‘Not a shred of evidence to link govt or BJP to controversy’: RS Prasad on Pegasus leak||Reports by an international media consortium that claim Indian politicians, journalists, judges and at least two serving ministers could have been among those targeted for hacking through Israeli spyware that is sold only to governments have snowballed into a political slugfest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition.While the opposition parties are demanding a probe and raised the issue in Parliament, the BJP has denied any link to the wrongdoing.On Monday former IT and telecom Minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad said there is “not even a shred of evidence” to link the BJP or the Union government to the entire Pegasus snooping controversy and raised questions about the timing of the story coinciding with the monsoon session of Parliament.Responding to the Congress party’s demand for an independent probe into the issue, he said,” We strongly refute, condemn the baseless and bereft of political propriety comments of the Congress party. This is a new low in the political discourse of the party that has ruled India for 50 years.”The former minister, during a press briefing, said the country has a robust system and specific laid down rules and procedures that allow tracking or tapping phones for national security purposes.Referring to the statement made by IT minister Ashwini Vaishnav in Parliament on the controversy, Prasad said, “The IT minister confirmed today that lawful interception of electronic communication can only be made as per relevant rules under provisions of section 5(2) of Indian telegraph act, 1885, and section 69 of the information technology act 2000.”Raising questions about the timing of the reports, the minister said the question to ask is that if 45 plus countries are using the cases then why is India being targeted only.He went on to say those who broke the story themselves did not claim that a presence of a particular number in the database does not confirm that it is infected with the spyware. ”The whole story has broken out just one day before the monsoon session, what is the agenda behind this? Why is India being targeted?”The former minister also questioned if the targeting has anything to do with India’s handling of the Covid crisis and the vaccination drive. ”Is it an attempt to block the story of India’s development which is Atmanirbhar and full of confidence? Are some people upset that India is making strides and getting the highest FDI?” he questioned.Training his guns at the Congress, Prasad said, it was during the UPA rule that the then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh complaining that his phone was being tapped at the behest of then home minister P Chidambaram. “In 2013, there were news reports based on RTI queries that peoples’ phones had been tapped,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-shred-of-evidence-to-link-govt-or-bjp-to-controversy-rs-prasad-on-pegasus-leak-101626712529181.html

When Opposition members, led by TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, sought to raise the issue alleging Pramanik was a Bangaldeshi national (without naming him), Union Minister and Leader of the House Piyush Goyal said such remarks should be expunged as it was an insult to Pramanik and the society to which he belongs. As the issue triggered an uproar, the House was adjourned till 3pm.Without naming the minister, Sekhar said, “Go through Wikipedia, you will find the name of a gentleman… A Minister of State for Home Affairs is a reportedly a Bangladeshi.” Soon after, Kharge said, “I have every right to know whether he is a Bangladeshi or not."Last week, Rajya Sabha member and Assam Congress president Ripun Bora had written to Modi seeking an inquiry into the matter. Pramanik was made a junior minister in the home and sports departments in the recent revamp of the Union Cabinet. Ever since his elevation, a number of allegations have been raised against him, including questions being raised about his educational qualifications.Pramanik’s silence on the issues have provided fodder to the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state and is also making news in home district of Cooch Behar.However, some BJP leaders said Pramanik has been busy with two key portfolios and will respond at the right time.The controversy reportedarose after several Bangladeshi media outlets published stories of how Pramanik’s ancestral village celebrated his elevation as a Union minister and that some of his relatives distributed sweets over the matter.Bora has reportedly claimed in his letter that Pramanik was born in Bangladesh. He was born in Harinathpur village under Palashbari police station in the neighbouring country, he wrote.Earlier, Modi was prevented from introducing his newly inducted Union ministers to Rajya Sabha as several slogan-shouting opposition members trooped into the Well of the House to protest over various issues, including farm laws and fuel price hike.Questioning the opposition's conduct, Modi wondered "what kind of mindset is this" that prevents them from giving respect to the new ministers who are women, Dalits and come from Scheduled Tribes and OBC communities.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uproar-in-rajya-sabha-over-new-minister-s-nationality-govt-slams-oppn-claims-101626711877427.html

Of total, seven patients are undergoing treatment.Monday’s cases include a 41-year-old woman from Kattaikonam, Thiruvananthapuram and a 31-year-old doctor from Kumarapuram, George said in a release. The virus was confirmed in tests carried out at the Virology Lab of the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, she said, adding the health of all those infected is satisfactory at present.Kerala, which is already grappling with an increased spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), saw the outbreak of the Zika virus on July 8 when 14 people were found to be infected.

The survey also showed that people who had received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine had higher levels of seropositivity than those who are yet to be immunised against the disease.The seropositivity survey to study the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was conducted by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), news agency PTI reported. It was conducted between May 28 and June 3, when the second wave of infections was subsiding, the report showed.As many as 5,001 samples were collected for the study and out of these, 32 samples were not considered citing various results. The results of the study were available for 4,969 samples that included 2,354 males and 2,615 females, Dr Bhavin Solanki, AMC medical officer of health, said, according to PTI. “We carry out sero-surveillance studies at regular intervals to detect antibodies. Overall, 80 per cent seropositivity has been detected in the general population of Ahmedabad. Those who took both the doses had high levels of seropositivity as compared to those who took none,” he added.Also read | Covid-19 antibodies last 9 months after infection, claims studyAs many as 4,056 samples contained antibodies against Covid-19 with 81.63% seropositivity. “A total of 1,938 males demonstrated the presence of antibodies, giving the positivity of 82.33%, while 2,118 females, which comes to 80.99%, had antibodies. Thus, the seropositivity is higher among males as compared to females,” PTI reported, citing the report by the AMC. This also included over 80% of the samples that possessed the antibodies on account of previous infections or the vaccination or both.Meanwhile, 2,887 people in the survey were not infected with Covid-19 in the past and were not vaccinated and 2,216 people among them had antibodies which accounts for 76.76%. On the contrary, 158 people were infected with Covid-19 in the past and also had taken two doses of the vaccine and 154 people among them had antibodies, the report further highlighted. Also, antibodies were found in 164 samples out of 173, who had Covid-19 earlier and had taken one dose of the vaccine.Among people who were vaccinated, those with previous infections had more antibodies than those that were never infected and those who had taken two doses of the vaccine had higher seropositivity than those with only one dose.“A majority of the vaccinated population in our sample were vaccinated with Covishield vaccine. Although there are very few who were vaccinated with Covaxin in our sample, people with Covaxin have slightly higher seropositivity as compared to Covishield,” PTI quoted from the survey. However, the report also highlighted that the available data is “insufficient” to comment on the status of herd immunity for the entire city. It further said that vaccination is needed for complete control over the pandemic situation.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-81-people-in-ahmedabad-have-covid-19-antibodies-serological-survey-finds-101626707621460.html

He said all required steps were being taken and crowded places were being regulated to contain the spread of the viral disease.Thakur’s comments came amid concerns being raised by the Central government over tourists flouting coronavirus protocol at several places. Several experts have urged caution as fears of a third wave of the deadly virus loomed large on the country. The CM had said on Saturday the government wanted tourists to visit Himachal Pradesh, but they would have to follow norms. Earlier this month, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said that visuals from tourist spots of people mingling without adhering to protocols are a "serious cause of concern", and asserted that lowering of guard cannot be accepted at present.“You cannot stop tourists from entering the state.

The present spell of heavy to very heavy downpour will also continue till July 20 over the western Himalayan region -- Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand -- and adjoining northwest India, comprising Punjab, Haryana, east Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh and northwest Madhya Pradesh.Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is likely over Jammu division, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana till Tuesday. The IMD predicted moderate downpour at most places with isolated intense spells across the national capital of Delhi during the next 24 hours.This is because the western end of the monsoon trough continued to run in its normal position and may gradually shift northwards from Tuesday. Subsequently, a low pressure area is likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal around July 23.The weather body also warned of moderate to severe lightning strikes at isolated places of Uttar Pradesh, north MP and east Rajasthan during the next 24 hours.Widespread downpour has been witnessed over the past few days across the country with cloudbursts and flooding leading to loss of lives and property in some states and disrupting normal life at other places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wet-spell-to-continue-as-imd-predicts-heavy-rains-across-north-west-regions-101626698409846.html

Among the infected, 40 are MBBS students and 10 post-graduate students. Later students’ hostels were shut down.A test drive was carried out at the college after an employee of a coffee house situated on the premises of the hospital died a couple of days ago due to Covid-19 complications. The coffee house was later closed and 13 of its workers also tested positive. Hospital authorities said most of the infected students had received both doses of vaccine and the majority of them are asymptomatic.Most of the students were working in Covid wards and their sudden infection affected some of the wards, said a senior doctor who did not want to be named. “We started an inquiry about how the hospital has turned into a major cluster of the virus. The health department has also sought a report from the hospital,” she said.The country’s first Covid-19 case was reported from Thrissur in 2020 January in a China-returned medical student. She was admitted to Thrissur medical college hospital for almost a month. Last week, she again tested positive and is undergoing quarantine at her home. “We suspect the presence of a strong Delta variant in some pockets of the district. Samples of some of the infected were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for more studies,” she said.A pandemic hotspot, the state has been reporting at least one-third of total cases of the country for almost a month. On Sunday, it reported 13,956 cases with a test positivity rate of 10.69 % and its active caseload also crossed 1.25 lakh, according to statistics released by the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-medical-students-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-thrissur-medical-college-hospital-101626697647515.html

In his PIL, Gupta sought directions to authorities to provide the interim custody of orphaned children to their nearest relatives, or child care homes, while protecting their identity."D.O. letter dated 30.04.2021 by secretary, MWCD was sent to chief secretaries with request to district magistrates in all the districts to ensure immediate action of rehabilitation of children orphaned due to Covid-19. Information about the child may be shared with child helpline 1098," the ministry mentioned in its affidavit in the high court.It further stated children under distress are mandated care and protection under the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, 2015, which, it said, has to be implemented by states and UTs. "Child Protection Services, a centrally-sponsored scheme, is already being implemented to provide financial support to states and UTs for delivering services under the JJ Act," the affidavit said.The ministry also mentioned national initiative "SAMVAD," which stands for "Support, Advocacy and Mental Health interventions for children in Vulnerable Circumstances and Distress," as well as a 24x7 number for emergency outreach, as steps taken by it to support the psychosocial and mental health of children impacted by the pandemic. It also said states and UTs were asked to issue public notices in local languages over issues requiring lawful course of action in case of orphaned children.In May, prime minister Narendra Modi announced children, who lost both parents due to Covid-19, will be supported under the "PM Cares for Children" scheme.

The deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh Narayan Singh repeatedly negated raising such issues under the points of order. Points of order are raised to enforce rules of procedures or such articles in the constitution to regulate the business of the house.“A minister of states of home affairs is reportedly a Bangladeshi,” said Trinamool Congress leader Sukhendu Shekhar Roy. Former leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge also tried to raise the issue, finally resulting in another adjournment of the House till 3pm. This was the third time that Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Monday.The first session was adjourned after the obituary readings as a mark of respect for departed MPs Raghunath Mohapatra and Rajeev Satav, while the second session witnessed sloganeering by the Opposition, due to which newly inducted ministers could not be introduced.

19-07-2021||India||UK, US, EU accuse Chinese state-backed actors of targeting servers worldwide||The UK, the US and the European Union (EU) on Monday accused Chinese state-backed actors of hacking more than 250,000 computer networks around the world via Microsoft Exchange servers.Britain said it was joining like-minded partners to confirm that the Chinese state-backed actors were “responsible for gaining access to computer networks around the world”.The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: “The attacks took place in early 2021, affecting over a quarter of a million servers worldwide.”Britain also attributed China’s ministry of state security (MSS) or the civilian intelligence agency of being behind hacker groups known to cyber security experts as Advanced Persistent Threat 40 (APT40) and Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (APT31).Also Read | Women at risk, from streets to cyberspaceBoth APT40 and APT31 have been described by experts as actors backed by or having a nexus with the Chinese state that specialise in targeting crucial technologies or intellectual property theft.The EU said in a statement that the targeting of Microsoft Exchange servers undermined the security of thousands of networks worldwide, including in member states and EU institutions. “It allowed access to a significant number of hackers that have continued to exploit the compromise to date,” the statement added.The EU further said it detected malicious cyber activities linked to APT40 and APT31 that were “conducted from the territory of China” and targeted government institutions and political organisations in member states and key European industries for intellectual property theft and espionage.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that “countries around the world are holding the People’s Republic of China (PRC) accountable for its pattern of irresponsible, disruptive, and destabilising behaviour in cyberspace. The MSS, he added, has “fostered an ecosystem of criminal contract hackers who carry out both state-sponsored activities and cybercrime for their own financial gain”.Blinken said the US and its partners had “formally confirmed that cyber actors affiliated with the MSS exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server in a massive cyber espionage operation”.“As evidenced by the indictment of three MSS officers and one of their contract hackers unsealed by the Department of Justice [on Monday], the US will impose consequences on PRC malicious cyber actors for their irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace,” Blinken added.UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab described the cyber attacks by Chinese state-backed groups as a “reckless but familiar pattern of behaviour”. He added, “The Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held account if it does not.”The attack was highly likely to enable large-scale espionage, including acquiring personally identifiable information and intellectual property, the Foreign Office said.At the time of the attack, the UK provided advice and recommended actions to those affected and Microsoft said that 92% of customers had patched against the vulnerability by the end of March.“The Chinese government has ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead allowing its state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when caught,” the Foreign Office statement said.The UK said its coordinated action with partners is part of the world community’s efforts to “urge the Chinese government to take responsibility for its actions and respect the democratic institutions, personal data and commercial interests of those with whom it seeks to partner”.“The UK is calling on China to reaffirm the commitment made to the UK in 2015 and as part of the G20 not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property of trade secrets,” it added.The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued specific advice to more than 70 affected organisations in Britain to enable them to mitigate the effects of the hacking.In 2018, the UK government and its allies revealed that elements of the China’s ministry of state security were responsible for one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions stealing trade secrets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-us-eu-accuse-chinese-state-backed-hacker-groups-of-targeting-servers-worldwide-101626695907328.html
19-07-2021||India||Widespread, intense rainfall activity to continue over NW India till Wednesday||Widespread and heavy rains lashed several parts of northwest India and the Western Himalayan region on Monday.This is mainly because of the western end of the monsoon trough running over parts of northwest India and two cyclonic circulations causing convective activity over the region. Satellite images show dense cloud cover over northwest India. Heavy and widespread rain over the region is likely to continue till Wednesday, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The west coast is also receiving intense rainfall mainly because of an offshore trough (area of low pressure) stretching from Maharashtra to Karnataka coast.Between Sunday and Monday, weather stations that recorded over 7cm rain are: Uran- 45cm; Thane- 28cm; Ulhasnagar- 20cm; Sanpada -24.8cm; Matheran-27 cm; Mormugao and Harnai-19 cm each; Panjim and Ratnagiri-15 each; and Bulsar and Mahabaleshwar-10 each cm all in Maharashtra. In Delhi, Mungespur -10cm, Najafgarh -9cm, Safdarjung -7cm, and Palam -10cm.“The western end of the monsoon trough is passing close to Delhi. There are also two cyclonic circulations, one over southwest Uttar Pradesh and another over north Pakistan. The combination of these features is bringing widespread and continuous rains here over NW India. Both radar and satellite images are showing convective activity and dense cloud cover over the region stretching from Punjab to north Madhya Pradesh. It’s an intense patch,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.“There is very strong wind convergence along the west coast and an offshore trough is also affecting the region bringing heavy rains,” she added.The western end of monsoon trough is running close to its normal position and is likely to shift gradually northwards from July 20 when more rains also expected along the Himalayan foothills, scientists said. Its eastern end is lying north of its normal position and is likely to continue there for the next two days and shift southwards thereafter.A low pressure area is likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal around July 23. An offshore trough at mean sea level is running from Maharashtra coast to Karnataka coast. It is likely to persist the next 3-4 days.Present spell of heavy to very heavy rainfall activity is very likely to continue till July 20 with widespread rainfall and very heavy falls very likely over western Himalayan region (Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and adjoining northwest India (Punjab, Haryana, East Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh and northwest Madhya Pradesh).Isolated extremely heavy rain is very likely over Jammu division, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana on July 19 and heavy to very heavy rainfall on July 20 over the same areas.Moderate rainfall at most places with isolated intense spells is very likely over Delhi during the next 24 hours.Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are very likely to continue over west coast and adjoining inland areas during the next 4-5 days. Isolated extremely heavy falls (over 20cm) are also very likely over Konkan, Goa and adjoining ghat areas of madhya Maharashtra till July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widespread-intense-rainfall-activity-to-continue-over-nw-india-till-wednesday-101626695847617.html
19-07-2021||India||Af min ‘concerned’ at Pak charge of Indian hand in envoy daughter’s abduction||Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar on Monday expressed concern at Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s claim that India’s spy agency was involved in the abduction of the Afghan envoy’s daughter in Islamabad, saying such “unprofessional remarks” could affect bilateral relations. Atmar conveyed his country’s concerns to his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi during a phone conversation. The call was arranged at the Pakistani side’s request after the Afghan government decided on Sunday to recall its ambassador and senior diplomats from Islamabad over the kidnapping of the envoy’s daughter. Selsela Alikhil, the 26-year-old daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hours and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on Friday. Afghan first vice president Amrullah Saleh said on Sunday the incident had “wounded the psyche of our nation”. Also Read | Afghanistan recalls diplomats from Pakistan after kidnapping of envoy’s daughterA statement in Dari from the Afghan foreign ministry said Atmar spoke with Qureshi “on the ongoing investigation into the abduction of the daughter of Afghanistan’s ambassador to Islamabad, expressing his deep concern over the remarks made by Pakistan’s interior minister”. Atmar said such “unprofessional remarks and premature judgments will severely damage bilateral relations and the credibility of ongoing investigation that has not yet been completed”, according to the statement. In an interview with a Pakistani TV news channel on Sunday, Ahmed had claimed that the Afghan ambassador’s daughter “was not kidnapped” and had gone from Islamabad to Rawalpindi of her own will. He further claimed RAW, India’s external intelligence agency, was involved in the incident as part of a “conspiracy to slander Pakistan”. “The main problem is that they aren’t saying why she went to Rawalpindi,” Ahmed said, speaking in Urdu. He claimed Pakistani security agencies had CCTV footage of the envoy’s daughter travelling to Rawalpindi and that they had established she had used her phone at the time she was abducted. “We have presented the situation to the nation and we are being dishonoured before the world, on social media we are being given a bad name...This is all being done according to a plan. There is a conspiracy to slander Pakistan and RAW is involved,” Ahmed claimed. The Afghan foreign ministry’s statement said Atmar told Qureshi that Afghanistan is ready to cooperate with the Pakistan government in the investigation into the abduction to “apprehend and prosecute the perpetrators of this crime and to ensure the security of Afghan political missions and diplomats”. An Afghan delegation is scheduled to visit Pakistan, and further steps regarding the return of the Afghan ambassador and diplomats will be taken in light of the delegation’s findings. The downturn in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations came days after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani accused Pakistan of not taking action to prevent the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters” in the past month, and not delivering on repeated promises to influence the Taliban to join negotiations to find a peaceful settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/af-min-concerned-at-pak-charge-of-indian-hand-in-envoy-daughter-s-abduction-101626694289001.html
19-07-2021||India||Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi appointed deputy leader of Rajya Sabha||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday announced the appointment of Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi as the deputy leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha. Naqvi takes over from Piyush Goyal who has been elevated as the leader of the house in the Upper House.A former minister of state for parliamentary affairs minister, Naqvi is well versed in Parliamentary affairs. He is also known for his cordial relations across party lines. “At parliamentary affairs ministry, he had a good working relation with various political parties. He knows how to engage with the opposition, especially when there are tricky issues before the house,” said a BJP leader requesting anonymity.Naqvi’s appointment comes at a time when the government is facing questions from the Opposition on a bunch of issues notably price rise, the response to the Covid-19 situation and the preparation for the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. On Monday, both Houses of Parliament were disputed by the opposition that raised slogans even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi rose to introduce the newly inducted ministers as per tradition.“Both Goyal and Naqvi have their job cut out for them. They will have to handle the opposition in the Upper House and ensure that the house proceedings are conducted smoothly to allow the passage of bills,” said the BJP leader quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-appointed-deputy-leader-of-rajya-sabha-101626693568349.html
19-07-2021||India||Illegal surveillance not possible: Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Pegasus Project||Union minister for electronics and information technology (MeitY) Ashwini Vaishnaw on Monday said that reports suggesting India used Israeli spyware Pegasus to hack phones of journalists, activists and ministers were nothing but an “attempt to malign Indian democracy and its well-established institutions”.Vaishnaw, who was making his first speech in Parliament as the new MeitY minister, said the “highly sensational story” has made several “over the top allegations” but there is “no substance behind them”.“It is not a coincidence that the reports have been published a day before the monsoon session of Parliament,” he said. “In the past, similar allegations were made [about the use of Pegasus] on WhatsApp but there is no factual basis to these and have been categorically denied.”Also Read | Cyber attack: At least nine rights activists targetedIndia is among the countries that used Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus phone hacking software to potentially target politicians, journalists and activists, an international collaborative investigation involving 17 media organisations including The Guardian, The Washington Post, and Die Zeit said. India’s news website The Wire was one of the 17.Also Read | ‘Aap chronology samajhiye…’: Amit Shah questions timing of Pegasus leaksThe first part of the multi-part investigation, released late on Sunday night, said that 38 Indian journalists (according to The Guardian), including those from mainstream publications (three current Hindustan Times journalists are named, as is one from sister publication Mint), and websites, apart from freelancers were targeted. The 38 are among 180 journalists the report said were targeted worldwide, including the editor of the Financial Times Roula Khalaf, and journalists from the Wall Street Journal, CNN, New York Times, and Le Monte.The investigation was based on a data leak of around 50,000 numbers obtained by Amnesty International and Paris-based Forbidden Stories, a non-profit. To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. Amnesty International subsequently forensically investigated 67 of these phones, and found 23 hacked and 14 showing signs of attempted penetration.The Wire reported that 10 of the phones forensically examined in India showed they had either been hacked or showed signs of an attempted hacking.NSO Group, in a response to Forbidden Stories and its media partners, said the interpretations from the leaked dataset were misleading. “The alleged amount of ‘leaked data of more than 50,000 phone numbers,’ cannot be a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus,” it said, and added that it “does not have insight into the specific intelligence activities of its customers”.Vaishnaw added that there were inconsistencies in the report. “One report clearly states that the presence of a number on NSO’s list does not mean it is under surveillance,” he said. “The consortium has accessed a leaked database of 40,000 numbers. The presence of the number does not indicate whether there was an attempted hack, or a successful one,” he said.Citing NSO’s statement calling the report misleading, the minister said, “The response also states that the names of the countries using Pegasus is incorrect.”Highlighting the Telegraph Act and Information Technology Act, he said, “No form of illegal surveillance is possible with the kind of checks and balances instituted by the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-surveillance-not-possible-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw-on-pegasus-project-101626693447152.html

19-07-2021||India||Lightning strikes in India see 34% rise than previous year, finds CSE study||Between April 2020 and March this year, India witnessed 18.5 million lightning strikes, marking a significant 34% increase in 13.8 million bolts from the blue in a similar period the previous year, a study by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down to Earth found.Laying stress on the trend that the number and frequency of lightning strikes have increased globally, the environment think-tank attempted to find out their link with climate change and unchecked urbanisation.As many as 1,697 people were killed after they were struck by lightning between March last year and April this year. Experts are of the view that the increase in incidents of lightning strikes are owing to climate change.“There is growing scientific evidence that climate change may be sparking more lightning across the world. Rapid urbanisation and population growth have guaranteed an intensification of human exposure to lightning hazards,” says Down To Earth managing editor Richard Mahapatra.ALSO READ | Climate crisis reason behind increase in lightning strikesIn recent months states such as West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Puducherry have seen a sudden spurt in incidents of lightning strikes. Punjab has seen an exponential 331% annual rise in such incidents while in Bihar — where 401 people lost their lives to lightning strikes during the year — recodes a 168% rise.National Disaster Management Authority listed thunderstorms accompanied by lightning strikes (usually in the pre-monsoon and monsoon months) are the single-largest killers among natural disasters in India.A study conducted by California University in 2015 projected that a rise in average global temperatures by 1ºC would increase the frequency of lightning by at least 12%.A soon-to-be-published paper in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics also cautioned that the frequency of lightning strikes in India are expected to increase by 10% to 25% every year and could grow by 50% by the turn of the century.Experts have found that a foreboding dimension of the rise in incidents of lightning strikes is their link to growing forest fires. “Scientists from the Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Srinagar, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, have studied the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in different weather conditions in the central Himalayan region. They have found a five-time higher concentration of CCN in the atmosphere during forest fires as against during rains. In May 2021, researchers in Australia linked excess CCN to the increased number of lightning strikes during the 2019-20 Australia forest fires,” says Kiran Pandey, programme director of CSE’s environmental resources unit.However, India has made some progress to mitigate the adverse effects of lightning strikes. The rise in fatalities prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to start lightning forecasts from April 1, 2019. Lightning India Resilient Campaign (LRIC), a joint initiative of several bodies such as Climate Resilient Observing-Systems Promotion Council (CROPC), National Disaster Management Authority, IMD, Union ministry of earth sciences and others aims to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning strikes to less than 1,200 a year by 2022.A senior reporter with Down to Earth, Akshit Sangomla said the LRIC campaign helped bring down lightning-related deaths by more than 60% within two years of its launch. “Dedicated efforts by governments of states like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have led to a 70% reduction in fatalities,” Sangomla added.CSE’ Kiran Pandey said the recorded incidents of lightning revealed that the seasonality of bolt is different each state, and laid stress that the lightning risk management programme is customised for each state according to their seasonality, frequency of occurrence and intensity.“States should undertake lightning micro-zonation for the regions inside their boundaries, depending on their geography, to handle the disaster and death risks better. These are LRIC’s recommendations and they make a lot of sense,” says Pandey.ALSO READ | Lightning strikes in north India: All you need to know about phenomenonMahapatra was of the view that even though fatalities from lightning strikes cannot be reduced to zero, their numbers can be decreased.He spoke on the need to create general awareness about universal safe practices, such as staying indoors for up to 30 minutes after the last flash if the time between a lightning flash and thunder is less than 30 seconds. “The next steps would involve making use of the evolving science and technology on the subject and decentralising predictions and risk management,” Mahapatra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lightning-strikes-in-india-see-34-rise-than-previous-year-finds-cse-study-101626691375033.html
19-07-2021||India||Covid-19: AIIMS doctor urges people to be careful for next 1 to 2 years||A leading health expert said on Monday that people should be careful for the next one to two years, and do not give a chance to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to explode again. The advise of Dr Neeraj Nischal, professor at medicine department of AIIMS, came as India heads towards the festival season.He also said that ripples of the second wave can still be seen."Idea of festivals is to share happiness, not Covid. For next 1-2 years, till the pandemic is not under control, we shouldn't become part of reason for causing the pandemic to explode again," Dr Nischal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The warning comes a day after health experts cautioned people to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour for the next 125 crucial days to minimise the effect of the infection.Alerts have been extended from overcrowded public places to religious gatherings which experts say can emerge as epicentres, if not restricted.Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul said that country has not reached the stage of herd immunity yet, but added that it does not want to acquire herd immunity through infections either.A similar warning was issued by other experts, like Dr Arvind Kumar, Director and Head of Department, Paediatrics, Fortis Hospital. He said that the second wave "spread like wildfire" in the country because people did not follow Covid appropriate behaviour. "It caused a lot of morbidity and mortality," he said.To avoid the maximum impact of the wave, the experts are repeatedly advising to maintain a social distance of six feet at public places, avoid crowded places, always wear a mask in public places among other Covid appropriate behaviour.During the second wave, the country witnessed an unprecedented surge in death toll and caseload. The health experts are predicting that a third wave could strike between late August and early September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-aiims-doctor-urges-people-to-be-careful-for-next-1-to-2-years-101626690721935.html
19-07-2021||India||PM Modi, PM Deuba agree to enhance India-Nepal cooperation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nepal’s new Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on Monday agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation and strengthen coordination in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. PM Modi spoke on the phone with Deuba a day after he comfortably won a vote of confidence in Nepal’s reinstated Parliament with the backing of his Nepali Congress party and other parties. Modi conveyed his congratulations and best wishes to Deuba on being appointed the prime minister and for winning the confidence vote. “Recalling the unique and millenia-old people-to-people linkages that underpin the special friendship between India and Nepal, the leaders agreed to work together to enhance bilateral cooperation in all areas,” the external affairs ministry said in a readout of the conversation. “They discussed, in particular, ways to strengthen cooperation and coordination in the context of ongoing effort against the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said. In a tweet, Modi said he and Deuba “will work together to further enhance the wide-ranging cooperation between India and Nepal, including in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic”. Deuba secured 165 votes in the vote in the 271-member House of Representatives or Lower House on Sunday evening. A total of 83 MPs, mostly supporters of CPN-UML chair and outgoing premier KP Sharma Oli, voted against Deuba. The vote of confidence put paid to desperate efforts by Oli to cling on to power after serious differences emerged within the government, especially between Oli and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”. On July 12, Nepal’s Supreme Court reinstated the House of Representatives that was dissolved by Oli on May 21. A day later, Deuba was appointed prime minister for the fifth time in line with an order from the Supreme Court. Under the provisions of Nepal’s Constitution, Deuba had to seek a vote of confidence within 30 days of his appointment. Nepal’s political leaders had accused President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Oli of subverting the Constitution through their actions. Deuba is expected to have a tenure of about a year and a half, and repairing ties with India after a border row during Oli’s term will be among his priorities. Nepal is also looking to India to resume supplies of Covid-19 vaccines that have already been paid for. The supply of one million doses of Covishield ordered by Nepal has been held since April, when India stopped exports as part of part of efforts to deal with a second wave of Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pm-deuba-agree-to-enhance-india-nepal-cooperation-101626690567007.html

He further said that the vaccines currently in use for the immunisation were effective against the variant, citing studies by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“B.1.617.2, a variant of Covid-19 is known as the Delta variant. It was first identified in October 2020 in India, and was primarily responsible for the second wave in the country, today accounting for over 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases. It emerged in Maharashtra and travelled northwards along the western states of the country before entering the central and the eastern states,” Dr Arora said.Also read | Vaccines reduce hospitalisation, death risk due to Covid: StudyCurrently, the variant has spread to more than 80 countries across the world, including the US, the UK and Singapore, and is around 40 per cent to 60 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, Dr Arora further said.“However, it is difficult to say that disease due to delta variant is more severe. The age profile and the deaths during the second wave in India were quite similar to that seen during first wave,” he added.The health expert said that the vaccines that are currently used for the immunisation program in India are effective against the variant.He also warned about a possibile emergence of a new variant of coronavirus. “The cases may go up if a new, more infectious variant comes. In other words, next wave will be driven by a virus variant to which significant proportion of population is susceptible,” Dr Arora said.Dr Arora also said that vaccination and following Covid appropriate behaviour were needed to manage the pandemic and also to control and delay future waves of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-variant-primarily-responsible-for-covid-19-second-wave-says-govt-expert-101626689924076.html

Earlier this month, Sidhu came to the national capital and met Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as the infighting played out with visible cracks in the Punjab unit.

He then requested the PM to put the introductory document on the union ministers and ministers of state on the table.Meanwhile, Congress deputy leader and MP from Assam’s Kaliabor constituency Gaurav Gogoi said that the Prime Minister prioritised the Cabinet reshuffle over the problems faced by Indians. “The PM believes that his decision to reshuffle the Cabinet is more important than the economic burden he has imposed on the millions of the Indian citizens,” Gogoi said, adding, “The Congress stands with the people of India.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “Healthy traditions in the House have been set by following conventions. I have been in the house for the last 24 years and have not seen such an incident where the PM could not introduce his council of ministers, even if it is one minister. It is sad, unfortunate and unhealthy.”However, in 2004, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could not introduce the ministers in his Cabinet in the Parliament—the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) protested the inclusion of late Mohammed Taslimuddin, and Lalu Prasad Yadav in the council of ministers.Congress MP Manickam Tagore also said there was a second incident in 2013 wherein former Prime Minister Singh wasn’t allowed to introduce his ministers in the House. “So, the BJP cannot say that this has never happened before,” said Tagore.Similar scenes were also witnessed in Rajya Sabha when the Prime Minister tried to introduce the new council of ministers in the House. The new BJP leader of Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal called it an “unfortunate” situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-pm-s-introduction-of-new-ministers-in-cabinet-interrupted-by-opposition-101626680785940.html

Jaishankar stood his ground at the meeting and wanted China to complete the disengagement process and resolve all outstanding border issues along the 1597-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in East Ladakh.Also read | 'Should set aside LAC standoff to revive ties': ChinaAlthough the disengagement from the north and south banks of Pangong Tso is complete, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not restored the April 2020 status quo from both Gogra and Hot Springs posts. The other issue that is hanging fire is the restoration of full patrolling rights to the Indian Army in Depsang Bulge as the PLA has virtually blocked the ingress route in this sensitive area which saw heavy fighting in the 1962 war. Even today both the armies deployed on either side of the LAC with support elements of tanks, rockets and artillery. Jaishankar stood firm that normalisation of ties could only happen after the resolution of the East Ladakh LAC contentious issues and put the ball in Chinese court as the May 2020 flare-up was due to aggression of the PLA in Pangong Tso, Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs. The unilateral change of status quo on the LAC was in utter contempt of the 1993 and 1996 agreements for maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border.Also read | On the border, China isn’t listeningHowever, the Chinese foreign minister Wang indicated that Beijing wanted the parallel diplomacy of the 1980s to be exercised, where the LAC issue would be put on the back burner for local commanders to resolve while the bilateral ties were restored to pre-2020 days with economic ties taking priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-firm-on-lac-resolution-at-dushanbe-with-wang-yi-economic-ties-later-101626675939660.html

As soon as the police team reached the spot, the bride and groom fled the venue.“We collected ₹3,000 from the hotel owner and ₹5,000 from the groom’s family for violation of Covid guidelines. Though the organisers had taken permission for the marriage, they were penalised for inviting more people than prescribed,” said the inspector. As per the Covid guidelines, not more than 25 persons are allowed to attend a marriage function.Early this month, police in Cuttack city had imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on organisers of a marriage function for flouting Covid guidelines.The Covid situation in Odisha continued to remain grim with 2000-2200 cases reported daily on an average and total casualties going past the 5,000 mark on Saturday. The government believes that the fresh infections in the state were mostly driven by hidden cases.“There were many symptomatic individuals too who did not opt for Covid test, spreading infection in the process. The spread can be contained by identifying and isolating the hidden asymptomatic cases,” said Dr Bijay Mohapatra, director of health services. He said the state government had begun integrated surveillance for three months, which had led to detection of more than 1 lakh cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bride-groom-flee-own-wedding-as-odisha-cops-raid-venue-for-covid-rule-violation-101626673883381.html

A senior Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader, not wishing to be named, said that the President is likely to be invited to unveil a portrait of Stalin’s late father and five-time Tamil Nadu chief minister M Karunanidhi in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. Stalin reached Delhi on Sunday. This is his second visit to the national capital after taking charge as chief minister of the souther state on May 7. He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 17 and submitted a list of 25 demands, which included the release of the seven prisoners convicted in the 1991 Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.Also Read | In Tamil Nadu, murmurs of state bifurcation provoke a backlashStalin is also likely to take this issue up with the President, to whom he had also written a letter in May requesting him to remit the sentence and expedite the release of the seven persons imprisoned for over three decades. Stalin has permitted a two-month long parole for one of the convicts, AG Perarivalan, on medical grounds. All regional parties in Tamil Nadu support the release of the prisoners, who are currently serving a life sentence. In 2018, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet passed a unanimous resolution for the release of all seven prisoners in the case; the resolution was sent to Governor Banwarilal Purohit for his assent. During a case hearing in the Supreme Court on Perarivalan’s remission, an affidavit submitted noted that Purohit was awaiting a report of the multi-disciplinary monitoring agency of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to make his decision. But in subsequent hearings, the CBI clarified that there is no connection between the remission of the sentence and investigation. The apex court also termed the governor’s delay as “extraordinary”. However, in February this year, Purohit refrained from taking a call on the matter and said that the President was the competent authority to make this decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-to-meet-president-kovind-in-delhi-today-101626672323037.html

19-07-2021||India||Mayawati plans Brahmin outreach before polls||Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections slated to be held next year, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)chief Mayawati announced on Sunday that the party will launch a campaign to reach out to Brahmin voters in the state.“A campaign, led by BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, will be started from Ayodhya on July 23 to awaken the Brahmin community once again... After forming the government, the BSP will take care of their ( Brahmins’) dignity and protect their interests,” said the BSP chief while addressing a press conference.Mayawati’s Brahmin outreach was considered as one of the key factors for her win in the 2007 state assembly election.She attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the state, accusing it of “harassing and exploiting the community” after winning the 2017 assembly polls with the help of their votes.“The BJP formed the government with the support of the Brahmins but instead of working for the welfare of the community, it committed atrocities on them. They were being harassed and exploited and were repenting their support to the BJP.”She further praised the Dalit community for not “falling in the trap” of the BJP and other rival parties. The BJP organised ‘khichadi’ feast of their leaders with the members of the Dalit community, as well as a rath yatra to win the support of the Dalits during the 2017 assembly elections. “I am proud of the Dalit community’s support who did not deviate, remained united, and voted for the BSP,” she said.BJP state unit spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi hit back, saying, “From 2007 to 2012, the BSP government indulged in the policy of appeasement. The upper castes were sidelined and now when the elections are knocking on the door, BSP chief Mayawati has started to woo Brahmins again. The Brahmins know that BJP worked for their welfare and dignity. In the 2022 polls, they would again support the BJP.”Congress party spokesperson, Naseemuddin Siddiqui said, “Due to shrinking support base, the BSP chief Mayawati is panicking, she is indulging in the politics of caste, the Congress believes in working for the welfare of all the caste and communities in Uttar Pradesh as well as in the other states.”Samajwadi Party state unit spokesperson, Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said, “The SP respected all communities and castes.

Come to the FLOOR OF THE HOUSE,” TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O Brien tweeted, indicating rejection of the offer.Management of the Covid-19 pandemic and India’s vaccination strategy have been at the centre of a raging debate between the Narendra Modi-led government and the Opposition, with the latter calling the vaccination policy “faulty” and its distribution plan “opaque”. The Opposition has also accused the central government of not sending enough doses to non-BJP governed states. The government managers, however, rejected the charges and hailed the domestically produced vaccines as major achievements.A senior Opposition leader, who did not wish to be named, said, “Any briefing on the Covid management would affect the prospects of a full debate. The Parliament is meeting after the second wave. It must debate the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-turns-down-offer-of-separate-briefing-on-covid-by-pm-modi-101626655830520.html

Most of the side effects, the report added, were related to anxiety following vaccination – which does not directly implicate the product.“55 out of 60 cases for which Causality assessment has been done found to have consistent causal association to vaccination, Of these, 36 were anxiety related reactions and 18 were vaccine product related reactions and one was classified as both -- vaccine product related and anxiety related reaction. Five cases have been found to have inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental - not linked to vaccination) of which one was a death case,” said the ministry’s AEFI report.The result of the causality assessment for these 60 cases was completed on May 27, 2021, after a thorough review, deliberation and approval by the national AEFI committee.“The data is thoroughly analysed by experts as part of India’s AEFI surveillance system.

19-07-2021||India||Foreigner who attacked Bengaluru cops held||Bengaluru: Bengaluru police on Saturday arrested a 36-year-old foreign national, who attacked two policemen on patrolling duty on Maragondanahalli in the last week of June. The arrested man, identified as Asiedu Morgan, was absconding since the attack and was finally arrested by the police from sector 3, in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. According to a statement from the police, Morgan, along with his four friends, was caught creating a ruckus in the KR Puram area on the night of June 23 and their neighbours informed the police. When the police team arrived at the location, he picked up an argument with the policemen and in a fit rage, hit their motorcycle with his car. The personnel had to jump out of the bike to escape the attack, the police said in the statement. A senior police officer in the know of the developments said that the attack in Maragondanahalli influenced the police’s decision to conduct raids across the city to identify foreigners overstaying in the city. During these raids, five homes were searched by a team of six ACPs, 20 police inspectors and over 100 police constables, read a statement from the CCB. Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Thursday conducted raids across the city and 38 foreigners were detained for not having valid documents while seven were detained on charges of overstaying. “The officials also found marijuana and 90 ecstasy pills from two foreigners. They have been arrested,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). Bengaluru police had announced that it will book house owners if tenants were found involved in narcotics cases. The top brass of the city police had issued directions to all police stations after several instances were reported of landlords not verifying documents of foreign nationals before renting out their property. “In many cases, this is done with the knowledge that they were staying illegally, to get more rent,” said a senior CCB official. As many as 70 foreign nationals were arrested in 2020 under Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS), in comparison to 44 in 2018 and 38 in 2019. The number of arrested persons in 2020 under the NDPS Act increased by 200% last year. According to the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), Bengaluru, more than 800 foreigners are overstaying in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreigner-who-attacked-bengaluru-cops-held-101626638240867.html

19-07-2021||India||Cinema halls, colleges set to reopen in Karnataka today||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Sunday announced further relaxation to the lockdown rules in the state from Monday. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the relaxations were made since there is gradual improvement in the Covid-19 situation in the state. In the new set of relaxations, the government has allowed theatres and higher education institutes to reopen while the duration of the night curfew has been reduced by an hour. “The Covid-19 situation in the state has again been reviewed and it has been observed that a number of active cases as well as case positivity rate have been consistently declining. The health experts have suggested opening up few more activities with focused public health measures and strict adherence to Covid 19 appropriate behaviour,” read the government order.These decisions were made after a meeting chaired by the chief minister along with top ministers and bureaucrats on Sunday morning. Karnataka had gone for full lockdown starting April 28, which are being relaxed in multiple phases.The new relaxations would be applicable for the entire state, except Kodagu district and it will come into effect from 6 am on Monday. As per the new guidelines, the night curfew will be imposed from 10 pm to 5 am in the state as against the existing timing of 9 pm to 5 am . The new timings will allow restaurants and pubs, which had reopened during the last relaxation, to remain open till 10 pm. The government has also allowed the reopening of cinema halls, multiplexes, theatres, rangamandiras, auditoriums and similar places of entertainment. However, they will be allowed to operate at only 50% seating capacity and strictly adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and SOPs issued by the concerned departments. Karnataka on July 8 had ordered a complete waiver of property tax on single-screen theatres for financial year 2021-22, after the Karnataka State Film Exhibitors Association (KSFEA) submitted a detailed memorandum to Yediyurappa, citing the problems faced by the industry during the lockdown. In the third main change, the government has allowed the reopening of colleges and institutions pertaining to the Department of Higher Education from July 26. “Only students, teaching and non-teaching or other staff who have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine will be permitted to attend the colleges/institutions. Attendance of students will be optional,” read the government order. It also added that all skill development training including long term technical courses are permitted while strictly adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour. Even in these institutes only students, teaching and non-teaching staff, who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine will be permitted to attend the institutions. Earlier on Friday, the state government had allowed the reopening of medical, dental colleges and allied healthcare academic institutions. “It has been decided to allow the reopening of all medical, dental, AYUSH and other allied healthcare educational institutions in the state with immediate effect,” Karnataka health minister K. Sudhakar had tweeted. On Friday, the government had also announced the commencement of training for doctors and paramedics across the state to tackle the potential third wave of Covid-19. “The state health department will conduct training sessions for doctors and paramedical staff in district hospitals across the state for preparing them to fight the pandemic’s possible third wave,” the health minister told reporters on Friday. The state government also hired about 4,000 doctors and ramped up the healthcare infrastructure during the pandemic’s second wave to contain the virus. “Measures are being taken as recommended by the expert committee headed by noted cardiologist Devi Prasad Shetty to minimise the impact of the third wave on people. As our state shares borders with Kerala and Maharashtra, where positive cases continue to remain high, safety measures have been taken to prevent the infection from spreading in the districts,” Sudhakar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cinema-halls-colleges-set-to-reopen-in-karnataka-today-101626637880843.html
19-07-2021||India||Yediyurappa’s call for key meet fans speculation||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa’s call for a legislative party meeting on July 26 has fuelled fresh speculations within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over his possible resignation even though the 78-year-old on Saturday clarified that there was no change of guard in the state.While a section of party leaders claimed that his replacement is imminent, others believe that a Cabinet reshuffle is likely on the cards and may take place during the meeting next week. “As far as we are concerned, the legislative party meeting is about a possible Cabinet shuffle and not a change of guard,” a party legislator from Bengaluru said, wishing not to be named.However, a legislator associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a faction of the BJP, said there are clear indications that Yediyurappa will be handing over the charge. “You can’t expect the party of Yediyurappa ji to reveal the details of the meetings with the Prime Minister to the media. But the fact is that there is a consensus between the party leadership and Yediyurappa to do what is required for the long-term success of the party. You will know the details soon,” the legislator said, preferring anonymity.The chief minister met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday during his two-day visit to the national capital. On reports suggesting his removal, he told reporters: “No, not at all... There is no truth in the rumours.” He added that “not a single word” was discussed on the issue by him or central party leaders. The chief minister also met BJP chief J P Nadda and said he was asked to strengthen the party ahead of the 2023 elections. He added that he would return to Delhi to discuss various developmental issues early next month.Meanwhile, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president DK Shivakumar claimed that several MLAs and workers belonging to the Lingayat community are ready to join the Congress. Speaking to reporters at Kalaburagi Airport on Saturday, Shivakumar said former ministers M B Patil and Eshwar Khandre among others have already begun discussions in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappas-call-for-key-meet-fans-speculation-101626637460821.html
19-07-2021||India||‘G23’ dissenters back in Congress' House rejig||In a major rejig ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament that is scheduled to begin on Monday, the Congress has reconstituted and expanded its parliamentary groups in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, bringing in senior faces such as former Union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Ambika Soni, and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh.The announcement came on Sunday by way of a letter by party president Sonia Gandhi. In that she wrote that the reshuffle has been done for the effective functioning of the party in both houses of Parliament. “These groups will meet daily during the session and can meet during the inter-session periods as well where Parliament issues are concerned,” the Congress president wrote.After two curtailed sessions, there is expectation that the monsoon session will be a full one, and there is every indication that it will be stormy too, with the opposition likely to corner the government on the economy, the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccinations, job losses and the contentious farm laws.The letter has also ended speculation about the role of West Bengal MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who, it was thought, will be replaced by either Shashi Tharoor or Manish Tewari.The letter states that Chowdhury will continue as the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, but Tharoor and Tewari will be in the group too, which only underlines that Sonia Gandhi wants more heads in the party’s parliamentary decision-making process.The Lok Sabha group will also have Assam MP Gaurav Gogoi (deputy leader), K Suresh (chief whip), Ravneet Singh Bittu and Manickam Tagore (both whips).The Rajya Sabha hierarchy, which earlier had Mallikarjun Kharge as the leader of the opposition, Anand Sharma (deputy leader) and Jairam Ramesh (chief whip), will now include Chidambaram, Soni and Singh—the three senior leaders with years of experience in Parliament as well as party.The groups will have various roles. Mustering numbers, coordinating with various political parties, and deciding on key floor issues such as support for a bill or the extent of cooperation with the government.It will also decide which issue needs to be raised and how the Congress will manoeuvre on issues raised by other parties.Only last week, Congress had entrusted Kharge with the responsibility of coordination with other parties in Parliament. He is expected to play the key role in Parliament as lack of opposition unity has proved to be an advantage for the ruling dispensation in passing key bills such as on Triple Talaq, bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir as Union territories, and the scrapping of Article 370.With the inclusion of senior, more accessible leaders, the party hopes to mend fissures within the opposition camp with a few regional parties trying to go it all alone in the forthcoming state elections and the 2024 general elections.The Congress already has two panels — the parliamentary strategy group headed by Gandhi to look into the larger issues relating to parliamentary functioning, and a smaller group headed by P Chidambaram to carefully scrutinise all government bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g23-dissenters-back-in-congress-house-rejig-101626636511521.html
19-07-2021||India||IMA slams move to ease curbs in Kerala for Eid||The Kerala government’s decision to ease restrictions for Eid al-zuha celebrations even as Covid-19 cases continued to surge in the state has triggered sharp reactions from medical bodies and experts, with the Indian Medical Association terming it “unwarranted and inappropriate” at a time of a medical emergency and threatening to move court.“The IMA is pained to see amid the rise of cases and seropositivity, the Kerala government has issued an order to ease out lockdown followed in the state on the pretext of religious gatherings of Bakrid. It is unwarranted and inappropriate at this time of medical emergency,” said the statement released by the apex doctors’ organisation.It further warned the government of approaching the court, if the relaxations were not withdrawn immediately.Kerala on Sunday recorded 13,956 fresh cases said the data released by the state health ministry. The active caseload in the state has crossed 125,000.On Saturday, as the state reported 16,148 new cases –the highest single-day increase in infections in over a month -- chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared that lockdown restrictions in the state would be relaxed for three days starting Sunday in view of Eid celebrations on July 21.At least 40 people will be allowed in places of worship and there will be special relaxation from June 18-20 – shops and business establishments can be opened till 8pm.Besides concessions for Bakrid, certain activities like film shooting and relaxations for places of worship were announced on Saturday by the CM, who added that restrictions were also needed to overcome the serious situation that Kerala was facing.The CM said on Saturday that the curbs, including lockdowns, no matter how limited, were causing huge economic and social problems and therefore certain concessions were being allowed after evaluating the course of the Covid-19 infection daily.The issue has also sparked a fierce debate online and drawn comparisons to the cancellation of the kanwar yatra by Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“When many northern states like J&K, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand have stopped, with a constructive sense of public safety, the traditional and popular pilgrimage Yatras, it is unfortunate that the learned state of Kerala had taken these retrograde decisions,” the IMA statement added.The test positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive for Covid-19 – remains the highest among India’s populous states.On Sunday, the positivity rate in the state was 10.69%. While the second wave of the outbreak has been receding in most regions in the country over the past two months, Kerala has been witnessing rising infections over the past four weeks, data shows.The seven-day average of daily infections in the state, which had dropped to 11,357 for the week ended June 27, has now again climbed to 13,409 cases a day in the past week, data shows.“It is a fact cases are high in Kerala. We expected this. The second phase started very late in the state and peaking is very slow due to our effective intervention,” said health minister Veena George, adding that there is no need to panic over the rising number of infections.(With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-slams-kerala-for-easing-covid-curbs-for-eid-101626637280790.html
19-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh orders probe into three cases against suspended IPS officer||The Chhattisgarh government has ordered probes into three cases against suspended Indian Police Service (IPS) officer GP Singh, who was booked for sedition last week, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The probes will be carried out by three senior IPS officers of Chhattisgarh police, as per orders (copies of which have been seen by HT) issued by director general of policeD MAwasthi on July 14 and 15. On July 8, Singh was suspended by the state government after the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and Economic Offence Wing (EOW) raided his premises in connection with a disproportionate assets case. On July 9, he was booked for sedition after documents “promoting enmity” and “conspiracy against the government” were seized during the raids. As per the first order, a probe has been ordered on a complaint of one Duralabh Agarwal of Raipur, who alleged that the suspended IPS officer, who was investigating a case of police atrocity against his father and uncle in 2013, hushed-up the case. The complaint in this regard was registered with the Chhattisgarh DGP and others on July 12 and will be probed by senior IPS officer Ashok Juneja. Another probe was ordered on a complaint of Manjit Kaur Bal, a resident of Raipur who accused Singh of helping one criminal, Kamalkant Tiwari, by forging documents and also giving him protection. The complaint in this regard was also filed with the DGP on July 12 and will be investigated by inspector general of police (IGP), Raipur, Anand Chhabra, as per the issued order. The third case to be investigated by IGP, Durg range, Vivekanand Sinhna, pertains to a complaint in which one Gaynendra Yadav of Rajnandgaon alleged that Singh had ‘misappropriated’ the money which was recovered from Maoist leader Pahad Singh, when he was posted as the IG Durg Range in 2018. It is worth mentioning here that several searches were conducted at around 15 locations linked to Singh, an additional director general-rank officer, between July 1 and 3. Investigators have claimed to have discovered documents related to movable and immovable assets worth over ₹10 crore during the raids. An ACB statement on July 3 said the documents seized during searches at Singh’s premises suggested that he had allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and indulged in a “massive exchange of money”. “Singh also allegedly tried to commit money laundering by investing in shell companies,” the statement said. Singh, a 1994-batch IPS officer, served as additional director general of ACB and EOW before he was transferred to the state police academy in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-orders-probe-into-three-cases-against-suspended-ips-officer-101626637100773.html
19-07-2021||India||Sidhu named Punjab Congress chief with 4 working presidents||The Congress appointed Navjot Singh Sidhu as the president of its Punjab unit on Sunday after days of intense tussle in the state where the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh resisted the elevation.The party also announced the appointment of four working presidents, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel and Kuljit Singh Nagra, which paves the way for a significant revamp of the organisational setup disbanded by the Congress president in January, 2020. The state is scheduled to go to polls early next year.“Congress president has appointed Navjot Singh Sidhu as the president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee with immediate effect,” according to a statement by the All India Congress Committee. “The party appreciates the contributions of outgoing PCC president Sunil Jakhar,”it added.The announcement came at the end of a day full of hectic political activity that saw the factions led by Singh and Sidhu holding meetings with supporters to consolidate their positions. The incumbent Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar called a meeting of party legislators and district unit chiefs on Monday to draw up a resolution for a solution but the meeting was called off following the formal announcement.According to a person aware of the developments, it is not clear whether the announcement addresses the factionalism and some in the party fear the rift may widen as Singh continues to be upset with Sidhu, who has attacked the chief minister on several occasions.Congress leaders aware of discussions on Saturday indicated that a compromise formula had been worked out but it included a public apology that Singh sought from Sidhu for his attacks. Till late Sunday, there was no apology that was made. Singh had told Congress leader Harish Rawat, who was in Chandigarh to inform him about the changes, that any decision of the Congress president would be acceptable to him, but refused to meet Sidhu till he tendered the apology.The day began with Sidhu visiting several districts and reaching out to MLAs in Patiala, Khanna and Jalandhar to demonstrate the support he was shoring up. Earlier on Saturday, he met nearly 30 party leaders, including Jakhar in Panchkula and sought his support and guidance.A former cricketer-turned-politician, Sidhu, a four-time MP, joined the Congress from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the 2017 state assembly polls. He was inducted into the state cabinet but shared an uneasy relation with the CM, which eventually culminated in him quitting after Singh shuffled his portfolio in 2019.The CM had opposed his elevation, citing his lack of seniority in the Congress and community equations as both are Jat Sikhs and belong to Patiala. The appointment of the working presidents is seen to have aimed at addressing some of these objections.Earlier on Sunday in Delhi, nine Congress leaders from the state held a meeting and decided to back the CM and sought a meeting with party president Sonia Gandhi to push their case, said people aware of the developments. The Congress MPs met at the residence of Partap Singh Bajwa, who had earlier met with the CM for dinner at his farmhouse in Mohali on Saturday. They had differences earlier over the Rajya Sabha MP questioning the CM’s decisions, especially the power purchase agreements, rather publicly but have now buried the hatchet.Barring Ambika Soni and Amar Singh, all the other Punjab MPs were present at the meeting in Bajwa’s residence, including Amarinder Singh’s MP wife, Preneet Kaur. Bajwa later took to Twitter to share images of the meeting. “Discussion with @INCIndia Rajya Sabha & Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab to devise a strategy on farmers’ issues in upcoming monsoon session of the Parliament,” Bajwa tweeted.Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dullo, who attended the meeting, said there are a lot of things going on in the state. “We have informed the Congress president and sought time from her for a discussion on Punjab Congress affairs and other burning issues,” he said.Dullo said they are not opposed to anyone but want the party to maintain caste and religious balance. Apart from the MPs, 10 Punjab MLAs, including three AAP legislators who switched to the Congress last month, also issued a joint statement in CM’s support, urging the Congress leadership not to let him down as “because of his unrelenting efforts, the party stands well entrenched in Punjab”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-named-punjab-congress-chief-amid-infighting-101626636980796.html

I spoke to her and have sent a letter to her today, saying that if the party wants to retain power, a Dalit should head the state unit,” he said. Dullo said they are not opposed to anyone but want the party to maintain caste and religious balance. Apart from the MPs, 10 Punjab MLAs, including three AAP legislators who switched to the Congress last month, also issued a joint statement in CM’s support, urging the Congress leadership not to let him down as “because of his unrelenting efforts, the party stands well entrenched in Punjab”. In a statement released on behalf of the MLAs by Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who is among the three crossover legislators but is still not a member of the Congress Legislature Party, Sidhu was described as a celebrity and an asset but who, by condemning and criticising his own party and government in public, has only created a “rift in the cadres and weakened it”. Other MLAs who endorsed the statement were Harminder Singh Gill, Kuldeep Vaid, Fatehjang Bajwa, Gurpreet Singh GP, Balwinder Laddi, Santokh Bhalaipur, Joginder Pal, Jagdev Kamalu and Pirmal Singh. They also supported Amarinder Singh’s decision not to meet Sidhu until he publicly tenders apology for his “derogatory” tweets against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-appointed-congress-punjab-unit-chief-amid-rift-with-cm-101626635002898.html
19-07-2021||India||Over 1,800 news portals shared compliance details: Govt officials||More than 1,800 digital news websites have shared details of their compliance with the new social media and intermediary guidelines, ministry officials familiar with the matter said, even as the government reached out only to 1,200 such digital publications.“The response has been overwhelming,” the official said. “Regional digital news media websites are grateful that they are being recognised. More and more are alerting the ministry regarding their compliance every day,” this person addedThe official said this will enable the government to create a repository of all digital news media platforms. The compliance, however, does not amount as a certification with the central government, the official clarified. “All 40 over the top platforms, including Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, have also complied with the guidelines,” the official said.The ministry is working on extending certain benefits, such as a Press Information Bureau accreditation for reporters, cameramen, videographers, to enable them with better first-hand information and access including participation in official press conferences and interactions.These are currently available only to traditional media (print and TV).The new intermediary and digital media guidelines require platforms to appoint officers, grievance redressal officers in case of OTT and digital news media platforms, institute a three-tier mechanism for grievance redressal with an inter-ministerial committee at its apex, and give the I&B ministry takedown powers over the content circulated online.The rules, which were notified in February, have been challenged in the court by several digital news media outfits, including LiveLaw and TheWire.While there is no requirement for the digital news media publishers to be registered with the ministry, information pertaining to their grievance redressal officer in India, self-regulating body of which the publisher is a member, and the details of the editor were sought by the ministry on May 26. Similar information has been sought from the video streaming services, with details of the content manager in place of the editor.The News Broadcasters Federation, which consists of 78 news channels in 14 languages, representing broadcasters from 25 States, said that they have complied with the rules.In a notification dated June 10, the ministry said digital arms of traditional media houses would not be exempt from furnishing the details under the new rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-800-news-portals-shared-compliance-details-govt-officials-101626634703328.html
19-07-2021||India||SC to examine if a ‘stranger’ can challenge validity of marriage||The Supreme Court will look into the legal principle that only a wife or a husband can challenge a marriage, and determine if the validity of a wedlock can be contested by a ‘stranger’.Judicial precedents hold that only the husband or the wife can maintain a challenge to a wedlock under the Family Courts Act. A bench of top court justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian have now admitted a matter to examine this after the daughter of a deceased man sought to invalidate her father’s second marriage with a woman.The daughter has contended that her stepmother was not a divorcee and was already married to someone else when she married her father in 2003. Therefore, she contends, her father’s second marriage was invalid.The case involved provisions of the Family Courts Act and some decisions of high courts on the point of locus standi (legal standing) of individuals who can question the validity of a marriage.The legal conundrum reached the Supreme Court from a judgment of the Bombay high court in March this year, allowing the daughter to proceed with her petition before a family court for a declaration that the second marriage of her father was null and void since her stepmother was already married.The father, who was Hindu and a businessman, died in 2015. A year later, the daughter, 66, filed a petition claiming that her stepmother, who was a Muslim belonging to Dawoodi Bohra section, was not validly divorced from her previous husband.In July 2019, the family court refused to entertain the daughter’s petition after the stepmother referred to the judgments to show that the former was a stranger and could not legally have a say in the validity of the relationship. The family court further noted that since the daughter had not asked for invalidation of the marriage in any of her previous cases before the civil courts and the Bombay high court, she could not be permitted to press her petition now.The daughter challenged this order before the HC, which overturned the family court’s order in May this year. The HC referred to a sub-clause under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act to hold that a family court can entertain a petition against validity of a marriage even if the proceedings have not been initiated by either the husband or the wife.The HC added that a child cannot be said to be a ‘stranger’ in a situation like this when her father had passed away and she claimed to have come across certain proofs to show that the second marriage of her father was untenable.Rajasthan HC, by a judgment in 2014, has also indicated that petitions by a third party will not be maintainable before the family courts when it pertains to the marriage of a couple. The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the daughter and will hear the matter in detail on August 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-examine-if-a-stranger-can-challenge-validity-of-marriage-101626634701243.html
19-07-2021||India||Maya plans Brahmin outreach before polls||Lucknow: Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections slated to be held next year, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)chief Mayawati on Sunday announced that the party will launch a campaign to reach out to Brahmin voters in the state.Addressing a press conference here, the BSP chief said “A campaign, led by BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, will be started from Ayodhya on July 23 to awaken the Brahmin community once again... After forming the government, the BSP will take care of their ( Brahmins’) dignity and protect their interests.” Mayawati’s Brahmin outreach was considered as one of the key factors for her win in the 2007 state assembly election.She attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party state government and said that the party “harassed and exploited the community” after winning the 2017 assembly polls with the help of their votes.“The BJP formed the government with the support of the Brahmins but instead of working for the welfare of the community, it committed atrocities on them. They were being harassed and exploited and were repenting their support to the BJP ,” she said. She further praised the Dalit community for not “falling in the trap” of the BJP and other rival parties. The BJP organised ‘khichadi’ feast of their leaders with the members of the Dalit community, as well as a rath yatra to win the support of the Dalits during the 2017 assembly elections. “I am proud of the Dalit community’s support who did not deviate, remained united, and voted for the BSP,” she said. Responding to BSP chief’s barb, BJP state unit spokesperson, Rakesh Tripathi said, “From 2007 to 2012, the BSP government indulged in the policy of appeasement. The upper castes were sidelined and now when the elections are knocking on the door, BSP chief Mayawati has started to woo Brahmins again. The Brahmins know that BJP worked for their welfare and dignity. In the 2022 assembly elections, they would again support the BJP.” Congress party spokesperson, Naseemuddin Siddiqui said, “Due to shrinking support base, the BSP chief Mayawati is panicking, she is indulging in the politics of caste, the Congress believes in working for the welfare of all the caste and communities in Uttar Pradesh as well as in the other states.”Samajwadi Party state unit spokesperson, Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said, “The SP respected all communities and castes. Mayawati’s attack on the opposition showed her undeclared alliance with the BJP.”Expressing solidarity with the farmers, Mayawati said that the BSP MPs would raise their voice in support of the farmers and demand withdrawal of the three farm laws in the monsoon session of the Parliament commencing from July 19.“The indifferent attitude of the Centre towards farmers protesting against the three farm laws is extremely sad. It is necessary that pressure is put on the Centre in Parliament,” she said.The party MPs had been directed to raise public issues, including hike in the price of essential commodities, unemployment and slowdown in Covid vaccination, she said.

19-07-2021||India||‘India among nations that hacked phones’: Global media investigation||India is among the countries that used Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus phone hacking software to potentially target politicians, journalists and activists, an international collaborative investigation involving 17 media organisations including The Guardian, The Washington Post, and Die Zeit said. India’s news website The Wire was one of the 17.‘Govt committed to right to privacy’: India’s response over Pegasus hackThe first part of the multi-part investigation, released late on Sunday night, said that 38 Indian journalists (according to The Guardian), including those from mainstream publications (three current Hindustan Times journalists are named, as is one from sister publication Mint), and websites, apart from freelancers were targeted. The 38 are among 180 journalists the report said were targeted worldwide, including the editor of the Financial Times Roula Khalaf, and journalists from the Wall Street Journal, CNN, New York Times, and Le Monte.In its response published by The Guardian, the Indian government termed the investigation a “fishing expedition” , that there is “no concrete basis out truth associated with the claim that there was government surveillance on specific people”, and referred to a 2019 controversy surrounding Pegasus when a vulnerability in WhatsApp was used to deliver the malware to at least 20 Indian citizens, including journalists, lawyers and activists.“Government of India’s response to a right to information application about the use of Pegasus has been prominently reported by media and is in itself sufficient to counter any malicious claims about the alleged association between the government of India and Pegasus,” India said in its response.“It is important to note that government agencies have a well-established protocol for interception, which includes sanction and supervision from highly ranked officials in central and state governments, for clear stated reasons only in national interest,” it added.The investigation was based on a data leak of around 50,000 numbers obtained by Amnesty International and Paris-based Forbidden Stories, a non-profit. To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. Amnesty International subsequently forensically investigated 67 of these phones, and found 23 hacked and 14 showing signs of attempted penetration.Also read | ‘Aap chronology samajhiye…’: Amit Shah questions timing of Pegasus leaksThe Wire reported that 10 of the phones forensically examined in India showed they had either been hacked or signs of an attempted hacking.NSO Group, in a response to Forbidden Stories and its media partners, said the interpretations from the leaked dataset were misleading. “The alleged amount of ‘leaked data of more than 50,000 phone numbers,’ cannot be a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus,” it said, and added that it “does not have insight into the specific intelligence activities of its customers”.The Wire also said that three leaders of opposition parties in India, two ministers, many business people, and one constitutional authority were among those targeted. These names are expected to emerge over the next few days in subsequent installments of the investigation. The website also said relatives of activists accused in the Elgar Parishad case were also targeted.Pegasus makes it possible for those using the software to intercept all communications on their targets’ device, including stored files as well as messages. The malware also allows for the device’s microphone and camera to be turned on, and its location logs accessed.According to the Guardian report, the list of governments believed to be NSO customers, and who entered the numbers that were part of the leaked database are: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the UAE.Watch | Indian govt reacts to phone hacking report: Minister says bid to malign democracyThe report is likely to see some heated exchanges in India’s Parliament, set to convene on Monday for the monsoon session, especially once names of the opposition politicians are released.On Sunday, in anticipation of the release — there was buzz that an investigative report of this nature was being published — several opposition parties met. Later on Sunday, after the names of the journalists targeted came out one opposition leader said “we will wait to see what data is available on political leaders,” before deciding a course of action.“GoI has denied resorting to unauthorised surveillance. The question this raises is, if Pegasus is only sold to governments, which other govts (China/Pak?) are using it to snoop on prominent Indian citizens? Shouldn’t the authorities call for an independent investigation?” said Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in a tweet on Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-among-nations-that-hacked-phones-global-media-investigation-101626634581835.html

19-07-2021||India||Want to protect your Aadhaar biometrics from misuse? Here are 2 ways to lock it||Aadhaar card is one of the most vital documents that any Indian has, and lately, the central government has made it mandatory to link the same with several other personal identification documents such as passport, driving license, and others. The importance of Aadhaar card lies in the fact that it comprises biometric details, apart from demographic ones, which involves an individual’s fingerprints, photo identity, and even iris details. Therefore, it is even more significant to safeguard these unique details, especially if one’s Aadhaar card gets misplaced and falls into the wrong hands.The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has addressed this issue in their latest tweets, and have even rendered a solution for users to avoid such a fate. As per the UIDAI, the 12-digit Aadhaar number can be locked and instead a 16-digit virtual ID (VID) number – also known as ‘Masked Aadhaar’ can be used for all kinds of identification purposes. The VID is “valid and accepted widely,” the UIDAI said in a Twitter post on Thursday. For this, one needs to download the e-Aadhaar card.Once the user has received the VID, the next step is to lock the Aadhaar biometrics. The UIDAI in another Twitter post on Friday stated that the locking and unlocking of Aadhaar biometrics can be done in two ways – either by visiting the official website of UIDAI or by using the ‘mAadhaar’ mobile application. This, according to UIDAI, will prevent “misuse” of one’s biometric information by anyone.How to lock Aadhaar biometrics via the UIDAI website?Step 1: Visit the UIDAI website at uidai.gov.in.Step 2: Under ‘My Aadhaar’ category, look for ‘Aadhaar Services’, and click on ‘Lock/Unlock Biometrics’.Step 3: In the required field, enter the 12-digit Aadhaar number (UID). After that, enter your full name as per the Aadhaar card, and also enter the pincode details.Step 4: Enter the security code as reflected on the screen to proceed further.Step 5: Click on ‘Send OTP’ that will help you get the one-time password in your registered mobile number.Step 6: Once the OTP comes in, enter the same along with a password of your choice.Step 7: Click the check box beside ‘Enable Biometric Locking’ and then hit the ‘enable’ button again. This will lock your Aadhaar card biometrics.How to lock Aadhaar biometrics via mobile SMS?Step 1: Users need to send an SMS to 1947 to request an OTP on their registered mobile number. The SMS should be written as GETOTP and the last four or eight digits of the Aadhaar number – for example, GETOTPXXXX or GETOTPXXXXXXXX.Step 2: Once the user sends this message, UIDAI will send the individual a 6-digit OTP via SMS.Step 3: After receiving the OTP, the user needs to send yet another message using the OTP. The message needs to be written as LOCKUID along with the last four or eight digits of the Aadhaar number, and the 6-digit OTP – for example, LOCKUIDXXXXOTP or LOCKUIDXXXXXXXXOTPStep 4: A confirmation message will then be delivered on the registered mobile number of the user, citing that the Aadhaar biometrics have been locked.The unlocking process via SMS consists of the same steps. However, in all the steps, instead of the digits of the Aadhaar number, the last six or 10 digits of the VID number will be required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-to-protect-your-aadhaar-biometrics-from-misuse-here-are-2-ways-to-lock-it-101626513910005.html
19-07-2021||India||Vaccines reduce hospitalisation, death risk due to Covid: Study||Fewer hopsitalisations (9.8%) and deaths (0.4%) were reported in people who experienced breakthrough Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections, mostly caused by the Alpha variant in north India and the Delta variant elsewhere, after two doses of vaccine, highlighting the fact that vaccination does reduce hospital admission and mortality, according to a pre-print study.The nationwide study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) during the peak of the second wave between April and June, is likely the largest and first nation-wide study of post-vaccination breakthrough infections from India with 677 clinical samples.The subjects had received wither Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin or Serum Institute of India’s version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Covishield.Also Read | ‘3rd wave can be bigger than second if...’: What Randeep Guleria said““During March to June 2021, India has experienced a deadly second wave of Covid-19 with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections reported across the country. To understand the possible reason of these breakthroughs, we collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/ nasal swabs) of individuals who had received two doses (n=592) and one dose (n=85) of vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin,) and tested positive for Covid-19, from 17 states/Union Territories of country,” said the paper.The subjects were telephonically interviewed and clinical data was analysed. Out of 677 cases included in this study, 593 contracted Covid after both doses, and 84, after one dose.A total of 482 cases (71%) were symptomatic with one or more symptoms, while 29% were asymptomatic. Fever (69%) was the most consistent presentation followed by body ache including headache and nausea (56%), cough (45%), sore throat (37%), loss of smell and taste (22%), diarrhoea (6%), breathlessness (6%) and ocular irritation and redness (1%).“This study indicated that majority of the clinical cases in the breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant and only 9.8% cases required hospitalisation while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality,” finds the study.The aim of conducting the study was to allay fears regarding vaccination with growing questions of the protection offered by vaccines following the emergence of variants of concern and reduced real world effectiveness of certain candidate vaccines against these variants.The Indian Council of Medical Research -Department of Health Research (ICMR-DHR) utilised the network of Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) to track breakthrough infections .“It was observed that southern, western, eastern and north-western regions of India predominantly reported breakthrough infections from mainly Delta and then Kappa variant of SARS-CoV-2. The northern and central regions reported such infections due to Alpha, Delta and Kappa variants; however, cases due to Alpha variant predominated in the northern region. The overall majority (86.09%) of the breakthrough infections were caused by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions of India except in the northern region where the Alpha variant predominated,” the study added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-reduce-hospitalisation-death-due-to-covid-icmr-study-101626415992531.html
19-07-2021||India||Based on a ground survey in Punjab, Congress devises a compromise formula||Amid the ongoing power tussle in Punjab, the Congress conducted a ground survey to gauge the mood of the people in the state ahead of the assembly election next year, party functionaries aware of the development said. It covered both the functioning of the state government and organisational issues.The survey, conducted in three rounds last month to cover party workers and common people, has come at a time there is intense speculation about former cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu’s possible role in the Congress, with a section of the party claiming that he could be the next chief of Punjab Congress.While the party leaders are tight-lipped about the results of the survey, two functionaries said that it showed Sidhu enjoys some support, especially among the young voters and party workers. “He is no pushover,” said a party leader refusing to be identified.The Congress is all set to fight elections under the leadership of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, the party’s most prominent and popular face in the poll-bound state. But the survey, according to the two functionaries, also indicated that a section of the party has some misgivings — arising from the belief that bureaucrats have been empowered at the cost of politicians, that promises made in the run up to the 2017 elections have not been met, and that the chief minister is soft on the Shiromani Akali Dal’s Badals.Punjab, the only north Indian state ruled by the Congress, goes to polls early next year. Earlier, it looked like the party had an upper hand in the state after the Akali Dal left the National Democratic Alliance over its differences with the Bharatiya Janata Party over the three farm laws that triggered massive resentment among farmers. But the internal squabbles, the lingering tension between Singh and Sidhu might cast a shadow over the party’s prospects, say analysts.The Congress, however, is hopeful of finding an amicable solution after Sidhu met both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra while Singh came to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi Sidhu is believed to be in Delhi today (July 16) to meet with Sonia Gandhi. An announcement resolving the Punjab crisis is expected later in the day.Another party leader said on condition of anonymity that the Punjab survey is not extraordinary as the party’s data analytics team conducts regular surveys in different states. A similar ground survey was conducted in Maharashtra before Nana Patole was made its state unit chief.Surveys are now being conducted in Goa, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, while those in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have finished recently, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/based-on-a-ground-survey-in-punjab-congress-devises-a-compromise-formula-101626414072679.html
19-07-2021||India||The sedition story: Complicated history of Sec 124A||Proceedings in the Supreme Court and the contentious arrests of activists and journalists have once again brought the law of sedition into the spotlight.The colonial era law, which many say is used to quell protests and to quieten criticism against the government, carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and the police can arrest individuals without a warrant.The law has been amended after Independence, but only to make it more stringent. As many as three benches in the Supreme Court have recently underscored the need to review Section 124A (sedition) in the Indian Penal Code (IPC), making it pertinent to examine how the penal law has evolved since the pre-Independence era and the interpretations rendered to it by the constitutional courts in the country.History of sedition law in IndiaIndia’s sedition law has an interesting past. IPC was brought into force in colonial India in 1860 but had no section concerning sedition. It was introduced in 1870 on the grounds that it was dropped from the original IPC draft by mistake. The UK, incidentally, would repeal the law in Britain only in 2009 (with effect from early 2010).Under Section 124A of IPC, the offence of sedition is committed when any person by words or otherwise brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government established by law.Three explanations added to the provision prescribe that while “disaffection” shall include disloyalty and all feelings of enmity, comments without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, will not constitute an offence.Sedition is a cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offence under the law, entailing life imprisonment as maximum punishment, with or without a fine.Use of sedition in the British RajThe penal provision came in handy to muzzle nationalist voices and demands for freedom. The long list of India’s national heroes who figured as accused in cases of sedition includes Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and Jawaharlal Nehru.Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the first person to be convicted of sedition in colonial India. The British government brought the charge alleging articles carried in Tilak’s Marathi newspaper Kesari would encourage people to foil the government’s efforts at curbing the plague epidemic in India. In 1897, Tilak was punished by the Bombay high court for sedition under Section 124A and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Tilak was held guilty by a jury composed of nine members, with the six white jurors voting against Tilak, and three Indian jurors voting in his favour. Later, Section 124A was given different interpretations by the Federal Court, which began functioning in 1937, and the Privy Council that was the highest court of appeal based in London.In Niharendu Dutt Majumdar Vs King Emperor, 1942, the Federal Court held that “public disorder or the reasonable anticipation or likelihood of public disorder is the gist of the offence.” But this proposition was overturned by the Privy Council in King Emperor Vs Sadashiv Narayan Bhalerao, 1947.The Privy Council lent credence to the law laid down in Tilak’s case and ruled that incitement to violence was not a pre-requisite for the crime of sedition and that excitement of feelings of enmity to the government was sufficient to establish guilt under Section 124A.Sedition law after IndependenceAfter Independence, “sedition” was dropped from the Constitution in 1948 after discussions of the Constituent Assembly. KM Munshi moved an amendment to remove the word “sedition” that was included in the draft Constitution as a ground to impose restrictions on constitutional freedom of speech and expression. The word “sedition” thus disappeared from the Constitution when it was adopted on November 26, 1949, and Article 19(1)(a) gave absolute freedom of speech and expression. However, Section 124A continued to stay in the IPC.In 1951, Jawaharlal Nehru brought in the first amendment of the Constitution to limit the freedom under Article 19(1)(a) and enacted Article 19(2) to empower the State put curbs in the form of “reasonable restrictions” on right to free speech.It was the Indira Gandhi government that made Section 124A a cognisable offence for the first time in India’s history. In the new Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which came into force in 1974 and repealed the colonial-era 1898 Code of Criminal Procedure, sedition was made a cognisable offence authorising the police to make arrests without a warrant.Case lawsThe validity of sedition law was tested for the first time in independent India by the then Punjab high court in 1951 in Tara Singh Gopi Chand Vs The State. The high court held that Section 124A was indisputably a restriction on the freedom of speech and expression, and invalidated the provision on the basis that it was in contravention of the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 of the Constitution of India. It was this judgment that prompted the Jawaharlal Nehru government to introduce new grounds on which the right to freedom of speech and expression could be reasonably restricted.But in 1954, the Patna high court, in Debi Soren & Ors Vs The State, upheld the validity of Section 124A, holding that the law does not violate Article 19. Four years on, the Allahabad high court declared Section 124A void in the case of Ram Nandan Vs State, and held that the government must be ready to face a strong opposition apart from popular approval or disapproval.The conundrum arising from various views of the high courts was finally settled by the Supreme Court by its judgment in Kedar Nath case in 1962, which is considered the most authoritative judgment of the Supreme Court on the interpretation of the sedition law. A Constitution bench upheld the validity of the sedition law under IPC, holding that the purpose of the crime of sedition was to prevent the government established by law from being subverted because “the continued existence of the Government established by law is an essential condition of the stability of the State”.At the same time, the five-judge bench defined the scope of Section 124A. It held that Section 124A only penalised words that reveal an intent or tendency to disturb law and order or that seem to incite violence. The Supreme Court underlined that the presence of a pernicious tendency to incite violence is a pre-condition to invoke the sedition clause and that the penal provision cannot be used to stifle free speech. This definition has been taken as precedent for all matters pertaining to Section 124A ever since.Post-Constitution bench judgment on seditionIn Balwant Singh & Anr Vs State of Punjab, 1995, the Supreme Court dropped sedition charges against two men who raised slogans in favour of an independent Sikh majority State outside a cinema hall in the aftermath of the assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi. The court ruled in favour of the accused, pointing out that acts did not amount to sedition since the slogans did not lead to any disturbance, and was not likely to incite any violence in the minds of the target audience.By two judgments in 2011, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated yet again that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised. In Indra Das Vs State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan Vs State of Assam, the apex court also held that mere membership of a banned organisation cannot incriminate a person unless he is proved to have resorted to acts of violence or incited people to imminent violence. The Union government has, however, sought review of these judgments on the aspect of membership of banned organisations.The Law Commission of India, in its consultation paper on sedition, published in August 2018, also observed that while retaining the offence of sedition was essential to protect national integrity, it should not be used as a tool to curb free speech.Sedition cases up in India but convictions dipAccording to the data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), uploaded on its website, cases of sedition and under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act showed a rise in 2019, but only 3% of the sedition cases resulted in convictions.The year 2019 saw a 25% increase in the number of sedition cases and a 41% increase in arrests over the previous year. A total of 93 cases of sedition were reported in 2019, with 96 arrests and charge sheets filed in 76 cases, as against 70 cases, 56 arrests and 27 charge sheets the previous year.The ministry of home affairs, in a written reply in February, informed the Rajya Sabha that out of the 96 people arrested for sedition in 2019, only two were convicted for the crime, while 29 were acquitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-sedition-story-complicated-history-of-sec-124a-101626370928612.html
19-07-2021||Today's||Democratic Quad vs China’s Quad||Even as the sherpas of the Quad democracies — the United States (US), India, Japan and Australia — prepare for a summit of the top leaders in Washington later this year, a rival quadrilateral grouping led by principal challenger China is in the making, with Russia, Pakistan and Iran.Fired by the hubris of the successful centenary of the Communist Party of China, Beijing has been plotting its next moves on the geopolitical chessboard, and countering Quad is one of them. Is there a credible threat to the democratic Quad? Understanding China’s coalescence with each of these actors is instructive.Despite a complex and troubled past, in recent years, the China-Russia relationship has gone from strength to strength. The two define it as a comprehensive strategic partnership that can be turned into an alliance, if necessary. On June 1, the foreign ministers of China and Russia marked the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation. The treaty is viewed as a bulwark against the US-led West, and a pact of solidarity to perpetuate Sino-Russian pre-eminence and influence in world affairs.The two nations are neighbours and partners in the combat against Covid-19, and are deepening cooperation in trade, economy, scientific cooperation and technological innovation. Russia supplies energy resources to China and shares defence technologies; in turn, the Chinese provide capital, equipment and goods needed by the Russians. Lurking Russian suspicions that China seeks its territory in the Far East and the perception that Moscow has become a junior partner are troublesome, but these reservations are kept in check for the larger needs of this relationship.Western strategists are reflecting on ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, but this is easier said than done. There is a convergence between the Russian and Chinese governments and strategic communities. Ivan Timofeev, director of programmes at the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), said, in an interview with the Global Times, in March 2021, “Sino-Russian relations are still not an alliance, but they are more than a partnership.”Then there is China’s relationship with Pakistan, fuelled by a shared hostility towards India, which are of a different level of depth altogether. In a joint statement on November 25, 2018, the two nations projected themselves as “good neighbours, close friends, iron brothers and trusted partners” with an “All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership” from which Pakistan continuously draws political and economic dividends.China recognises the central geostrategic location of Pakistan, and its value in keeping India pinned down to being only a regional player. Strategic congruence, economic benefits and close security cooperation make up this relationship. Its attempted collaboration to counter the “three evils” of extremism, terrorism and separatism should not fool anyone, except to signal that Islamabad refrains from any action that hampers China in dealing harshly with its Muslim minority.Since 2013, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with its generous package worth $62 billion covering projects in infrastructure, transport, energy, industry and agriculture, has become the centerpiece of the relationship. Experts, however, point out that lately, CPEC has lost some of its salience, as the Pakistan economy has failed to grow due to the absence of economic reforms as well as enhanced security challenges. Islamabad is now also enmeshed in working out its options in a post-US Afghanistan where it needs to reconcile its interests not only with China but also with Iran, Russia, Central Asian neighbours, and, to some extent, India. Pakistan will remain China’s steadfast partner, but given its long-standing relationship with the US, it will also be responsive to Washington’s overtures and offers of assistance in both the military and economic domains.China-Iran relations, marked by a shared hostility towards the US, are seeing signs of consolidation. In March, the two countries agreed to a 25-year commitment to enhance comprehensive economic cooperation. At the heart of this deal is China’s plan to invest $400 million in Iranian projects against a long-term supply of oil and gas to China. The Iranian foreign ministry clarified that the agreement contained a roadmap but not any contract, figure or exclusive rights to the other party. This agreement builds on President Xi Jinping’s visit to Iran in January 2016 and the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership to support “their core interests” such as independence, national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Iran’s commitment to the One China policy.On the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), China has strived to present itself as a firm upholder of Iran’s sovereignty and national dignity, and has called on the US to return to JCPOA. The $400-million investment plan, says Alex Vatanaka, senior fellow at Frontier Europe Initiative, can be Iran’s “insurance policy” for economic renewal if US sanctions continue and the US-China fight escalates.These three relationships are vibrant, but they are also vulnerable. The Vladimir Putin-Joe Biden summit in Geneva showed that Putin is willing to improve relations with the US (and the European Union) if his red lines are respected. Iran continues to be interested in JCPOA; if it materialises, this will increase US leverage. Steady friend Pakistan is unpredictable, but the army, the most powerful player, remains interested in measured normalisation with Delhi.The task then for the democratic Quad sherpas is delineated — use all available levers to weaken China’s relations with its three partners. China’s potential Quad is flawed because it is founded on limited common interests and rivalries, and is not backed by compelling principles and values. The Quad of democracies should strengthen itself and their sherpas should watch China’s moves carefully.Rajiv Bhatia is distinguished fellow, Gateway House and a former ambassador.

19-07-2021||Today's||People’s support must for population policies||Population “control” has become a political buzzword, cutting across party lines. Following the release of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) draft population control bill, which aims to restrict the number of children per family to two, the health minister of Rajasthan has gone a step further advocating a one-child policy. Similar sentiments on coercive measures to control family size have been expressed by politicians from Madhya Pradesh (MP), Bihar and Jharkhand.It was Assam chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who set the ball rolling on the issue. In June, he announced the phased implementation of a two-child policy in the state. It got renewed attention when UP chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath announced the population policy on July 11.It is necessary to understand the provisions of this policy before going deeper into its political consequences. According to Yogi Adityanath’s plan, government employees with only two children will get two additional increments in their service period, 12 months leave with full salary, and a 3% increase in the employer’s contribution to the National Pension Scheme.If a couple opts for a vasectomy after one child, then a lump sum of ₹80,000 will be given for a male child and ₹100,000 for a girl. But, under this policy, people with more than two children would be denied government jobs, subsidies and participation in panchayat/local body elections. In addition, the government’s ration schemes would be available only for four members per family.While the UP policy may sound attractive, there is many a slip between the announcement and its implementation. Last year, the Centre told the Supreme Court: “[The] government is unequivocally against forcing people to have a certain number of children”. So, these policies proposed by certain states don’t have the central government’s sanction. Some people feel that these population control-related announcements are politically motivated. But if politicians don’t do politics, what would they do? So, Yogi Adityanath got some success in his objective.The same thing happened in the case of the Kanwar Yatra. After the Supreme Court remarked that this multi-state religious event should not be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the UP government cancelled it. But the state government’s intention was clear. Such tricks have their importance in an election year.Some people smell communalism in the population discourse, as statistics offer a different perspective. The National Family Health Survey shows that the total fertility rate (TFR) of Muslims fell from 4.4 in 1992-93 to 2.6 in 2015-16. Factors such as economic status, education and health care affect family size across all communities.However, India will be the most populous country in the world by the turn of the century, followed by Nigeria, China, the United States and Pakistan. The good news is that, according to a report in the medical journal, The Lancet, India’s population will peak by 2047. This will be the point at which the population growth rate will start declining.Experts from the Population Foundation of India, a non-governmental organisation, say that fertility rates are falling in several states, with UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan and Odisha being notable exceptions. The reasons for the decline in fertility rates are many. Women are getting married later, couples are more aware of the need for spacing between children, lower-income families have realised the importance of education for their children and how their resources can go a longer way if they have fewer children. The concept of more children being equal to more earning members in a family no longer holds. This is the reason why Yogi Adityanath wants to reduce Uttar Pradesh’s TFR from 2.7 to 1.9 by 2030. The national average is 2.1.No population policy can succeed unless it takes into account the people’s needs. We saw there was a backlash against the uniquely cruel, coercive policies enforced during the Emergency.In the 1960s, three children per family were considered as acceptable. Over the next decade, the government came up with the Hum Do Hamare Do slogan. At that time, many people adopted this and two children per family were considered ideal. But if you ask people from a later generation, they will probably tell you that they preferred to have one child as more and more women entered the workforce, families had to pay for child care-givers, and couples wanted to focus on providing quality education, nutrition and other inputs for their children.The balance of the population is important for the country. Scholars believe that India and China will regain their economic glory in the first half of this century, taken away from us by foreign invaders two centuries ago. At the beginning of the 18th century, the share of China and India in the GDP of the world was about 50%.A population policy cannot be seen in isolation from the people it affects. It is, in fact, a social policy. Therefore, India should focus on health, nutrition, education and economic policies. If this is done, population will take care of itself.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief of Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/peoples-support-must-for-population-policies-101626614605252.html
19-07-2021||Today's||Danish Siddiqui’s work mirrored society’s uncomfortable truths||“I never push my luck to the limit. I always keep a buffer which helps me walk out with the pictures which tell the story,” photojournalist and Pulitzer-awardee Danish Siddiqui told Reuters about his image of a Muslim man being beaten by a mob during the Delhi riots that made it to Reuters’ Pictures of the Year in 2020.On July 16, 2021, the pictures made their way back to tell the story, but Siddiqui tragically didn’t. He was killed while on a reporting assignment, embedded with Afghan security forces fighting the Taliban in Kandahar.Over the past few years, but especially in 2020 and then the summer of 2021, Siddiqui photographed some of the most evocative scenes from India’s migrant crisis, the Delhi riots as well as the deadly second wave of Covid-19 in the country. At a time when images are made in millions daily on smartphones, news photography is struggling as a standalone profession and the truth is a hard find in the media, Siddiqui’s work stuck to the rigour of good, old-fashioned photojournalism — tell it as it is.Perhaps that’s what set him apart from most others in the field. There was no time for snap judgments or biases in Siddiqui’s photographs. His work was a mirror of society’s uncomfortable truths that authorities were forced to notice, and contemporaries forced to admire.Siddiqui had been working silently for a decade and came into the spotlight in 2018, when he was awarded the Pulitzer along with his colleagues from Reuters for their coverage of the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh.On January 30, 2020, his photograph of a teenage shooter, now identified as Ram Bhakt Gopal (as he self-identifies), opening fire at protesters demonstrating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, near Jamia Milia Islamia University in Delhi went viral. It was an unforgettable portrait of blind rage and communal hatred gone out of control. A photograph for the ages, though it didn’t come without its ethical and legal implications since the suspect was allegedly a teenager and the face was blurred/left out in print across a few publications, including this one.Barely a month later, communal riots broke out in Delhi over the same protests and Siddiqui managed to get into the middle of it again, this time with a gory photograph of a Muslim man bleeding while being ruthlessly attacked by a mob in Delhi. In a talk he gave at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in New Delhi four days later, Siddiqui spoke of that image, and having been trained to shoot in hostile environments. He had walked away from that scene soon after photographing it to save himself from being attacked.Soon after, Mohammed Zubair, the man in the photograph, told a national daily that he couldn’t bear to look at that photograph — it made his legs shake in pain. Siddiqui traced Zubair after this account was published and met him again, photographing him a second time as Zubair recuperated at a relative’s home. He tracked Zubair’s recovery in the following days and apologised to him, saying he regretted walking away from the scene without being able to intervene in the unfolding attack.Amid photojournalism’s serious, unavoidable ethical implications and the questionable afterlife of viral images, Siddiqui attempted to mirror the truth relentlessly, keeping his conscience in check.Earlier this year, his photographs of hundreds of funeral pyres from the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 crisis in India, where people struggled to procure oxygen cylinders to save their loved ones, made the world sit up and take notice of India’s biggest public health crisis. The publishing of those images of burning pyres was being debated on account of sensitive content, but a time comes when the news photograph finds itself in the line of fire if it threatens to show the uncomfortable truth. Danish Siddiqui lived with that threat — even died for it.paroma.mukherjee@htlive.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/danish-siddiqui-s-work-mirrored-society-s-uncomfortable-truths-101626528560534.html
19-07-2021||Today's||UP’s population policy push is unwarranted||When one of the BJP’s star Hindutva crowd-pullers — the saffron-clad chief minister (CM) of Uttar Pradesh (UP) Yogi Adityanath — announces a controversial, drastic draft policy on family planning, many are bound to ask: What is he up to?There doesn’t seem to be an urgent need for a new two-child policy. Many commentators have argued that the population growth is not unstable. They point out that the number of babies born to Indian women is now close to the net replacement rate. UP, along with the other five laggards in development indicators — Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand — has not yet reached that stage. But in UP, the birth rate has been declining steadily. Some suggestions, which are a subset of the larger population policy, are welcome, for their impact on the state’s health and education services. For instance, there will be maternity centres in all primary health centres. These centres will distribute contraceptive pills and other means of contraception. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are to collaborate in this distribution. This is an overdue acknowledgement of the potential of NGOs by a government which, like the Centre, has often been hostile to civil society. Another provision promised in the policy is the establishment of health clubs in schools to make children aware of the need to stabilise the population. These are measures designed to encourage family planning. The measures designed to make parents afraid of having more than two children include some which would rob them of their legally guaranteed rights. Parents of large families in UP will be robbed of their right to contest in local elections. They will not be able to compete for government jobs, and large families will only be given four ration cards. They will not be able to avail government subsidies. There is the likelihood that taking these and other strict preventive measures will go wrong in the short-term and have disastrous long-term consequences. Because of the preference for boys, it can lead to female foeticide and infanticide. This will further increase the imbalance between men and women in the population. In UP, the ratio is more unbalanced than the national average, at 908 women to 1,000 men. There is also the possibility that the policy could be too successful, that the birth rate could fall too steeply, and that UP could lose the advantage of having a young population. The immediate consequence of this policy could be vigilantism and heavy-handed police intrusion into people’s private lives.So, we come back to ask why the CM has chosen this time to suggest such a potentially dangerous population control policy? Some commentators suggest that he will highlight the policy during next year’s state election campaign to broaden his appeal and escape from his hardline Hindutva straitjacket. He will then be able to present himself as a leader whose top priority is the development of his state and is willing to take radical measures to achieve that.There is another interpretation of Adityanath’s intention. One of the purposes of the draft policy is “to maintain the demographic balance in all the communities”. Hindutva politics has consistently (and unjustifiably) blamed Muslims for India’s population growth. So, couldn’t those words be a coded message that the CM will ensure that the Muslim population does not grow disproportionately? If that’s the way the message is read, the policy will become a Hindu-Muslim issue in the election campaign.Inefficiency, maladministration, and corruption are the prime causes of UP’s comparative backwardness and it is on these that Adityanath should focus his attention.

19-07-2021||Today's||A disturbing account of a father’s legacy||If I can coin a term, Ashok Lavasa is a WhatsApp friend. We’ve only met once, and I doubt if we’ve spoken even half-a-dozen times. But over the last two years, we must have exchanged stuff on WhatsApp at least a thousand times. So, when I discovered the former election commissioner has written a book, I made a point of reading it.Called An Ordinary Life, it’s the story of his father, Udai Singh Lavasa, and it’s based on the diary that bauji, as he calls him, left behind. In many ways, this is a remarkable, even astonishing, book. Some of what you’ll discover will fill you with admiration for Pere Lavasa. But there’s a fair amount that could disturb you.At one level, it’s the story of Lavasa the elder’s journey from riches to rags, and his struggle to climb back to respectability. He was a man whose commitment to his principles and values took precedence over everything. His son clearly admires that.The problem is, so honest is Lavasa’s portrait that his father often comes across as selfish, insensitive, uncaring, a bully, naive and foolishly trusting.Let me give you an example. The book begins with an account of how his father left a nine-year-old Ashok alone at Bombay Railway Station to make his way to school at Belgaum, a journey that involved three train changes. To absolve himself of responsibility, Udai Singh asked a complete stranger, whose name and address he did not bother to find out, to keep an eye on his son.The train reached Belgaum at 2.30 in the morning and the school was three kilometres away. Ashok had no money. Fortunately, the stranger was a good man who took him home, gave him a bed for the night, breakfast the next morning, and took him to school. But what if this stranger had not bothered? After all, the little boy was not his responsibility. The thought did not occur to Udai Singh. Not for a moment did he think that his young son could be abducted, sexually assaulted, or killed. Or if he did, it was a risk he was prepared to take.Ashok Lavasa defends his father by arguing that those were days when you could trust strangers. He says that’s the difference between then and now. He adds that his father was an intuitive person who could judge people by their appearance. Perhaps, but I can’t see too many fathers taking a similar risk and very few mothers would forgive them if they did.The elder Lavasa could also be horribly insensitive. “His habit of speaking the plain truth, unconcerned about the feelings of the listener … often crossed the norms of ordinary social behaviour”, his son writes. Consider this example: “Bauji had this shocking habit of speaking the most unpleasant truth quite unmindful of how it would be received or perceived by others… he would speak his mind irrespective of the awkwardness that it could create.When one of my Mamajis died at the age of 50 in a road accident leaving behind his widow and four teenaged children, Bauji after attending the prayer meeting told my Mamiji ‘jo Bhagwan karta hai, acche ke liye karta hai; whatever God does is for the good’.”The son sees this as an illustration of his father’s passionate commitment to the truth. But to the reader, it comes across as hateful insensitivity. Even, perhaps, cruelty. When I finished reading there was only one thought in my mind — why has Ashok Lavasa revealed the darker side of his father’s character? There was so much else in his life that was laudable, but it’s overshadowed by these black edges.The truth is, there isn’t a father in this world who doesn’t have character flaws. But how many sons would deliberately reveal them? It’s an astonishingly honest thing to do — and, therefore, creditable — but it presents a loved parent in a rather poor light.

19-07-2021||Today's||The political drivers of the monsoon session||The monsoon session of Parliament begins on July 19. It is a significant session for a range of reasons.One, it is the first full session after a year-and-a-half of Parliament either witnessing curtailed sessions or missing sessions due to the pandemic. A majority of parliamentarians are vaccinated, and it is time they return to their core work of law-making and holding the executive accountable.Two, it is the first session with a new and expanded council of ministers which will be on test. This is particularly true of the health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, who will be the face of the government’s Covid-19 management even if he was not the man in charge till 10 days ago.Three, the political backdrop — of assembly elections held in 2021, particularly the West Bengal outcome, and those scheduled for 2022, especially the battles in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh — will weigh heavily on each side’s calculations. Four, the battle for 2024 has already begun and each intervention will be with an eye on cultivating constituencies, building alliances, projecting leadership, and pushing one’s narrative.And five, precisely because of all these factors, both the treasury and Opposition benches have a common, rare, convergence of interest in seeing a functional session. To be sure, it will be stormy and there are bound to be walkouts and disruptions, but all indications are that legislative and political business will get done too.In this overall context, it is instructive to examine the strengths, vulnerabilities, and strategies of both sides as they approach the session.Within the Opposition, there is both intensified cooperation and heated competition, with the singular objective of emerging as the primary voice against the Narendra Modi government. This cooperative-competitive impulse will play out in different ways.First, the convergence. The Opposition is on the same page on a range of issues. This includes hopes of cornering the government on its Covid-19 management strategy, especially during the second wave and questioning its vaccination policy. It includes raising the issue of price rise, especially of fuel, which is largely (but not exclusively) a result of taxes — a rising concern that the Opposition believes will resonate with voters. The convergence extends to questioning the government on the economic downturn, especially rising unemployment and depleting demand. It includes asking the government questions on the border situation, especially with China (though defence minister Rajnath Singh’s laudable, quiet, off-the-record, briefing for Sharad Pawar and AK Antony, two former raksha mantris, may help in defusing this line of attack).But that is where the divergences also begin. There are two issues on which priorities differ. One is Rafale — the Congress intends to raise allegations about the Rafale procurement, Rahul Gandhi’s pet agenda, in the light of new revelations and inquiry in France. But this isn’t an issue that other Opposition parties are too invested in because they doubt it has larger traction among the electorate as seen in the 2019 elections. The second is the farm protests — for some parties such as the Shiromani Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party and even Samajwadi Party, this will be a greater focus of attention. For the others, this is an issue that merits support but is not an immediate concern in their electoral calculus.But the greater divergence is not on issues but the question of leadership. The Trinamool Congress (TMC), emboldened after the West Bengal win, believes that the moment is ripe to assume a larger national avatar in positioning itself as the most militant and aggressive of parties against the central government. It is not a coincidence that Mamata Banerjee is arriving in Delhi on Sunday to spend five days in the Capital as Parliament commences. The TMC believes that it can be the lead player in galvanising a set of regional parties, which may not be comfortable with the Congress and vice-versa.The Congress, for its part, will seek to be the lead voice but is handicapped by a weak leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha (Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury) and the absence of stalwarts in the Rajya Sabha (with Ahmed Patel’s death and Ghulam Nabi Azad’s exit). How the Congress balances its aspiration for leadership, while taking the rest of the Opposition along, will give clues about the state of Opposition unity in the run-up to 2024.For the government, which is far more coherent than the Opposition given the strong control and focus on disciplined messaging from the top, the session is crucial because it recognises the need to put forth its version on contentious issues. And that is why it appears to have decided that rather than skirt around the second wave of Covid-19, and evade the issue, it will allow a full discussion.The government believes that with the passage of time, its narrative on the second wave will gain credence. This narrative will rely on the following elements — the deaths were a tragedy, we did our best and Prime Minister (PM) Modi was focused on boosting health care infrastructure through the cruel months of April-May, vaccination is a difficult exercise globally, the slowdown happened because of the failure of the states but now that the Centre has taken back control, vaccination rates will pick up again, preventing a third wave is a collective responsibility but we are prepared. Whether this narrative is enough to satisfy the electorate is to be seen. But the Opposition will focus on refreshing the memory of the second wave and pointing to the errors, while the government will focus on looking ahead.It will, however, be interesting to see how the treasury benches respond to other issues, especially price rise. Defending it is politically dangerous, evading it altogether is hard. To go on the offensive, there are also expectations that Members of Parliament on the ruling side will pick issues of post-electoral violence in Bengal and perhaps even put forth a few more private member bills on population control.In terms of leadership, the Rajya Sabha has witnessed a change. Piyush Goyal is now leader of the House — and the session will be a test of his floor coordination and management skills. Goyal is understood to have warm ties with political leaders across the aisle, but whether he can translate this into a more collegial way of functioning, while ensuring that the National Democratic Alliance retains dominance in the House, will have to be seen.Beyond the political calculus, however, both the government and the Opposition must realise that this has been an extraordinarily difficult time for citizens. They expect the ultimate symbol of their sovereignty, Parliament, to be the home of a civilised, even if fierce, discussion on all issues with the common objective of evolving laws and policies after democratic deliberation. The government must be open to criticism and acknowledge where it has failed, along with highlighting its successes. The Opposition must perform its role of seeking accountability, but do so constructively.letters@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-political-drivers-of-the-monsoon-session-101626528557037.html
19-07-2021||Today's||With Space 2.0, India’s entrepreneurial odyssey has the potential to take off||The year 2022 represents a significant milestone for India’s space industry. It marks the fifth decade since the establishment of the Department of Space (DoS). The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has been at the helm of India’s rich space heritage with several remarkable achievements, including successful space missions and development of technologies to foster India’s self-reliance and progress.Over the past 50 years, India’s space programme has contributed to the rise of an array of space technologies for socio-economic development, including, satellite-based remote education, remote health care, agriculture support, and weather forecasting, among others.For India’s post-pandemic future, SpaceTech represents an extremely vital, and as yet underdeveloped, cog. The space sector has the potential to truly mobilise India’s economy beyond the $5 trillion GDP target. Whether it be optimised navigation or data analytics, enhanced agri tech or health care, SpaceTech applications have significant potential to shape the future.Also Read | Branson, Bezos and the frontiers of outer spaceToday, Indian space commerce accounts for less than two per cent of the global market. With Space 2.0, India has an unparalleled opportunity to leverage its rich competencies, skills and resources to stake its leadership in SpaceTech. Space 2.0 will unleash entrepreneurial spirit, and result in greater democratisation of SpaceTech.It is well-recognised that a strong technology ecosystem with academia, private and public sector players can together foster economic development, and contribute to nation building. The government remains the key enabler with proactive policy initiatives to foster the technology ecosystem. Academia and public sector contribute to the rise of new fundamental space technologies. The private sector brings in entrepreneurial energy, with scientific know-how, strong business acumen, and access to capital and markets.The government’s space reforms and establishment of new enabling mechanisms are aimed at furthering India’s SpaceTech successes in the Space 2.0 era. The New Space India Limited (NSIL), established in 2019, offers access to Isro technologies and spin-offs to the private sector for deep commercialisation. In 2020, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe), a new facilitating agency, was established. IN-SPACe provides enabling policies, and simplified guidelines to the private sector, and the necessary access for using Isro-built space infrastructure.These enabling policy mechanisms complement the rich research and innovation hotbed that the India’s institutes of higher learning represent. Indian institutions of higher learning have provided academic programs across undergraduate and post-graduate levels. They also provide the enabling incubation ecosystem and support for new SpaceTech entrepreneurs. Whether it be IIT Madras Research Park or Birla Institute of Science and Technology or Indian Institute of Science (IISc) or IIIT Hyderabad, many new SpaceTech entrepreneurs have come to the fore. With support from risk-averse angel investors, Indian SpaceTech start-ups are seeking to leverage the SpaceTech opportunities.An array of SpaceTech startups, including Pixxel, Bellatrix Aerospace, Agnikul Cosmos, Skyroot Aerospace, and Digantara Space Startup, among others, are seeking to leverage SpaceTech. Start-ups have made tangible progress in their proof-of-concepts and developing prototypes, and are contributing to the rise of new products and services across the value chain, including upstream and downstream space technology development.Standing on the shoulders of India’s SpaceTech Giants, Indian SpaceTech start-ups have the potential to make a dent in the universe. In doing so, they will script India’s SpaceTech leadership over the next 50 years.Prabhu Ram heads the Industry Intelligence Group (IIG) at CyberMedia Research (CMR)The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/with-space-2-0-india-s-entrepreneurial-space-odyssey-has-the-potential-to-take-off-101626440173836.html
19-07-2021||Today's||Women leaders, and women voters, matter||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reconstituted council of ministers of 77 members includes 11 women, the highest number of women ministers since 2004. The current Lok Sabha, too, has the highest number of women, at 14%. Some have celebrated this, but surely a celebration of a 14% representation is a worrying one, underlining a very low bar.The number of women candidates in elections remains regrettably small: 9% in Kerala, 7.8% in Assam, 11% in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, in the recent state elections. India’s status on women’s political participation has been underwhelming, highlighted by the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2021, where India ranked 140 among 156 participating countries, faring the worst in terms of political empowerment.But political participation is not only about being elected to governance structures. The larger political story includes the role of voters, a role in which women’s numbers have increased. A study by Shamika Ravi and Mudit Kapoor found that the sex ratio of voters (the number of women voters for every 1,000 men voters) increased from 715 to 883 between the 1960s and 2000s. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, women voters were more than 48% of total voters in 23 states/Union Territories (UTs) and overtook the number of men voters in 10 states/UTs.Also Read | PM Modi has souped up his cabinet, time for bureaucratic revamp for new IndiaIt is instructive to examine why women’s political participation is important. Gender-based equity is unarguably a key reason, sufficient in itself, some may argue. But the implication of women’s political participation on social policy and development priorities is equally important; with voters and elected representatives bearing a clear influence on social policies.The presence of women as political leaders and their participation in policymaking bodies have the potential to influence the direction of policy. Studies by Sonia Bhalotra, Damian Clarke, and others show how the election of women as political leaders has influenced public policy priorities to favourably impact maternal health. Their work found women politicians place greater priority on investing in local public health infrastructure and on interventions focusing on appropriate health-seeking behaviours directed at improvements in maternal health.The impact of women leaders in local governance has similarly been visible in priority to social policy. Studies conducted by Esther Duflo, Raghabendra Chattopadhyay, and other scholars, have shown a greater priority to health, nutrition, water, and other social goods in villages with women panchayat leaders.But it is not only in their leadership roles that women can influence the direction of policy attention; their role as voters is no less significant. It is well established that women’s vote is not necessarily influenced by family members; as evident from a 2019 survey Lokniti survey. A paper by Grant Miller highlighted the impact of suffrage rights for women in the United States (US) as resulting in greater attention and support from politicians to women’s preferences, thereby influencing policy priorities. An eye on the constituency of women voters led to increased public health spending, which, in turn, enabled interventions on behaviour change campaigns that reduced child mortality.In India too, women voters have been known to influence policy priorities, as they come out to vote in large numbers. Not missing their increased numbers, politicians have responded to their needs, as reflected in Bihar, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu, to name a few states.The policy prioritisation of maternal and child health in Tamil Nadu has for long been influenced by the large base of women voters. Expanding the space for women to voice and assert their priorities clearly can and does influence policy priorities in the social sector, and specifically health.The lack of attention to health and other social policy areas in India has been a topic of discussion for long, with the political economy of social policy becoming a key area of interrogation. While there could be several political determinants of policy, the key among these includes tangible demands from the electorate and the inherent preferences of policymakers. If priorities and policy preferences of men and women are distinctly different, the gendered constitution of the electorate as also policymakers will likely impact the direction of policy priorities, in a competing policy space.Public health and other social services stand to gain from the increased representation of women in policy platforms. As elected representatives, their numbers remain woefully small, except at the third-tier of governance. It is not that political parties don’t have adequate numbers of women workers or that women are not politically engaged. The farmers’ protests and the Shaheen Bagh protests are two of several examples that point to women asserting their political positions. A critical mass of women leaders offers them the potential confidence to support agendas different from others and ensure their voice is heard.Reservation for women, discussed and debated for long, needs urgent action from a variety of perspectives, not the least of which includes greater attention to India’s social policy.The distinction in preferences based on identity suggests that ensuring adequate representation at both the policymaker level as well as the voter pool should be a key objective to ensure that different policy areas get the attention they need.Sandhya Venkateswaran is a member of Lancet Citizen’s Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/women-leaders-and-women-voters-matter-101626437473375.html
19-07-2021||Today's||Ten questions for the government||Right through the extraordinarily gruelling pandemic period, one question has remained unanswered. Who is accountable for the many shortcomings in the Covid-19 fight? So, as the monsoon session of Parliament begins next week, here is a list of 10 questions that ought to be debated by our parliamentarians.One, health minister Harsh Vardhan has been removed, a tacit admission that the Centre failed to act swiftly and effectively during the lethal second Covid-19 wave. But was the minister singularly responsible for the failure to anticipate, or at least minimise, the impact of the virus? The hubris and complacency that led to a premature declaration of victory over Covid-19, the frenetic electioneering in the crucial March-April period, the green signal to the Kumbh Mela, surely wasn’t the act of just one Cabinet minister. So shouldn’t there be a mea culpa and shouldn’t more heads roll across the political and administrative spectrum?Two, vaccination remains the key weapon in the fight to contain the virus. So could the nation be informed just how the Centre intends to double vaccinate all its adult population by the end of December as promised to the Supreme Court (SC)? At the moment, the vaccine numbers keep oscillating wildly, a day of record highs followed by sudden dips and shortages. In May, the Centre projected that India would have 2.16 billion doses of vaccines available by year-end, but in an affidavit before the SC in June, the figure was revised to 1.35 billion. So could we have an accurate estimate of vaccine supplies over the next six months without any trumped up figures?Also Read | Adhir Ranjan to lead charge in LS as Cong looks to corner govt over issuesThree, there have been concerns over just how budgetary allocations on vaccines have been spent so far. So could the nation be enlightened as to how exactly has the government used the ₹35,000 crore budget allocation which was aimed ostensibly at ensuring free vaccines for all?Four, there are several unanswered questions over the relationship between the Centre and Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin. The Indian Council of Medical Research has, after all, helped Bharat Biotech in developing Covaxin and co-funded the research. For example, while emergency-use authorisation was granted to Covaxin even before its phase 3 clinical trial efficacy results were available, why was there a reluctance to fast forward approvals to foreign manufacturers such as Pfizer? The over-reliance on just two indigenous producers to ramp up supply without allowing compulsory licensing to other potential firms is seen as a key reason for the vaccine crunch. Moreover, is the Indian government aware of the details of the vaccine deal between Bharat Biotech and the Brazilian government that is now the subject of a criminal inquiry in that country?Five, there remains considerable confusion over the exact Covid death toll across the country. Every few days, some states “revise” their numbers upwards, further evidence of the glaring undercount. Is it not imperative to have a transparent, court-monitored audit of the number of deaths across the country, especially as the apex court has now forced a reluctant Centre to devise a compensation scheme for Covid-affected families? How long will rural Covid deaths, in particular, be invisibilised?Six, the PM-Cares Fund, set up in the aftermath of the pandemic, refuses to share details of donors and amounts received or expenditure incurred by claiming that it is not a public authority which comes under the ambit of the Right to Information Act. This opacity is troubling since the fund was created to assist citizens who are denied the right to know how exactly the money is being spent. For example, a number of ventilators funded through PM-Cares have been found to be defective. On what basis were these supply orders placed with certain companies with no previous track record in manufacturing ventilators? And what is the exact status of government-funded oxygen plant infrastructure, a gap so cruelly exposed in the second wave?Seven, a critical element in the fight against Covid-19 is to empower the scientific community by aggressively funding research and development. In the build-up to the second wave, it was found that India had failed to ensure sufficient levels of genome sequencing. So can the government now share details of its investments in medical research in tracking the virus as it mutates?Eight, the pandemic has led to massive job losses. Since the government refuses to accept the unemployment data provided by credible institutions such as the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, why doesn’t the ministry of labour and employment provide us accurate numbers of jobs lost during the pandemic? The previous labour minister ducked the question with a wishy-washy response in the Rajya Sabha last year. It’s time now for a reality check.Nine, rising fuel prices have led to a typical Centre-state blame game. Why doesn’t the Centre withdraw several existing cesses and initiate a dialogue with the states to ensure a calibrated reduction in fuel taxes? Surely, Parliament can initiate a discussion which can then be carried forward in the Goods and Services Tax council to push for fuel to become part of a more rational and sustainable tax regime?And finally, is India better prepared to handle a possible third wave than we were for the second or will chaos reign yet again? And where does the buck stop if, god forbid, there is a next time?Post-script: In the build-up to the monsoon session, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla was seen posing before a Mahatma Gandhi statue in the Parliament precincts. Can the speaker ensure that the Gandhian values of honesty and fair play prevail through a comprehensive discussion on all the above questions in Parliament?Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and author The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/ten-questions-for-the-government-101626433693510.html
19-07-2021||Today's||Twenty years later, the old Afghanistan returns||The Indian Air Force (IAF) transport aircraft touched down without any incident, with us strapped up on benches running along the inside wall of the fuselage. The giant door opened shortly, on a sun-drenched tarmac, a rolling expanse of harsh concrete.As we left the aircraft, an official collected our passports. For immigration stamping, we were told. An Afghan official sat cross-legged on the tarmac not too far from us, putting immigration stamps on passports.Welcome to Bagram airport.The Soviet Union-built sprawling airport outside Kabul had become, since November 2001, the nerve centre of the United States (US) invasion. It changed hands once again recently amid somewhat dramatic conditions — the Americans left unannounced in the middle of the night, claimed the Afghans.Also Read | Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui killed in Afghanistan’s Kandahar provinceOn November 21, 2001, a week after the Taliban had fled Kabul, ceding control of the country to the Northern Alliance, a loose confederation of Afghan warlords, the IAF cargo plane had brought a delegation of Indian diplomats led by special envoy Satish Lambah.It was the first official visit to post-Taliban Afghanistan, and Lambah was received by all top leaders, including Marshal Fahim, who had inherited the fighting forces of Ahmad Shah Masood, the charismatic Tajik leader who was assassinated by al Qaeda just days before 9/11.The IAF flight also brought a huge consignment of medical supplies and some sorely-needed entertainment for an Afghanistan starved by the Taliban of films, music, and TV: CDs of Amir Khan’s super-duper hit Lagaan, which was released six months before in June.Also on the flight, one more time, were diplomats who would begin the work of restoring India’s diplomatic presence in Kabul, five years after Indians had shut down the embassy in left for India, on September 26, 1996.They would start small, with the liaison officer of the ministry of external affairs in a room, one room, in Kabul Hotel, which was undergoing extensive restoration work funded by the Agha Khan foundation.The Indian embassy in upscale Shahr-e-nau was still largely intact but needed repairs, mostly to plug and paint over bullet holes left by Taliban fighters. It became fully functional on December 22, with a flag hoisting by external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, who had flown in really for the inauguration of the interim authority led by Hamid Karzai.It was a chaotic day on the streets of Kabul, and reaching one point from another was quicker on foot. Some reporters who had accompanied the minister failed to make it back in time to Bagram for the flight home. The newly opened embassy gamely hosted them till the next flight out.India evacuated some 50 diplomats and security officials from its consulate in Kandahar earlier this week as the Taliban closed in on the southern city, which once served as the de facto capital of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the Taliban called the country on their watch. What’s next? Jalalabad? Kabul, once again, eventually?Twenty years since that flight to Bagram, Afghanistan, and India’s presence in Afghanistan has come a full circle.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/twenty-years-later-the-old-afghanistan-returns-101626424512825.html
19-07-2021||Editorials||The Kabul dilemma||The civil war in Afghanistan came home on Friday, with the formidable Indian photojournalist, Danish Siddiqui of Reuters, who was embedded with Afghan security forces, killed by the Taliban in Kandahar. Siddiqui’s tragic death has led to an outpouring of grief globally, but it is the latest symbol of the tragedy that is unfolding in Afghanistan. The Taliban remains a monstrous force, committed to a medieval form of an Islamic Emirate, but it is winning. The Afghan government remains determined to preserve the Republic, with its democratic values, but is struggling to hold on to power. The international community (read the United States and its western allies) is still holding on to the fiction of a peace process and political settlement, but can’t wait to flee after having ravaged the country for 20 years and left it without any sustainable and resilient institutions to defend democracy. And India is stuck, caught between its values and principles it holds dear and immediate strategic interests and imperatives.Distilled to the core, at the cost of being simplistic, here is a 20-year history of Afghanistan. Wounded by the 9/11 terror attacks, the United States (US) decided it was time to invade Afghanistan to kill Osama bin Laden, dismantle al Qaeda and oust the Taliban, which had provided State support and sanctuary to the terror outfit. The last objective was met fairly quickly, and a new interim authority led by Hamid Karzai took office. But it took the US 10 years to find and kill bin Laden; al Qaeda changed its form and its ideology and leaders also found a home in other terror outfits; and the Taliban went to Pakistan and waited.Islamabad and Rawalpindi, compelled to take part in the US-led “war on terror”, figured that eventually the Americans would go back home. Uncomfortable with a democratic regime in Kabul which wanted to reorient Afghanistan’s domestic and external trajectory and have balanced ties with other South Asian countries, particularly India, Pakistan harboured, supported, funded, and armed the Taliban and other proxies — even as it pretended to be with the US in cracking down on terrorism. Washington, first distracted by the flawed invasion of Iraq and then war fatigue back home, vacillated between the objectives of merely defeating terror and nation-building. It achieved neither successfully. And as the politics of nationalism intensified in the US, Washington began looking for an exit. Pakistan then pretended to be the good guy facilitating peace, and a staggering degree of spin about how there is a good Taliban and bad Taliban began doing the rounds. The US special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, in a desperate bid to emerge as peace-maker irrespective of the terms of the peace, appeased the Taliban, even as the Afghan government got weaker every day.And so now there is a descent into chaos, to use Ahmed Rashid’s evocative title of a book on Afghanistan-Pakistan. The Taliban is officially participating in a peace process, but is on a military offensive. In two months, it has taken over one-third of the country’s districts; captured crucial border posts; penetrated Kandahar; and caused massive civilian suffering in terms of death and displacement. Ashraf Ghani, the Republic’s president, in an interview with The Hindu, put up a brave front and said while the Taliban has won battles, the Republic will win the war while still pointing to the need for a political settlement. The US has claimed that it will not recognise any forceful capture of power, but the Taliban intends to change the balance of power irreversibly, leaving little choice. The West is slowly reconciling itself to a Taliban-dominated regime in return for guarantees on security; China, Russia and even Iran seem to have cut bilateral deals with the Taliban; and despite sporadic differences with the Taliban, Pakistan seems to be smiling all the way to Kabul.India is in a tough spot. Delhi recognises the threat the Taliban poses to not just its security but modernity. But it has little leverage to influence the outcome. It is unhappy with the manner of the US exit, but can’t change that either. To secure its political, diplomatic and developmental investment in Afghanistan, it wants to support the Afghan government, which is indeed putting up a fight, but also knows that there is little choice but to deal with the Taliban, a force that it so dislikes for the right reasons. Between the right side and winning side, India will have to strike a balance to protect its core national interests and citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-kabul-dilemma-101626614300526.html
