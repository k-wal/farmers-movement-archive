28-07-2021||News||Inflation: The contrasting tale of India and the US||Retail inflation is making news in both United States (US) and India. Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 5.4% in the US in the month of June 2021. This is the highest monthly inflation in the US in 13 years.Retail inflation in India was 6.26% in June. June 2021 is the second consecutive month when India’s CPI has stayed above the 6% mark, which is the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s tolerance band. The wholesale price index (WPI) in India continued to grow in double digits for the third consecutive month in June.While, both the US and India are experiencing a high inflation environment, the two are very different. Here is how.Composition of CPI indices in US and India is different Retail inflation, by definition, is a measure of change in prices of commodities consumed by the representative household in an economy.Also Read | Inflation targeting and the Indian economyThe Indian economy differs a great deal from its US counterpart. The former is a lower-middle income economy with a per capita income of $1901; the latter is a high income economy with the largest GDP in the world and a per capita income of $63,544. 39% of India’s CPI basket comprises of food items. This share is just 13.9% in the US CPI. Services account for 58% of the US CPI; in India, it is just 28%.Base effect is a much bigger factor in US inflation than India Since the pandemic inflicted a huge disruption to economies across the world, it is important to keep in mind the role of base effect while looking at any statistic which uses year-on-year comparisons.Base effect is a bigger factor in generating tailwinds for inflation in the US than in India. CPI growth in US in June 2020 was 0.65%, compared to 3.18% in June 2019. This is not the case in India. India’s CPI grew at 6.23% in June 2020 as well.A useful way to filter out the base effect in inflation indices is to look at its two-year growth rather than the year-on-year growth number. The June 2021 value of CPI index in US and India had grown by 6.07% and 12.88% respectively between June 2019 and June 2021.What is driving inflation in US and India at the moment? The first issue here is the importance of core and non-core inflation. Core inflation measures the change in prices of all items in the CPI basket excluding food and fuel. In India, both core and non-core inflation are high at the moment. The respective values were 6.39% and 6.27% in June 2021. These numbers are 4.5% and 8.3% for the US economy.Food inflation, both in standalone and overall terms, is a much smaller factor in the US than in India. Food prices grew at 5.58% in India and 2.4% in the US in June 2021. Their contribution to overall CPI growth was just 6.42% in the US compared to 32.48% in India. Bulk of the food inflation in India is on account of edible oil and pulses.Price of petroleum products, which are at a record high, is the other big factor behind the inflationary spike in India. While fuel inflation has also risen in the US, it is largely a base effect. Unlike India, petroleum prices actually went down in the US when crude prices crashed during the pandemic. Weekly retail gasoline price per gallon had fallen by 20% in the last week of June 2020 from $2.715/gallon in June 2019.What is really driving inflation in the US is a rise in prices of things such as used cars, which experts believe is symptomatic of persisting supply side constraints as demand bounces back in the economy.“With used cars and trucks accounting for more than one-third of the surge in prices reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday, economists continued to believe that higher inflation was transitory, aligning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s long-standing views”, said a Reuters story.In contrast, unless the government cuts taxes on petrol-diesel, prices are likely to remain high in India. India is also expected to experience additional inflationary tailwinds as demand for services rises with the economy opening up.How do markets and economists see inflation? In today’s world, inflation numbers influence more than an ordinary household’s budget. Thanks to the entrenched inequalities in what is a globalised economy, inflation can have very different consequences for different economies.Interest rates, capital movements and stock markets are one such example. Real interest rates have been almost zero in advanced countries for quite some time now. This has encouraged capital to move out towards emerging markets in search of better returns. If inflation were to rise in the advanced capitalist world, interest rates will have to rise. Even an expectation of such a development can trigger some sort of capital flight from emerging economies. This is exactly what happened during what is now referred to as the Taper-Tantrum in 2013.So far markets have not reacted negatively to high inflation in the US markets. Bond yield on benchmark 10-year treasury bonds had increased by four basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point - on July 13, the day June inflation data was released. However, this has fallen by 15 basis points between July 13 and July 22, perhaps a result of the US Federal Reserve ruling out any increase in interest rates against what it saw as temporary inflation.In India, RBI has repeatedly asserted that restoring growth will remain a priority of monetary policy, even though analysts expect that the central bank will have to start withdrawing from the paddle of monetary easing by the end of this year.“Starting in the December quarter, we expect the RBI to gradually start draining the surplus liquidity, raising the reverse repo rate, and change its stance to neutral. Our real neutral rates analysis suggests that the repo rate will have to be raised by 100bp over time. We expect the RBI to raise the repo rate by 50bp in 2H2022. The remaining 50bp rate hike is likely to follow thereafter (in FY24)”, Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets had said in a note on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/inflation-the-contrasting-tale-of-india-and-the-us-101627468112124.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||FIR intended to suppress graft revealed in phone tapping case: Rashmi Shukla to HC||Senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla sought to quash the first information report (FIR) registered by the Mumbai Police against her in the illegal phone tapping case and informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the FIR was intended to suppress crime and not to investigate and prosecute offenders who resorted to corrupt practices in postings and transfer of senior police officers. While submitting that there was nothing illegal in the phone tapping which was done after getting the requisite sanction from the concerned authority, Shukla’s counsel disclosed excerpts of the report which was based on the surveillance of the phones of some individuals who allegedly used their connections with the then home minister and one “dada” to facilitate transfers in return for huge sums of money. The HC adjourned hearing of Shukla’s petition till August 5 after the state assured the court that no coercive steps, including arrest, would be taken against her till August 6. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was informed by senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani that Shukla was being harassed for being honest and exposing the corruption involved in posting and transfer of senior police officers. The petition sought either quashing of the FIR or transfer of investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Jethmalani submitted that while Shukla was the Commissioner of Intelligence she had initiated interception of the phone calls made by certain individuals who acted as brokers. The interceptions, which had requisite sanctions, revealed that these brokers were in touch with senior police officers and used their clout with the home minister’s office and certain other political bigwigs from the ruling coalition government to facilitate transfers and postings for huge sums of money. “The interception was for preventing a crime and it was done in an authorised way,” said Jethmalani. He, however, clarified that the political leaders whose names were mentioned in the report were not necessarily involved and the same could be ascertained after proper investigation. Jethmalani said the names were mentioned as the brokers purportedly approached them to get the desired transfers and postings for the police officers. He further added that though the sanctions for the interceptions had been granted by the then additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, he had later back-tracked and claimed that he had been misled on the reasons for the interceptions. Due to paucity of time, the court adjourned the hearing to August 5 and accepted the assurance from the state that they would not take any coercive action or arrest Shukla till August 6.BOXThe CBI, represented by additional solicitor general Anil Singh, informed the Bombay HC bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar that the state had refused to hand over the documents pertaining to the FIR which it had registered against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and other unknown others on April 21. Singh submitted that CBI had written two letters to the state after the HC had dismissed the petition by the state on July 22 and paved way for CBI to continue its investigations on the allegations of corruption and criminal conspiracy made by Param Bir Singh in his March 20 letter to the chief minister. He informed the court that the concerned officer had refused to furnish the documents sought by CBI, thus acting against the order of the court. However, after the state objected to the grievance raised by Singh during the hearing of a different matter, the HC directed CBI to file an application for its consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-intended-to-suppress-graft-revealed-in-phone-tapping-case-rashmi-shukla-to-hc-101627496990411.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||760 people died on Mumbai suburban railway tracks in six months: GRP||At least four persons lost their lives every day on suburban railway tracks in Mumbai in the past six months, even though local trains are not yet open for general public. According to the statistics compiled by the Government Railway Police (GRP), 760 people have died on suburban railway tracks in Mumbai from January 1 to June 30 this year. The deceased include 665 men and 95 women. The GRP data, however, revealed that a maximum of 490 died while trespassing. Last year, 730 people had died while crossing the railway line.Police officers said that local train travel is restricted only to people engaged in emergency and essential services due to the pandemic. They said since the crowd is less (in and around suburban railway stations), people tend to take short cuts by crossing the lines, assuming that the train services have reduced.Activists, however, maintain that the cause of deaths on railway lines is due to the illegal entry points. “Railways should put up fences between tracks connecting two platforms to bring down the number of track-crossing and do more experiments like closed doors of local trains to minimise the problem of overcrowding and people falling off running trains,” said Shakil Ahmed, a railway activist.In the past six months, 106 people have died due to falling from running trains and around 30 people died by suicide on railway tracks and five commuters died as they were hit by poles close to railway tracks.The data also revealed that 111 people lost their lives due to natural causes while three were electrocuted.According to GRP figures, this year, a maximum number of deaths are recorded on Central Railway (CR) with around 460 commuters losing their lives between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to Kalyan till June 30 this year. Throughout 2020, CR had reported 523 deaths, and 1,763 in 2019.In 2020, train services were hit by the Covid-19 pandemic which directly impacted the accidents in tracks, thus reducing deaths on tracks considerably. Last year, 1,116 people lost their lives and 878 people suffered injuries on Mumbai’s suburban railway lines, as compared to 2,691 deaths and 3,194 injuries reported in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/760-people-died-on-mumbai-suburban-railway-tracks-in-six-months-grp-101627496989738.html

Kundra moved the bail plea on Monday, immediately after the magistrate refused to extend his police custody and remanded him in judicial custody.Opposing his bail plea, police claimed that the investigation so far has revealed that the 45-year-old businessman had set up a company, Armsprime Media Pvt Ltd., which developed the mobile phone application Hotshots and sold it to London-based Kenrin Pvt Ltd, which is owned by his brother-in-law. Police claimed Kundra used the app to upload pornographic videos shot in and around Mumbai for paid viewership on the app.The property cell further alleged that Kundra was one who controlled the operation of the app and had earned over ₹1.17 crore between August and December last year by means of subscription fee collected from Apple App Store users of his mobile application.

28-07-2021||Mumbai||Inquiries a vendetta for complaining against Anil Deshmukh: Param Bir Singh to HC||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, while making submissions in support his petition before the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday, has alleged that the two preliminary inquiries initiated against him by the state were intended to scuttle the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) probe which was ordered by the HC on April 5. The state opposed the petition, stating that it was not maintainable as the preliminary inquiries initiated by it were under the purview of the Central Service Rules which are decided by the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) and added that Singh should have approached the tribunal rather than the HC. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was informed by senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani that the plea challenged the two preliminary inquiries initiated against him. The first probe against Singh is under the All India Services (Conduct) Rules in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case and the second probe is related to the allegations made by inspector Anup Dange, who was suspended last year and has recently been reinstated.While arguing on behalf of Singh, Jethmalani submitted that both the probes were ordered as a vendetta as he had complained to the chief minister about the corrupt practices ordered by former home minister Anil Deshmukh. He said the probes were ordered hastily and without application of mind. “Instead of inquiring into the complaints by Singh against Deshmukh, the state has punished the whistleblower. They are trying to shoot the messenger,” said Jethmalani. He added that the inquiries were not merely administrative in nature but also dealt with the criminal aspect of the case, and hence Singh was justified in approaching the HC. Earlier in May, HC had observed that the reliefs claimed by Singh could be decided by CAT.Jethmalani then continued that the state had tried to make Singh withdraw his March 20 letter to the chief minister by asking director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey to convince Singh to take back his allegations against Deshmukh. Pandey had been appointed to conduct the preliminary inquiry when he allegedly advised Singh to withdraw the letter as it was futile to fight against the system. Jethmalani said that when Singh did not fall in line and disclosed the conversation between him and Pandey, the DGP recused himself from the inquiry, after which false and concocted cases were initiated against Singh including the one by Dange. Senior counsel Darius Khambatta for the state, however, opposed the petition and argued that the issues raised by Singh pertained to service matters and he should approach CAT as the issues were covered under the provisions of the Administrative Tribunals Act. Khambatta further refuted Singh’s claims that the government action was a form of vendetta and that Dange had lodged the complaint against Singh on February 4, much before Singh wrote the letter to the chief minister on March 20. In light of this, Khambatta said the petition was not maintainable and was intended to scuttle the probe initiated by the state against him by claiming that all action by the state against him was mala fide. “The petition is an abuse of process. Just because the petitioner has made some allegations, he does not get immunity from any of his actions. The allegations in Dange’s complaint are grave; extraordinarily serious offences are made out. None is above law, not even the former Mumbai Police chief,” said Khambatta. Senior Counsel Navroz Seervai, for DGP Pandey, concurred with Khambatta and said if the court deemed Singh’s petition maintainable, he would file a detailed affidavit with regards to the claims made by Singh against him. After hearing submissions, the court reserved its order on the issue of maintainability of Singh’s plea, which it will pronounce in due course. Meanwhile, the bench adjourned till August 5 hearing on Singh’s pleas seeking quashing of an FIR lodged against him by the Thane Police under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The state said it would continue its earlier statement of no coercive action, including arrest, against Singh till August 6 in the case under the Atrocities Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/inquiries-a-vendetta-for-complaining-against-anil-deshmukh-param-bir-singh-to-hc-101627496928968.html

The Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor is a green-field project. The project would be beneficial not only for the defence and aerospace industry but also for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups established in the project area, he said. The chief minister, who addressed the CII-Indigenization Summit on Defence and Aerospace-2021 (CII-ISDA-2021) through virtual medium, said the useful suggestions received in the summit would prove useful in making India self-reliant in the field of defence production. The summit, based on the theme ‘India Marching Towards Self-Reliance in Defence and Aerospace,’’ has been jointly organized by CII, UPEDA and Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM) from July 28 to July 31, 2021. Yogi said the state government had implemented the model of development of the Prime Minister with full commitment. The initiatives taken by the state government during the last four years under the inspiration and guidance of the Prime Minister had changed the perception of the people in the country and the world regarding Uttar Pradesh. The state government’s zero tolerance policy towards crime and corruption had strengthened law and order in the state, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/defence-ind-corridor-would-help-realise-make-in-india-vision-101627496508961.html

It’s praiseworthy. But at the same time, we must ensure that each and every patient in the state must get immediate medical service. Any laxity at any level towards this will be intolerable.”The two primary ambulance services – 102 (delivery of pregnant women) and 108 (emergency services) had come to a grinding halt since July 25-26 midnight, as workers went on a flash strike in wake of a change in the company that operates the advanced life support system (ALS) ambulances. So far, GVK EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute) was operating advanced life support system (ALS), 108, and 102 ambulance services in the state.

They are also used for hair transplant outside India.The quantity of stolen hair, naturally lost by women, is said to be ten quintals, and it was collected in a year from women in villages of Madhya Pradesh but went missing from Shipra Express on Tuesday, a railway police official said.“This is quite unusual that hairs have been stolen because theft of any product is rare in Railways. We are investigating the matter as the parcel was loaded safely from Indore and it is hard to locate where it was unloaded. We have also informed the Howrah parcel officer to check with railway officials present in the train,” Indore railways public relation officer Khemraj Meena said.The agents who collect hairs from rural areas to sell it to businessmen in West Bengal’s Midnapore for further processing and manufacturing of wigs and hair extensions, said they will go bankrupt if the parcels were not found.According to these agents, the hair collection business is worth ₹one crore annually and hair collection agents in villages earn up to ₹1000 for a kilogram of hair depending on its length as longer hair fetches better price with women earning ₹200 for 100 gm of their hair.Hair collection agent Sunil Ashok Ghumarkar said, “It took one year for me to collect 10 quintals of hairs with the help of some daily wagers from different villages of MP but I have lost it in the train.”He added that the collection of hairs was not an easy task as it can’t be collected from salons. “We have to collect the hairs of women only and it must be minimum 8 inches in length. We wash it and segregate it according to size which goes up to 14 inches. We make separate packets according to size before supplying it to businessmen in Midnapore.”The hairs are made into wigs and hair extensions before the finished product is exported, said Ajeet Dehra, a Midnapore based businessman.“Due to changes in lifestyle and hair fall problem, the demand for hair extensions and wigs has increased by 20% in the past five years. We use 10 to 20% wigs and hair extensions for the local market and the rest is supplied to China and Bangladesh,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/10-quintal-of-women-hair-collected-from-mp-villages-stolen-from-train-says-police-101627495909542.html

A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued the notice and asked the Delhi government to file reply to the petition which also sought to quash a provision in the new excise policy which mandates only private liquor vends will be able to sell alcohol in Delhi.The court listed the plea for further hearing on September 17. The plea by NGO All India Bhrashtachar Virodhi Morcha said a lot of people feel that reducing the age of consumption of liquor will increase alcoholism among students and the younger generation, and lead to other consequent problems. It added that the decision to close government vends is not in public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plea-challenges-move-to-reduce-legal-drinking-age-in-delhi-101627495608813.html
28-07-2021||Gurugram||City marks five years of Gurujam with similar woes||Residents woke up to flooded roads and water overflow inside housing societies as 91.8mm rainfall wreaked havoc in the city on Wednesday morning, with several areas expected to be waterlogged till midnight.This was the second consecutive day that waterlogging was reported due to rainfall. However, the intensity was much higher in comparison on Wednesday, as only 18.6mm of rainfall was recorded on Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).According to IMD Chandigarh, Gurugram recorded 12.8mm rainfall between 8.30am on Tuesday and 8.30am on Wednesday, and 91.8mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Wednesday.The day also marked the fifth anniversary of the infamous “Gurujam” incident of 2016 when commuters were stuck on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway for nearly two days and a rainfall of 52mm was enough to flood all arterial roads, inundate houses, and wash away the moniker of “Millennium City.”On Wednesday, three underpasses, two at Rajiv Chowk and one at Hero Honda Chowk, were temporarily shut while key stretches, such as Sheetla Mata Road and Hamilton Court Road, were barricaded.At least 16 teams of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were deployed on the ground with the necessary machinery to implement counter-waterlogging measures.Pardeep Kumar, the chief engineer of GMDA, said that rainwater was cleared from 90% of the city by 6pm, three hours after it stopped raining.“The city received nearly 100mm of rainfall, which is considered to be in the heavy category. In the high-lying areas of the city, rainwater was cleared within two hours, while in the low-lying areas, it took around three hours,” said Kumar.Kumar said that work on clearing rainwater from Iffco Chowk Road and CH Bakhtawar Singh Road was still ongoing, at the time of filing the report. Also, Narsinghpur, sectors 9A, 21, 22, and 23, which are considered to be the lowest points in the city, were waterlogged, with officials saying that rainwater will recede once the load on the drainage lines reduces.“All three-leg master drains have been running at full capacity since the afternoon. Rainwater in the aforementioned low-lying areas will recede when there is an outlet for it. We are anticipating them to be cleared by 10pm,” said Kumar.Kumar said that in Narsinghpur, where the service lanes of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway were flooded, eight motor pumps were being used to drain out rainwater and that work is expected to finish in the early hours of Thursday, after midnight.As many as 250 police personnel were deployed at the city’s 12 underpasses. Between noon and 1pm, traffic police closed two underpasses at Rajiv Chowk and one at Hero Honda Chowk for a short duration as a precautionary measure, due to rainwater accumulation.“We did not want to take any chances and did not want any motorist or commuter to get stranded inside the underpasses. We closed the three underpasses for 15-30 minutes, and opened them after 1pm, when the intensity of the rain had reduced,” a senior traffic police official, who did not wish to be named, said.Of the cumulative strength of 6,312 police personnel, 4,500 were deployed on waterlogging duties, with hourly reports sent to the police commissioner.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that teams were deployed at 38 waterlogging-prone spots in advance. “The teams were well prepared. We had kept cranes ready near all the underpasses and stretches, with 14 vehicles having to be towed during the day. Officials were directed to keep a close watch on traffic and assist those stranded. The most challenging stretches were Sheetla Mata Road, Sohna Road, Basai Road, those in sectors 10, 17 and 38, Sushant Lok-1, IMT Chowk, Narsingpur and Dwarka Expressway,” said Rao.Despite heavy police deployment, Ambedkar Road, MDI Chowk, Narsinghpur, Mayfield Garden, Nathupur, Hamilton Court Road, Tikri exit, Dhankot, Jwala Mill Road, Udyog Vihar, sector 4/7/9 traffic signal, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, Kapashera border, Iffco Chowk, IMT Chowk, and Basai Road were all inundated, resulting in traffic snarls.The traffic police issued alerts on social media cautioning commuters to avoid waterlogged areas.CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, Narsinghpur, Sheetla Mata Road, MF Husain Marg and Hamilton Court Road were the worst-hit stretches, with commuters taking nearly 20-45 minutes to cross them.Harshit Shukla, a resident of Sector 50, said, “It took me nearly an hour to reach the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway from my house. The underpass near Medanta hospital was closed, while the CH Bakhtawar Singh Road was flooded with knee-deep water. Wrong-side driving was rampant and many vehicles had broken down. It was complete chaos.”A section of the Sheetla Mata Road was closed for several hours on Wednesday due to heavy rainwater accumulation while on Hamilton Court Road, the road leading towards Cross Point Mall and camera museum was closed by MCG officials as rainwater had entered many people’s houses.Roads in residential areas of MG Road, Sushant Lok-1, South City-2, sectors 3, 5 and 6, and Suncity, among others, were also rendered unusable as water accumulated to a waist-high level and entered residences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-marks-five-years-of-gurujam-with-similar-woes-101627495253075.html
28-07-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Second dose Sputnik V inoculations to start from July 31||The second dose of the Sputnik V vaccine will be available at the Sector 31 polyclinic from July 31, almost 21 days after the first shot of the vaccine was administered at the government centre. The district health department received a stock of around 4,800 doses for the second dose drive on Wednesday.Gurugram is the only district in Haryana to conduct Sputnik V vaccinations at a government health centre and private hospitals.“Only those people who have taken their first shot of Sputnik V at the polyclinic will be eligible to take their second shot at the same government facility from July 31 based on the date mentioned on their vaccination certificate. People who have taken their first dose in a private hospital will not be given a second shot of Sputnik V at the polyclinic,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.The Sputnik V inoculations at the polyclinic started on July 10 under corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes, with vaccines procured from Dr Reddy’s Lab that has been importing the shots from Russia. The second dose of the vaccine has to be taken 21 days after the first shot. Till now, roughly 1,835 first doses of Sputnik V have been administered at the polyclinic.According to the Co-WIN portal dashboard, 16,697 doses of Sputnik V were administered in the district till Wednesday as three private hospitals, Fortis, Narayana and Medanta. As per the government’s guidelines, the price of Sputnik V is capped at ₹1,145.It is the third vaccine approved by the Centre to combat the coronavirus infection. The vaccine was developed by The Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia in 2020, and it shows over 91.6% efficacy against Covid-19. The vaccine has to be kept at -20° C to -25° C. It has to be kept outside for 15-20 minutes before it is administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-second-dose-sputnik-v-inoculations-to-start-from-july-31-101627495250861.html
28-07-2021||Gurugram||U-turn underpass at Sirhaul border likely to open on Independence Day: NHAI||A U-turn underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza, which has been a longstanding demand of commuters in the city, is likely to be opened on August 15, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said on Wednesday.Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, said that civic work on the underpass has been completed and finishing touches are being given to the structure. “The work of painting the inside of the underpass is going on. Lights are being installed and other such fixtures are getting fitted. If the monsoon remains normal then we will be opening the underpass for traffic on August 15,” said Mittal.The completion of the underpass on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway will allow commuters from Gurugram to take a U-turn to go towards Ambience Mall and DLF Phase 3 without having to travel up to Rajokri in Delhi.The original deadline for the completion of the Sirhaul underpass, which had started on March 5, 2019, was September 4 last year. The project was delayed due to a ban on construction imposed by the Supreme Court in November 2019 to curb air pollution. Last year, the three-month lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic also affected the progress of the work, said officials.Mittal said that measures to counter waterlogging have also been taken, with the construction of catch drains on both sides of the underpass. “The location of the underpass is such that heavy waterlogging does not take place here, but still, we have taken adequate measures,” he said.However, a four-foot patch of the main carriageway of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway caved in last Tuesday (July 20) morning due to heavy rainwater accumulation inside the under-construction underpass. The NHAI officials had then said that a high volume of rainwater accumulated inside the underpass and without a concrete slab on top of a 15-metre portion, the water came in contact with the exposed road surface, leading to the cave-in.In a report by HT dated July 20, an official working for the contractor undertaking the project had said that rainwater accumulation in the underpass is a common occurrence and it usually drains out. However, due to the high-intensity rain, it would take 24 hours to pump out the water with a 15-horsepower motor pump provided there is no further rainfall, the official had said.NHAI officials said that the underpass is 14 metres wide and the height of the tunnel is 5.5 metres. Energy-saving LED lights of 75 watts have been installed and signage and dividers have been constructed, as per the highway norms.The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres, while the entire stretch, including access roads, is 1.5 kilometres. The service roads are 559 metres long and 7 metres wide. Commuters have been set a speed limit of 40kmph in the underpass.A flyover at Shankar Chowk, which opened last year, was also built as part of this project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/uturn-underpass-at-sirhaul-border-likely-to-open-on-independence-day-nhai-101627495249541.html
28-07-2021||Gurugram||Sheetla Mata Road partially shut due to waterlogging, traffic thrown out of gear||The Sheetla Mata Road was partially shut by the traffic police on Wednesday morning due to heavy waterlogging following a spell of rain, which threw traffic out of gear on nearby roads and left residents stranded in their homes. According to the police, their control room received 316 calls about waterlogging on Wednesday, of which 89 calls were regarding the inundation of Sheetla Mata Road. Commuters and residents complained that they were facing issues in crossing the five-kilometre stretch and that the diversions nearly tripled their commute time. Sheetla Mata Road is one of the oldest in the city that connects residents with other major roads of Lt Atul Kataria Marg, Caterpuri Road, Ambedkar Road, and Bus stand Road. Due to the presence of a temple, there is heavy footfall on the road with around 5,000 people visiting the shrine (pre-Covid) every day that goes up to around 15,000 visitors during the Navratri festival. On Wednesday, the Sheetla Mata Road was filled with waist-high rainwater throughout the stretch. Pedestrians held hands and formed human chains as they navigated the stretch, to avoid being swept away or avoid falling into an open drain.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that six teams were deployed on the stretch. “Unlike July 19, the situation was controlled as soon as the rain started pouring on Wednesday morning. We barricaded the entry and exit points of waterlogged stretches and diverted traffic through other routes. We had also informed civic agencies to be ready with motor pumps. All teams acted swiftly and managed the situation by the afternoon,” he said. On July 19, the Sheetla Mata Road was one of the worst-affected stretches in the city, with additional pumps being requested by the traffic police to drain rainwater as it did not recede even a day after the rainfall. On Wednesday, hundreds of commuters, especially those travelling on the stretch from Sector 5, were stopped from entering the stretch till 4pm due to the high water level. Pawan Sapra, a resident of Sector 5, said, “It took me more than an hour to travel through the diverted routes and reach my destination. Despite heavy police presence, traffic management was pathetic. I regret moving to this area.” Dinesh Vashishta, the president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of sectors 3, 5 and 6, said that despite repeated complaints to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), there has been no resolution.“The water enters our sectors through Gurugram village and Sheetla Mata Road. Our basements are completely inundated. Residents have suffered huge losses as their household and electrical appliances have been damaged. Moreover, their life is at risk due to risk of electrocution and problems arising from water-borne diseases,” said Vashishta. A resident of Sector 3, who is also a daily commuter, said that he was stuck last week on the stretch during rainfall. “I avoided travelling through the stretch near the shrine as I had to abandon my two-wheeler and walk home last week. Despite avoiding the stretch, I was stuck once again, due to road diversions. The diverted routes were heavily congested and it took me nearly 20-25 minutes to cross the area,” said Mithlesh, a resident of Sector 3. After last week’s rains, traffic police had written to the MCG requesting it to install more motor pumps on the stretch, while the MCG initiated an internal probe regarding the effectiveness of the motor pumps. At present, the MCG has installed two tractor-mounted high-capacity motor pumps to divert rainwater towards a natural pond located on the temple premises. “Using two high-powered tractor-mounted motor pumps, we diverted the excess rainwater towards a natural pond located inside the Sheeta Mata Devi shrine complex. The pumps had been placed in the morning. However, they were only connected by 3pm. By 5.30 pm, all rainwater was cleared from the stretch and channelled to the pond,” said Jitender Kumar Garg, joint commissioner of MCG. Garg said that the high-capacity motor pumps will be permanently placed on the road. Besides reducing waterlogging, the diversion to the pond will also help in recharging the groundwater table, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sheetla-mata-road-partially-shut-due-to-waterlogging-traffic-thrown-out-of-gear-101627495010579.html
28-07-2021||Gurugram||Arterial stretches flooded, residents marooned in condos, societies||A heavy spell of rain on Wednesday morning did not just impact underpasses and major roads but also left several arterial roads and low-lying areas underwater. Stretches leading to Galleria Market, MG Road, Sushant Lok-1, South City-2, sectors 3, 5 and 6, and Suncity, among others, were rendered unusable as water accumulated to a waist-high level and started entering residences.The flooding of arterial and internal roads has been a regular occurrence this year. Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) attributed this to a change in monsoon preparedness plans caused by the second Covid-19 wave.Opposite the Galleria Market in DLF Phase 4, a stretch leading towards the camera museum was cordoned off completely due to heavy waterlogging. MCG workers blocked the entrance to the stretch, located on an incline, with sandbags and mud, as rainwater from the Hamilton Court Road flowed towards the lower-lying areas of DLF Phase 4, Sector 28 and Chakkarpur village.With the help of tractor-mounted motor pumps, MCG workers channelled the rainwater from the camera museum stretch to the Hamilton Court, and directed it towards the nearest drain outlet.“Before the path to the sector was blocked by MCG workers, rainwater entered several ground-floor houses nearby and the level of rainwater kept rising. Our entire furniture was soaked and so were a few electrical appliances. We kept draining out rainwater from our home, with mops and buckets, but the water level was too much to handle,” said Mohit Saini, a resident of Sector 28.Residents of Suncity, South City-2 and Sushant Lok-1 also complained of waterlogging in residences.“By noon, such was the extent of waterlogging inside my house that I had to shift my elderly parents to a relative’s house nearby. I had to turn off the main power, fearing electrocution, and voluntarily stayed without power for nearly three hours. From 2pm, once the moderate rains were reduced to a drizzle, the rainwater started to recede. It was only around 4pm that I was able to completely clear rainwater from my home,” said Sidhant Chawla, a resident of South City-2.On the Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road, the entrance to Essel Towers was completely flooded residents, restricting residents to their homes.“The entrance of our colony is located on a slope. All the rainwater from the direction of Iffco Chowk and MG Road Metro station started flowing towards it due to which there is persistently high accumulation of rainwater. A truck tried to make its way to the colony but stalled midway due to the rainwater. Until motor pumps were able to drain out rainwater by later afternoon, I was stuck at home,” said Manish Sinha, a resident of the condominium.Sinha said although the entrance was flooded sporadically during previous monsoons, it has become a regular occurrence this year.MCG officials said that this year, waterlogging on arterial roads has been more severe than usual due to a change in their monsoon preparedness strategy.“Till May-end, MCG workers were all caught up with the second Covid-19 wave. At the time, the monsoon was forecast to hit the city by June 12. Our priority was, hence, to clean up drains and set up temporary counter waterlogging measures at stretches that have a high volume of traffic. We prioritised high-density stretches rather than internal residential areas due to the short time period,” a senior MCG official, who did not wish to be named, said.The official cited above said that although monsoon only arrived in the city over two weeks ago, the uncertainty with its timeline meant that the MCG did not alter its strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/arterial-stretches-flooded-residents-marooned-in-condos-societies-101627495009550.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government slashes school fees by 15%||In a major relief to parents and guardians, the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to slash private school fees for the current academic year by 15%. The decision, according to school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, was on the lines of the Supreme Court’s (SC) order for the reduction of fees for schools in Rajasthan. Earlier this week, the Apex court had asked the Maharashtra government to consider its May judgement to collect 15% less school fees.Parents’ bodies had been demanding some relief from the state government in terms of slashing school fees, given the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Schools in the state continue to remain closed amid the pandemic and the fear of a possible third Covid wave.“The state cabinet has decided to cut school fees by 15%. The criteria adopted by the state are on the lines of the Supreme Court’s order for Rajasthan. The decision will apply to all boards. We will issue an order in the next two to three days. Parents will have to pay only 85% of the fees for this academic year. The decision will come as a relief to parents and even students. The SC had also asked the state government to consider a cut in fees, therefore, today we have made this decision,” said Gaikwad.Dispelling the doubts that school managements, anticipating a move by the government to cut fees, could have hiked the fees for this year, the minister said that many schools have not hiked fees considering the Covid-19 scenario. Gaikwad also said that the state will take action against school management if they do not adhere to the truncated fee. “Once the cabinet has taken a decision, we will share with the honourable Supreme Court. Even then if any school management does not adhere to it, then we will take action against them. The government order will cover various issues and intricacies to avoid any confusion among parents and school management,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-slashes-school-fees-by-15-101627494168696.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 6,857 new cases; weekly positivity rates falls to 3.80%||Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate has dropped to 3.8% from last week’s 4.36%, indicating a declining trend of the second Covid-19 wave. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate should remain below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control.Maharashtra currently has 10 districts that have positivity rates above the state average of 3.80%. These include Satara (8.03%), Pune (7.23%), Kolhapur (7.18%), Sangli (6.91%), Sindhudurg (6.49 %), Solapur (5.90%), Ahmednagar (4.95%), Beed (4.88%), Raigad (4.70%) and Ratnagiri (3.83%). This means currently just six out of the 10 districts have a positivity rate of more than 5%. Last week, nine of the 10 districts had a positivity rate of more than 5%.Meanwhile, the state on Wednesday recorded 6,857 new cases with 286 deaths. The state’s Covid tally has reached 6,282,914, while the death toll stands at 132,145.There were 193,042 tests done on Wednesday and the number of recoveries clocked 6,105. There are currently 82,545 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 15,768 patients followed by Thane with 9,587 active patients. Mumbai recorded 403 new cases and 10 deaths, thus bringing its toll to 15,860.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the weekly average rate of less than 5% itself indicates the waning of the second Covid-19 wave. “We ramped up medical infrastructure and also started mass vaccination, which played an important role in controlling the virus. However, some districts like Satara, Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli and Sindhudurg are still matters of concern for the state,” said Dr Awate.Dr Satyendra Nath Mehra, medical director, Masina Hospital, Byculla, said that the pace of vaccination should be increased in these hotspots. “The government needs to speed up vaccination as well as strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour in these districts,” said Dr Mehra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-6-857-new-cases-weekly-positivity-rates-falls-to-380-101627494108727.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Second wave saw at least four Covid-19 deaths in 0-9 age group in Mumbai: Hospitals||The city has recorded at least four deaths in the 0-9 age group due to Covid-19 this year. Civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recorded three infant deaths, while SRCC Children’s Hospital recorded one death. Covid pneumonia, wherein the infection inflames the lungs, has been seen as the most common cause of death. However, these deaths are yet to reflect in the official data of the civic body. According to the age-wise mortality numbers obtained by Hindustan Times, the civic body has recorded zero deaths in the 0-9 age group between January to July 15 this year. “We did see deaths in the 0-9 age group during the first wave, but we have not recorded any deaths this year so far,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “It could be that the review of deaths recorded by these hospitals revealed that the cause was not Covid-19,” he said. The civic body has recorded as many as 13,185 cases in the 0-9 age group since March 2020. Last year, there were 18 deaths in this age group, as per the civic body data. According to Dr Soonu Udani, medical director of SRCC Children’s Hospital, they recorded the death of an 18-day-old baby in May this year. “The baby had severe pneumonia. As per protocol, we have mentioned the cause of death as Çovid-19 pneumonia on the death certificate too,” said Udani, adding that the facility has recorded only one other death in the paediatric age group, that of a 15-year-old who had multiple comorbid conditions including obesity. She said that the number of paediatric patients went up during the peak in April. But cases have now reduced drastically. BYL Nair Hospital’s paediatric head Dr Sushma Malik said that at least one of the three infants who succumbed this year had developed the multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a serious complication of Covid-19 that affects organs and systems in the body. The hospital has also seen death of an 11-year-old child. “While any mortality is a concern, we have not seen a severe impact of Covid-19 on children,” said Malik. Some experts predict that the anticipated third wave may affect children badly, as they will be vulnerable without vaccine. However, there is another section of experts who believe that the third wave may not severely impact children. The civic body has started preparations to manage the anticipated paediatric surge by equipping jumbo hospitals with paediatric beds and intensive care units. A state-level task force has also been formed to steer the actions required to manage the under-18 population. Talks of rolling out vaccination for children between 12 to 18 years are also on at the centre. Clinical trials are underway with at least two vaccines for children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-wave-saw-at-least-four-covid-19-deaths-in-0-9-age-group-in-mumbai-hospitals-101627493988681.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university revokes circular, marks of law students from August 2020 valid||Less than a month after the University of Mumbai (MU) released circular nullifying results of law students that were based on average scores and internal assessment last year, the MU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BoEE) on Wednesday released another circular reinstating the old marks. The university had announced to scrap the results of students from three year and five-year law courses in August 2020, based on a Bar Council of India (BCI) directive, making end of semester exams mandatory in order to promote students. “Since we were promoted last year based on an average score of previous semesters and our performance in the current semester, the university had called for the scrapping of our results. They asked all colleges to conduct assignment-based evaluation (ABE) and announce results accordingly. The HC on Wednesday clarified that the BCI directives don’t apply to results announced before the directives were released,” said Vikram Pandey, a final year law student.Last year, due to increasing Covid-19 cases and the eventual lockdown, all university students (except final semester students) were promoted to the next semester based on their performance in that semester. Results for semesters 2 and 4 of the three-year LLB course and semesters 2, 4, 6 and 8 of the five-year LLB course we’re announced based on the average scores of previous semesters and internal assessment marks. These results were announced in August 2020 and several of these students have already cleared the semester after that and are currently in their final semester of the course. On July 5 this year, law students were in for a shock after the university released a circular nullifying the August 2020 results and directed colleges to hold ABE as per a set schedule, in order to declare results once again. Students were asked to submit two assignments in each subject for 50 marks, and the scores obtained would have been extrapolated to the scale of 60 or 100, whichever applicable. Students raised this matter in the Bombay HC and a final decision came through on Wednesday.“The university announced results of summer 2020 examination, in accordance with the University Grants Commission (UGC) directives of giving marks based on previous semesters and internal assessment. The BCI in its circular from July 9 made the end of term exams mandatory, forcing the university to scrap August 2020 results,” said a statement released by the BoEE director, Vinod Patil. He added that as per the HC decision, the ABE schedule announced on July 5 stands withdrawn and results of intermediate semesters declared in the first half of 2020 announced in August 2020 stand restored.“This decision restores our faith in the judiciary. Expecting students to put their studies for the current semester on hold and complete assignments for the last academic year would have been unfair. We are happy the judiciary understood our plight,” said another student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-revokes-circular-marks-of-law-students-from-august-2020-valid-101627493928624.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to get 6 new DNA testing units to expedite probe in Pocso cases||To speed up the investigations, trials and outcomes of cases involving sexual assault and crimes against minors, the Maharashtra government will soon have dedicated DNA units to analyse the evidence in six regional forensic science laboratories in the state.A senior official from the Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories (DSFL) said that these units in the regional forensic science laboratories at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, would be launched within a month. Those at the Nashik, Aurangabad and Amravati are likely to be operational in August-September after seeking necessary permissions from the state government.“There is a substantial backlog of cases that are pending DNA testing at our labs. These new genetic analysers will be used only for the cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012. This will enhance DNA extraction, testing and generation of forensic evidence,” the official explained.Sandeep Bishnoi, director general of police (legal and technical), confirmed the development and said that these specialised units would quicken the criminal jurisprudence process in offences registered under the Pocso Act.Maharashtra has a state-level forensic science laboratory in Mumbai and seven others across the state (Nagpur, Pune, Nashik, Amravati, Nanded, Kolhapur and Aurangabad). DNA testing facilities are available at Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Amravati and Aurangabad.At present, the DFSL has around 6,500 cases pending for DNA analysis, of which, around 1,100 pertain to offences registered under the Pocso Act.Though it takes around three days to analyse a DNA sample, the large number of cases pending for forensic testing ensure that the reports can take up to three or even six months in some instances. However, these new genetic analysers, which will be ring-fenced for testing only those cases related to crimes against minors, will bring down the time taken to just around a month.The analysers and other equipment are purchased with a fund of ₹53.70 crore, granted by the Central government to the state, to strengthen its forensic infrastructure.The number of cases sent for DNA testing to the regional forensic science laboratories has risen from 5,113 in 2017, to 6,259 in 2018, 7,540 in 2019, 6,314 in 2020 and 3,823 in July 2021. These include cases of murder, unclaimed dead bodies, dacoity, attempt to murder, sexual assault and paternity. DNA analysis is also used to establish the identity of bodies that have been mutilated in mishaps and disasters.BOX:- The DNA division generates forensic evidence for the investigation of offences like sexual assault, murder and unclaimed and mutilated dead bodies and to establish paternity.- However, factors like shortage of staff and a rise in the number of cases sent for analysis have led to the number of pending cases increasing from around 3,300 in 2019 to 5,400 in 2020 and 5,700 in July 2021.- The cases registered under the Pocso Act that were sent for forensic analysis have grown from 1,914 in 2018 to 1,974 in 2019 and 935 by July this year.- The offences lodged under the Pocso Act that is pending DNA testing have also risen from about 900 in 2018, to 1,200 in 2019 and stand at 1,100 in July this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-get-6-new-dna-testing-units-to-expedite-probe-in-pocso-cases-101627493868709.html

The state assured the court that it would consider the possibility of complying with the HC suggestion and respond by August 4. The court directed students from other boards to register for the CET as well. The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice RI Chagla, while hearing the petition by ICSE student Ananya Patki, a student of IES Orion School, Dadar, was informed by her father advocate Yogesh Patki that the petition sought quashing of the May 28 notification of the state government which stipulated that admissions to Class 11 would be based on CET results, the question paper of which would be based solely on the syllabus of SSC board.Advocate Patki told the HC that after the syllabus for the CET was notified on June 24 it was felt that there was alleged discrimination against the 4 lakh students from the ICSE and CBSE students. He added that as his daughter would not be able to appear through the offline mode, her interest would be heavily prejudiced. In light of this, Patki, sought a stay on the May 28 notification. On July 22, the Court had sought to know from the state whether there could be a separate syllabus for CBSE and ICSE students appearing for CET for Class 11 admissions and also asked the state that if such separate syllabus could not be prepared, the priority for admissions given to students who appear for CET could be withdrawn. The court had also sought data on the number of students who registered for the CET offline test. However, on Wednesday, the government pleader Purnima Kantharia submitted that the SSC board could not venture into the syllabus of ICSE or CBSE and other boards to prepare the CET admission test based on it. She added that as the registration website had crashed, the process could not be completed till July 26 and hence it was extended by three days. In light of this, the data sought by the court could not be furnished. After hearing the submissions the court said, “You (state) can form a committee consisting of all three boards so that there will be options. If there is an attempt to eliminate students from certain boards, then that is not a solution. How can ICSE or CBSE board students answer the Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on topics which are optional subjects for them?” The court also suggested having some part of the ICSE, CBSE and other board syllabus as part of the CET examination.The bench while asking students from all boards to register themselves for the CET, said that their contentions would not be prejudiced and posted hearing on August 4. The bench then asked the state to file its reply to the suggestions and said that no further adjournments would be allowed. The court also allowed the addition of the IB and IGCSE board as parties to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/consider-committee-of-all-boards-for-preparing-cet-paper-bombay-hc-101627493808616.html

Why does the central government want to deprive 70 per cent of the population of the backward/most backward people of their rights? Does BJP not consider 70 per cent of the population as Hindus?," said Tejashwi Yadav in a tweet roughly translated from Hindi.Earlier on Saturday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reiterated his demand for a caste-based census in the state at least once, saying it will help in the development and welfare of people in the state."We have already kept our thoughts about the caste-based census in the House in February 2019 and 2020.

However, now with the floods affecting these same districts , health infrastructure has also faced the brunt. The testing and reporting of Covid-19 cases has been hampered and areas flooded with water have also seen a fall in vaccinations. However, with the forced isolation of people due to the floods there could be a possible fall in numbers visible after 10-15 days, say experts. As of Wednesday, the overall positivity rate is higher than the state average in Kolhapur, Pune, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Satara and Sindhudurg. Most of these district also include the ones that saw the highest amount of rainfall in the past few days. Dr Sanghmitra Phule, civil surgeon at Ratnagiri, which saw massive rainfall in the district especially in Chiplun, said, “The testing and vaccination surely affected a few blocks, but only those that were submerged under water. Even in the relief camps we did carry out testing and anyone found positive was immediately isolated. However, even before the floods hit our district, we had carried out extensive Covid-19 testing in the most affected blocks, including Chiplun.” Satara also saw heavy rains. Mahabaleshwar which recorded its highest recorded rainfall in 24 hours also saw Covid-19 testing hampered. Dr Sachin Patil, district health officer, said, “Not all the areas in the district were hampered, however, we did have testing centres in some districts, where there was heavy rainfall, hampered. However, the impact of whether or not the isolation of people due to floods has brought down the spread of infection will be evident in the next 10-15 days, which is the period of incubation in case of Covid-19. Now it would be too early to report any trends in case of the impact of floods in the district.”In view of the hampered vaccination drive in the flood-affected districts, the state government has sent vaccines to Ratnagiri, Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara and Raigad. Dr Vivek Patil, the district immunisation officer in Sangli, said that they have received the latest vaccine stock today. “On Monday, Sangli district received over 65,000 doses of the vaccine and on Wednesday, district received over 78,000 doses of the vaccine. The vaccination drive, which was impacted in some districts, will resume soon. We even vaccinated people in the temporary shelters and prioritised those who came from these villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-vax-drives-affected-in-flood-hit-districts-101627492068519.html

This comes after crocodiles were spotted in some residential localities as the flood waters receded on Tuesday. The floods triggered by heavy rains hit Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara, inundating several areas of these districts. Later, as the rain ebbed and water levels in villages along the banks of the Krishna river began to recede, crocodiles were spotted on some roads, in drains, and even on roofs of houses, triggering panic among people. According to forest officials, crocodiles inhabit a 60-70 km river stretch, passing through around 15 villages, including Bhilwadi, Malwadi, Digraj, Audumbarwadi, Chopadewadi and Brahmnal. In the past, there have been incidents of human-animal conflicts in some of these areas. “During the recent heavy rains, crocodiles were swept away along with the flood waters into some villages,” P G Sutar, regional forest officer, Sangli range, said. “In one case, a crocodile was spotted on the roof of a house, but the animal later returned to the river along with the flow of water,” he said. Vijay Mane, deputy conservator of forest (Sangli), said the forest department has now set up six centres near some flood-hit areas of Sangli city, Kavthe Mahakal, Palus, Kadegaon, Walwa and part of Tasgaon, to rescue crocodiles. At these rescue centres, teams comprising forest officials, guards and members from NGOs working for wildlife conservation will respond to calls of the presence of crocodiles, snakes, injured birds and other wild animals in human habitats, he said. “We have circulated a toll-free helpline number (1926) and personal numbers of forest officials and NGO members. If someone calls to inform about the presence of a crocodile or any other wild animal, the team from the nearest centre will go there, rescue the animal and initiate a process to release it into its natural habitat,” the official said. The objective of these rescue centres is to prevent any harm to the wild animals and minimise incidents of human-animal conflict, he added. Tabreg Khan, a member of the NGO Nature Conservation Society in Sangli, claimed the natural habitat of crocodiles along the Krishna river has been destroyed due to indiscriminate sand excavation. “Now, during floods, the animals easily get swept away towards villages,” he rued, and appealed to people not to harm crocodiles and inform the forest department and NGOs if they spot a reptile in their area. Amol Jadhav, another member of the NGO, asked people not to panic. He also said several videos of crocodiles venturing into villages were doing the rounds, but most of them were either of the 2019 floods in Sangli, or in other parts of the country.

The tradition started in 1972 after Charu Majumdar, founder of Maoist movement in the country, died in police custody in West Bengal. According to the posters, at least 160 Maoists have been killed over last 12 months in eight Maoist-affected states. Police informed the high alert has been sounded after intelligence reports suggested that the ultras might attack Maoist areas and indulge in demonstrative acts of violence by targeting security forces and infrastructure such as trains, buses, railway stations, bus stations and other places, where people are likely to gather in significant numbers. Officials in police headquarters said apart from ensuring deployment of additional police and paramilitary forces, the combing operations and patrolling has been intensified to check possibility of entry of Maoists from neighbouring states.

Together, the three oxygen plants will have a capacity to generate up to 2,233 litres per minute of oxygen. These plants, along with the cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks, are expected to be commissioned by end of August.The institute allocated a fresh area on its campus to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Monday to set up two oxygen generation plants after the space earmarked earlier was found to be low-lying. The two oxygen generation plants are being set up under the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situation (PM CARES) fund. Each plant will have a capacity to generate 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) oxygen, said Shailendra Kumar Singh, superintending engineer (biomedical), IGIMS. Earlier, the institute had on July 18 commissioned its first 233 LPM oxygen generation plant, facilitated through Patna MP and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. “We have spoken to the authorities in the DRDO and requested them to expedite installation of the two oxygen generation plants. We expect them to be ready within a month,” said IGIMS director Dr NR Biswas. “Besides, one of the two cryogenic tanks of liquid medical oxygen (LMO), each having 20-kilo litre capacity, has been installed. Civil work on the laying of the pipeline is now underway. We expect all oxygen-related work to be complete within a month,” added Dr Biswas. The IGIMS, which has 1,050 in-patient beds, with plans to scale it up by another 1,900 beds, has also put up its 20-kilo litre cryogenic LMO tank and work on laying the pipeline is underway. “One 20 kilo-litre LMO tank is equivalent to 2,250 D-type cylinders, each having 7,000 litres (approx.) oxygen. We will have three such tanks on our campus, in addition to three PSA oxygen generation plants, making us self-sufficient in medical oxygen,” said Singh. In anticipation of the third wave of Covid-19, one tank each of 20 kilo-litre LMO has also been set up at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) and the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), both in Patna. The Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) will be taken up after installation work at the IGIMS is completed, said a health official. While PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS and DMCH will have two cryogenic LMO tanks each of 20-kilo litre storage capacity, the remaining six state-run medical colleges will have one such tank.

Simdega, Koderma and Ramgarh are out of that list.”The districts which continue to be on the list are Bokaro, Chatra, Dhanbad, Dumka, East Singhbhum (Jamshedpur), Garhwa, Giridih, Gumla, Hazaribag, Khunti, Latehar, Lohardaga, Palamu, Ranchi, Seraikela-Kharsawan and West Singhbhum (Chaibasa). The list is revised by the Union home ministry based on the number of Maoist incidents in the districts over last three years, officials said. As per data provided by the Union home ministry in reply to a question in the Parliament, the number of incidents/activities related to Maoist violence witnessed a marginal dip in Jharkhand in the past three years. The number of deaths in the state in such incidents also recorded a decline in 2020 as compared to 2019. The total incidents stood at 205, 200 and 199 in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, while the death toll stood at 43, 54 and 39, respectively. While the development was a pat on the back of the state police, officials expressed apprehension that dropping the three districts from the list may have other repercussions with regard to anti-Maoist operation, as it would entail funds drying up provided by the Centre under security-related expenditure scheme. “Though the funds vary from district to district, depending on the number of operations conducted, it is of big help as it pays for expenditure such as hiring vehicles for patrolling, fuel expenditure, besides other expenditure related to strengthening of pickets and camps. Though alternative arrangements are made and operations do not stop, it does pose a risk of incidents picking up if patrolling and area domination goes down,” a police officer involved in anti-Maoist operations said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/mha-drops-3-j-khand-districts-out-of-lwe-hit-list-101627490628960.html

I will burn down those curtains. I dare those people to come out in the open,” Sahni said, while talking to reporters outside the state Assembly.“Some people are trying to mislead my party MLAs and split the party. But they won’t succeed. All my party MLAs are with me and they are free to put their views at the party forum,” he said. Sahni had earlier announced his party’s plans to contest the Uttar Pradesh polls next year and field over 150 candidates. On Sunday last, he was not allowed to go out of the airport in Varanasi to attend a programme to observe the death anniversary of bandit-turned-politician Phoolan Devi, who, like Sahni, was a Mallah, a community mainly of boatmen that has significant presence in eastern UP. Earlier this week, the VIP chief had skipped the NDA meeting called to discuss the House strategy for the ongoing monsoon session.NDA in Bihar has a slender majority in the 243-member Assembly and support of VIP is crucial for its survival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sahni-say-all-well-in-party-warns-those-behind-curtains-101627490568424.html

Singh was replying to a call attention motion of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member Arjun Sahni, who alleged that farmers were not getting the appropriate return to their produce in the absence of GI tag. A huge number of farmers in Mithila region are engaged in production of makhana (fox nuts) on water bodies and selling them to local traders for processing and supplying it to other states and abroad. The agriculture minister said that the Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour (Bhagalpur), has sent a formal application to accord GI tag to makhana as “Mithila Makhana” to the Geographical Indication Registry office in Chennai in September last year. “Officials are in touch with the registry office, which stated that the process was on to grant the GI tag to Makhana,” said Singh. The minister said both Central and state governments were encouraging farmers to grown high-yield varieties of makhana under various schemes. “Farmers engaged in production of high-yield varieties of makhanas are being offered credit-linked assistance grant up to 35% of up to ₹10 lakh under the scheme Makhana Vikas Yojna,” said Singh. PMC faces fireEarlier in the day, leaders cutting across the party lines lashed out at the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the urban development department for their alleged lackadaisical approach to make the capital city free from recurring waterlogging. Sanjay Prakash alias Sanjay Mayukh of BJP, Sanjiv Kumar Singh of Janata Dal United, Kedar Nath Pandey of CPI, Prem Chandra Mishra of Congress and Ram Chandra Purbe of RJD, through different questions, highlighted improper and inadequate drainage facilities and blamed recurring waterlogging in Patna on callous negligence on the part of agencies.Deputy chief minister Tar Kishore Prasad, who also holds the charge of urban development department, assured of action against agencies failing to repair the roads after building drains. Prasad said a comprehensive drainage plan was being made for seamless disposal of storm water to rid cities of waterlogging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pursuing-gi-tag-for-mithila-makhana-agri-minister-101627490508988.html
28-07-2021||Patna||BJP MLA raises demand for population control bill||Amid the ongoing difference of opinion between the JD(U) and the BJP on bringing legislation for population control, a calling attention motion was moved by BJP MLA Vijay Kumar Khemka in the Bihar Assembly on Wednesday, seeking the state government response on the need for implementing the two-child norm across all castes and communities as a measure to check population and environment conservation.Other party MLAs also said there is a need for checking population due to the pressure building on agricultural land, water and environment in the state and across the country. Khemka, in the motion, said a policy for checking the population would be essential for the next 50 years. The motion drew the attention of the government to the scarcity of natural resources due to population explosion and stressed the need for implementing the recommendations of the Karunakaran committee report, which proposed measures like disqualifying those with more than two children from contesting elections. However, the government sought time to give a reply to the call attention motion. Talking to reporters outside the Bihar Assembly, Khemka said, “We request the government to give serious consideration to a population control law. It is as important as having a law to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol.” Asked whether it was a strategy by the BJP, which now enjoys the upper hand in the NDA in Bihar, to nettle Nitish Kumar, Khemka replied, “It is not about the party. It is about the whole society.” Incidentally, the BJP’s latest bid to put a thrust on framing a policy for population control is at variance with its junior constituent JD(U), which has asserted that education of women and wide awareness could be the panacea to check population. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had recently disapproved the draft of the population control bill in Uttar Pradesh and other BJP-ruled states, stating that it is not possible to check population with a law. Kumar opined that raising public awareness and boosting women’s education could achieve the target better, as it has already worked in Bihar in the past..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bjp-mla-raises-demand-for-population-control-bill-101627490508357.html
28-07-2021||Patna||March 23 incident a blot on Bihar Assembly: Speaker||Bihar Legislative Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha on Wednesday said that the March 23 incident, when the House witnessed particularly unruly scenes during a debate on the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 and police had to be called in to evict the protesting Opposition members, was a blot on the legislature and every effort should be made to prevent such recurrence.He was speaking after a debate on the matter, as demanded by the Opposition. Parliamentary affairs minister and BJP leader Vijay Kumar Choudhary, however, said there was no relevance of a debate on the matter that was already referred to the ethics committee, but the Chair’s decision was final.Choudhary said the government had no role in the shameful incident that happened on March 23, as everything was done by the order of the Speaker in view of the ugly situation. “The government wants the House to run smoothly and that is why we are here as a mark of respect to the Chair, even though the government does not have to give any reply on an issue it is not responsible for. The government hopes the debate will put an end to it,” he said.Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav asked the Speaker by whose order the police entered the House to assault the legislators, the Speaker recited a couplet as to how slippers have to take all the blame if one trips even though it provides all protection.“March 23 incident was an insult of the House, not of the Chair or any individual. None of us can absolve ourselves. We all must strive to learn from it so that such a situation never recurs,” the Speaker said in his concluding remarks before adjourning the House.In his speech, Tejashwi said the Opposition’s role could not be undermined by use of force and spoke of how legislators, even female ones, were roughed up by policemen.Apprehending action against RJD legislators, he said if it were so, he should be the first to face action, but not before action against the erring policemen. Congress leader Ajeet Sharma and CPI-ML leader Mehboob Alam also supported his argument, demanding action against erring officers first.Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi said that while none could appreciate the incident, it was equally important to get to the root. “Protests and dharnas have happened in the past also, but I never came across such an incident in my 36-year career as legislator. The protests in the House are symbolic and marshals were always enough to clear the area in the past, as members respected the Chair and the rules and were committed to uphold the sanctity of the House. Let the ethics committee decide the matter and all should accept it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/march-23-incident-a-blot-on-bihar-assembly-speaker-101627490449016.html

The chief minister will review the Covid situation, post which, a decision on relaxations of existing curbs is likely to be taken. “As many as 11 districts, where the positivity rate is higher than the state average, will not see relaxations. The public health department relief and rehabilitation department has sent a file to the CM with suggestions on relaxations in the other 25 districts, where shops are open till 4 pm now. There is a need to relax curbs in these 25 districts. The decision will be made in two days. CM will take a final call,” said Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope in Mumbai, on Wednesday.The trader and business community in Pune are eagerly awaiting the decision regarding additional relaxations in Pune. Last week, after the Covid review meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had announced that there was consensus among the attendees to ease curbs in Pune and a decision would be made on Monday. Traders are demanding an extension of timings of all shops till 7pm from the existing 4pm. Business operators have also asked for some relaxations on weekends as well. “We have written multiple times to the administration regarding some relief. Timings of all the shops should be extended till 7pm on all days. Traders, shop owners and other business operators have become restless now. We were expecting a decision this Monday, but there were floods in some districts. So we can understand that. But, a definitive decision should be taken this week,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP). There are currently 2,488 active Covid patients in the city. The weekly positivity (July 22- July 28) rate is at 3.37% in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits. “Positivity rate in Pune has gone below 4%. So what is the problem now to ease some restrictions? On our level we will take all the precautions to follow the Covid norms,” said Pitaliya. The people’s representatives from Pune have supported the demand for relaxations. Muralidhar Mohol, mayor of Pune, also demanded extended timings for all services at the Covid review meeting. “In the city, all services should be allowed to remain open till 7pm on weekdays and till 5pm on weekends,” Mohol said. Like traders hoteliers are also demanding an extension of timings for restaurants. “Our main business is in the evening.

Locals rushed him to Dhanbad medical college, where doctors declared him brought dead. According to the police, they came into action after Anand’s family raised an alarm as he did not return home till 7 am. As police started looking for the missing judge, they got information of the accident case. When they reached the hospital, his driver identified the judge whose body was lying at the hospital. While initially the incident appeared as a routine accident, CCTV footage accessed by local media channels hinted at foul play, as an auto rickshaw is seen going out of its way to the extreme left of the road, and hitting the judge from behind before fleeing the spot. Suspecting foul play, the Dhanbad police said they are filing an FIR in this connection, and possible angles will be probed in the case. “I have constituted an SIT led by city SP who will look into all possible reasons. The CCTV footage and all related aspects will be analysed and identify the vehicle. We have requested the deceased’s family members to file a complaint and we will register an FIR,” said Dhanbad senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sanjeev Kumar. While the police said exact reason behind the suspected foul play will be clear only after investigation, the deceased judge had reportedly recently rejected bail plea of a noted shooter from Uttar Pradesh, who is in jail in a high profile murder case of Dhanbad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/dhanbad-judge-dies-in-road-accident-sit-to-probe-101627490388423.html

The PMC is likely to rethink using cement concrete patches to fill the potholes.Civic activists, citizens and opposition parties criticised the civic body over the pothole issue. With continuous rain over the last few days, almost all roads have developed potholes. The Congress party, on Wednesday, held an agitation on Tilak Road over the potholes. Congress leader Sanjay Balgude organised the agitation and Congress leader in the PMC, Aba Bagul, blamed a nexus between administration and contractors for the potholes. He said, “PMC is spending crores of rupees on roads and resurfacing. Potholes not only emerged on the roads which got dug up, but even on the roads which were constructed a few years ago.”Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “It is true that the potholes emerged, but we instructed the administration to clear it on war footing once the rains take a break. We need to rethink the cement patches used on the roads.”PMC road department head VJ Kulkarni said, “We already instructed the concerned engineers to visit the spots and chalk out a plan to clear the potholes. It’s not possible to clear the potholes in the rain. If we get a break of three or four days, the department will try to clear the potholes.”Civic activists Vivek Velankar and Qaneez Sukrani blamed the administration and contractors. They said that the resurfacing work was shabby and that the administration did not monitor the technical process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-rethink-use-of-cement-to-re-surface-roads-101627490208430.html

Yadav who is currently lodged in jail has been arrested on charges of plotting the murder of his rival Bablu Gawli by hiring two assassins to liquidate him. According to the Kondhwa police, Yadav was fired upon by Gawli during Ganesha celebrations in 2016 and he had been nursing revenge since then. He hired the services of a convict Rajan Rajmani who was currently out of Yerawada Central Jail on parole. Kondhwa police station incharge Sardar Patil confirmed that Yadav had been booked under MCOCA. According to the Kondhwa police, during investigation following the arrest of Yadav, it was revealed that he was involved in running an organised crime gang aimed at spreading terror in the society. The MCOCA proposal was sent to Zonal DCP Namrata Patil who vetted it and sent it to Addl CP Namdev Chavan for approval. Addl CP Chavan gave approval to the proposal and the gang has been accordingly booked under the act. ACP Rajendra Galande is investigating the case. Yadav was arrested from Gujarat-Rajasthan border and brought to Pune and the policemen submitted a list of cases against him when he was produced before cantonment court on seeking his custodial interrogation. The WhatsApp chats of arrested criminal Rajan Rajmani and Husain Shaik revealed that Yadav allegedly gave an ‘online supari’ (contract) to kill Gawli.

However, due to the flood situation in the state, colleges and their faculty were not able to complete the evaluation process given by the state education department to declare the results. As the Covid cases were on the rise, Class 12 and 10 board examinations were canceled this year by the state government. While the evaluation of marks for the students was set through a formula given by the government in which Class 10, 11 and 12 internal evaluation marks will be considered. According to the formula, 30 per cent each for Class 10 and 11 evaluation and 40 per cent for Class 12 evaluation is set to declare the results. “The Class 12 results are expected to be declared in the first week of the August and the main reason behind it is the floods that happened in the state. Many teachers who were in the work of evaluation are been affected and it has delayed the process,” said a senior education officer from the state education department on anonymity. The plans to declare the Class 12 results have been postponed because of floods and landslide in Konkan, Kolhapur and various other parts of the state. Teachers in the flood-affected parts are still to complete the assessment and evaluation work of students and so the results will be declared late. The Supreme Court of India had instructed the state government to declare Class 12 results before July 31 which seems to be impossible now. “The process of class 12 students’ evaluation is going on and we are particulary focusing on the online results declaration process. Last time, during the Class 10 results declaration, our website crashed, so now I am personally monitoring the Class 12 results work and taking continuous follow-ups. We have also made alternate arrangements for the website if it gets any technical issues on the results declaration day,” said Vishal Solanki, state education commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/class-12-results-to-be-delayed-expected-in-first-week-of-august-101627487508067.html

Till now, the state has vaccinated 42,352,467 beneficiaries of which 3,19,89,665 have received the first dose and the remaining 10,362,802 have received both doses.“We should receive a supply of vaccines because most cases are found in our state and the death rate is also high. We want to immunize the people as soon as possible. In this way, the effect of the third wave in the state would be less,” Tope said, while addressing reporters on Wednesday.Tope, along with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has earlier urged the Centre to provide 30 million vaccine doses per month. Two weeks back, he (Tope) said that the state has a capacity to administer doses to 1.5 million beneficiaries on a daily basis but only 200,000 to 300,000 were being inoculated per day due to scarcity of vaccines.On being asked about the upcoming third wave of the pandemic, the Maharashtra health minister said on Wednesday that the state government is preparing for it, adding it has laid emphasis on paediatrics in accordance with the Centre and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“The surge in cases in Kerala can be seen as the beginning of the third wave.

28-07-2021||Kolkata||CBI can probe ex-TMC leader Vinay Mishra in smuggling cases, says Calcutta HC||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Wednesday rejected former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Vinay Mishra’s request to stop the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against him in the coal and cattle smuggling cases. The bench of justice Tirthankar Ghosh also declined to extend its order that shielded him from arrest.“There has been no illegality committed in the ongoing investigation and as such, there is no scope for interference in the continuation of the investigation,” the judge said in his order, declining any relief to the former TMC general secretary of its youth wing who wanted an arrest shield, permission to be questioned over video conferencing and an Interpol red corner notice against him suspended.The petition was dismissed, said Ayan Bhattacherjee, a member of Mishra’s legal team that represented him in the high court.Vinay Mishra is a prime suspect in a CBI case that alleges that illegally mined coal worth several thousand crores of rupees was sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited operates several mines. In March this year, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Vinay Mishra’s brother Vikas and attached his property.On Wednesday, CBI also raided an under-construction apartment owned in east Kolkata by a former officer of the Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL). Vinay Mishra’s name also figured in a CBI probe into a cross-border cattle smuggling case in which a commandant of the Border Security Force (BSF) which is deployed along the border with Bangladesh, is also an accused.Vinay Mishra has claimed that he left India on September 16 last year, days before CBI registered the first case on September 21. A second case was registered on November 27.He is believed to be living in Vanuatu, a chain of 80 islands in the south Pacific, whose citizenship he acquired. A report in Vanuatu media earlier this month said he was granted citizenship under its Development Support Program, which requires applicants to possess net personal assets worth $ 500,000 ( ₹3.7 crore).The Vanuatu passport would give the businessman visa-free access to more than 130 countries except that he has an Interpol red corner notice pending against him. One of his requests rejected by the high court also was that the red corner notice is suspended.The coal smuggling case, became politically sensitive after CBI questioned TMC’s powerful general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and her sister Maneka Gambhir. The latter’s husband, Ankush Arora, and his father Pawan Arora was also grilled. TMC leaders have alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)is using the agency to target West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee by targeting her nephew and keep her under pressure.During the recent assembly polls, the BJP alleged that Abhishek Banerjee, who also appointed Vinay Mishra as one of the youth wing’s general secretaries months before he left the country, was involved in the coal smuggling case. The young Lok Sabha MP was earlier the president of the TMC’s youth wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-can-probe-ex-tmc-leader-vinay-mishra-in-smuggling-cases-says-calcutta-hc-101627483008333.html

The first-of-its-kind service in UP is part of the exercise to boost the vaccination drive in view of the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. “Vaccination is the only way out to minimise the effect of the virus. Hence, we are about to start the van service to transport pregnant women to the vaccination centres,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate, during a meeting to check preparedness ahead of a possible Covid third wave. The health department was asked to chalk out the plan and how the facility would be made available to expectant and lactating mothers. The service would be made available at the time of registration and would be governed by the Covid control and command centre, said officials. “Many women avoid going to the vaccination centre due to inconveniences. However, the transportation facility would help them move out to the vaccination centres,” the official said. The DM also directed the health department to increase the total number of vaccinations to up to 30,000 a day. Currently, Lucknow has around 68 vaccination centres and is vaccinating around 18,000 to 22,000 a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/soon-vans-to-ferry-pregnant-women-to-vax-centres-in-lucknow-101627482767683.html

Thereafter, they will address a public meeting at the Government Inter College ground, said Ratnakar Mishra, BJP MLA from Mirzapur. A dream project of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the corridor is aimed at beautification of Maa Vindhayavasini Temple, creation of space for 50-ft-wide ‘parikrama’ route and creating world class facilities for pilgrims. After the construction of the corridor, Maa Vindhyavasini Temple would be visible from the bank of Ganga. The Vindhyachal project would be the second corridor in eastern UP after the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, which is already under construction in Varanasi. Mishra said the official protocol of Shah’s visit was yet to be received. But the party had received information about the proposed programme. After arrival, Shah will pay obeisance to Maa Vindhyavasini and then participate in a ‘havan’, after which the foundation stone of the project will be laid. Shah would also inaugurate ₹16-crore ropeway facility to help devotees reach the Maa Ashtbhuja temple on the hillock. The inauguration was proposed before Chaitra Navratri in 2020, but was postponed due to the Covid pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amit-shah-to-lay-foundation-of-vindhyachal-corridor-project-on-august-1-101627482227635.html

28-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Heavy rains damage property, Kempty Falls closed for tourists||Heavy rains lashed parts of Uttarakhand on Wednesday, damaging roads and houses following an orange alert issued by the weather department predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall in at least seven districts of Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal, Nainital, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Dehradun had also predicted “extremely heavy rainfall with intense shower spells in parts of Dehradun, Nainital and Champawat districts.” Continuous heavy rains since Tuesday night damaged a culvert and caused waterlogging in low lying areas of Dehradun, damaging several houses in the capital city. In Almora district, a home guard jawan Rakesh Kiroula was swept away by an overflowing stream while riding home early Wednesday morning on his scooter. The two-wheeler was later retrieved but Kiroula could not be traced and is suspected to have drowned. Due to the heavy rains, tourists were also stopped from going to Kempty Falls since the popular waterfall near Mussoorie was overflowing. “The rain has stopped but the sudden surge in water level with strong current was being experienced continuously from early morning till noon, making it dangerous for tourists to enter the pool for bathing,” Naveen Chand Jural, police station in-charge of Kempty Falls said. He added that the strong current of the fall could also result in boulders falling from the top. Ramesh Talwar, a tourist from Delhi, said, “We had come to bathe in the fall but the police have banned the entry into the pool considering the risk to lives due to falling boulders”. Another tourist Sumit Makhia from Noida said, “I am disappointed at not being able to bathe in the pool here at the Kempty Falls but the administration has done the right thing considering the risk due to the surge in the water levels here.” Tourists are currently permitted only to take pictures and pose for videos right now, said police station in-charge Naveen Chand Jural. The IMD centre in Dehradun said the state on Wednesday witnessed “moderate rainfall with heavy to very heavy rainfall with active monsoon.” “The rainfall in the state is above normal in July with excess rain in June. At present we are receiving above normal rainfall which is above 90mm. However, the exact amount of rainfall so far could be revealed after proper analysis,” Bikram Singh, director of IMD Dehradun centre said.The IMD has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall again on Thursday in Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal, Nainital, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-heavy-rains-damage-property-kempty-falls-closed-for-tourists-101627471772108.html
28-07-2021||Other||Climate crisis: Odisha first coastal state to assess vulnerability||With climate crisis impacting the Odisha’s economy, the state is planning a vulnerability and risk assessment for its 10 agro-climatic zones using around 40 indicators such as BPL population, infant mortality rate, fertiliser application, livestock, annual average rainfall, migration, heatwaves, frequency of storm surges and solid waste generation.The macro/micro vulnerability analysis, the first one among all coastal states, will be undertaken with the help of various research institutes and is expected to help the state prioritise some of its activities under State Action Plan on Climate Change for 2021-30.Director of environment Susanta Nanda said though such risk assessments were done for some districts earlier, the assessment is being done for the entire state for the first time. “This could be the first such vulnerability analysis for any coastal state with so many social, environmental, physical, agricultural and health parameters. The analysis would help with policy briefs for decision makers based on scientific evidence, and building up better awareness of community on climate change and its impacts. The mapping will be done by the end of this year and help us in risk mitigation,” said Nanda.Also Read | Man arrested for burning woman in Odisha’s GanjamAmong the first to recognise the threat posed by the climate crisis, Odisha was one of the first states in the country to prepare a comprehensive and consultative state action plan involving diverse stakeholders. In 2020-21, it was the first Indian state to present a climate budget. To address the issue of climate crisis, Odisha formulated its State Action Plan on Climate Change in 2010, which was revised for 2021-30 as per the commitments made in the SDG-NDC report.Officials said the risk analysis would use various existing assessments such as vulnerability to floods in coastal Odisha, vulnerability to agricultural drought in western Odisha and district-level analysis of climate vulnerability and household nutrition status among rural communities in Odisha.In a state with high poverty levels (32.5%), higher than the national average (21%), disaster management experts say the climate crisis has the potential to derail the current growth strategy and deepen poverty in Odisha. Dr Anil Gupta of National Institute of Disaster Management said the direct impacts of extreme climate-induced events could affect the state’s economic growth and nullify the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies and pro-poor initiatives.“It’s an appreciable initiative for a state like Odisha which is a pioneer in disaster management. The need to address vulnerability in agro-climatic zones is very necessary and hazard assessment is must. Improved scientific evidence base and coordination mechanisms between scientific research and academic institutions (including both national and state-level agencies) for building scientific data and evidence base for the state and collation of available scientific information and data on climate change pertaining to the state,” said Dr Gupta.According to the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, for 95 of the last 105 years, Odisha has been affected by disasters brought on by heat waves, cyclones, droughts, and floods. Since 1965, these calamities have become more frequent and widespread. Natural calamities have seriously affected household income and set back the state’s economy. A report by World Bank, Asian Development Bank and various UN agencies in the wake of Cyclone Fani that hit Odisha coast in May 2019, assessed the state’s loss at ₹24,176 crore, while a similar report by World Bank after the Cyclone Phailin in October 2013 estimated the total damages and loss caused at about ₹8902 crore, bulk of which was in housing, agriculture and livestock.Officials said the vulnerability analysis would be done by downscaling global climate models with the help of research institutes and organisations such as the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority and Odisha Remote Space Application Centre etc. These new research and data will be used for necessary modification of the SAPCC and prioritisation of activities already proposed within the state annual plan for climate crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/climate-crisis-odisha-first-coastal-state-to-assess-vulnerability-101627470271855.html
28-07-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: Mosque plan inspires the first Peshwa-period temple||The other day, a quintessential Puneri ajji (grandmother) remarked indignantly: “I don’t fear this Coronavirus, Omkareshwari Govarya gelya majhya” (Cow dung cakes of my funeral have already reached Omkareshwar temple). And the modern generation was baffled at this specific Puneri reference which involves Omkareshwar Temple and cremation. In last week’s column, we witnessed how Shivram Bhat Chitrav Shaastri was relocated to the western side of the newly built Shaniwarwada, with due compensation. As the work on digging a well at the new house began, a treasure consisting of gold was discovered by Chitrav Shastri. The selfless Shastriji handed over the treasure to Bajirao Peshwa I, who was impressed by his Guru’s sincerity. Adding his own contribution to the treasure, Bajirao I handed it back to Shivram Bhat and asked him to construct a Shiv temple at the end of Shaniwar peth on the banks of the Mutha river. Sadashivrao Bhau, the son of Chimaji Appa and nephew of Bajirao Peshwa too contributed generously to build the temple. The construction of the temple complex was completed in 1760. The expense of building the temple was around ₹1 lakh. Construction in the early phase was supervised by the then Subhedar of Pune, Bapuji Shripat, who belongs to the Chitrav family. This area had a ghat descending to the river and as the river meandered slightly, like a knee-shaped bend, the area was called “Nadagemod”. The ghat was frequented by cows for drinking water and hence, the descent was also known as “gay utaar”. And though it may be hard to imagine, in the early 18th century, this area was outside Pune’s boundaries. The main cremation ground for Pune was located nearby. The foundation of the temple was laid on October 1736, thus making it one of the first temples built in Pune during the Peshwa period. This new endeavour was unlike any new temples built in the 18th century, due to its unique plan inspired by a Muslim mosque. The entire complex is enclosed in a prakara or temple wall, but has openings towards the river banks. The complex can be accessed via a large and imposing gateway in the middle of a massive fortified wall built in the Indo-Islamic style. Over the gateway is a music hall or nagarkhana. The courtyard houses a Nandi shrine which was damaged during the Panshet floods, and then reinstated. The additional chambers in the complex houses modern shrines of Vitthal Rukmini, Ashtabhuja Devi, Hanuman, Vishnu and Shani on a pigeon mount.This east facing temple has a main shrine consisting of nine domes with a slightly bigger central dome housing the main deity, Omkareshwar Shiva. The eight surrounding domes are connected with arches and form the circumambulatory path around the sanctum. The central dome is higher and encloses a storey within called “talim”. This place was frequented by freedom fighters to conduct secret meetings during British colonial rule. Shivalinga of the deity was specially made from Narmada valley stone and it is likely, that the name is inspired by the Omkareshwar pilgrimage site in Madhya Pradesh.The central courtyard to the east is large and enclosed by the semi-open “osari”, enclosed today it formed the priests’ residential quarters. A courtyard to the north towards ghats is smaller in size and is reserved for private rituals and devotional performances.The temple is plain with no exterior decorations and has plastered plain walls. The minimum floral motif known as “bel-fulachi nakshi” on borders and lotus petals on the dome ,made using stucco, are seen on the walls. The temple building in this case is far removed from earlier temples of Pune which used stone as a principle element, be it the Yadava-period temples, or the pre-Peshwa period. The new temple building during early Peshwa times capitalises on techniques of Indo-Islamic architecture making profuse use of arches and domes to achieve the desired height and allow flexible construction. The minarets as seen in other medieval temples, such as Bhuleshwar near Yavat, are absent here. Instead, bulbous domes of the respective niches are fashioned in conical shape to give appearance of a Hindu Nagara shikhara. However, it was still in an experimental stage and hence, the mosque-like elements do not blend with Hindu architectural sensibilities. Yet such innovation symbolises the liberal architectural approach taken by early Peshwa builders, which later evolves into a mature Maratha architecture in the region during the 18th century.The temple houses a poignant memory of Chamaji Appa, younger brother of Bajirao I in the form of his memorial. Chimaji Appa was an able commander of the Maratha army and was instrumental in successfully annexing the Vasai territory under Portuguese rule, during the Vasai Campaign. His contribution to expanding Maratha domains and supporting Bajirao Peshwa, is exemplary. His wife, Rakhmabai from Pethe family who took sati, has a memorial next to his. It was common belief that if the Omkareshwar Shivalinga submerges during the first floods of the river Mutha, it would mean a good monsoon. It is the ingenuity of the architects who allowed this phenomenon to happen in spite of massive construction during those days. If the water did not reach the Shivlinga, the entire sanctum was submerged by pouring water in. The Omkareshwar temple being next to the cremation ground was a prime location for conducting last rites and ancestral rituals as per Hindu traditions. Thus,” “smashanatil Mahadev” (Lord of Cremation Grounds), is a feared and revered deity signifying the sombre yet inevitable end of life. Hence, the phrase “Omkareshwari Gowrya gelya” prevails amongst Punekars, referring to the nearing of death.Due to modern developments, the precincts of Omkareshwar have been modified turning the complex into a medieval island. Yet, the charming complex is beautifully reminiscent of early 18th century Pune, which tempted colonial painters to illustrate it in its full glory.

28-07-2021||Chandigarh||City Beautiful has all but my beautiful aunt||Chandigarh has perpetually seemed ever so beautiful to me for a covert reason. Championing her feminist cause vociferously to make her hearth-bound niece see the world post completion of matriculation, my maternal aunt, Prem Lata, had extracted a hard laboured go-ahead from my orthodox grandfather. Born and brought up in pastoral setting with only an imaginary understanding of how city life looked like through books and movies, visiting the country’s first planned city left me awestruck as I marvelled at its chic random ways. My aunt painstakingly cared for my stay lest I should feel stifled in the sophisticated bubble of an urban milieu. To match me aesthetically with her two up-to-the-minute kids, she took me to the market to buy a new set of outfits besides making me partake of mouth-watering ‘gol gappas’ and ‘tikkis’ and myriad street food options. The mesmerising spectacle all around was transformed into a paradise with everything appearing new and exciting wherever my glance fell. The most fascinating among them was the visit to a theatre to watch the movie, Noorie. My aunt’s tug at my arm broke my reflecting spell over where else a movie could be seen besides the TV. She escorted me into a big dark hall, where only the usher’s face was barely visible. He split our tickets in half before pointing us to a row a few steps up. My aunt made her way into the tight aisle and the crowd’s panicked rush left me behind. My heart was thumping with a horrifying pound until her familiar voice comforted my edgy nerves. My feet hesitantly stepped into the dark with my hands unmindfully feeling heads, faces, arms, and shoulders of strangers and that unintentional ill-mannered act ended with my helpless flopping onto the lap of a woman. Thankfully, a timely apology from my aunt silenced her agitation. Soon, the silver screen lit up to an ear-piercing sound, so did my eyes and ears in utter astonishment. The enormous size and sonorous dialogues of artists seen only on a few inches screen hitherto blinded my visual senses, while the deafening sound numbed the auditory nerves. The film’s ending brought much-needed relief as I headed out in the fresh open air, leaving my aunt in fits of laughter for I, utterly buried in my own thoughts, failed to recount the basic storyline let alone voice my opinion about it. In lieu of ranting over seemingly wasted money, she was glad that I got an unprecedented experience worth narrating back at the village. Over the years, my circumstances changed for the better and were marked with frequent visits to City Beautiful. Each time, while on the way to surprise my aunt, I would rewind the same story to the boredom of whoever accompanied me. A recent visit to her was the most painful. Bidding a tearful adieu to an unexpected ending of her mortal journey flooded my mind with pleasant memories and no prizes for guessing which one is among the most unforgettable. Sitting in the car, my gaze suddenly fell upon a highway signboard announcing the arrival of City Beautiful. My eyes welled up and the heart sank for all those familiar spots and landmarks stood ‘alive’ at their original places but the loving aunt who had introduced them to me for the first time was gone forever. rama.kumari030165@gmail.com The writer is an Una-based homemaker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/city-beautiful-has-all-but-my-beautiful-aunt-101627468052158.html

The agenda of its formation is to get full autonomy in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The council’s allegation comes days after they wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking his intervention in identifying Chakma migrants settled in Dhalai district of the state and deport them. In the letter, they also claimed that Chakma people are settled at some places, including NarikelKunja, Naikacherra, Twichakma and Thakurcherra in Dhalai district, after coming from Bangladesh and later expanded their base in other villages adjacent to the Indo-Bangla international border.“We have written to Union home minister about illegal immigration of Chakma people as we collected reports showing them come to India illegally from Bangladesh. They also get Indian documents made illegally,” said convener of Tiprasa Hoda Dhirendra Tripura to media.Chakma National Council of India ( CNCI) called the allegations baseless and claimed that Chakmas are indigenous to Tripura as per the state’s Royal chronicles Rajmala. “ We believe that these allegations are being made to disturb the communal harmony,” said CNCI vice president Aniruddha Chakma. Leader of Opposition Manik Sarkar said the matter raised by Tiprasa Hoda is of concern and he forwarded the letter to chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb as the CPM is against any kind of disturbance of communal harmony. “ We want communal harmony among all the communities. We will oppose any conspiracy to disturb the peace between the communities, “ Sarkar told reporters. The chief minister’s office is yet to respond to the Tiprasa Hoda’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tripura-indigenous-body-claims-armed-bangladeshi-activists-in-state-101627467872247.html

28-07-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC lawyers protest outside acting CJ’s court; bar association divided||The stand off in Calcutta high court over the acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal’s decision to transfer a case from justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya’s court to a division bench showed no sign of resolution on Wednesday as a group of lawyers protested outside the acting chief justice’s court after having decided to stay away from his court a day earlier. However, on Tuesday evening, another section of bar association members said they will not abstain from proceedings in the chief justice’s court and will instead wait for an amicable solution of the issue.The protesting lawyers are demanding that justice Bindal recalls the transfer of a civil case from the court of justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya to the division bench headed by justice Harish Tandon on July 19. The incident triggered a strong reaction and on July 22, some members of the bar association convened a meeting and wrote a four-page letter to justice Bindal. “We are extremely shocked that the moment justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya questioned why measures were not taken to improve the quality of virtual hearing, the same matter was suddenly assigned to a division bench. It is extremely apparent that the sudden assignment to a division bench was made only for the reason that justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya questioned the administrative side of the high court for not doing their required job…..” wrote the lawyers. Justice IP Mukherjee, who is a member of the five-judge bench headed by justice Bindal, on Monday held a meeting with members of the bar association but no solution was found. On Tuesday afternoon, many general members of the bar association met in the presence of assistant secretary Ritzu Ghosal, the treasurer and four members of the executive committee. The meeting was chaired by senior advocate Saptangsu Basu. “Since the issue was not resolved, the general members resolved unanimously in today’s meeting that the general members shall abstain from participating in judicial proceedings before the honourable acting chief justice till the matter is resolved,” said the resolution which was forwarded to justice Bindal. Copies of the resolution were forwarded to advocate general Kishore Dutta, the bar library club and the Incorporated Law Society of the high court. “The members said that assignment of the case to a division bench is not in conformity with appellate side rules as well as rules framed by the administrative full court of the high court,” Ghosal, who signed the resolution and the forwarding letter, told HT. Hours later on Tuesday evening, another section of bar association members virtually held a general body meeting, presided by the association’s acting vice-president Ajay Chaubey. This section of the members passed a resolution saying they would review the situation after 15 days and make efforts to resolve the issue amicably instead of abstaining from proceedings in the court of justice Bindal. The resolution was made public on Tuesday night. Referring to the issue of assignment of the civil case to a division bench, the resolution said the matter was being “considered by the judges’ committee.” The sequence of events started on July 19. Justice Bhattacharyya, who had reacted sharply on July 16 when technical glitches disrupted the virtual hearing of the civil case, passed a strongly-worded order when he found that the case was transferred to the division bench of justice Tandon. In his 10-page order, justice Bhattacharyya criticised the court administration as well as acting chief justice on whose orders the case was assigned. “There is doubt as to whether the chief justice/acting chief justice, in her/his administrative capacity as the Master of the Roster, can override a judicial order passed by a bench having determination fixed by the chief justice/acting chief justice herself/himself and the file of the matter be assigned to some other court overnight,” justice Bhattacharyya wrote in his order on July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-lawyers-protest-outside-acting-cj-s-court-bar-association-divided-101627465831301.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||Union minister Rane upset as officers were not present during his Chiplun visit||A video clip of Union minister of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Narayan Rane, giving an earful to a government officer because his seniors were not present when the former visited flood- ravaged Chiplun area of Konkan has gone viral on social media. Rane, who was inducted in the Union cabinet early this month, visited flood ravaged Raigad and Ratnagiri on Sunday along with leaders of Opposition in state legislature, Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar. In the video clip, Rane is seen taking to task district collector B N Patil for his failure to appoint a senior official to accompany the minister even as government officials were busy with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s tour. When Rane was told the officials were busy with Thackeray, he reportedly shouted, “Do not tell me about the CM, I do not care about him. The sub-divisional officer says he is with the guardian minister, You are saying you are with the CM…. I have tolerated enough…You are saying the CEO (of district council) is deputed with me...I don’t see him anywhere. Where is he?” During his subsequent press conference in Ratnagiri, Rane said, “There is no CM...Administration cannot be seen anywhere and everything has collapsed…CM has stepped out of Matoshree (Thackeray residence) only after he realised that I am on Ratnagiri tour. He did not get a helicopter for four days of the flood. He brought bad luck to the state ever since he took over.”Sena leader and former union minister Arvind Sawant condemned Rane’s behaviour. “It is not the person but the post which needs to be respected. But then, we cannot expect decent behaviour from Rane,” said Sawant. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said such behaviour demoralises the officials undertaking relief work. “Rane is a senior leader and a Union minister and we expect more responsible behaviour from him,” said Sawant. Significantly, Sena and NCP have said earlier that politicians should avoid visiting flood-affected areas as the local administration needs to focus on relief operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/union-minister-rane-upset-as-officers-were-not-present-during-his-chiplun-visit-101627465051134.html

The report of Lovepreet’s death and alleged cheating by his NRI wife has been shared widely on social media, prompting Punjabi media in Canada to question Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but he declined any review of the country’s liberal immigration rules and instead urged immigrants to apply through the government’s website. Also read: Trudeau: We have enough anti-Covid shots to vaccinate entire eligible populationIn his complaint on Tuesday, Lovepreet’s father Balwinder Singh of Khote Gobindpura village near Dhanaula town stated that the wedding of his son with Beant was solemnized on August 2, 2019, after which she went to Canada to study on August 17. 2019. He claimed that he had spent ₹25 lakh on her studies but his son Lovepreet, alias Laddi, was upset as she did not take him abroad as promised and eventually stopped communicating with him. Lovepreet was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his farm on June 23. Initially, the police registered a case under Section 174 of the CrPC as the family had not complained about the cheating. Rather, Lovepreet’s family claimed he died in the field after spraying pesticide, but the viscera report is awaited. Acting on Balwinder’s complaint, Dhanaula police station in-charge Harsimranjit Singh said that a case has now been registered against Beant Kaur, who belongs to Khudi Kalan village in Barnala district, under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. “We will investigate Lovepreet’s mobile phone records and other documents to get to the truth,” the station house officer said. On July 13, Punjab State Women Commission chairperson Manisha Gulati met Lovepreet’s mother and sisters at their village and assured them of justice. Though Beant’s family members were not available for comment, she has denied allegations of cheating on social media platforms. She said that she tried to bring Lovepreet to Canada but could not due to the Covid-19 restrictions. “His case could not be pursued due to the travel curbs,” she said. On Wednesday, local residents held a protest at Dhanaula on the Bathinda-Chandigarh national highway, demanding that the police add Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/canada-dream-shattered-woman-booked-for-cheating-husband-s-family-of-25-lakh-in-punjab-101627464451135.html

28-07-2021||Kolkata||More complaints of post-poll violence are in, NHRC tells Calcutta HC||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) informed the Calcutta high court on Wednesday that more complaints of alleged post-poll violence poured in after the enquiry committee submitted its final report on the alleged human rights violations in the state before the court on July 13. A five-judge bench of the Calcutta high court, headed by acting chief justice of Calcutta high court, directed the West Bengal government to file a supplementary affidavit on the allegations of post-poll violence mentioned in the NHRC report. The court will hear the matter again on August 2. “The committee received some more complaints after the final report was submitted. We forwarded the same to the Director General of Police in West Bengal. We can file a supplementary report in this regard,” said Subir Sanyal, the advocate representing NHRC. Also Read | Lawyers protest Calcutta chief justice’s decision to reassign caseIn June, the court, while hearing PILs pertaining to allegations of post-poll violence, had directed NHRC to constitute a committee to examine all cases of alleged violence after the recent assembly elections. The seven-member committee submitted its final report on July 13, slamming the Trinamool Congress state government, while recommending a Central Bureau of Investigation probe. The state government on Monday filed an affidavit refuting the charges, while alleging that the report was politically motivated. “We are seeking liberty to submit a supplementary affidavit. On July 26, a 951-page document was sent to us by the NHRC. We need time to respond,” said Kishore Datta, advocate general of West Bengal. Advocate Priyanka Tibrewal, who represents some of the victims of the alleged violence, however, raised objections, stating that the violence is continuing, and the victims may end up withdrawing their complaint if the matter is further delayed. “Extension of time leads to disappearance of evidence. The police are complicit in this matter. If the state wants to file a supplementary affidavit, they have to show reason,” said Mahesh Jethmalani, counsel of a deceased BJP supporter. The bench however observed that there is no FIR on record to suggest that witnesses and victims were under pressure, while allowing the state to file a supplementary affidavit within three days. Meanwhile at least two TMC legislators, Jyotipriyo Mullick and Partha Bhowmik, who were branded as “notorious criminals and goons” in the NHRC report moved the Calcutta high court, challenging the report. The report named more than 123 people, some of them local TMC leaders, and tagged them as “notorious criminals and goons”. The list includes former TMC MLA Udayan Guha and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in Nandigram, Sheikh Sufiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/more-complaints-of-post-poll-violence-are-in-nhrc-tells-calcutta-hc-101627462110874.html

28-07-2021||Lucknow||New rules make maintaining vintage vehicles easier||The Central Motor Vehicles (Fifteenth Amendment) Rules, 2021, recently notified by the union ministry of transport, has made separate rules for the registration of vintage cars, bringing hope for their owners, as also encouraging enthusiasts. “The new rules are encouraging...vintage and classic cars, jeeps and motor- cycles can now get registration and ply legally despite being overage,” said Sandeep Das, secretary, Vintage Car and Motor-Cycle Club, Lucknow. A vintage vehicle connoisseur himself, Das owns five such vehicles. The gazette notification came on July 15. “The rules have been notified after the ministry invited comments and suggestions from all the stakeholders last year in October-November,” senior transport official AK Pandey said. “Till now, there were no separate rules for vintage vehicles due to which their owners were facing problems,” he said. This, he said, will enable people to retain the original registration number of their vintage vehicle even if it was earlier registered in a state outside UP or imported from outside India. “Vintage vehicles have been exempted from the requirement of being fitted with a high security registration plate (HSRP) too,” he added. The rules that have come into force across the country with immediate effect define a vehicle as vintage if it is more than fifty years old from the date of first registration after first sale. This category will also include any imported vehicle if it is maintained in its original form and has not undergone a substantial overhaul, which includes any modification in chassis, body shell, or engine. The government has fixed ₹20,000 as the fee for the first registration and certification of a vehicle as vintage vehicle and ₹5,000 for its subsequent registration every five years with the first registration/certification to be valid for 10 years. All those vehicles which are already registered will continue to retain the original registration number and registration plate without any change. The rules, however, do not allow vintage vehicles to be driven or plied on the roads on a regular basis. According to Das, there must be at least 500 vintage vehicles in UP, mostly in Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi and Agra. “In Lucknow alone, there are around 75-80 such vehicles and the new rules will help in restoration of more vehicles as vintage ones in the whole state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-rules-make-maintaining-vintage-vehicles-easier-101627457730234.html

As against an average rainfall of 49mm in May and 181.10mm in June, East Champaran witnessed a rainfall of 260.94mm and 422.20mm respectively, causing damage to area spread over 6,800 hectares in blocks such as Kesariya, Sangrampur, Banjariya, Safauli, Fenhara, Ramgarhwa, Raxaul, Adapur and Patahi, besides parts of Motihari, Ghodasahan and Pakaridayal. “We have received online application from 55,454 farmers across the district and 8,833 of them have benefitted from the distribution,” said Chandradeo Prasad, district agriculture officer (DAO). According to Adesh Titarmare, director, department of agriculture, Patna, the government has provided over 6,500 quintals paddy seeds for farmers in these two districts (East and West Champaran) as contingent crops.*As a technology, direct seeded rice is being promoted in all districts. Due to recent floods and loss of seedlings, farmers are advised to adopt DSR in East and West Champaran,” he said. Dr N K Singh, associate director research and chief scientist (rice), Pusa University, Samastipur, describes the short duration variety as cost effective. “Compared to old transplantation technique, the yield from DSR is almost equal. Paddy cultivation through DSR can help augment farmers; income,” he said. However, not all farmers are in favour of DSR yet. “This variety of seed is still unknown in our village. Moreover, who would take risk with regard to their paddy?” said Updesh Sah, a Bherihari village-based farmer near Valkminagar in West Champaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-hands-out-paddy-seed-to-farmers-who-suffered-losses-in-floods-101627456229948.html

She also held the additional charge of Karnal Range IGP till May 10.In a letter to chief secretary Dr Vijay Vardhan through DGP Manoj Yadava on July 24, the 1998-batch IPS officer sought to be relieved by July 31, citing Section 16(2) of the All India Service (DCRB) Rules after attaining 50 years of age.Arora also requested that the prior notice period of three months be waived, as per the provision of the rules.Cites spiritual calling in applicationThe reason for her seeking premature retirement was not clear, but at the end of her application, she indicated “spending the rest of her life in devotion to God”.“My service has been my pride and passion. I am very grateful to this service for providing me with the opportunity to serve, to learn and to grow. My gratitude to the state of Haryana for showing me the right path,” her letter reads.“Now I wish to achieve the ultimate goal of life. I yearn to traverse the path shown by the holy saints such as Guru Nanak Dev, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Kabirdas, Tulsidas, Surdas, Meerabai, the Sufi saints and dedicate the rest of my life in loving devotional service of Lord Sri Krishna,” the letter reads.She didn’t respond to a questionnaire sent on her official email and his reader showed inability to connect with her for a comment.

Together, the three oxygen plants will have the capacity to generate up to 2,233 litres of oxygen per minute. These plants, along with the cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks, are expected to be commissioned by the end of August.The institute allocated area to the National Highways Authority of India this Monday to set up two oxygen generation plants. The plants are being set up under the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situation (PM-CARES) fund. Each plant will have a capacity to generate 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) oxygen, said Shailendra Kumar Singh, superintending engineer (biomedical), IGIMS. The institute commissioned its first 233 LPM oxygen generation plant, facilitated through Patna MP and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on July 18. “We have requested DRDO to expedite installation of the two oxygen generation plants. We expect them to be ready within a month,” said IGIMS director Dr NR Biswas.

Of the six accused in the case, two are members of the present assembly--V Sivankutty is the state education minister and KT Jaleel is a former minister. All six (V Sivankutty, KT Jaleel, EP Jayarajan, CK Sadasivan, Kunahmed Master and K Ajith) were charged under the prevention of damage to public property act and other provisions. The verdict is crucial for Sivankutty, also the main accused in the case, because, according to political observers, the minister will have to resign in case of adverse remarks from the apex courtAlso Read | Zika virus cases in Kerala soar past 50 with 3 new infectionsKerala House witnessed violent scenes in March 2015, after Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget, alleging his role in the bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee, and two legislators were later hospitalised. The session was broadcast live when the violence took place and property worth ₹2.20 lakh was destroyed in the ruckus. In 2016, the government appealed for withdrawal of the cases, but a local court rejected the plea. The government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The government invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its plea, but the high court said privilege was not a licence to carry out violence in the House. Interestingly, the coterie of KM Mani, the minister t the heart of the issue, is part of the LDF camp now. After his death in 2019, KM Mani’s party Kerala Congress (M) split, and his son took a splintered faction to the LDF camp. A predominant Christian party, Kerala Congress (M)’s foray into LDF helped it win many seats in the Christian heartland of central Travancore; and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is now forced to swallow its earlier charges against KM Mani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/violence-in-kerala-house-supreme-court-verdict-today-101627448068593.html

He began the second edition of the tours with a day-long visit to Unnao, a neighbouring district of Lucknow, on July 21. Between December 2020 and April this year, the former chief minister campaigned in as many as 40 districts. “The national president’s tour was supposed to resume soon after April’s panchayat polls, but the party put it on hold because of the second wave of Covid-19,” said a senior SP functionary.The party says while Yadav will complete the tour of the remaining districts this time around, he may also revisit some districts, including his Lok Sabha constituency Azamgarh, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, and a couple of Bundelkhand districts.Also Read | Heavy to extremely heavy rain likely over Uttarakhand and northwest UP todayThese tours involve meeting the party cadre for poll preparation discussions, roadshows, public meetings, Kisan panchayats, press conferences, and short bicycle rides with party workers. He had also been on temple runs--going to Hindu, Muslim, and Buddhist places of worship.“The way crowds are gathering at his shows indicates how restive the people are to vote the BJP out and bring back the Samajwadi Party,” said SP state spokesperson and former minister Rajendra Chaudhary.Yadav has mostly kept his attack focused on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and has refrained from speaking about any other rival political party, be it the Congress or the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Among his political rivals, BSP chief Mayawati has not travelled across the state at all, while Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited a few districts such as Saharanpur and Mathura (before the panchayat polls) and recently Lucknow and Lakhimpur-Kheri.“If he and his party aspire to win against the BJP, he has to be seen on the road now. There is no other way. As of now, it is only his party which is in a position to take on the BJP in the coming polls.

Potholed, damaged roads in almost every part of the city increase the chances of accidents especially, during waterlogging, but the authorities have turned a blind eye towards the problem. Even as the MC has been making tall claims regarding taking up development projects in the city, deep potholes can be seen on main roads of the city including, Model Town-Jawaadi Road, Brown Road, Gill Road, Pakhowal Road, Lodhi Club Road, etc. A similar situation can also be seen in the residential areas of Model Town, Field Ganj, Nehru Nagar, Kundan Nagar, Dugri, Haibowal, among others.The roads that were dug up for ongoing development works at Ferozepur Road, Malhar Road, Pakhowal Road, Old GT Road, etc., have further added to the woes of the commuters.Gurkirat Singh, a resident of Model Town, said, “MC should take up the process of reparation of the roads regularly. Last year in November, a girl had suffered a serious head injury after she lost balance of her two-wheeler on Model Town-Jawaddi Road.”“The issue of potholed roads is raised every year, but the authorities still do not repair them ahead of monsoon season and put the lives of residents in danger,” added Singh.Pawandeep Singh, a resident of the Field Ganj area, said that apart from repairing the potholes, the MC should also find a solution for the uneven covers. “The roads should have been repaired ahead of the monsoon. Now, the authorities claim that repair work cannot be done during the rainy season. The MC should at least clear the gravel spread on the damaged portion of the road as there is always a danger of vehicles skidding,” he added.Councillors had in the MC general house meeting on July 14 raised the matter regarding the pathetic condition of roads. They rued that commuters are facing trouble as the contractors had failed to construct the roads after digging them up to install sewer lines.Sunita Rani, leader of BJP councillors, said, “The main Shivpuri has been dug for around three months to install sewer lines. The authorities have failed to reconstruct the road even as hundreds of vehicles ply on it daily and accidents are also taking place there.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that the potholes are temporarily being filled them with rubble and sand as the bitumen work cannot be done during the rainy season. “The repair work with bitumen material will start soon after the monsoon season. The MC has also approved different projects to reconstruct the main roads of the city. If the residents are facing any problems due to the potholes, then they can submit a complaint with my office,” he added. Despite repeated attempts, made to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/potholes-exacerbate-ludhiana-commuters-woes-in-monsoon-101627418301452.html
28-07-2021||Chandigarh||In six months, over 3,000 residents bitten by dogs in Ludhiana||Letting sleeping dogs lie is doing no good as despite a slew of initiatives to keep the dog population in check, as many as 3,075 residents have been on the receiving end of a dog bite in six months. As per civil hospital data, 894 cases were reported in January, 800 in February, 336 in March, 315 in April, 245 in May and 485 in June. Data for July had not been compiled so far. The death of 11-year-old Arjun on Sunday was no isolated incident, on June 3, 15-year-old Neha of Krishan Nagar near Ghumar Mandi, had narrowly escaped death after she was attacked by a pack of dogs. She had received multiple dog bite injuries, primarily on her arms, chest, and back. Two passersby saved her from the vicious attack . She had also sustained a serious head injury from falling on the street.  ₹4 crore spent on sterilisation so far In 2009 and 2010, Himmat Singh Grewal, a dog lover, had initiated a sterilisation project. However, the project ended mid-way after Grewal accused the civic body officials of harassment. The project resumed in February 2015 after the civic body hired a private company to sterilise dogs and paid it ₹760 per dog. The company’s contract was renewed in January 2019 and the fee was revised to ₹990 per dog. As per the officials, around 50,000 dogs have been sterilised in the city so far at a cost of ₹4 crore. However, the dog population continues to rise. Sterilise females: GADVASU VCAs per Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University ( GADVASU) vice-chancellor Dr Inderjeet Singh, authorities should sterilise female dogs for better results. Any interruption or any break in the sterilisation project can jeopardise the exercise as the dog population multiplies rapidly.Municipal corporation veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dalla said 40 dogs are being vaccinated in the city each day and the number of sterilisations will increase from next month. “There are around 25,000 stray dogs inside the MC limits, while around 2,000 dogs have been registered as pets with the MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-six-months-over-3-000-residents-bitten-by-dogs-in-ludhiana-101627417462022.html

The victim, Arjun, who lives in the slums on the outskirts of Jaspal Bangar village, had told his parents that he had injured his leg while playing, while he had in fact sustained a dog bite. An ex-serviceman, Lakhwinder Singh, who lives in the village, said, “Arjun started behaving abnormally a few days ago. Instead of taking him to a doctor, the family took Arjun to a quack, and then to a witch doctor as they believed he had been possessed by evil spirits.”The victim’s health deteriorated further on Sunday and he started frothing at his mouth. This time, the family took Arjun to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with rabies, but he died a few hours later. His body was handed over to the family after postmortem.The incident came to light after health officials probed the death. The victim’s father Haimraj and mother Parvati blamed the stray dog menace in the area for their son’s death. “The stray dog population is on the rise. Canines enter the slum area in search of food and attack children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-boy-conceals-dog-bite-dies-of-rabies-20-days-later-101627417221220.html

The smart phones will be used by ‘anganwadi’ workers under the National Nutrition Mission programme. Each phone is expected to cost ₹9,440 and a sum of ₹116.48 crore had been earmarked for the purpose.A government order (dated July 26, 2021) titled ‘financial and administrative sanction to buy smart phones in 2021-2022 through GeM portal under Poshan Abhiyan’ has been issued in this regard by special secretary Garima Yadav cancelling the financial and administrative sanction issued vide GO number 13/2020/1763/58-1-20-2/3 (6) 13TC (dated July 24, 2020) to buy smart phones. The order also laid down other terms and conditions for the use of funds earmarked for the purchase of smart phones. The state government proposed to provide these phones to the ‘anganwadi’ workers to ensure real-time monitoring of provisioning supplementary nutrition to national nutrition mission beneficiaries that include pregnant and lactating mothers and children etc. Those aware of the development said the smart phones would enable village level women and childcare workers (‘anganwadi’ workers) to feed data on the spot about the distribution of nutrition supplements to beneficiaries. The workers will use the Poshan tracker app to feed the data for real-time monitoring. “the state government has issued administrative sanction to buy 1,23,398 smart phones through the GeM portal. It has cancelled the financial and administrative sanction for bids to buy smart phones issued on July 24, 2020,” said a senior officer of National Nutrition Mission, which was launched with an objective to leverage technology for monitoring and improved service delivery to beneficiaries. About the complaints of alleged irregularities in the bidding process initiated earlier, the officer said the department was not aware of any such complaints. “We just received one-line information from the state government informing the department about the cancellation of bids,” said the officer.There were reports that a smart phone manufacturing company had pointed towards alleged irregularities in the tendering process that pushed the company out of the bidding process. Minister of state (independent charge) for women and child development, Swati Singh, had raised the issue of alleged irregularities and wrote to a senior officer in the women and child welfare department. Swati Singh and other senior officers of the women and child welfare department either remained unavailable or refused to comment on the issue. The UP government had proposed to buy smart phones for ‘anganwadi’ workers under the National Nutrition Mission named as the Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition (POSHAN) Abhiyan. It was launched in 2017 as a multi-ministerial convergence mission with a vision to make India malnutrition free by 2022. The union ministry of women and child development developed the new Poshan tracker app to monitor distribution of nutrition supplements and bring about an improvement in the nutritional status of beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-scraps-bidding-process-clears-decks-for-purchase-of-1-23-398-smart-phones-101627416620395.html
28-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC orders fact-finding survey on ‘apartmentalisation’ in Chandigarh’s northern sectors||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Chandigarh administration to carry out a survey, within two weeks, to identify residential properties which have been sold to a person outside the family of the original owner since December 2019, in a particular manner indicating that the purpose of the sale was construction of apartments.The court also asked for a physical inspection of such buildings to find out whether the sale has actually led to the buyers occupying independent floors in an otherwise composite dwelling unit. The entire exercise is to be carried out under the supervision of the UT chief architect, and with assistance from police and other enforcement agencies. “We are constrained to observe that the UT administration has chosen to skirt a vital issue that has been raised in the instant petition,” the HC bench of justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and justice Vivek Puri observed while seeking a report by August 11.Only those residential properties are to be checked which were transferred or sold to a person outside the family of the original owner, after December 31, 2019, and where the pattern of share(s) is 50 %, 30 % or 20 %.“We would also like to observe that it is only a fact-finding exercise, which we feel would be imperative for us to take a final view in the matter. The present order in no way expresses our opinion on merits,” the bench further observed.The court was hearing a batch of petitions pending since 2016 seeking prohibitory orders on conversion of residential plots into apartments. Residential plots in Chandigarh are meant to be used as single-dwelling units. However, in the recent years, these are being sold floor-wise to multiple owners.There is a huge divide among residents on the issue. A section says by allowing apartments, those who wish to get property in northern sectors would get a chance to own them. On the other hand, many owners in northern sectors have been opposing the move insisting that it could change the city’s character.In the year 2001, Chandigarh administration notified Chandigarh Apartment Rules, 2001, whereby even single residential units, wherever they existed, could be subdivided into apartments but were repealed in October 2007. Chandigarh administration has maintained that no permission is being granted to convert residential houses into apartments. The bench itself scanned newspapers to ascertain veracity of the claims and found that on a single day in an English daily, 24 advertisements scouting for purchasers/investors for separate floors/independent floors, were found. “ ..(It) lend (s) credence to the assertion raised on behalf of the petitioners that under the garb of sale of certain percentage share of a residential unit, independent floors are being sold,” the court observed adding that UT had been silent on such aspect.“In our view, the Chandigarh administration ought to have been alive to such situation and particularly when there were specific averments made in the present petition which was filed way back in the year 2016. Being in a state of denial on paper would not suffice. In the fitness of things, the administration should have carried out some kind of physical verification to ascertain as to whether such modus operandi had been resorted to after repeal of the Apartment Rules, 2001,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-orders-fact-finding-survey-on-apartmentalisation-in-chandigarh-s-northern-sectors-101627416561107.html
28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Charges fly as safai karamcharis’ panel chief, Ludhiana MC staff lock horns||High drama was witnessed at the Circuit House after the Chairman of the Punjab State Safai Karamchari Commission and Municipal Corporation (MC) employees locked horns over the recommendation of lodging FIR against the concerned MC employees, who had alleged forced staff to undertake manual scavenging of sewer lines without safety gear in Jugiana area on July 16.Chairperson of the commission, Geja Ram Valmiki, had called a meeting of the commission over the delay in lodging the FIR against the concerned MC employees even after he recommended action against the officials on July 16. However, some MC staffers reached the spot and opposed the recommendation alleging that the chairperson himself had asked the manual scavengers to enter the manhole and accused the chairperson of falsely implicating the employees. The MC employees, including junior engineers, a sub-divisional officer (SDO) and executive engineers of the operations and maintenance cell of the civic body shared a video where the chairperson can reportedly been heard asking the men to enter the manhole.Contractual sewer cleaner, Vijaypal, who was caught on camera while entering the manhole in the Jugiana area, also said that he was asked to enter the manhole by the chairperson himself. Few councillors also came in support of the MC employees. As the argument between the chief and MC employees grew heated, police force was deployed on the spot. The argument between the MC employees, chairperson and administrative officials continued for over seven hours, with Geja Ram alleging that he too had video evidence of a sewer cleaner entering a manhole in Model Town area on July 22.The MC employees said they try to avoid manual scavenging and when there is no other option, prior permission is taken from the higher authorities and safety kits are provided.The chairperson accused the MC employees of misbehaving, threatening him and obstructing the proceedings of the meeting and recommended an FIR against 33 employees. In turn, Municipal Employees Sangharsh Committee chairperson Jasdev Sekhon said that the MC employees will go on an indefinite strike if the MC officials and employees are wrongly implicated.Administrative officials including sub-divisional magistrate (SDM East) Baljinder Dhillon, and municipal corporation joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh who were present on the spot intervened. The commissioner recorded the statements of the MC employees and sewermen.Geja Ram said he was stopping the employees from entering the manhole and the video was being misinterpreted to pressure the commission. “Five manholes had already been cleaned in the Jugiana area before the act was caught on camera. The statements of the MC officials and safai karamcharis have been taken but they will be verified as the manual scavengers are also under pressure,” he said.“An FIR will be recommended in cases of manual scavenging and also against the MC officials who came to the meeting uninvited, broke the protocol, misbehaved, created nuisance and obstructed the proceedings of the meeting. I will meet commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal in this regard on Wednesday. We have video proof of everything,” said the chairperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charges-fly-as-safai-karamcharis-panel-chief-ludhiana-mc-staff-lock-horns-101627416500489.html

28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Soon, Chandigarh officials will only move around in electric vehicles||In a major move towards clean-energy, the UT administration is all set to start the process of replacement of its fleet of official vehicles with electric ones. Confirming the development, UT adviser Dharam Pal, said, “Within all the departments, we are looking at buying only electric vehicles from hereon and all condemned vehicles will also be replaced by e-vehicles.”Batting for e-vehicles for the city, Pal, said, “The city is small. E-vehicles can serve our purpose very well. In fact, e-vehicles are designed for a city like Chandigarh.”Pal has already directed the finance department to issue necessary instructions to other departments on the issue. The UT engineering department has also been directed to examine the requirement of necessary infrastructure for e-vehicles.“I have already held discussions with the engineering and finance departments on the issue. They are looking at what infrastructure is required to back-up the decision. It will require charging systems in all government offices,” said Pal.The induction of e-vehicles in the UT official fleet of cars is part of Pal’s focus on improving mobility within the city. “The inter-city connectivity issues would require time and beset with inter-state coordination issues. I am not overly focused on outer towns. I am only looking at the requirement within the city,” said Pal.Notably, earlier this year, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had also made a case for making it mandatory for all officials in government ministries and departments to use electric vehicles.20% to be replaced in next three yearsDebendra Dalai, chief executive officer, Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology (CREST), said, “We are planning to replace 20% of the current official fleet of vehicles with e-vehicles in next three to four years. For official use in the city, e-vehicles are the best option. This will be beneficial for the environment and the administration will save a huge amount in running and maintenance costs.”Currently, the department has nine such vehicles which include e-cars and e-scooters. “The cost of running an e-car is around ₹0.50 per km. At the same time, a petrol car costs around ₹10 per km, which mainly includes maintenance and cost of fuel. The electric vehicles only require recharging of battery and vehicle as such doesn’t have high-maintenance costs,” said Dalai.Infrastructure available in cityFor improving the charging infrastructure in the city, the CREST is also planning having additional number of charging stations in the city. “Currently, we have nine points with 48 charging stations in the city. These are slow chargers. In addition to these, at the same nine points, we are planning to have fast chargers,” said Dalai.The UT transport department plans to replace its entire fleet of around 360 local buses with electric buses. Forty buses have already been procured. The prototype bus will be inducted into the fleet by August 15. All of these 40 e-buses will be inducted by October this year. The transport department has also started the process of procuring another batch of 40 e-buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/soon-chandigarh-officials-will-only-move-around-in-electric-vehicles-101627416141113.html

The problem might lead to diseases for those who can’t afford a water purifier at home, they said.Dr Deepak Arora, a dentist and a resident of Sector 9, said due to the contaminated water supply in the area, he had to get the RO membrane replaced multiple times. “The problem has been going on for weeks. I met the area SDM who assured us of a solution soon. But there is no improvement,” Dr Arora said.Advocate Sandeep Sachdeva, the president of the Sector-7 residents welfare association (RWA), said that the water quality was the poorest till last week, but had improved considerably.“We had visited the supply spot in Sector 10 earlier this week and highlighted the negligence of the officials of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), who assured us of a solution within a week. But the situation deteriorated and MLA Aseem Goel had to check out the site on July 24. The demand of the residents to cement the distributary line is two decades old. The state government had approved it, but the officials made a mockery of it and affected the supply itself,” he said.On Tuesday, deputy commissioner (DC) Vikram chaired a meeting of senior officials of HSVP and the irrigation department and asked them to prepare a timeline of works being carried out.Officials said that cementing of the areas around Kanwla distributary that supplies water to these sectors was going on at a cost of ₹23 crore and almost a kilometre was left to be constructed. “I’ve also asked the officials to ensure there are filled sacs arranged at the areas where the sand is getting mixed with water,” the DC said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/muddy-water-supply-situation-yet-to-be-corrected-in-ambala-s-sectors-101627415602126.html

A painter by profession , Dinesh used to earn ₹18,000 per month plus overtime.It was mentioned in the complaint that on October 9, 2018, Dinesh and his brother had gone to the new construction site in Sector 71, Mohali. At around 8am, when they were crossing the light-point of Phase 7, Mohali, a Punjab Roadways bus came from Chandigarh side and hit Dinesh’s bicycle from the front.Dinesh suffered head injuries and was taken to Guru Harkrishan Hospital, Sohana, in the same bus where he was declared dead by the doctors. The same day, an FIR was registered against the driver under Sections 279 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code.Alleging that the bus was being driven in rash and negligent manner, the victim’s family moved the tribunal seeking compensation.In the tribunal, driver Amrik Singh pleaded that no accident had taken place and that a false FIR had been registered against him at the instance of the claimants. He denied driving the vehicle at a high speed, rashly and negligently. A similar plea was taken by the MD of Punjab State Bus Stand Management Private Limited, Chandigarh.The tribunal, however, directed the two to pay ₹19.83 lakh to the family. “As the bus is not insured, the amount is to be paid by the respondents jointly and severally together with costs; and interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realisation,” the tribunal ordered.While the widow, Manjula Devi, will get ₹3.83 lakh, her four unmarried daughters will get a total of ₹13 lakh and a married daughter will get ₹2 lakh.

The lab has already been set up in the medical college with the assistance of PATH, an international nonprofit health organisation. The training of 40 staffers who were already involved in RT-PCR testing at the college is starting from Wednesday. The virology lab of the Patiala medical college has already got the registration with the Indian SARS CoV2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG), a group of 28 virology labs from across the country, to conduct genome sequencing. Bangalore-based private pharmaceutical company Genotypic will provide training to the staff for 3 days starting from Wednesday. They have already trained few staffers in their lab in Nagpur. Samples from Punjab were being sent to the National Centre for Diseases Control in Delhi and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for the genome sequencing and their results were delayed due to heavy rush of samples from other states. Till date, Punjab has got tested 2,200 samples in these labs for genome sequencing, of which nearly 1,980 had the Delta variant, said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. “The idea is to test the variants regularly so that the strategy to deal with the virus is changed accordingly. At least 15 samples from our labs already conducing RT-PCR tests would be tested after every 15 days for whole genome sequencing. Positive samples of post-vaccination, re-infection cases, death cases, severe cases, clustering etc. would be sent for testing,” the nodal officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/genome-sequencing-to-start-at-gmch-patiala-in-first-week-of-august-101627415120847.html

Dulloo also informed that two PSA units were donated and commissioned by Maruti Udyog each at Jammu and Srinagar. “We have augmented our capacity and have more than sufficient plants. The work on remaining plants will be completed at the earliest,” he added.

28-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Look before you sit||The woman’s eyes are threatening to turn into two big tears. Beside her is painted a heart, embedded with these two words—Love You.And in this theatre of romance sit people like us—the auto rickshaw commuters. For this is the seat cover of an auto. “I got this new seat after the first lockdown” says driver Kishore Kumar, while driving a customer from Gurugram’s MG Road Metro station to Civil Lines.The yellow-and-green auto rickshaws of the Delhi region epitomise its distinct identity, like the yellow cabs of Kolkata, the red double-deckers of London, and the painted trucks of Pakistan.But the seats of the autos have long gone ignored, when often they are the auto’s showiest part. Though many auto seats are themed after the matter of love, you’ll be astounded at the dizzying variations of the bleeding heart symbol. The other much-exploited icon is the ubiquitous ‘Tum Kab Aoege’ figure—that classic image of a woman sitting with her face buried in her knees, silently wondering when her lover, the driver, will come back. Taj Mahal is another common sight on these seat covers.So, it is refreshing to find seat designs that go beyond romantic love. An auto in north Delhi’s Kashmiri Gate is evocative of Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre. It shows a ballerina dressed in white, her left arm raised upwards, her head turned to one side. An auto seat in Mahipalpur is spotted showing a panorama of a riverside village, with trees shaped like pagodas.Other sightings included Delhi’s Lotus Temple, actor Salman Khan holding a plate of boondi laddus, horses running in a jungle, and the famous “I’m flying” scene from the Titanic movie.Truth be told, many autos still consist of plain seat covers, but the scenario is gradually changing. It takes anything from ₹3,000 to ₹5,000 to get the upholstery revamped. These makeovers are done in Delhi’s so-called scooter markets of Dakshinpuri, Jheel, Hastinapur, and Janakpuri. In Gurugram, some such shops are situated on New Railway Road.This afternoon, auto driver Parmeshwar is waiting for customers outside Gurugram’s MG Road Metro station. His seat is plain blue. “Each driver makes his own choices,” he explains. “Some also fit their auto with disco lights and (music) deck, but I like being simple.” In a way, his seat too is a style statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-look-before-you-sit-101627413903794.html

28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Capt urges protesting govt employees to call off strike||Assuring all efforts to resolve their grievances, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday appealed to the striking state government employees to call off their agitation to prevent inconvenience to the people. Chairing a high-level meeting to review the demands of the striking employees, the chief minister expressed concern over their continued agitation, which has severely impacted the functioning of state government departments, according to an official spokesperson. The state government had constituted a committee of officials to look into the demands of the agitating employees. The committee examined, in detail, the demands of employees’ associations and had submitted its report. It found that certain demands raised by the employees were linked to the decisions of the government prior to 2006 and were in no way connected with the report of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission, the spokesperson said. As such, it was decided that these demands will be considered separately, based on the recommendations of the administrative department. The meeting further decided that certain demands linked with inta/inter departmental issues will be addressed in consultation with the departments of personnel and finance, the spokesperson said. Acceding to a long-pending demand of the employees, the Punjab government had decided to implement the recommendations of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission within a month of receipt of its report. The implementation of the commission’s recommendations with effect from July 1, 2021, has resulted in a financial outflow of ₹4,692 crore to approximately 2.85 lakh employees and 3.07 lakh pensioners every year. On an average, it works out to ₹79,250 per annum, over and above what they are getting at present. In addition, the government employees and pensioners will be getting arrears of ₹14,759 crore, which works out to an average of ₹2.32 lakh per employee/pensioner, the spokesperson said. The meeting was attended by local government minister Brahm Mohindra, finance minister Manpreet Badal, PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla, chief principal secretary to the chief minister Suresh Kumar, chief secretary Vini Mahajan, principal secretary to the chief minister Tejveer Singh and other senior officials of the departments of finance and personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-urges-protesting-govt-employees-to-call-off-strike-101627413561558.html

The seven parties have also requested the President to give them time to apprise him about the deadlock in Parliament due to the “intransigent attitude” of the NDA government, which is stonewalling all discussion on the three agricultural laws. The letter was signed by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on behalf of his party, besides representatives of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), National Congress Party (NCP), CPI-M, CPI, RLP and Jammu and Kashmir National Congress. It has also demanded a discussion on the need to probe the Pegasus spyware issue. In a statement, former minister and SAD’s Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal said the opposition parties briefed the President that they had been moving repeated adjournments to demand discussion on repeal of the three laws on agriculture, but the government refused to allow discussion on this most sensitive issue. The letter said a human tragedy was unfolding on the borders of Delhi with more than 550 farmers already having lost their lives during the course of the ongoing agitation. “The livelihoods of millions more are at stake due to the three agricultural laws, which have been made with the express purpose of handing over the agriculture sector to corporates, but the NDA government remains unmoved,” it read.BoxTwo Punjab Cong MPs stage dharna inside Lok SabhaNew Delhi: Congress MPs from Punjab Ravneet Singh Bittu and Gurjeet Singh Aujla sat on a dharna inside the Lok Sabha chamber on Tuesday after the proceedings of the House were adjourned for the day.The opposition has been disrupting the House since the beginning of the monsoon session of Parliament on July 19 demanding discussion on the three farm laws, besides alleged snooping of various political leaders using Pegasus spyware.As soon as the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day around 4.45pm, both Bittu and Aujla sat on a dharna inside the chamber.

Even the work on many ‘tiraths’ has not been completed yet.Around ₹64 lakh was spent on construction of five ponds, a ghat and a shed but the Panchdev ‘tirath’ in Karnal’s Padha village is in a poor state, Even the boundary wall is broken and a newly-constructed wall between two ponds has collapsed in the recent rains.When the issue was taken up with Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav, he said, “I will look into the matter and strict instructions will be issued for better upkeep of this ‘tirath’ by forming a village-level committee.”The condition of Surajkund ‘tirath’ located in Jyotinagar of Kurukshetra is also not satisfactory despite the KDB claiming to have allocated over ₹1.30 crore on development of this ‘tirath’ since 2015. As it is located in the middle of a residential colony, residents of the area often complain of dirty water in the ponds and weed on the ground.However, the KDB officials said the project could not be completed yet and the second phase is yet to be completed.Waterlogging on the main entrance of the Jyotisar ‘tirath’, where lakhs of people from across country visit every year, is a major challenge and people face problems during rains despite ₹12 lakh being spent on contraction of pavement and repair work.The Kotikut ‘tirath’ in Kaithal’s Keorak village on which ₹1.02 crore was spent by the KDB since 2018 requires efforts for cleanliness.“The government did a good job by developing this ‘tirath’ in our village but the water could not be released in the pond yet and in lack of water it has become a grazing ground for stray cattle,” said Ranjit Singh, of the village.Rasmangal ‘tirath’ in Jakholi village of Kaithal was found well maintained and construction of ghats, a conference hall and toilets is near completion with ₹1.05 crore.However, two years after ₹67 lakh were allocated for development of Chakra ‘tirath’ in Serdha village of Kaithal, the construction of this ‘tirath’ is in its initial stage.Similarly, the pond of Pundrik ‘tirath’ in Pundri town of Kaithal is also in a poor condition. “There is nobody to take care of it,” said Sonu Singh, a shopkeeper from near Pundrik ‘tirath’.On why the money was spent on the ‘tiraths’ related to Hindu mythology as the KDB was set up for overall development of Kurukshetra, KDB honorary secretary Madan Mohan Chhabra said, “We are not sending money to promote any religion or place but to provide facilities to people visiting these places as they need shelter, food, toilets, parking, etc.”He said the government is also going to develop a Sikh museum as all 10 Sikh gurus had visited Kurukshetra and a Buddha circuit will be developed by the Centre in Kurukshetra. The aim is to develop Kurukshetra as a cultural hub.Talking to HT, KDB member secretary Atul Dwivedi said he will take up the issue of lack of cleanliness and poor upkeep of the ‘tiraths’ with the CEO of the KDB.KDB chief executive officer (CEO) Anubhav Mehta said, “ There were some problems due to which the projects are not complete yet. Efforts will be made to ensure cleanliness of these ‘tiraths’.”He added that since most ‘tiraths’ are located in rural areas, they come under the village panchayats and the tenure of village panchayats was over. But with participation of local-level committees better facilities and cleanliness will be ensured, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cleanliness-of-tiraths-a-challenge-in-haryana-101627412369348.html
28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Gangster Preet Sekhon, two aides held from Ajnala village with arms||Police on Tuesday arrested notorious gangster Daya Singh, alias Preet Sekhon, and his two aides from Chamiari village, falling under the Ajnala sub-division. Sekhon is wanted in more than a dozen criminal cases, mostly of murder and extortion. The other two arrested are gangster Jarmanjit Singh alias Nikka Khaduria of Chamba Khurd village in Tarn Taran and one Gurlal Singh of Kamalpur village in Tarn Taran. Sekhon, who is the prime accused in the May-28 Patti shootout in which an Akali leader and his aide were killed, had been playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Punjab Police since December 2019. The police also recovered five pistols, a rifle, three mobile phones, a cache of bullets, two internet dongles, and a Maruti Swift car. Amritsar rural police and the organised crime control unit had a tip-off that the gangster had taken shelter in a house at Chamiari village. A team of nearly 100 policemen, including several deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) and station house officers (SHOs), sealed the entire village. Sources said, the gangster also opened fire at the police team and tried to flee, but to no avail. Before being nabbed, Sekhon posted a post on his Facebook page about being surrounded by police. According to police, gangster Nikka was also involved in Patti shootout. On May 28, two unidentified car-borne men opened indiscriminate fire at Amandeep Singh alias Aman Fauji (28), an Akali worker and a close aide of former minister Adesh Pratap Singh Kairon’s political adviser Gurmukh Singh Ghulla, and Prabhjit Singh, alias Pooran (27), killing them on the spot. One Samsher Singh alias Shera (30) had received bullet injury in the attack outside a tomb at Nadohar Chowk in Patti. Soon after the killing, two Facebook posts surfaced, one from a user who claimed himself from Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang and another from an account named after Preet Sekhon, claiming responsibility for the murders. Later, police identified Sekhon as the shooter and he reportedly committed the crime for ₹10 lakh at the ‘instance’ of gangster Lakhbir Singh alias Landa, who lives Canada. According to the police, Sekhon had allegedly killed his own sister and her mother-in-law in a Tarn Taran village in 2011. A case in this regard was registered at Tarn Taran Sadar police station. He reportedly came out of jail in 2018. Hailing from Sangna village in Amritsar, Sekhon had allegedly killed one Harjit Singh in Amritsar in December 2019. Sekhon was also wanted for shooting dead a bouncer in Amritsar in October last year. Sekhon was also booked on July 14 this year for allegedly opening fire at the Beas residence of singer Prem Dhillon, currently living in Canada. The singer’s family members had a narrow escape in the attack. Sekhon had allegedly demanded ₹10 lakh from Prem Dhillon on July 2. Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said, “Gurlal, who is currently on parole and accused in several criminal cases, including of murder, had given shelter to gangster Sekhon and Nikka at his in-laws’ house in the village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-preet-sekhon-two-aides-held-from-ajnala-village-with-arms-101627412240925.html

28-07-2021||Chandigarh||OP Chautala to meet politicians over forming third front||Former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala on Tuesday injected fresh vigour into the possibilities being explored to form a third front against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying he will meet ‘leaders of all political parties opposed to the BJP to stitch a strong third front’ and topple the Union government.The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo said in next one month he will travel across states to meet Opposition party leaders and unite all anti-BJP forces to form a third front.Chautala said he would like to make formal announcement of the third front on September 25 when the INLD has planned to hold a mega-rally to mark the birth anniversary of former deputy PM Devi Lal, with strong support base among the farmers.Chautala’s push for a third front comes close on the heels of recent reports of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar holding talks to assess possibilities to formulate a third front. Pawar had later said that third front cannot be formed without the Congress.“I will reach out to all Opposition parties. My aim is to unite all political forces opposed to this corrupt government at the Centre and stitch a robust third front. I will visit all states in the next one month. I’m going to have a luncheon meeting with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar next week. And I have close ties with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee,” Chautala said.Accusing the Centre of formulating anti-farmer policies, the former CM said all 36 communities of Haryana are participating in the ongoing agitation against the three farms laws.He said every section of the society and people from all religions are supporting the farmers’ stir, but the Union government is “not reading the writing on the wall”.“The country needs an alternative to the BJP as people across country are suffering,” Chautala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/op-chautala-to-meet-politicians-over-forming-third-front-101627412004081.html
28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Team Sidhu meets Capt, lists five demands for early action||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and four working presidents, who met chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday, demanded immediate action in sacrilege and police firing cases, arrest of “big fish” behind drug trafficking and rejection of three farm laws. These were among the five “priority areas”, which also included cancellation of “faulty” power purchase agreements and opening of doors for discussions with 20 protesting unions, listed by Sidhu and his team for immediate action in a letter handed over by the newly appointed state office-bearers of Punjab Congress to Amarinder at their first formal meeting. The government must act immediately upon these issues identified from amongst the 18-point agenda after multiple deliberations and consultations with party workers across Punjab to understand the public sentiment, read the one-page letter signed by Sidhu and working presidents Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Kuljit Nagra and Pawan Goel. The meeting, held at the chief minister’s office in Punjab Civil Secretariat, lasted close to one-and-a-half hours. Amarinder told Sidhu and others that all the key issues of concern raised by them are already in advanced stages of resolution, and that his government had been working on them in close coordination with the party. “The government has already implemented most of the promises made to the people in the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The other pending issues are also being resolved. The government is committed to the implementation of all the poll promises,” he told the newly constituted state Congress leadership. The chief minister also stressed the need to work closely together in the interest of the party and the state and its people. “The party leaders and workers need to take the pro-people decisions and actions of the government to the ground so that the people of Punjab could be made aware of all the excellent work done in the past four-plus years of the Congress government in the state,” he said, offering to meet the PPCC leaders on regular basis for better coordination. The new state Congress leadership, named by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on July 18 and took charge on July 23, called on the chief minister after Sidhu took time from him. In the letter, they said that Punjab needs a stern, decisive, inclusive and compassionate leadership more than ever before to fulfil the genuine demands of every Punjabi. “Punjab Congress workers stand firm in their resolve with our esteemed high command’s 18-point agenda,” they wrote, calling it their “guidebook” to deliver justice to every Punjabi. The 18-point to-do list, based on the feedback given by Capt’s detractors and others, was handed by the central leadership to the chief minister for implementation before next year’s state polls. PRIORITY POINTS Punish the main culprits behind sacrilege and police firing incidents at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan Arrest and give exemplary punishment to “big fish” behind drug trafficking mentioned in STF report Reject the Centre’s three farm laws completely.

28-07-2021||Other||Recall Maharashtra governor: Congress to Centre||The Maharashtra Congress has raised a strong objection to the statements by Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on former prime minister late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Terming Koshyari’s remarks as an insult to the people of the country, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole demanded that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs call him back immediately. Koshyari on Monday had criticised Nehru and said that the first PM’s policies weakened the country. “I admire Pandit Nahru, but he had the biggest weakness. He wanted to become a messenger of peace and release pigeons. Due to this weakness, the nation has become weak and remained in the same position for a long period,” he remarked. “Nehruji’s contribution to the country after independence helped India in becoming self-reliant in the world. The hatred toward Nehruji is the preaching of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and reflects in the governor’s remarks. The governor is expected to act as a constitutional head of the state by rising above politics. However, the statements by Koshyariji in the past exhibit the ideology of a particular organisation. He has been acting against the government and in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). If he has political aspirations, he should first resign from the constitutional post. The Union government should recall him immediately,” said Patole.Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “Patole’s demand to recall the honourable governor is a political stunt. It is an attempt to showcase the loyalty towards the Gandhi-Nehru families. There is nothing wrong in criticising Nehru.”Patole has also demanded the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to go for a judicial probe in the Pegasus case, on the lines of the investigation being done by the West Bengal government.“The Central government has failed to order an inquiry into the Pegasus row even after it came to the light that hundreds of influential people were under surveillance. The MVA government should initiate an inquiry by a retired high court judge on the lines of the inquiry announced by West Bengal government led by Mamata Banerjee. The phones of politicians, lawyers, social activists and journalists were hacked since 2017 as per the reports. In Maharashtra too, the phones of political leaders from opposition parties were tapped by the then Devendra Fadnavis government. It needs to be probed if there was any link with the phone hacking software developed by Israeli firm NSO Group,” he said. “I think the state government should admit Patole’s demand. A probe should also be conducted into Patole’s allegations that his phones, too, were being tapped,” remarked Bhandari, hinting at the earlier allegations made by the state Congress chief that he was being kept under surveillance by allies Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).The Pegasus row erupted on July 18, a night before the beginning of the current monsoon session of the Parliament, after an international investigative consortium reported that India was the among countries that had used NSO Group’s phone hacking software to potentially target politicians, journalists and activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/recall-maharashtra-governor-congress-to-centre-101627411580147.html
28-07-2021||Noida||GB Nagar health dept notice to 6 premises for failure to curb mosquito breeding||The Gautam Budh Nagar district health department has begun inspecting government and private premises for possible mosquito breeding sites and has issued notices to six establishments for failing to check the menace.“The notices have been issued to four residential societies and two private schools under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention and Control of Malaria, Dengue, Kala-azar and any Vector Borne Disease Regulations, 2016,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.As per the regulations, if the owner or occupant fails to clear stagnant water, the health department will issue a penalty against the person responsible.Most vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are reported in the months of July to November, which is also the monsoon season.The regulations were implemented in 2017 in Uttar Pradesh under Vector Borne Diseases Control Act. Since then, notices and penalties have been issued in the district every year, except in 2020 when the inspection could not be carried out because of the Covid-19 outbreak.According to official data, in 2017, 256 notices and 20 penalties were issued, to the tune ₹3,500. In 2018, 74 notices and 43 penalties were issued, amounting to ₹1,67,000. In 2019, 48 notices and 23 penalties were issued totalling ₹1,07,000. “From 2018, Gautam Budh Nagar fixed the penalties for violation of rules at ₹500 for small structures where water is allowed to collect, ₹1,000 for medium-sized structures and ₹2,000 for big structures,” said Sharma.The Aedes aegypti mosquito that causes vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya breed in still water that accumulates in old tyres, discarded vases and objects, utensils and coolers.Till the month of June, Gautam Budh Nagar has reported two malaria cases, but no dengue case. The report for July is yet to be released, said officials. Chief medical officer Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma said, “Health teams have been instructed to ensure all preventive measures are taken in order to control vector-borne diseases in the district.”Sharma further said that since Covid-19 outbreak, better hygiene and cleanliness are being maintained by citizens and hence the department expects fewer number of notices and penalties this year.“After the Covid-19 outbreak, people have become conscious of cleanliness and hygiene and there is an increase in awareness as well. Apart from these, the district health department keeps on holding awareness programmes in rural and urban areas to educate people about removing any stagnant water around their residential area. Hence, we hope that this year, we will see fewer number of penalties,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-health-dept-notice-to-6-premises-for-failure-to-curb-mosquito-breeding-101627411400108.html
28-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Seven residential segments have no Covid case in July||Covid-19 cases have decreased in Ghaziabad drastically since June, with seven residential segments not reporting even a single case this month so far. According to data from the district health department, the densely populated segments of Bhowapur near Kaushambi, Chandmari in Vijay Nagar, Ghookhna adjacent to Delhi-Meerut Road, Khoda, Maharajpur in Sahibabad Industrial Area, and Pasonda and Shaheed Nagar in Sahibabad have reported no fresh Covid-19 case in July so far. The localities of Vaishali, Vasundhara and Indirapuram have reported just one, two and four new cases, respectively, this July so far, shows the data. The records also indicated that during the period, the highest cases -- 10 -- were reported from Sadik Nagar comprising Raj Nagar Extension. “The cases have reduced, but the infection is still present. So we have to continue with testing and surveillance in the district. The vaccination coverage has also increased, and this has helped prevent the spread of the infection,” said Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, district surveillance officer. In June, only Shaheed Nagar segment had no fresh Covid-19 case.Experts said it is likely that the rate of seroprevalence could be higher in segments where cases have reduced. “Since these are densely populated areas, we expect that it (decline in cases) could be a result of high rate of seroprevalence -- about 60-70% -- indicating the beginnings of herd immunity. But, the health department should keep the daily testing at the same level and continue with it for at least another two months. They should also focus on testing of people coming from other states,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president, Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to the data, there were only 59 new cases in July so far, while the district had reported 324 cases in June. As a result of declining cases, the sample positivity rate in July (up to July 26) dropped to 0.06%, with 108,253 samples tested in the district. According to the state’s health bulletin, Ghaziabad, till July 26, has recorded 55,605 Covid-19 cases and a death toll of 461, with 21 active cases. Of the 21 active cases, eight patients were under home isolation, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-seven-residential-segments-have-no-covid-case-in-july-101627411280578.html

Commuters had a difficult time between 8am and 10am due to slow movement of traffic at Mahamaya Flyway, DND cut on Film City road, Labour Chowk and Kulesra in Dadri, among other areas. Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha 1 in Greater Noida, said he got stuck in traffic around 9.30am while going to Noida. “I was stuck in a traffic jam at Kulesra village for 30 minutes. The authorities should fix the waterlogging problem permanently,” he said. At some places, traffic was diverted to ensure smooth flow of vehicles, officials of the traffic police department said.CP Maurya, traffic inspector, GB Nagar, said that the traffic police personnel were deployed at different places. “Heavy rain affected the traffic movement at some places in the morning. We received some complaints of a traffic jam from Kulesra in Greater Noida. This road connects Surajpur to Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ). We visited the spot and found that both sides of the road were waterlogged. But Surajpur-NSEZ stretch was a bit less waterlogged. We divided this stretch to allow traffic from both sides and blocked the NSEZ-Surajpur side as it was waterlogged till the afternoon,” he said.The Noida traffic control room also received complaints of waterlogging at the Sector 60 underpass. Maurya said that the underpass gets waterlogged as it is in the low lying area. “The traffic was slow at this spot. Our personnel guided commuters to navigate through,” he said.The traffic also moved slowly on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway near DND Flyway loop. This is a significant road connecting the expressway to DND Flyway leading to Delhi. Similar situation was witnessed at Labour Chowk where people were seen wading through the knee-deep water. The rain had slowed down the traffic movement at the Model Town crossing in Sector 62 too. Meanwhile, waterlogging was also reported from some residential areas. Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of Sector 51 RWA, said that there was waterlogging between Sector 51 and Sector 52 metro stations from 8am to 9am. “It was very difficult for people to commute. The RWA members then drained out the water from the road using a pipe into the neighbourhood park and cleared the stretch,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/heavy-rain-slows-down-traffic-at-several-places-in-gbnagar-101627411220174.html

28-07-2021||Noida||Noida sees season’s highest rainfall||Moderate showers lashed the city on Tuesday, making weather soothing and bringing mercury down by a few notches. However, the rainfall, so far the best recorded in Noida since the arrival of monsoon on July 13 in the National Capital Region, left several roads waterlogged even as officials said that there were adequate measures in place to deal with the situation.The city will continue to see light to moderate rainfall for the next five days, the weather department predicted.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Noida saw moderate rains while neighbouring Delhi recorded heavy rainfall. Though the automatic weather monitoring station installed at Noida Sector 62 recorded very light rainfall, IMD officials said that the actual rainfall especially in the areas adjoining Delhi was high.“Noida received an average of 25mm rainfall on Tuesday. At some places, it would have been around 40-50mm. The city experienced moderate rain showers which was also evident from waterlogged streets at a few places during the morning hours. The weather monitoring station recorded only light rains because it would have been lesser rains in those areas. But as per the radar information, it was moderate rainfall day for Noida,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. According to IMD, a rainfall between 15mm and 65mm is considered moderate.Srivastava further said that there are chances of rains everyday till August 2. “The rains will continue for a few days. The intensity may fall slightly on July 29. However, it will pick up from July 30 again and continue till August 2. On July 31, the rainfall intensity is likely to be maximum,” he said.On Tuesday, IMD recorded maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida at 30.2°C and 26.6°C against 32.9°C and 29°C a day earlier.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 29.5°C, five degrees below the season’s average and 25°C, two degrees below the season’s average. The humidity level oscillated between 100% and 79%.Meanwhile, waterlogging and traffic snarls were reported from several areas of the city during the morning, including DND cut, near Dalit Prerna Sthal, below Mahamaya Flyover, Labour Chowk, and Sector 58, among others. However, officials of the Noida authority said that the situation has improved compared to last year.“It often takes a few minutes for the rainwater to clear from roads whenever the rain intensity is high. Compared to the situation in Delhi or Gurugram, we have done much better. Measures have been taken to deal with three major waterlogging -prone spots in the city. At DND cut, we have a sump that channelises the water and at Dalit Prerna Sthal and areas under Mahamaya flyover, we have fixed the drains. We also use pumps at some congested areas like Khoda where rainwater gets logged,” said PK Kaushik, general manager (water), Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sees-season-s-highest-rainfall-101627411160104.html

One of the accused is still absconding and hunt for him is on. According to police, the killings were the outcome of money transactions that took place between the main accused and the victim woman who were cousins. The children were killed because they knew the main accused who was a frequent visitor to their house and owed ₹3 lakh to the woman. Addressing the media on Tuesday evening, inspector general (IG) of Agra range Naveen Arora claimed that the blind case had been worked out with the arrest of two people, including the main accused. “These three accused were Santosh Rathore, Anshul Rathore and Dheeru Valmiki. Santosh Rathore, the main accused, was related to the victim woman Rekha Rathore and they used to celebrate Rakshabandhan,” informed Arora. “Santosh Rathore had taken about ₹2 to 3 lakh from Rekha Rathore as well as a scooter. Santosh believed that Rekha might have received heavy cash after being divorced from her husband. So, he planned to eliminate her. He took two of his associates Anshul Rathore and Dheeru Valmiki to her house on July 21. Santosh had assured his associates of a share in the loot,” said the IG. “It is believed that the three accused stayed for three to four hours in the house and first killed Rekha and then her three minor children before moving out with cash and jewellery. The accused had brought tablets to intoxicate the children and killed all with knife and scissors one by one,” said Arora. “Santosh Rathore and Dheeru Valmiki have been arrested and search is on to nab Anshul Rathore who too is related to Santosh Rathore. The successful police team has been awarded Rs. 25,000,” added Naveen Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-three-kids-murder-case-workedout-two-arrested-101627410740047.html
28-07-2021||Pune||Continuous rain exposes civic work: Potholes on all major roads in Pune city||Continuous rain in the city over the past four days has exposed the Pune Municipal Corporation’s poor road resurfacing work undertaken as part of its pre-monsoon preparations.The PMC is also in the process of laying pipelines for its 24x7 water scheme, because of which, several roads were dug up before the rains began. Currently, potholes have developed on all prominent roads in the city. VJ Kulkarni, head of the road department said, “It is true that potholes have developed on the roads, which were mainly dug-up for various works. Once a road gets dug-up, the ‘life’ of that road reduces.”Kulkarni added, “Once the rains take a break, we will start to clear the potholes. This cannot be done in the rain.”During lockdown, PMC carried road works on Tilak road, Bajirao road, Shivaji road, and Sahakarnagar among other parts of the city. The allegation by residents and activists, especially those residing in areas with these pothole-ridden roads, is that the PMC, after digging-up the roads, re-surface it with cement. “The rest of the road is tar and the part which got dug-up is now levelled by pouring cement. This cement has come out in the rain causing potholes,” said one angry resident on Tilak road, requesting anonymity.Recently, the BJP, the ruling party in the civic body, had issued a statement saying, “Citizens must co-operate with the civic body as it is executing the water project. Water lines are getting changed. Due to development works, roads getting dug up.”The PMC’s road department said that as roads are being dug-up for the water project, more money will have to be set aside on for road maintenance in the future. Under the 24x7 water project, a total of 1,800 km of roads will be dug-up for laying of pipelines in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/continuous-rain-exposes-civic-work-potholes-on-all-major-roads-in-city-101627410441703.html
28-07-2021||Pune||COEP begins survey of landslide-prone areas in 34 merged villages||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has appointed the College of Engineering of Pune (COEP), to survey the 34 villages merged into its limits for areas prone to landslides.This comes in the wake of a major landslide following heavy rain in Taliye village, Raigad district that killed 53 villagers and left 31 still missing.COEP has already begun work on the survey and a report will be submitted to the PMC in August. Recently, the State government merged 23 villages with the PMC, and in 2017, 11 fringe villages were also made part of the corporation.Yuvraj Deshmukh, superintendent engineer of the building permission and development department, said, “Against the backdrop of the Raigad landslide incident, we have taken the decision to survey landslide-prone areas in the merged villages. We have assigned the work to the COEP.”“The corporation wants the survey to reveal unauthorised construction at the foothills, as well illegal constructions on the hills,” he added.Professor B G Birajdar, applied mechanical department, COEP, said, “We have started work and it will be completed before next month.”COEP will check the soil and slopes of hilly areas. It will categorise the areas as low, medium, and high risk. It will also suggest remedies to tackle the situation and take precautionary measures. Second survey of landslide-prone areasAfter a major landslike at Malin village in Ambegaon taluka of Pune district in 2014, PMC surveyed landslide prone-areas in Pune city. That survey was also done by the COEP.Deshmukh said, “As per that report, we removed unauthorised constructions in Warje and carried out a strengthening process as recommended by the COEP. That report highlighted Warje and the Baner gaothan area. We took precautionary measures.”According to the PMC disaster management department, there are six land- and mud-sliding areas in the city - Dukkar Khind (between Chandani chowk and Warje) and the new Katraj tunnel road are landslide-prone areas. Whereas Kelwadi (Kothrud), Warje hill and Parvati hill are mudslide-prone areas.Landslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. It can happen after heavy rain, droughts, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides usually begin on steep slopes and can be triggered by natural disasters. Areas where wildfires or construction have destroyed vegetation on slopes are at high-risk of a landslide during and after heavy rains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/coep-begins-survey-of-landslide-prone-areas-in-34-merged-villages-101627410440632.html
28-07-2021||Pune||Grandpa, 90, pens years’ old tale for great-grandchildren during Covid||PUNE Unlike a majority of people who found the Covid-induced lockdowns boring and stifling, Vishnu Joshi, 90, an ex-student of Deccan Education Society’s New English School Ramanbaug, Pune, put all that time to good use by turning his passion for storytelling into concrete reality.Joshi, who loves to regale everyone with stories, managed to write a tale he had narrated to his grandchild 15 to 16 years ago and even got it published as a book titled, “Why the Rose has thorns?” which was launched on Saturday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of New English School Ramanbaug. What’s more, the book is now available in 12 languages, both Indian and foreign, into which it was painstakingly translated.Recalling his experience, Joshi said, “During Covid, I made it a habit to write every day for an hour using my computer (which he learned at the age of 70). I remembered the story I had narrated to my grandson and penned it.”Reminiscing how an old story came to life as a book, the voracious reader and budding author said, “I am an engineer by profession, and it was while I was looking after a factory at Khanapur near Belgaum that I visited a rose garden near Asogaon. My grandson had accompanied me and while we enjoyed the beauty of the many varieties of roses, he asked the owner of the garden whether he could pluck a rose. After the owner allowed him to do so, he plucked a rose but its thorns pricked his finger and he started crying. The owner crushed the leaves and petals of the very same rose into an ointment of sorts which he applied on my grandson’s wound. My grandson stopped crying but kept pestering me as to why the rose plant has thorns. I then narrated to him the tale of how Lord Shankar and his consort Goddess Parvati visited the Earth as commoners when they felt thirsty and asked a local gardener for water. Instead of water though, the gardener gave them gulkand (sweet made from rose petals) which Goddess Parvati had never tasted…”“Why the Rose has thorns” is dedicated to Joshi’s nine great-grandchildren whom he rarely gets to meet. In his dedication in the book, Joshi has said that the energy drawn from watching children play along with the discipline and values he was taught at Balranjan Kendra, Bharati Niwas, made it possible for him to write the book.Joshi said that after he showed the completed script to his daughters and grandchildren, they were pleasantly surprised. Joshi’s daughter, Savita Kelkar, remembered, “After my father wrote this story, it became a family affair, which brought us a lot of joy and a chance to interact with each other. It was read aloud before the grandchildren in Marathi and English and reactions and suggestions were noted and words were added to and deleted from the script.” Being a translator by profession, she decided to reach out to the larger public with this simple story and consequently, the book got translated into 12 (Indian and foreign) languages.“Many of my friends volunteered and we now have this book in 12 languages. With my translation in German, others like Ujjwala Chaphalkar Anderson from Sweden (who is translating it in Swedish) were inspired to take the project further,” said Savita.Joshi’s book is now available in Urdu, translated by Sahida Inamdar; Hindi by Shipra Chaturvedi from Lucknow; Khasi by Rebekah Tham from Shillong; Odiya by Dusmant Kumar Chakra; Kannada by Shobha Joshi and Shobha Panchangmath; French by Jaya Gadgil; Russian by Rohini Joshi; Spanish by Darshana Thatte; Sanskrit by Swati Yadnopavit; Gujarati by Surbhi Bhagwat; Chinese by Yashoghara Gadgil; and Japanese by Swati Bhagwat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/grandpa-90-pens-years-old-tale-for-great-grandchildren-during-covid-101627410379992.html
28-07-2021||Pune||Only 16 of 50 oxygen plants operational in Pune district||PUNE As the daily requirement of medical oxygen in Pune district rose to nearly 421 MT at the peak of the second Covid-19 wave, the Pune district administration in May proposed setting up around 50 oxygen generation plants at public hospitals under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), and rural parts of the district to ease scarcity of medical oxygen and also prepare for a possible third wave. However, of the 50 proposed plants, only 16 have become operational till the end of July even as officials claim that the remaining 34 will soon become active.Of the 16 oxygen generation plants that have become operational, six are under the PMC; two under the PCMC; and eight in rural parts of Pune district. “Six oxygen generation plants have become operational under the PMC while six more are in the pipeline,” said Dr Ashish Bharati, head of the health department, PMC. The six operational plants under the PMC are at hospitals crucial in the treatment of Covid patients namely, Naidu Hospital, Dalvi Hospital, Baner (old) Hospital, and Laigude Hospital. The six plants in the pipeline have been proposed at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, Khedekar Hospital and Annasaheb Magar Hospital among others.Between the 16 oxygen generation plants that have become operational, a total of 13,169 LPM (litres per minute) of oxygen is generated. If the remaining 34 oxygen generation plants also turn operational, the oxygen generation capacity is expected to increase up to 37,267 LPM. The Pune district currently has a medical oxygen storage capacity of 3348.8 MT. Work on the 34 oxygen generation plants is currently in different stages. Funds for these plants are gathered out of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the mayor’s funds, civic bodies’ budgets, and the district planning development committee.Apart from the eight operational plants, 24 more have been proposed in the rural parts of Pune district. “Some of the proposed plants are expected to be operational by August 31. Work on them is in progress,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/only-16-of-50-oxygen-plants-operational-101627410323168.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||30 schools to be affiliated to new Delhi state board, says Sisodia||New Delhi: Thirty government schools will be affiliated to the newly formed Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) in the upcoming 2021-22 academic session, of which 20 will be the Schools of Specialised Excellence (SoSE), deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday.Admissions to Class 9 and 11 of these special schools will begin by August 15 as a part of the first phase, he said.“The Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) will affiliate 30 Delhi government schools in the session 2021-22. We will roll out this year with 20 Schools of Specialised Excellence and 10 general schools. The 20 SoSE spread across Delhi will be launched by August 15,” Sisodia said.The decision was taken during the second general body meeting of SoSE and DBSE officials presided by Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio. Following the meeting, the government also announced that the department was partnering with global institutes to hold consultations on the board.“Our vision is to create government schools in Delhi that would be at par with the international schools in the coming years. In order to create progressive curriculum and assessment structures for Delhi schools, the Delhi Board of School Education is partnering with the renowned research and assessment organisation Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER), which is credited with designing the globally recognised Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA),” Sisodia said.The Delhi Cabinet on March 22 approved setting up 100 schools of specialised excellence across the city for students of classes 9 to 12. These schools will focus on four domains -- science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), humanities, performing and visual arts and ‘high- end 21st century skills’.In a statement released on Tuesday, the government said admissions for Classes 9 and 11 in STEM schools and Class 9 in the other three SoSE domains will begin shortly. “Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) will provide technical and managerial support to DBSE and SoSE respectively,” the statement said.Of these 20 SoSEs in the first phase, eight schools will specialise in STEM, five schools each specialise in humanities and skills, and two schools specialising in Performing and Visual Arts.Sisodia further said in the next academic session, a total of about 100 Schools of Specialised Excellence will be formed -- with all four domains available in every educational zone of Delhi -- so that children of all parts of Delhi can access specialised schools in their neighbourhoods. All of these schools will be affiliated to DBSE.Detailing the modalities, the deputy chief minister said the students at SoSEs will receive excellent learning opportunities in the area of their interest that will enable them to join some of the best universities and institutions in the country and abroad. “It is important to identify and provide specialised education to students who have a specific aptitude and deep interest. In the first year, admissions will be offered in Class 9 in SoSEs in humanities, performing and visual arts, and high-end 21st century skills, whereas, in the STEM schools, admissions will be offered at the 9th and 11th grade levels. Students seeking admission in SoSEs will have to take an aptitude test. The schedule of admission will be announced later,” he said.Currently, there are about 1,000 government and 1,700 private schools in Delhi, nearly all of which are affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).In July last year, the Delhi government constituted two committees to prepare the scheme and framework for the formation of the state education board and for curriculum reforms.The Delhi Cabinet approved the setting up of the DBSE on March 6, following which the society for the Board was registered on March 19. Announcing the cabinet approval, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the present education system focuses only on learning by rote that needs to be changed. He added that high-end methods will be used to teach students of schools affiliated to the new education board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/30-schools-to-be-affiliated-to-new-delhi-state-board-says-sisodia-101627409719914.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||DTC buses clock bigger spike in ridership than the Delhi Metro||The daily bus ridership of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) spiked by around 36% on Monday compared to a week ago when only 50% of the seating occupancy was allowed in the buses, the DTC said on Tuesday. The jump in ridership after the latest Covid-19 relaxation was steeper than that of the Delhi Metro, which registered an increase in ridership of only about 9.3% on Monday, data analysed by HT showed.Buses and the Delhi Metro were operating with 50% seating capacity till Sunday. This has been increased to 100% from Monday, but no standing passengers are allowed inside buses or the Metro. So effectively a DTC bus can now carry 33 passengers (excluding the driver and conductor), while a Metro coach can carry 50 people (400 for an entire train).DTC data showed that last Monday (July 19), its fleet of 3,760 buses carried 1,102,513 passengers. During that period, buses were allowed to ply with only 50% seating capacity. On Monday (July 26), when the restriction was lifted to allow 100% seating capacity, the ridership increased to 1,522,444. Similarly, the total earning of the DTC through tickets also increased from ₹1.01 crore to ₹1.58 crore on the days mentioned above. This means that the per bus earning last week was around ₹3,450 which increased to ₹4,611 this week after the relaxation.“Compared to the pre-pandemic days, the average daily bus ridership, even after the relaxation, is less by around 1.6 million. Till March 2020, for example, the DTC used to carry around 3.2 million passengers every day,” said RS Minhas, deputy chief general manager (public relations), DTC.The Delhi Metro, which also started operating with 100% seating capacity from Monday, witnessed at least 1.75 million passenger trips on day one after the relaxation, as compared to the usual 1.6 million passenger trips seen on Mondays.The combined DTC and cluster bus fleet in Delhi currently is 6,750 - the highest in nearly a decade. It was during the 2010 Commonwealth Games that Delhi last operated around 6,000 buses. However, the city needs 11,000 buses, according to a government affidavit submitted to the high court in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dtc-buses-clock-bigger-spike-in-ridership-than-the-delhi-metro-101627409660435.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||Black fungus: Delhi hospitals can now refer patients to pvt health centres||The Delhi government has allowed its hospitals to refer patients of mucormycosis, popularly known as black fungus, to private hospitals for surgeries if the waiting period is more than seven days.The measure has been taken under the government’s existing scheme of Delhi Arogya Kosh that allows state-run hospitals to refer patients in need of over 1,000 surgeries and procedures, which the Delhi government has identified that can be referred to private centres, if there is a long waiting period or the service is unavailable.However, the waiting period at government hospitals for other procedures and surgeries has to be over a month for a patient to be referred out. Keeping in mind the urgent surgery that patients with mucormycosis need, the waiting period has been reduced to seven days.“In view of the limited capacity for performing surgeries pertaining to mucormycosis in Delhi government hospitals … eligible patients (resident of Delhi identified on the basis of voter ID of Delhi) … may be referred to empaneled private hospitals under cashless scheme of Delhi Arogya Kosh if allotted date of surgery in the concerned Delhi government hospital is beyond seven days,” said the order signed by director general of health services Dr Nutan Mundeja.This will help patients admitted to some state government hospitals where the ENT department, which handles cases of mucormycosis, are scheduled to do surgeries only on a few days of the week. The government designated three of its hospitals – Lok Nayak, Guru Teg Bahadur, and Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital – for dedicated treatment of patients with the fungal infection.The decision of the Delhi government comes at a times when new cases of the fungal infection have already gone down in the city. A doctor from Lok Nayak hospital said, “Now, we are getting maybe one case a week. At its peak, we used to get five to six new mucormycosis patients each day”The hospitals, however, are still running full with patients of the fungal infection needing hospitalisation for a month on average.Data accessed by HT shows that Delhi has recorded at least 1,656 cases of mucormycosis so far, of which 952 are active cases.Private hospitals are treating 402 cases in the city, which is the maximum among the three hospital categories in the city. The Delhi government hospitals are treating 302 cases, while Central government hospitals have 248 cases.A senior doctor from Guru Teg Bahadur hospital said, “There is some waiting for the mucormycosis surgeries because the ENT department has only two OT (operation theatre) days.” A second doctor from Lok Nayak hospital, however, claimed they were able to bring down the waiting period by opening up the OTs on Sunday.“With so many patients in need of surgery, the hospital had to increase hours for ENT and eye surgery. Now, we are performing surgeries even on Sundays to cut down on the waiting time, which has reduced from a week or ten days to maximum three days,” said the doctor from Lok Nayak hospital.Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that started surging in the city after the second wave of Covid-19 wave in April-May. The infection is largely affecting those who recently contracted Covid-19, have uncontrolled blood sugar levels and were administered steroids during the treatment of the viral infection.Mucormycosis has a fatality of over 50% and others face facial disfigurement as a result of surgeries to remove the dead tissues.The total requirement of Amphotericin-B--the vital drug required for the treatment of mucormycosis-- in Delhi is about 150,000. “Delhi has been alloted a total of 39,680 vials of Amphotericin-B, of which 30,880 vials have been received and distributed to hospitals. At least 8,800 vials are awaited,” said the government document, which HT has seen.To address the shortage of such medicines, the Delhi government is now procuring more injections. It is buying 6,700 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B and 25,000 vials of Amphotericin Lipid Complex, said a health official on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/black-fungus-delhi-hospitals-can-now-refer-patients-to-pvt-health-centres-101627409661109.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||Waterlogged road forces DMRC to briefly shut Saket Metro station||Heavy rains on Tuesday flooded the road outside south Delhi’s Saket Metro station, forcing the the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to shut the entry and exit gates to the station for about two and a half hours in the afternoon.Many commuters posted photographs and videos of the waterlogged road leading to the station on social media. In one such video, stranded commuters could be seen waving to a DTC low-floor bus, signalling it to rescue them from the spot.“Service Update: Trains are currently not stopping at Saket metro station. Entry/exit gates have been closed due to waterlogging. Services otherwise normal on the entire Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli -HUDA city centre),” the DMRC tweeted at 12.24pm.According to DMRC officials, the primary reason to halt services on the line briefly was because the entry and exit points were waterlogged. “The area outside was flooded and there was no way passengers could get in. The services were resumed at the station shortly after the water receded,” said a senior DMRC official, who did not wish to be named.According to PWD officials, the stretch outside the station was inundated because of a depression on the road. “The rainfall was heavy and hence the accumulated water took few hours to clear. Four pumps were installed to help clear excess rainwater from the road,” said a PWD official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/waterlogged-road-forces-dmrc-to-briefly-shut-saket-metro-station-101627409659917.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||National child rights body justifies probe into child care homes||The National Commission for Child Rights Protection (NCPCR) has justified in the Delhi high court the criminal investigation against two child care homes run by Centre for Equity Studies (CES), where social activist Harsh Mander is a director.The statutory body, in an affidavit filed in the high court, has prima facie observed that inadequate facilities were being given to children and there were several violations, such as financial irregularities, and instances of sexual assaults in 2012, 2013 and 2016 in the boy’s shelter home.“The Commission... from an employee of the home has received information that the cases of sexual abuse are still prevalent in the Home (for boys) and there is no reporting being done of the same. The non-reporting of such POCSO offences by the staff of the home is a serious offence under POCSO Act, 2012 and also jeopardizes the welfare and well-being of children in this home,” said the NCPCR.Reasoning the recommendations on which an FIR was registered against two child care homes-- Umeed Aman Ghar, a home for boys, and Khushi Rainbow Home, a residence for girls—the commission told Justice Rekha Palli that children were used for protest as four to five girls were taken to Jantar Mantar to agitate against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) last year.The children, in an interaction with the commission, said they sat for some time at the protest site but later returned due to the sultry heat.The court on Tuesday took the NCPCR’s response on record and posted the matter for further hearing in January.The NCPCR’s response comes after the two child care homes moved high court through their counsel Sarim Naved challenging the recommendations of the NCPCR, on the basis of which a show cause notice was issued by the Delhi government. Subsequently, an FIR was also registered against the two homes on various charges.The plea also sought quashing of the show cause notice issued by the Delhi government and stated the inspection was carried out at the homes in violation of the Juvenile Justice Act and rules.The two NGOs were raided on October 1 by the NCPCR, following which they submitted their findings to the police. In its recommendations, the commission reported a host of abuse and irregularities such as sexual abuse, using the children for anti-CAA protests, not providing them the right living conditions, Covid-19 norm violations, among others, said the police earlier.On April 7, the court sought to know the procedure that was followed in recommending action against the two child care homes.Responding to the queries of the court, the commission said during inspection, they found there were frequent visits by foreign nationals for providing voluntary services in this institution. However, it was unclear that on what grounds these foreign nationals were permitted to give voluntary services in these institutions and interact with children while their visit to India was for other purposes.Raising questions on the infrastructure of the NGOs, NCPCR said the building of the institution was covered with tin shed, which was not in line with safety and security measures.It said the sleeping material was not properly cleaned /sanitized regularly or before reuse as needed and they were not regularly fumigated.“It was also observed that some of the girls were staying in a tin shaded room connected with iron staircase, which was very risky and dangerous. It was seen that there was one double storey porta cabin and that the stairs were hazardous. Also, the rooms of dormitories were not well lit, ventilated and were tin shaded with inadequate sunlight and dampness in many of them,” said the NCPCR in its affidavit.The children’s body said even though rules provide for the segregation of children, during inspection, it found minor children were mingling with the elder ones.It said the police verification of all the staff members was not done and neither the qualification of the teachers was in consonance with the norms.Earlier, the DCPCR and the Delhi government’s social welfare department informed the court that based on the recommendations of the NCPCR, the State Inspection Committee conducted an inspection and found that the children were very happy and content at the care home.The city government earlier told the court that they just issued a show cause notice to the child care homes and put their registration on abeyance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/national-child-rights-body-justifies-probe-into-child-care-homes-101627409601932.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||Two murders in 10 hours in Delhi, elderly targeted||Two people were murdered in two separate incidents within a span of 10 hours between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Personal enmity was the prime reason behind both the killings, said police.In the first incident that took place in east Delhi’s Anand Vihar around on Monday evening, a 42-year-old rickshaw puller allegedly stabbed a 51-year-old woman, Neelam, at least thrice near a bus stop close to a private hospital, where she worked as a sanitation worker. She was rushed to Hedgewar hospital where she died during treatment, said police.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said the attacker, Vedpal, was known to the woman for the last 10 years, as she used to take his cycle rickshaw to commute between her home and the workplace.“Vedpal told us that he was angry with the woman because she stopped taking his rickshaw. She had also filed a police complaint against him for assaulting her in January this year, for which Vedpal was booked,” said the DCP.Police said Neelam lived with her daughter in Vishwas Nagar while her husband works in Mumbai. Her two other children – a daughter and a son – are married and live with their families.Around 8 pm on Monday, Neelam finished work at the hospital and was waiting for her son near the Anand Vihar community centre, when Vedpal arrived and a scuffle broke out between the two. Vedpal took out a knife and stabbed Neelam twice in her abdomen and once on the shoulder. She screamed for help and collapsed on the road. Some passersby caught Vedpal and informed police.“Vedpal claims that Neelam slapped him and he killed her in a fit of rage. However, he has no explanation as to why he was carrying the knife. We suspect he had come prepared to kill the woman,” said an investigator.Nearly 10 hours after Neelam’s murder, Ajeet Singh (62) was shot dead while he was asleep outside his house in southwest Delhi’s Palam Extension on early Tuesday morning. Singh was shot in his forehead from a close range, said police.“Singh’s family members were carrying out some construction work, that was met with opposition from their relatives. There was a quarrel over that issue on Monday. Singh’s nephew Rajbir had threatened to kill them. Singh’s family members suspect the role of their relatives, who live next door, in his murder. We are investigating the case,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.According to Meena, the murder came to light after Singh’s wife went to wake her husband and found him dead. She alerted her family members and her son informed police about it. An empty bullet shell was found on the bed on which Singh was sleeping, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-murders-in-10-hours-in-delhi-elderly-targeted-101627409599999.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||100mm rain in 3 hours on Tuesday makes it Delhi’s wettest July in 18 years||Season’s heaviest rain in Delhi on Tuesday morning inundated key road stretches and low-lying areas, flooded residential colonies and led to long traffic jams.The Safdarjung observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded 100mm rainfall in just three hours (between 5.30 am and 8.30 am) on Tuesday morning, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Another 1.8 mm rain was recorded from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm. IMD data shows that the Delhi has recorded 381mm rainfall so far this month, the highest for July since 2003 when the national capital recorded 632.2mm. Normally, Delhi records 210.6 mm precipitation in July.On Tuesday, the Palam weather station saw the heaviest rainfall with 68 mm 24-hour rain ending at 8.30 am and another 59.4 mm during the day ending at 5.30pm. The Lodhi Road station recorded 86.8mm rain over the past 24 hours and another 0.5mm during the day. Aya Nagar station got 69.8mm 24-hour rainfall and another 27.4 mm throughout the day. Delhi Ridge station received 38.2 mm 24-hour rainfall with another 6.3mm during the day.The IMD rain guages define 24-hour rainfall from 8.30am of a day to 8.30am the next day.“With some days still left for July-end and more showers are likely, the cumulative rainfall count for the month could even surpass previous records. Light to moderate showers are predicted even on Wednesday. Besides, another spell of moderate rain is likely to hit the city on July 30-31,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD’s head of regional weather forecasting centre.With Tuesday’s rain, Srivastava added, July already has a surplus rainfall of 108% at the Safdarjung observatory. “The maximum rainfall in Delhi is observed between July 10 and August-end. Moreover, Delhi sees more frequent spells of rainfall in August when easterly winds and the positioning of the monsoon trough, the primary conditions for rainfall, are favourable. So far it seems that Delhi is likely to have a normal monsoon,” he said.According to Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology), Skymet Weather, the number of rain days has reduced over the last few years, and extreme weather events have increased. “Cities are recording more rainfall in a shorter period of time. Earlier, 100 mm rainfall would occur over three to four days. Now, we have been receiving this much precipitation in just five-six hours,” he said.Waterlogging and jams across cityAccording to the Delhi traffic police, nearly 50 stretches were inundated and pumps were installed to flush out excess water. “Most of these stretches are from the list of 150-odd waterlogging-prone points across the city, which is shared with the civic and road management agencies every year ahead of the monsoon,” said a senior police officer asking not to be named.At least 11 vehicles, including state-run buses, broke down on different stretches, including Tilak Nagar, Badarpur, Dhuala Kuan, and traffic had to be diverted to alternate routes or slip roads. There were also reports of low-floor buses getting inundated and passengers stranded inside them being rescued by rickshaws, said the official.“A portion of a road caved in at the Rafi Marg crossing. Traffic from the stretch between Rail Bhawan and Sunehri Bagh Road was diverted to Dr Rajendra Prasad Road via Janpath,” said the official.As per data shared by the traffic police, the other stretches that were submerged in knee-deep water causing long traffic snarls include Pul Prahladpur underpass (both carriageways), 11 Murti Marg, Red Cross Road, Dwarka underpass, Sardar Patel Marg to Dhaula Kuan, road outside Qutub Minar Metro station, Mehrauli-Badarpur (MB) Road, Tilak Nagar, IP Estate, Vikas Marg, Africa Avenue, Seelampur flyover-Dilshad Garden, Zakhira underpass, Azad Market, among others.Commuters stuck in traffic jams tweeted photos, tagging the Delhi traffic police and other authorities, seeking help.“Continuous standing here since last 1 hour...Huge traffic jam..plz help...MB Road, South Delhi,” tweeted Rishang Sharma at 12.13pm.“Just one rain again and whole Delhi seems to have come to a standstill!! Stuck in huge traffic jam near Dhaula kuan,” tweeted Pankaj Roy at 9.34am.The Delhi Traffic Police also tweeted updates about waterlogging and the areas where traffic movement was affected.Trees uprooted, residential areas floodedData shared by the police and the three municipal corporations showed that the heavy showers also led to over 20 trees being uprooted across Delhi.Besides, residential colonies also reported flooding. Areas such as Saket, Vasant Kunj, Munirka, CR Park, Lajpat Nagar, Maharani Bagh, Mayapuri, Kailash Colony, Dwarka, RK Puram, Alaknanda apartments, Khanpur, Uttam Nagar, New Rajendra Ngaar, Karol Bagh, Anand Parbat, Ashok Vihar and Laxmi Nagar reported waterlogging during the day.Municipal corporations blamed the PWD and the state’s irrigation and flood control (I&FC) department for not cleaning up stormwater drains along arterial roads that they said overflow on internal streets.“Every monsoon, the major stretches get submerged in water causing major trouble to commuters. This is mainly because the major drains under the PWD are not being maintained, even causing them to overflow to residential lanes,” said South Corporation mayor Mukesh Suryan.However, PWD officials said that they do not want to engage in the blame game. “Where there is heavy rain, low-lying areas do get flooded. We take immediate action and install pumps to flush out the excess water. There are long-term plans underway to combat the problem,” a senior PWD official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/100mm-rain-in-3-hours-on-tuesday-makes-it-delhi-s-wettest-july-in-18-years-101627409540663.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||Minto Bridge to get a permanent waterlogging solution||An independent drain along Minto Road in central Delhi that came up in April this year as a trial measure to prevent the perennial waterlogging problem underneath the Minto Bridge has succeeded in resolving the issue, and the public works department (PWD) plans to widen the new drain after the monsoon, said a senior government official on Tuesday.The Minto Bridge success story was highlighted in the last drainage review meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on July 19, which was also attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi PWD minister Satyendar Jain, said the official adding that the decision to widen the new independent drainage system on Minto Road was taken in that meeting.“There was no waterlogging underneath Minto Bridge because of elaborate arrangements made there to avoid water accumulation. Nine pumps have been installed to flush out water from Minto bridge. Sound alarms along with blinkers and CCTVs have also been set up near the bridge for swift action and real time monitoring,” said an official on Tuesday.He further said, “Other than increasing monitoring, case specific solutions were also adopted in the Minto bridge waterlogging case. Usually, water from Minto Bridge area used to get mixed with a sewer line of DJB on DDU Marg, which used to cause back flow of water and eventually lead to waterlogging in the area. To prevent that, we did an experiment by making a new drain along the Minto Road so that storm water no longer merged with the sewer drain. Now, there is no waterlogging underneath Minto Bridge because of the independent drainage system there. The experiment has worked.”The official further said the work on widening the drain will start after this monsoon and it should be finished this year.After the July 19 meeting, Kejriwal said that the Delhi government will redesign the city’s drainage system and identify more waterlogging hot spots so that area-specific interventions can be made to ensure smooth flow of traffic and people’s safety.Citing the Minto Bridge example he said, “I am pleased with the work done by our agencies... In Delhi, it is said if Minto Bridge gets waterlogged, then monsoons have begun in the city. But, this time, Minto Bridge is the talk of the town for all the good reasons… We know of 147 such vulnerable points. If we conduct extensive mapping, we can enlist all possible vulnerable points. If solutions for all vulnerable points are planned and worked towards like the Minto Bridge, then we can bring Delhi freedom from waterlogging.”Following rains on Monday and Tuesday last week, traffic from at least 20 underpasses across the city was diverted after they were all flooded with rainwater. On Monday, a man drowned at the flooded Pul Prahladpur underpass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/minto-bridge-to-get-a-permanent-waterlogging-solution-101627409540034.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: DDA to open swimming pools by August 10||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is planning to open most of its swimming pools to the public by August 10, with officials adding that at least 11 of its 15 pools in the Capital will be made operational this year.“We plan to open the facilities by August 7 or 10. We will have proper measures in place and staff deployed to ensure that people coming to the facility follow all the Covid norms. There will be thermal screening of people and other such measures,” said a senior DDA official.Another senior DDA officialsaid the agency is carrying out repair and maintenance work “as the pools were closed for a while now”.However, the Olympic-size swimming pool at the Commonwealth Games village and the facility at Hari Nagar sports complex will not be operational as, the official said, the former is a Delhi government-run Covid care centre and the latter has no source of water to fill the pool.“While we plan to make at least 11 pools operational, the final number will depend on the size of the pool and water source available, as we have to refill the pools,” said the official.DDA officials said that they started the work on making swimming pools operational in March this year after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed swimming pools to open in April after a long gap due to the coronavirus pandemic.“We were planning to open our facility from April, but then the lockdown was announced. Though people were not allowed inside the facility, we kept the pool operational for a month after the lockdown. But it was turning out to be very expensive, as we had to filter the water on a daily basis and deploy staff for regular operations. This is why it was decided to drain the water in the pools,” said the official.A senior official said that it will take time to fill the pools and carry out basic repair and maintenance.Usually, swimming pools at DDA’s sports complexes are operational between April-September and some continue till November and again reopen in February.“We have three heated pools at Siri Fort, Yamuna and CWG sport complexes. Of the three, two facilities will continue till November,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-dda-to-open-swimming-pools-by-august-10-101627409422372.html
28-07-2021||Delhi||Covid curbs kill charm of Delhi’s iconic Daryaganj book bazar||Every Sunday, a section of the footpath outside Mahila Haat on Asaf Ali Road becomes busier than usual as booksellers from different parts of Delhi-NCR start trickling in around afternoon. Cycle rickshaws, tempos, scooters, and hand-driven carts stacked with books of all shades line the road, and restless vendors stand on the footpath as they wait for the clock to strike 4pm.As the heat gets unbearable, some occupy the footpaths, others use stacks of books as makeshift stools, while the rest lay down the books alongside a railing bordering the Mahila Haat complex with the hope that passersby might take note and buy a book or two.Santosh Gupta, a book vendor, whose books were stacked against the railing, talks about the futility of the entire process. “The gates of Mahila Haat will not open before 4pm. Until then, we are compelled to wait and watch. Some people unpack the books and spread them out in the hope that a passerby might buy some books from the lot. Around 4pm, we bundle the books again as the gates open and then unpack them inside the complex. Around 7pm, we start packing again before the closure at 8pm,” said Gupta, who was sweating profusely.Since malls and markets reopened in June, the timings for the popular book bazar have been reduced with the Haat opening at its usual time at 4pm but closing at 8pm instead of 10pm. As a result, Gupta and his contemporaries get only a handful of hours for business. The duration includes the time that goes into setting up the bazar and later packing it up.The Daryaganj Sunday Book Bazar functioned from the pavements for decades after the court ordered its removal from the road in 2019 due to traffic congestion. The Mahila Haat, from where it runs now, is located opposite the Delite Cinema, interestingly the same place where it used to start earlier. The bazar was known for priceless editions sold at throwaway prices and titles as varied as school textbooks to poetry, space and engineering.The bazar was reopened in June as curbs on markets and malls — put in place after a lockdown was imposed in the Capital from April 19 — were lifted. Unlike other markets, however, the book bazar is allowed to open only between 4pm and 8pm, as per oral orders of the North Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Vendors have asked authorities to extend their timings, arguing that the ongoing four-hour limit has made it difficult for them to even recover costs.Qamar Sayeed, president of Daryganj Sunday Book Bazar Patri Welfare Association, said MCD officials have given them oral instructions outlining the timings of the market. He said the vendors were helpless since MCD officials did not open the gates before the stipulated timing.“They never show us a written order and simply say that the Delhi government and DMs/SDMs have issued guidelines that say that the bazar can operate only between 4pm and 8pm. The orders might be oral, but we are compelled to comply since the complex is under the MCD’s control and they don’t unlock the gates before 4pm,” said Sayeed.Besides the unreasonable timings, there are other challenges at the current location. “Now, we are confined by walls. There are all kinds of challenges now. From harsh weather to police lathi charging us, we bear it all,” he said.The association has written to multiple stakeholders; including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, the district magistrate and sub-divisional magistrates of the district, and the police and MCD, asking for an extension of their business hours, but to no avail.“Before the second lockdown was imposed in April, we were allowed to sell our books from 4pm to 10pm. Now, we have to close by 8pm. These timings are not enough to run our business. It takes us an hour to set up the market once the gates open at 4pm. This leaves us with only three hours. After 7pm, we need to start wrapping up. How are we supposed to earn a living in an hour or two? We are not even able to cover the transportation cost and other charges,” said Sayeed, as he stood on the footpath outside Mahila Haat on Sunday, waiting for the gates to open.He added that the timings were not feasible for vendors, who travel from different parts of Delhi and its neighbouring cities, or students, who are an important target audience.“There is only one such market for book lovers. People travel from far-off places but don’t get enough time to purchase books of their choice. Parents also don’t allow children to travel freely in the evening. We want the government to allow us to operate from the morning as we did in our earlier location or at least allow us to work from 12 noon till 5pm,” said Sayeed.District magistrate of central Delhi Akriti Sagar said market timings were regulated as per the DDMA order. She added that since the market was shifted to Mahila Haat, the MCD was looking into the matter.Commissioner of North Delhi Municipal Corporation Sanjay Goel said the civic body will take action as per the DDMA orders and examine the timings of the market.On Sunday, first-time visitors to the market and others, who were not aware of the timings, waited outside till 3:30-4 pm for the market to open. Regular visitors to the book bazar also said that extended timings will be better. Vivek Kumar, a Class 12 student of a government school, said the old timings were better. “Here, time for buying books is limited. Earlier, we would get enough time for browsing through books, at the old location. Today, I saw many people return because they didn’t want to wait till 4pm,” said Kumar, who was at the market to purchase textbooks. “Books are cheaper here. Every year, I try and get my course books from this market,” he said.Pooja Kumar, a DU graduate and a first-time visitor, said she heard about the market from her friends. Pooja, who was not familiar with the timings, however, left before vendors could set up the market. “A friend of mine once got four to five books at throwaway prices. Since I had some free time, I decided to visit the market. However, only a few vendors are selling right now. I had no idea that the market is only operating for a few hours,” said Pooja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-curbs-kill-charm-of-delhi-s-iconic-daryaganj-book-bazar-101627409359920.html
28-07-2021||Mumbai||International travel expected to rise in the coming months: Travel portals||After few countries have opened their borders for Indians, enquiries for travel to international destinations have seen an average increase of 80-85% in July as compared to June. Maldives, Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine, Qatar, Turkey, Iceland, Costa Rica, Nepal, and France have opened travel for non-essential travel.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23, 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, cargo and special flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission and under bilateral air arrangements with selected countries since May last year.MakeMyTrip said that international travel is picking up slowly as countries have eased travel restrictions and quarantine regulations for Indian outbound travellers.According to the portal, Maldives and Russia currently rank high on the list of preferred leisure travel destinations. Switzerland and Qatar are the two countries that have made it mandatory for Indian travellers to be fully vaccinated.According to Swiss rules, children have to be quarantined, which is why fewer tourists are opting to travel to Switzerland.“We have seen a 35% jump in searches for international leisure packages for July as compared to the previous month. Overall, recovery within the international travel segment for essential as well as leisure travel is picking pace progressively. The scope and pace of recovery in international travel after the second wave is definitely higher as compared to the period post the first wave because of the global vaccination roll out,” said Vipul Prakash, chief operating officer, MakeMyTrip.Ixigo said it expects more countries to gradually lift restrictions in the coming months.“With India seeing an overall decline in the number of active Covid-19 cases, countries are evaluating and reconsidering their current travel restriction policies for Indian travellers. Recently the US state department has lowered its Covid-related travel advisory for India to ‘Level 3 – Reconsider Travel.’Industry sources said currently there are no direct flights from Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore to Switzerland. “Though the country is allowing Indians to travel, Switzerland might not allow an Indian traveller to come via a transit country as it may have different rules for entry from those particular countries,” explained an industry expert, who did not wish to be named.He added, “Moreover, not all tourists are aware of linking their passport to their vaccination certificates which is leading to case-specific issues.”Jyoti Mayal, president of Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), said currently most international travel is being undertaken by students.“After student travellers, business travellers are more seen travelling internationally. These are followed by visiting friends and relatives (VFR) and least air traffic is seen for leisure travel,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/international-travel-expected-to-rise-in-the-coming-months-travel-portals-101627409119858.html
28-07-2021||Other||Hardship for patients as ambulance workers in UP continue strike||LUCKNOW The staff of 108 and 102 ambulance services continued their strike across UP for the second day on Tuesday, resulting in hardships for patients who reached hospitals in autos, taxis and private vehicles.The two primary ambulance services – 102 (delivery of pregnant women) and 108 (emergency services) had come to a grinding halt since July 25-26 midnight, as workers went on a flash strike in wake of a change in the company that operates the advanced life support system (ALS) ambulances. So far, GVK EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute) was operating advanced life support system (ALS), 108, and 102 ambulance services in the state. But now the responsibility of the ALS ambulance service has been given to Ziqitsa Health Care.GVK EMRI sacked around 150 ambulance staff , including the president of the State Ambulance Sangh, Hanuman Prasad Pandey and other office bearers.Office bearers of the Sangh said they were being punished for demanding a salary hike of just ₹1,000, which was promised by GVK EMRI. They also alleged that the company terminated services of a number of drivers, citing change of company. Currently, ambulance drivers get around ₹13,000 as salary.Hundreds of GVK EMRI employees continued their agitation at Eco Garden in Lucknow and shouted slogans demanding increase in their salary and reinstatement of sacked workers.They claimed that the employment conditions offered by the new company were unjust and the government should be considerate towards their selfless service during the pandemic. Officials of GVK EMR, Ziqitsa Health Care Private Limited and health department held a meeting with the office-bearers of State Ambulance Sangh to solve the issue. An FIR was lodged against the agitating staff and office- bearers of the State Ambulance Sangh – Hanuman Prasad Pandey, Susheel Pandey, Abhishek Mishra, Brajesh Kumar Mishra, Sharad Yadav, Salil Awasthi, Sunil Sachan, Madhut Mishra, Raghvendra Tewari, Ritesh Shukla, Dinesh Kaushik for stalling essential services.One Sanjeev Kumar Gupta, who reached Lohia hospital in an auto with his ailing mother, said: “I called for an ambulance thrice, but they didn’t turn up. So there was no option, but to transport the patient in an auto.”Meanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath warned that if the needy don’t get ambulance services in the time of need, the state would take stern action against the ambulance services provider.“The state government is committed to providing quality health services to people. So ensure that needy people get ambulance services. If it doesn’t happen, the state government will act tough against the ambulance services provider,” he said during the Covid-19 review meeting at Lok Bhawan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hardship-for-patients-as-ambulance-workers-in-up-continue-strike-101627405699613.html
28-07-2021||Pune||Covid cases double Pune city’s 2021 death count as compared to previous year||Pune: In a year, the city’s death count almost doubled because of intense Covid-19 infection. As per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the city registered 11,870 deaths, including accidents and natural deaths, between January and May 2020. However, for the same period in 2021, the city saw 22,748 which is almost double the previous year. Although deaths due to Covid infection started to be reported in the city from April 2020, only a nominal number of deaths due to the infection were reported in April and May 2020. The data also showed a stark disparity in the number of deaths reported by the state department due to Covid as compared to the numbers reported by the civic body during the months of January to May for the 2021. As per the civic body data, Pune city reported 11,870 deaths from private and government hospitals covering all 15 wards. These deaths could vary as the data is collected from wards who then have to upload it on their centralised system. Dr Kalpana Baliwant, PMC assistant health officer, said, “The numbers of deaths registered for the actual period may vary as the data needs to be uploaded by the wards on the centralised system. Also, the information of occurrence of the event can be reported within 21 days and delayed registration up to one year.” In 2020, the city saw nearly half the number of deaths reported in 2021 in these five months. In January 2020, 3,071 deaths were reported, in February 2102, in March 2,492, in April 1,712 and in May 2,493 were reported. The city saw the first death reported from Pune city due to the infection on April 1 when a Thane resident was reported dead from a private hospital in Pune city. For the same months in 2021, the number of deaths rose by 52% when 22,748 deaths were reported. The major contributor being Covid infection. In January, the city saw 3,028 deaths of which 221 were due to Covid, in February 2,497 deaths were reported of which 193 were due to Covid, in March 3,785 with 783 Covid-related, and April saw peak of Covid cases and deaths as PMC registered 7,656, of which 4,055 were due to Covid which were more than non-Covid deaths. In May, the city saw 5,785 deaths of which 2,903 were due to Covid. Dr Baliwant said that irrespective of the residence, the person’s place of death or birth is where the “event” is registered. This could have possibly led to a major surge as Pune hospital also saw an influx of patients from neighbouring villages which are out of Pune city limits and also neighboring districts for tertiary Covid care and in case of their death, the death was registered in PMC records. Dr Baliwant said, “As per the birth and death registration act, it is the job of the private or government hospital to inform the local ward office about the event, birth or death, who then update the centralised system at Kasba peth.” The data disparity with respect to deaths recorded by the local administration and the state government was also evident from the data. As per the state records for Covid-19 cases and deaths, Pune city reported 2,376 deaths due to the infection between January 1 and May 30 while the PMC reported 8,155 deaths due to Covid alone in the city for the same period. To overcome the disparity, the state department has been reconciling deaths due to Covid after it was found that the reporting and recording of deaths due to the infection are lagging. The difference of deaths reported by PMC and the state highlights the gap in reporting or under-reporting of deaths. In April alone, PMC recorded 4,055 deaths due to Covid when the infection was at its peak in the city. The reconciliation process began from June and is still ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-cases-double-pune-city-s-2021-death-count-as-compared-to-previous-year-101627399691103.html

The Padma Awards are announced annually on the eve of Republic Day. Bharat Ratna is the country’s highest civilian award.Kejriwal said his government would take suggestions from the public to decide the nominees before sending their names to the Union government.“The contribution of doctors and health care workers has been immense throughout this pandemic. Many such doctors have even lost their lives while treating Covid-19 patients in service of the nation. It is time we honour them. Hence, the Delhi government has decided to nominate only doctors and health care workers for the three Padma awards this year.”The Union government seeks recommendations from every state for the awards.“Anyone who wants to suggest a doctor or health care worker for the Padma awards can mail us at padmaawards.delhi@gmail.com. In the mail, please explain why the person is deserving of the award. You can send in your suggestions by August 15.

The PWD officers who inspected its pillars in a boat, claimed that the bridge was safe and could be used for traffic. Officials said that the pillar of the bridge had a lot of waste accumulated during the recent heavy downpour, including a black cloth that appeared as a crack. The officials added that minor repair works needed to be carried out to the bridge.The bridge is a vital link between the cities of Kalyan and Bhiwandi. The bridge built over the Ulhas river, connects Kalyan (West) to National Highway 3 at Padgha check post.

28-07-2021||World||New CDC guidelines set off rush to reimpose mask mandates in US||States and businesses scrambled Wednesday to change course after the federal government issued new guidance calling for the return of mask wearing in virus hot spots amid a dramatic spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations nationwide.Nevada and Kansas City were among the locations that moved swiftly to re-impose indoor mask mandates following Tuesday’s announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The guidelines also call on all schools to require masks for students, teachers and visitors, and districts around the country tried to navigate the latest advice.In a handful of Republican-led states, lawmakers have made it illegal for schools to require masks. South Carolina's governor said the state would not reverse its mask restriction, but Arkansas leaders are weighing whether to revisit an April law banning local and state government entities from requiring masks.Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has faced growing calls to lift that ban, at least for schools, as virus cases and hospitalizations surge in the state.Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, said it would reinstate face mask protocols for all employees and visitors at its Missouri and Florida facilities. The two states are among the hardest-hit by the summer surge in which the U.S. is now averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, driven by the highly contagious delta variant spreading through unvaccinated populations.Other government leaders said they will hold off reinstating mask rules for now.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he’s not considering imposing a mask mandate in schools or statewide, though he urged Pennsylvanians to follow federal guidance. The Democrat said state mandates on masks were necessary before there was a vaccine.“People have the ability to make the decision to get a vaccine,” he said, speaking Tuesday on Pittsburgh radio station KDKA-AM. “If they do, that’s the protection.”The CDC's new guidance applies to places with at least 50 new cases per 100,000 people in the last week, which is roughly 60% of all U.S. counties, federal officials said.Nearly all of the South and Southwest is subject to the guidance, but most communities in the Northeast — with the exception of major metro areas like New York City and Boston — are exempt for now, according to the CDC's COVID tracker.Elsewhere, conservative officials pushed back against reviving mask mandates, setting up the potential for a patchwork of regulations within states and counties.In Missouri, the St. Louis County Council voted Tuesday to reverse the county’s mask mandate, just a day after it became one of the first reinstated in the country.But Democratic County Executive Sam Page insisted Wednesday that the mandate remained in effect and blamed the pushback on politics.“This is a national problem that went all the way up to the top with the last president," he said. "And we do have some folks in our country who work very hard to undermine public health efforts with a lot of very inflammatory rhetoric.”On the other side of the state, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, a Democrat, promised to provide details Wednesday on his plans to order mask wearing indoors in Missouri's largest city.“We cannot ignore the rapid spread of the COVID-19 delta variant in Missouri — outpacing much of the country,” he said in a statement. “We will do all we can to ensure our corner of this state is safe.”Meanwhile in Springfield, a hospital began expanding its morgue capacity as the state’s virus death toll soared. Steve Edwards, the CEO of CoxHealth, said his company brought in temporary cooling equipment because 75 patients in area hospitals have died this month.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that her agency's updated guidance was prompted by new data suggesting vaccinated people can pass on the virus in rare cases.“I know this is not a message America wants to hear,” she told CNN. “With prior variants, when people had these rare breakthrough infections, we didn’t see the capacity of them to spread the virus to others, but with the delta variant, we now see that you can actually now pass it to somebody else.”Walensky stressed that COVID vaccines are working by preventing greater levels of hospitalization and death.Unvaccinated people, she also noted, account for the vast number of new infections. Two-thirds of the vaccine-eligible population in the U.S. has received at least one dose.“We can halt the chain of transmission,” she told “CBS This Morning” on Wednesday. “We can do something if we unify together, if we get people vaccinated who are not yet vaccinated. If we mask in the interim, we can halt this in just a matter of a couple of weeks.”In Provincetown, Massachusetts, where officials earlier this week re-imposed an indoor mask requirement following a surge in COVID-19 cases this month, store owner Patrick Patrick says he doesn’t mind asking customers to mask up once more.The owner of Marine Specialties, a long running Army-Navy store, had been leery of officials dropping virus safety mandates ahead of what many expected would be a busy summer season. He even tried to require customers to mask up in his store through the summer, before finally relenting in June.“If we’d stuck with masks all along, I don’t think we’d be having this conversation,” Patrick said, adding that he’s required all his staff to be masked and vaccinated. “They’re not entirely fun, but we wore them all last summer, and we didn’t have a single case in Provincetown. Now see where we’re at.”As of Tuesday, the town had reported more than 750 cases of COVID-19 associated with the most recent cluster, which started around the busy July 4th holiday. Officials have said many cases are so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. Three people have been hospitalized, but no one has died.Patrick says the business drop-off has been significant, but he hopes the return of masks helps brings visitors peace of mind.“I don’t see masks as bad for business,” he said. “Maybe for a nightclub or bar it is. But if it gets people back out and feeling safe, it’s worth it. We take care of public health and safety, the dollars and cents will take care of themselves."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cdc-guidelines-set-off-rush-to-reimpose-mask-mandates-in-us-101627494033091.html
28-07-2021||World||'Audacious theft': Woman who swapped pebbles for diamonds in London heist jailed||A woman who secretly swapped seven pebbles for 4.2 million pounds ($5.7 million) worth of diamonds has been sent to prison for her role in the audacious heist at a luxury jewelry store in London’s tony Mayfair district.Lulu Lakatos, 60, was sentenced Wednesday to 5 1/2 years in prison after a jury at Southwark Crown Court in London found her guilty of conspiracy to steal.Lakatos was part of an international gang that fled to France after stealing the diamonds from Boodles on New Bond Street on March 10, 2016. The gems haven't been recovered.“This was an audacious theft, carried out in plain view of experienced and professional staff at a renowned jewelers,” Detective Sgt. William Man of London’s Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. “The meticulous planning and execution of this theft reveals to me that those involved were highly skilled criminals.”In the days leading up to the heist, the criminals held a series of meetings with Boodles staff on the pretense that they represented a wealthy Russian investor who was looking to purchase gems, police said.Lakatos, who was born in Romania and lived in France, posed as a gem expert named “Anna” who then went to Boodles to value seven diamonds for the buyer.After she inspected the gems, which included a 20-carat heart-shaped diamond valued at more than 2.2 million pounds, they were individually wrapped and placed in a locked bag that was supposed to be held in the jeweler’s vault until payment was received. But when Boodles’ own expert became suspicious the next day, the bag was X-rayed and the store discovered nothing but seven ordinary pebbles.Lakatos had used a distraction to swap the bag containing the diamonds for an identical one containing the pebbles before it was locked in the vault, according to security camera video released by police.After leaving the store, Lakatos handed the bag containing the diamonds to one of her female accomplices, before ditching the long coat, hat and scarf she wore as a disguise and boarding a high-speed Eurostar train to France.She was arrested on a European arrest warrant last September and returned to Britain to stand trial.Two men who worked with Lakatos previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and were sentenced to 3 years and eight months in prison. Police are still investigating the involvement of two other women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/audacious-theft-woman-who-swapped-pebbles-for-diamonds-in-london-heist-jailed-101627491544218.html

This equaled a 1.1 percentage-point difference in annual births, or roughly 23,000 excess babies in GOP counties that the authors tie to optimism over the election’s results.The effects also continued for the following two years for which data were available.What’s more, the gap was bigger in heavily partisan counties. The fertility gap between extreme Republican and extreme Democratic counties was 2.6 percentage points, according to the authors, Gordon Dahl and William Mullins of the University of California San Diego and Runjing Lu of the University of Alberta.Hispanic mothers also saw significantly fewer births than non-Hispanics, the authors wrote, noting some of the former president’s harsh rhetoric toward immigrants during his campaign.For some context, there was no partisan effect on fertility after former President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory, although the onset of the Great Recession complicated the data. The authors found some evidence that relative fertility fell in Democratic counties after former President George W. Bush’s 2000 win.The states with the highest birth rates shortly after the election were Utah, Alaska and the Dakotas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/love-for-trump-led-to-baby-boom-in-republican-counties-in-2016-101627491569052.html

US district judge Ann M. Donnelly ruled that the tablet recounting the epic of Gilgamesh, written in Akkadian, originated in present-day Iraq and entered the US contrary to federal law.The US state department on Tuesday said that the rare fragment was illegally imported to the country after it was bought by Hobby Lobby, a prominent arts-and-crafts retailer based in Oklahoma City, from an international auction house for more than $1.67 million. The law enforcement agents seized it from the museum in 2019.“This forfeiture represents an important milestone on the path to returning this rare and ancient masterpiece of world literature to its country of origin,” acting US Attorney Jacquelyn M. Kasulis said in a statement."This office is committed to combating the black-market sale of cultural property and the smuggling of looted artefacts," she added.The Gilgamesh Dream Tablet was discovered in 1853 in the ruins of the library of the Assyrian King Assur Banipal in Nineveh, situated in modern-day northern Iraq. In 2003, a US antiquities dealer purchased the tablet from a family member of a coin dealer in London and shipped it to the US by international post without declaring formal entry, according to the US state department.The antiquities dealer then allegedly sold the tablet with a false provenance letter that stated the ancient artefact had been inside a box of miscellaneous ancient bronze fragments purchased in an auction in 1981. The tablet changed hands several times in different countries along with the false letter.“Hobby Lobby consented to the tablet’s forfeiture based on the tablet’s illegal importations into the United States in 2003 and 2014,” the department added.Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi is reportedly set to take back 17,000 pieces of archaeological treasures when he returns on Thursday. However, it was not immediately clear whether the Gilgamesh tablet would be among those thousands of artefacts.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilgamesh-tablet-us-takes-step-to-return-3-500-year-old-looted-artefact-to-iraq-101627486349100.html

The daily death rate hit a record-high this week as cases surged, data by the country's ministry of health showed.Richard Rukwata, interim head of Zimbabwe's Medicines Control Authority, said in his statement earlier on Wednesday that "the drug's usage is valid for 12 months or until the public health emergency ends".“If additional satisfactory data needed for full registration are submitted in an application to the authority, then full marketing authorization could be granted,” Richard added.Earlier in June, the Zimbabwean government had requested the African Export-Import Bank to postpone the shipment of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine dosages citing concerns about blood clots and the government's inability to retain the vials of injections at the proper temperature.Zimbabwe has previously approved the use of the coronavirus vaccines such as India's indegenously produced Covaxin, China's Sinopharm and Sinovac, and Russsia's Sputnik V.According to Covid-19 data available on worldometers.info, Zimbabwe recorded 1,767 cases of coronavirus and 107 related deaths on Tuesday alone. The active cases in the country, with an approximate population of 1.46 crores, stood at 27,935.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-zimbabwe-approves-j-j-vaccine-101627477610647.html
28-07-2021||World||Upset China gives lecture on democracy to India, US||A seemingly upset spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday gave a lesson on democracy to India and the US, the largest and oldest democracies no less, after it appeared that the two had ganged up against authoritarian China.All because the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visiting India at present, talked about a rising global threat to democracies and that the two leading ones should stand together to support the threatened ideals.A Bloomberg question on whether the Blinken statement pointed a finger at the Middle Kingdom during the Chinese foreign ministry briefing on Wednesday triggered a passionate discourse on democracy from spokesperson, Zhao Lijian.“I want to stress that democracy is a common value of humanity. It is not a patent to any country. The way to realise democracy is diverse without a certain pattern or only one answer. A multiparty political structure is not the only form of democracy and democracy cannot be used to stoke confrontation,” Zhao said.The reference to the US went like this: “Some countries claim themselves to be democratic, but they face the problems of racial discrimination, political polarisation, among other issues.”“Is this the kind of democracy that they pride on?”Then, came the reference to neighbour, India - with the inevitable conclusion that money wins elections in India - and rhetorical questions, one after the other. “In some countries, without money you cannot get votes. Political parties place their interests above that of the people. Is this democracy or the rise of the wealthy? Some democratic countries contain others’ development. Is this democracy or hegemony? Is this the kind of democracy that you want?”The way to judge which country is democratic and which one is autocratic should not be decided by one certain country, Zhao mused. “The way to judge whether a political system is good is to see whether it can deliver progress of society, better livelihood and whether it is endorsed and supported by its people and whether it can make contributions to the progress of mankind.Zhao didn’t name either India or the US but clearly did not leave much to anyone’s imagination. Maybe, like Blinken’s statement.Elsewhere, the state-run tabloid Global Times was direct. “Such an arrangement, (Blinken’s visit) which closely follows (deputy secretary of state Wendy) Sherman’s visit to China on Sunday and Monday, is seen as a sign that the US will spend more efforts to rope in India to contain China and play the ‘India card’,” analysts told the tabloid.But all isn’t good between India and the US, the analysis said.One of the major rifts between New Delhi and Washington is the US decision to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, which has left India’s investment in the region for the past 20 years hanging in the air, Long Xingchun, from the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/upset-china-gives-lecture-on-democracy-to-india-us-101627484208789.html

What should be their guiding principles to navigate our exit?” Georgieva said in Washington, D.C., according to prepared remarks.Georgieva asked how central banks will adapt their tool kits to the post-pandemic policy landscape and how they’ll prepare for an acceleration in digital money.“These are just some of the difficult questions being faced by central bankers everywhere,” she said.The remarks come a day after the IMF warned that unequal access to vaccines is further widening the recovery gap between advanced and developing economies. The fund maintained its outlook for the biggest rebound in global economic growth in four decades, but changed its underlying regional forecasts.World output is still expected to grow 6% in 2021 following last year’s 3.2% drop, the fund said in an updated World Economic Outlook released Tuesday. It reduced the emerging-market forecast to 6.3% expansion, compared to the 6.7% increase projected in April, and raised the estimate for advanced economies by 0.5 percentage point to 5.6%.“Many emerging and developing economies are projected to grow slower than we had anticipated,” Georgieva said. “This difference is primarily due to dramatic differences in vaccine availability — thus, infection rates — and availability of fiscal space to act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-economy-in-crisis-due-to-vaccine-gap-amongst-nations-imf-chief-warns-101627481964700.html

In an interview with PBS NewsHour aired Tuesday night, Khan said that the US should have opted for a political solution when the presence of Nato forces in Afghanistan were at an all-time high and not when they had reduced the troops to “barely” 10,000."I think the US has really messed it up in Afghanistan," Khan told PBS NewsHour.The Pakistan premier opined that an “inclusive” political settlement that involves all factions, including the Taliban, will be the “only good outcome” for Afghanistan. Pakistan has been long accused of helping the Taliban militarily, financially and with intelligence inputs in their fight against the Afghan government, which Khan dismissed as “extremely unfair”.He said that thousands of Pakistanis lost their lives in the aftermath of the US war in Afghanistan when “Pakistan had nothing to do with what happened” on September 11, 2001, in New York.Also Read | 'Never would I say such stupid thing': Pak PM says he never blamed rape victimsWhen asked about a recent report of 10,000 Pakistani fighters crossing over the border to help the Taliban, he said, "This is absolute nonsense. Why don't they give us evidence of this?"Khan stressed that Pakistan hosts three million Aghan refugees of which the majority are Pashtuns, the same ethnic group as the Taliban fighters.“Now, there are camps of 500,000 people, there are camps of 100,000 people. And Taliban are not some military outfits, they are normal civilians. And if there are some civilians in these camps, how is Pakistan supposed to hunt these people down? How can you call them sanctuaries?” he argued.According to a report prepared for the UN Security Council, about 6,000 terrorists of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) are operating on the Afghan side of the border. While the TTP has “distinctive anti-Pakistan objectives”, it also supports the Afghan Taliban militants inside Afghanistan against Afghan Forces, the report by the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-are-normal-civilians-pak-pm-imran-khan-on-providing-safe-haven-to-terrorists-101627478065679.html

Now they explicitly say that they cannot give guarantees that it would not happen again."Since April 9, Tehran and six world powers have been in talks to revive the nuclear pact ditched three years ago by then US President Donald Trump, who argued it favoured Iran.The sixth round of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington adjourned on June 20, two days after hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi was elected president of the Islamic Republic. Parties involved in the negotiations have yet to announce when the next round of negotiations will resume.Like Khamenei, Raisi has backed the revival of the nuclear pact but officials have said that his government might adopt "a hardline" approach. Khamenei, not the president, has the last say on Iran's state matters, including the nuclear policy.Iranian and Western officials have said significant gaps remained to reinstate the deal, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder to obtain fissile material for a weapon in return for relief from tough sanctions. Iran says it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would.HARSH SANCTIONSHarsh sanctions reimposed by Trump since 2018 have prompted Tehran to violate the deal's limits. However, Tehran says its nuclear steps are reversible if Washington lifts all sanctions.US President Joe Biden seeks to reinstate and eventually broaden the pact to put more limits on Iran’s nuclear work and its missile development and constrain its regional activities.Khamenei again flatly rejected adding any other issues to the deal."In the recent nuclear talks, the Americans staunchly insisted on their obstinate stance. When making promises and on paper they say they will remove sanctions, but in practice they have not and they will not," Khamenei said.Khamenei said Washington is "stubborn" and insists on adding a sentence to the existing nuclear deal."By adding this sentence, they want to provide an excuse for their further interventions on the nuclear deal and (Iran's) missile work and regional issues," Khamenei said. "Then if we refuse to discuss those issues, Americans will accuse Iran of violating the nuclear deal and they will say the agreement is over."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-leader-khamenei-blames-cowardly-us-for-halting-nuclear-talks-101627472099826.html

In its weekly epidemiological update, the UN health agency said most of the 69,000 deaths were reported in the Americas and Southeast Asia, taking the cumulative deaths to over 4 million.“The highest numbers of deaths per 100,000 population over the past week were observed in the Americas and South-East Asia Regions which reported 2.8 and 1.1 new deaths per 100,000 population, respectively,” the report said.The overall Covid-19 cases across the globe also jumped by 8% as about 540,000 daily infections were reported on average over the past week. The UN health agency warned about the rise in Covid-19 cases, saying “if these trends continue, the cumulative number of cases reported globally could exceed 200 million in the next two weeks.”Also Read | Covid-19: US brings back face masks to control spread of Delta variantOver the past week, the biggest numbers of new Covid-19 cases were reported from the US, Brazil, Indonesia, Britain and India, according to the report. While America and Brazil reported an increase in Covid-19 cases, Indonesia and Britain reported a decline. Negligible change in India’s Covid-19 cases was reported in the last week.The highly contagious Delta variant has now been detected in 132 countries, as per the report, spreading to eight new countries.Addressing the widespread concern over vaccine efficacy against variants of concern, the WHO said that though studies have shown a several-fold reduction in neutralization against variants, it does not directly correlate with reduced vaccine efficacy. Explaining the reasons, the UN agency stated that there is currently no known threshold of neutralization below which vaccines stop working. It also noted that some vaccines produce higher neutralizing antibody concentrations, so a reduction will “likely have a lesser effect” on the vaccine efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-global-covid-deaths-up-by-21-cases-could-exceed-200-mn-in-two-weeks-101627472933570.html
28-07-2021||World||China urges Taliban to crack down on ETIM||China on Wednesday told a Taliban delegation that it hopes the insurgent group will play a critical role in the reconstruction process of Afghanistan in the backdrop of US forces leaving the country.State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi urged the Taliban to crack down on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Islamic group it alleges is fuelling unrest and separatism in China’s Xinjiang province from Afghanistan.Wang met Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s political chief, in Tianjin, a city some 100km from Beijing.On his part, Baradar said the Taliban is willing to establish an inclusive political structure in Afghanistan, which protects human rights as well as the rights and interests of women and children.FIRST VISIT OF TOP TALIBAN LEADER TO CHINABaradar, who heads the Taliban’s political office in Qatar and is the lead negotiator for talks with the US, is leading a nine-member Taliban delegation on a two-day visit to China.This is the first time a senior Taliban leader has visited China since the group launched an offensive to capture territories across Afghanistan, coinciding with the rapid drawdown of US and Nato forces.Calling the Afghan Taliban a “critical military and political force in the country”, Wang said the group is “expected to play an important role in the peace, reconciliation and reconstruction process of Afghanistan”.The Chinese diplomat called on the Afghan Taliban to put their national interests “…first and foremost, hold high the banner of peace talks, establish the goal of peace, create a positive image and adopt an inclusive policy”.China had hosted a low-profile meeting with a Taliban delegation in 2019, which met Deng Xijun, then the special envoy for Afghanistan.Back channel links with the group stretch back to the early 1990s through Pakistan, Beijing’s “iron brother”.The atheist Communist Party of China and the fundamentalist Taliban have little in common ideologically but shared mutual interests could form the basis of pragmatic if wary ties.The impact and the aftermath of the withdrawal of foreign forces from the war-ravaged country, the peace process and security issues were discussed during the meeting.EAST TURKESTAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT THREAT“The sudden withdrawal of forces by the United States and Nato from Afghanistan marks the failure of United States’ Afghanistan policy, and Afghan people now face an important opportunity to stabilise and develop their own country,” Wang was quoted as telling Baradar in an official readout issued by the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday.On the issue of ETIM, Wang said he hoped the Taliban would crack down on them as it was a “direct threat to China’s national security”, according to the readout.“The ETIM, an international terrorist group listed by the UN Security Council, poses direct threats to China’s national security and territorial integrity, and it is the common responsibility of the international community to fight against it,” he said.Wang called on the Taliban to draw a clear line from “…ETIM and other terrorist groups, and resolutely and effectively crack down on them, so as to remove obstacles and create favourable conditions for regional peace, stability and development”.China says ETIM is active in the northwestern frontier province of Xinjiang, which has a border of about 70km with Afghanistan, and is triggering unrest in the remote region.On his part, Baradar, as per the Chinese readout, said, “China has always been a trustworthy friend of the Afghan people”.“The Afghan Taliban, with sincerity for achieving peace, is willing to work with all parties to establish an inclusive political structure in Afghanistan that is accepted by all Afghan people and protects human rights as well as the rights and interests of women and children,” Baradar said.INVOLVEMENT OF CHINA IN AFGHAN PEACE PROCESSBaradar added that the Taliban hoped that China would be more involved in Afghanistan’s peace and reconstruction process, and play a bigger role in the country’s future reconstruction and economic development.He said the Afghan Taliban would make its own efforts in creating a favourable investment environment. “Politics, economy and issues related to the security of both countries and the current situation of Afghanistan, and the peace process were discussed in the meetings,” Taliban spokesperson Mohammed Naeem tweeted.Naeem added that the group was also meeting China’s special envoy for Afghanistan and that the trip took place after an invitation from the Chinese authorities. “(The) delegation assured China that they will not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against China,” Naeem said. “China also reiterated its commitment of continuation of their assistance with Afghans and said they will not interfere in Afghanistan’s issues but will help to solve the problems and ensure restoration of peace in the country.”HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN XINJIANGIt was not immediately known if the Taliban delegation brought up the issue of human rights abuses against Muslim minorities especially the Uighurs in Xinjiang during the meeting.It is however likely that as the two sides attempt to build a transactional relationship - security for China, international legitimacy for the Taliban, for one, - both will try to deftly negotiate the thorny issue of Beijing’s treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. “We care about the oppression of Muslims, be it in Palestine, in Myanmar, or in China, and we care about the oppression of non-Muslims anywhere in the world,” a senior Taliban representative had recently told The Wall Street Journal. “But what we are not going to do is interfere in China’s internal affairs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-taliban-to-crack-down-on-etim-101627472628062.html
28-07-2021||World||Chinese national shot at in Karachi two weeks after blast||A Chinese national was shot and wounded in Karachi on Wednesday, reported Reuters. The victim was shot at by two bike-borne masked men while he was enroute to Karachi’s industrial area. "Two men wearing face masks riding a motorcycle carried out the shooting," deputy inspector general Javed Akbar Riaz said. Riaz told AFP that the Chinese individual was not hit on any vital parts of his body and is currently stable.The latest attack on the Chinese individual comes just two weeks after 13 people, including nine Chinese citizens working on a dam project, were killed when their bus was hit by an explosion in Kohistan, northwest Pakistan, on July 14.The Chinese nationals who were killed were working at the Dasu hydroelectric project, which is being built by China in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province as a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. It was not clear if the victim of the latest attack was also involved with any CPEC project.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called the attack an “isolated case” and expressed confidence in Pakistan’s ability to protect Chinese citizens. "We have full confidence in the Pakistan side's protection of Chinese citizens and property in Pakistan," he told the media persons at a briefing in Beijing.Zhao’s statement marks a change of Beijing’s tone, after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang had ruled the July 14 blast a "terrorist attack" and asked Pakistan to take to task the perpetrators of the crime.Even though Pakistani officials have not offered any concrete details on the explosion, Chinese media carried reports stating the blast was carried out by Uyghur militants or the Pakistani Taliban, according to AFP.China-funded projects have fuelled discontent in local separatist groups who claim the CPEC projects do not benefit locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-national-shot-at-in-karachi-two-weeks-after-blast-101627471362126.html
28-07-2021||World||'Never would I say such stupid thing': Pak PM Imran Khan says he never blamed rape victims||In an interview with Axios' Johnathan Swan, Pakistan Premier Imran Khan apparently said if you raise temptation in the society to the point, and all these young guys have nowhere to go, it has consequences on the society. He was commenting on rape and his comment which he now has denied drew flak.In an interview with PBS NewsHour on Wednesday, Imran Khan said he was talking about Pakistani society and sex crimes, which are not limited to women. Asserting that he knows all his interviews and all that he says, Khan on Wednesday said that he would never say such a "stupid thing" that a person who is raped is somehow responsible. "Anyone who commits rape, solely and solely that person is responsible. So let’s be clear about that. No matter how provocative the woman is or whatever she wears, the person who commits rape is fully responsible. Never is the victim responsible," he said.He also said the compared to the Western countries, rape cases in Pakistan form a minuscule. "As far as a woman’s dignity and respect goes, I can say after going all over the world, this society gives more respect and dignity to women," Khan said.This was not the first time that Imran Khan was castigated as a "rape apologist" by international media. In April this year, in a state-run channel, he purportedly claimed that wearing a veil would protect women from sexual assault.Explaining his veil remark, he told Jonathan, "I said the concept of 'pardah' is to avoid temptation in society.

Britain’s strict travel rules owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has severely affected the airline and tourism industry, drawing flak for falling behind European Union in attracting tourists.According to LBC radio, Johnson said he wanted fully vaccinated US nationals to visit England as they did before the pandemic. "We want people to be able to come from the US freely in a way that they normally do. We're talking to them the whole time," LBC quoted Johnson as saying in an interview.Both the US and UK are witnessing another Covid-19 wave driven by a highly transmissible Delta variant but the countries are relying on high vaccination coverage to open up economies. While each of the four individual nations of Britain has the right to set different entry restrictions during the pandemic, any easing of travel restrictions could provide a huge boost to the travel industry reeling under 16 months of restrictions."At the moment we're dealing with a Delta wave, the U.S is dealing with a Delta wave, but be assured that we are on it the whole time. As soon as we have something to say about travel corridors you'll be hearing from us."Earlier this month, Britain removed almost all restrictions related to Covid-19 and opened up international travel under which fully vaccinated Britons and children under the age of 18 will no longer have to quarantine. The UK is reportedly set to announce similar relaxation for visitors from the US and the EU. Currently, non-Britons travelling to the UK from countries and territories on the “amber list” are required to quarantine for at least 10 days.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-discussing-travel-corridor-with-us-amid-delta-threat-report-101627468936838.html

Speaking at a joint press conference after India-US delegation-level talks, Blinken said the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hit both countries very hard and the US will not forget the aid and assistance India provided early in the pandemic.“I am proud we could return the gesture to India,” Blinken told the press conference, referring to the assistance provided to India during the second Covid wave.The top US diplomat said that the two sides discussed regional security issues including Afghanistan, echoing Jaishankar’s remark that there was much more convergence on the matter than divergence. Blinken stressed that both sides are committed to the proposition that there is no military solution to the conflict.“There has to be a peaceful resolution that requires the Taliban and the Afghan government to come to the table and we both agree, I think, strongly that any future government in Afghanistan has to be inclusive and fully representative of Afghan people,” said Blinken, adding that it has to be “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.”The Taliban have been rapidly making advances in Afghanistan after US troops started withdrawal from the war-torn region. But Blinken said that the US remains engaged in Afghanistan through important programmes that support the country economically through development and security assistance.“We are very much engaged in the diplomacy of working to bring parties together at the table for the resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan,” he added.Also Read | Antony Blinken meets Dalai Lama's representative in Delhi.

The assurance was given by Mullah Barader as Beijing is worried that Uighur extremist movement may get shelter in Emirate of Afghanistan through the Wakhan corridor.Mullah Baradar travelled to China for two days as the head of a high-ranking delegation of nine people and held separate meetings with Wang, China's deputy foreign minister and Chinese special representative for Afghanistan, the Taliban said in a statement."The meetings focused on political, economic and security issues related to the two countries, the current situation in Afghanistan and the peace process," the statement added.By reassuring Beijing that it will not allow the Afghan territory to be used against any third country, the Taliban are trying to allay global fears that Pakistan-based terror groups and pan-Islamic groups like Al Qaeda will not use the civilian strife in Afghanistan to establish terror training camps for targeting countries opposed to radical Islam. During its first term in power between 1996-2001, the Taliban gave shelter to majority of pan-Islamic terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, Harkat-ul-Ansar, HuJI Bangladesh, held training camps for Pakistan-based groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and virtually sponsored global jihad around the world.The Taliban delegation also thanked China for its continued cooperation with the people of Afghanistan, especially its continued cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to Afghanistan watchers, the Taliban, with support of their handlers Pakistan, are seeking assurance from China to help them establish an emirate in Afghanistan lest US has second thoughts on the Sunni group after reports of large numbers of civilian casualties.The US has already declared that it will leave Afghanistan on August 31. "While Pakistan is trying to leverage its influence on Taliban to get close to revive its ties with the US, the Sunni Islamist group is piggybacking on Islamabad to strengthen its ties with China. The Chinese, on their part, are looking towards expanding the Belt and Road initiative into Afghanistan and thereon to Central Asia for taking a grip on bilateral trade with Afghanistan and exploiting resources like coal, copper and iron ore in that country," said diplomats based in US and India.China wants to use Afghanistan as a route to Central Asian republics of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seek-support-of-china-for-expanding-footprint-in-afghanistan-101627462256131.html

The top US diplomat is on his maiden two-day official visit to India.Blinken, who took to Twitter soon after the meeting, shared a few photos from the gathering. The meeting was attended by Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of Tibet House in Delhi, cultural centre of the Dalai Lama. I was pleased to meet civil society leaders today. The U.S. and India share a commitment to democratic values; this is part of the bedrock of our relationship and reflective of India’s pluralistic society and history of harmony. Civil society helps advance these values. pic.twitter.com/5NL2WiQ13oBlinken also met briefly with Ngodup Dongchung, a representative of the Dalai Lama. A State Department spokesperson said, "Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to meet briefly this morning in New Delhi with a representative of His Holiness the Dalai Lama."Dongchung reportedly held a separate 10-minute meeting with US envoy Atul Keshap during the day.The meeting is the one of the most significant contacts the US has so far made with the Tibetan leadership since the Dalai Lama met then-president Barack Obama in Washington in 2016.Beijing says Tibet is a part of China and has labelled the Dalai Lama a dangerous separatist. China's foreign ministry has not responded to a request for comment.Close on the wheels of Blinken's visit, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin had said China was working against the shared principles and interests of the US and its partners across the Indo-Pacific. While the US and its friends are committed to inclusion and freedom of the seas, China had shown “unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law”, he said.The CTA and Tibetan advocacy groups have received a boost in international support in recent months amid rising criticism of China's human rights record, particularly from the United States.In November, Lobsang Sangay, the former head of the Tibetan government in exile, visited the White House, the first such visit in six decades.A month later, the US Congress passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act, which calls for the right of Tibetans to choose the successor to the Dalai Lama, and the establishment of a US consulate in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.Earlier, the US said it backed India’s emergence as a leading global power and vital partner to make the Indo-Pacific a region of stability and economic inclusion.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-meets-dalai-lama-s-representative-in-delhi-will-china-respond-101627459741844.html

The US publication has quoted a report from Federation of American Scientists (FAS) to say that as many as 110 silos have been detected in the western desert area of the country.The FAS report, published on Monday, is based on satellite images obtained by the organisation. It said that this is the second such silo after one near Yumen in Gansu province, as reported by Washington Post. The second missile silo field in Hami (Xinjiang province) is located 380 kilometres from the Yumen site, according to FAS.Satellite data can be a powerful tool for reporters investigating important issues like the discovery of 100s of Chinese missile silos (x2), the impacts of extreme weather and natural disasters, & much more. Read our latest blog to see this work in action: https://t.co/SzD58gONdf pic.twitter.com/YVFr88JQ0cIt also claimed that the construction at Hami site began in March this year and is continuing at a rapid pace. The area is being developed in a grid-like outline, the FAS report said.As many as 14 dome structures are visible at the Hami construction site, FAS said based on the satellite pictures it obtained. The higher resolution images of the site were provided by Planet, it added."This is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it," the US Strategic Command said on Twitter, reacting to the latest news about missile silos and tagging a New York Times story on it.This is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it.https://t.co/OTFkP14H5oFAS said that these sites signify "the most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever". It added that this is the most extensive silo construction since the US and Soviet missile silo construction during the Cold War.These silos will add to China's arsenal of nuclear tipped Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), which according to FAS has now swelled to 250 - constituting more than half of the size of the entire US ICBM force.Earlier, after the discovery of missile silos in Gansu, the United States had called the dramatic build-up "concerning" and called for practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilising arms race.Beijing, meanwhile, has said that its arsenal is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia and it is ready to conduct bilateral dialogues on strategic security "on the basis of equality and mutual respect."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-building-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field-claims-report-us-concerned-101627455116842.html

There was no word on the meeting from the Chinese side or the Taliban. Several images of Wang with the Taliban delegation, which included spokesman Suhail Shaheen, were posted on social media. Baradar, who heads the Taliban’s political office in Qatar and has been the lead negotiator for talks with the US, met Wang in the northern city of Tianjin, the South China Morning Post reported citing sources familiar with the arrangements. This is the first time a senior Taliban leader has visited China since the group launched a massive offensive to capture territory across Afghanistan, coinciding with the rapid drawdown of US and NATO forces. China has hosted a Taliban delegation in 2019 that met Deng Xijun, then the special envoy for Afghanistan. Also Read | Pak’s TTP supports Taliban as 6,000 terrorists still in Afghanistan: UN reportChinese officials had in the past participated in talks with the Taliban along with representatives from Afghanistan, the US and Pakistan but these had not resulted in any forward movement in efforts to find a political settlement. At a meeting with his Afghan and Pakistani counterparts in June, Wang vowed to “bring the Taliban back into the political mainstream” and offered to host intra-Afghan peace talks. At a meeting between Wang and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi in China on July 24, the two sides agreed to take joint actions to tackle the “spillover effect” from the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. China and Pakistan are facing the “direct effect” of the worsening situation in Afghanistan and both countries will pursue the “hope for peace in an attempt to prevent a civil war in Afghanistan and mediate for negotiations between the Afghans”, Wang was quoted as saying by China’s state media. The two countries will “jointly combat terrorism, push all major forces in Afghanistan to draw a clear line with terrorism, resolutely crack down on terrorist forces such as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), and prevent Afghanistan from falling again into being a hotbed for terrorism”, Wang added. According to a new UN report, ETIM has several hundred fighters in Afghanistan, primarily in Badakhshan and neighbouring provinces. ETIM wants to establish a Uyghur state in Xinjiang and facilitates the movement of fighters from Afghanistan to China, the UN report said. ETIM reportedly has relationships with al-Qaeda, Islamic State-Khorasan and Jamaat Ansarullah and Hajji Furqan, the group’s deputy commander, leads as many as 1,000 foreign terrorists, including 400 in Badakhshan province. ETIM continues to be China’s main concern in Afghanistan and the focus of its efforts to ensure peace and stability in the war-torn country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-delegation-meets-chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-101627454609763.html
28-07-2021||World||Canadian provinces reveal probing claims of abuse of indigenous children||Law enforcement officers in Canada’s Manitoba province have revealed that they conducted a decade-long investigation into claims of sexual abuse of indigenous children at a residential school there, while a similar probe has been launched in the province of Saskatchewan.The two disclosures follow a series of embarrassing discoveries of unmarked graves of indigenous children at or near the sites of Catholic church-run residential schools across Canada in developments that have jolted the nation.Manitoba’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said its Major Crime Services had been carrying probative investigations following allegations of sexual abuse at Fort Alexander Residential School. A probative investigation, it said, “means gathering information to determine what took place as well as the scope of the occurrences it commenced”.The Manitoba RCMP said the allegations were “historical in nature” and investigators travelled to Ottawa to review archival records of the school “to identify anyone involved” in the crimes that took place against indigenous children. Investigators interacted with over 700 people across North America “in an effort to locate any possible victims or witnesses” and a criminal investigation was launched in 2011. The probe team got hold of statements from 75 witnesses and victims.“There have been more than 680 investigational tasks identified and completed so far and more than 80 RCMP investigators have been engaged in this investigation,” the Manitoba RCMP said.CBC News, meanwhile, reported that Saskatchewan province’s RCMP was investigating a historical complaint about similar crimes having taken place at Timber Bay Residential School.Canada’s residential schools in question - operated by the Catholic Church from the late 19th century until the second half of the 20th – used to board indigenous children.Unmarked graves, numbering 215, were first found at the site of a school in Kamloops, British Columbia in June. The episode was followed a chain of similar discoveries at other locations, with the total number of graves of indigenous children discovered totalling over 1,100 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-provinces-reveal-probing-claims-of-abuse-of-indigenous-children-101627453769692.html
28-07-2021||World||Trudeau: We have enough anti-Covid shots to vaccinate entire eligible population||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada now has enough vaccines to fully inoculate every eligible person in the country against Covid-19.Trudeau said that with the arrival of the latest shipment of Covid-19 vaccines, Canada has so far received 66 million doses - enough for fully vaccinate everyone in the country two months ahead of the September deadline he had set.The Canadian PM’s announcement came shortly after the province of Quebec offered a third dose for those who require it for travel.“The best way to end this pandemic is for everyone to get their shots as soon as they can,” Trudeau said. “Today’s milestone is a clear sign that we are getting closer to this goal. I urge Canadians to book their vaccine today, to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities.” The effort to bring vaccines into the country was headed by Indo-Canadian minister of public services and procurement, Anita Anand. “The government has worked extremely hard to deliver vaccines to Canadians as fast as possible, and now has enough doses for every eligible person in Canada - two months ahead of our original projections,” Anand said. “This milestone was made possible by a true Team Canada effort across government.”So far, 79.66% of those above the age of 12 have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Of the total population eligible for anti-Covid jabs, 57.45% are fully vaccinated, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Canada’s vaccination programme had started in the second week of December last year.Meanwhile, with Covid-19 vaccines aplenty, Quebec has taken the extraordinary step of offering a third dose to those who need it for travel purposes. In its latest guidelines, the province said it considers “well protected against Covid-19” those who have received two doses of the AstraZeneca or Covishield jabs or a combination of the two, or one of either followed by an mRNA jab for the second. In Québec, it said “these individuals are considered to be adequately protected”, but that may not apply in all countries as “there is no international consensus on what is valid proof of adequate vaccination”.In what it described as an “exceptional measure”, it said “people who are required to get an additional dose of an RNA vaccine can get one in a vaccination centre, if required to travel outside the country”.However, it warned that such persons “must be properly guided to be informed of the potential risks associated with the additional dose, compared to the benefits of the planned trip. At this time, no study has assessed the impact of such an additional dose”.A debate is raging in Canada on this matter, since AZ has yet to be authorised in the United States, and Covishield in several European nations, and Canada’s policy of mixing and matching jabs could also be a hurdle for international travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-we-have-enough-anti-covid-shots-to-vaccinate-entire-eligible-population-101627449268950.html

According to Bhutan's health ministry, the vaccines that were received from foreign donations were used up in this inoculation drive.Bhutan, situated between India and China, has a population of less than eight lakh. The Himalayan kingdom started vaccinating its population with the second dose of the Covid-19 shot from July 20 and within seven days i.e. by July 27 (Tuesday), 90% of the entire population had been fully vaccinated, said the country's health ministry.The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) praised the rapid vaccination rate against Covid-19 in Bhutan and called it a "great success story".“We really need a world in which the countries which have surplus vaccines really do donate to those countries that haven’t received (shots) so far,” news agency AFP quoted Will Parks, Unicef's Bhutan representative, as saying. “And if there’s anything that I hope the world that can learn, is that a country like Bhutan with very few doctors, very few nurses, but a really committed king and leadership in the government mobilising society – it’s not impossible to vaccinate the whole country.”Bhutan had quickly used up the 550,000 AstraZeneca jabs donated by India back in March and early April for the first vaccine shots to its citizenry. However, due to a subsequent surge in Covid-19 infections in India, the exports were halted, which eventually led to a growing time gap between the first and the second doses.Bhutan later launched an appeal for donations, following which several Western countries sent Covid-19 vaccine doses to the Himalayan nation. Around half a million Moderna doses arrived from the United States soon, followed by 250,000 AstraZeneca shots from Denmark in mid-July.China, Bulgaria, Croatia, and other nations are also expected to send more than 150,000 doses of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sinopharm vaccines to Bhutan soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-fully-vaccinates-90-population-in-one-week-unicef-lauds-success-story-101627447149530.html
28-07-2021||World||Covid-19: US brings back face masks to control spread of Delta variant||The top US health agency has reversed its earlier mask protocol for those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, issuing a new guidance issued on Tuesday that recommends the use of face coverings in high-risk areas.“To maximise protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission,” the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in its latest guidance.More than two months ago, on May 13, the CDC had recommended that people who are fully vaccinated - those who received both shots of the two-dose Covid-19 vaccines such as Moderna and Pfizer - need not wear masks both indoors and outdoors.The Alpha variant of the coronavirus, which was prevalent at that time, was not as highly transmissible as Delta, which has been spreading rapidly in the United States feeding primarily on the unvaccinated. The CDC has called an ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.Daily tallies of new cases have been spiking, going up to 89,418 on Monday, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker. Almost all new hospitalisation cases and deaths in the country are of those infected by the Delta variant of the virus.US President Joe Biden called the new guidance “another step on our journey to defeating this virus” and appealed to Americans who live in the areas covered by the CDC guidance to follow it. “I certainly will when I travel to these areas,” he said, underscoring his support for it.Republicans, especially former US president Donald Trump, slammed the new mask guidance as overreach by the government, continuing their opposition to mitigation measures.Their arguments have included questioning the efficacy and safety of Covid vaccines, which has prevented many of them from getting the shots that are free and easily available.“We won’t go back. We won’t mask our children,” said Trump, stepping up his attacks on mitigation measures. “Brave Americans learned how to safely and responsibly live and fight back.”Trump’s reluctance to use masks when he was president contributed to the politicisation of America’s fight against the pandemic, in which Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, has come to be portrayed as a villain by the former president’s allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-brings-back-face-masks-to-control-spread-of-delta-variant-101627447108590.html
28-07-2021||World||China gets Uyghur man arrested from Morocco, activists fear extradition||Moroccan authorities have arrested an Uyghur activist in exile based on a Chinese terrorism warrant distributed by Interpol, according to information from Moroccan police and a rights group that tracks people detained by China.Activists fear Yidiresi Aishan will be extradited to China, and say the arrest is politically driven and part of a broader Chinese campaign to hunt down perceived dissidents outside its borders.Morocco's General Directorate for National Security said Tuesday that a Chinese citizen was arrested after landing at Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca on July 20, upon arrival from Istanbul.He “was the subject of a red notice issued by Interpol due to his suspected belonging to an organization on the lists of terrorist organizations,” the directorate said.The red notice — the equivalent of being put on Interpol's most-wanted list — was issued at the request of China, which is seeking his extradition, the directorate said. It said Moroccan authorities notified Interpol and the Chinese authorities about the arrest, and the Chinese citizen was referred to prosecutors pending the extradition procedure.Moroccan police didn't publicly name the arrested man, but nongovernmental organization Safeguard Defenders identified him as Aishan. The group specializes in cases of people detained by China.Aishan, a 33-year-old computer engineer and father of three, has been based in Turkey since 2012, where he worked as a web designer and activist and has residency papers, according to friend and colleague Abduweli Ayup.Aishan worked on an Uyghur diaspora online newspaper and assisted other activists in media outreach and collecting testimonies of abuse in China's Xinjiang province.After repeated arrests in Turkey, Aishan left Istanbul for Casablanca on the evening of July 19, Ayup said. Aishan called his wife on Saturday and said he was being deported, according to Ayup, who is in touch with Aishan's family.Interpol and the Chinese Embassy in Morocco didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the arrest. The exact charges against him are unclear.Morocco ratified an extradition treaty with China in 2017, among several such treaties China has made in recent years.China has described its sweeping lockup of a million or more Uyghurs and other largely Muslim minorities as a “war against terror,” after knifings and bombings by a small number of extremist Uyghurs native to Xinjiang.Researchers say many innocent people have been detained for things like going abroad or attending religious gatherings.Safeguard Defenders has appealed to the Moroccan ambassadors in Washington and Brussels not to extradite Aishan. It is “not uncommon” for Chinese authorities to obtain Interpol red notices for Uyghur and other dissidents abroad, said Peter Dahlin of Safeguard Defenders.In a similar case, a Chinese teenager who says he's a US permanent resident was arrested in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in April while transferring for a flight. Chinese officials had sought Wang Jingyu, a 19-year-old student, over his online comments about deadly border clashes between Chinese and Indian forces last year.The US state department called it a human rights concern. Wang was freed in May, and he and his fiancee fled to the Netherlands.Experts say both cases feed into growing fears of extraterritorial reach by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gets-uyghur-man-arrested-from-morocco-activists-fear-extradition-101627443030152.html

He spoke to President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday, after which Stoltenberg tweeted, "The security situation in Afghanistan remains deeply challenging, and requires a negotiated settlement. NATO will continue to support Afghanistan, including with funding; civilian presence; and out-of-country training.”Speaking about the offensive against Taliban, ANDSF spokesperson General Ajaml Omar Shinwarai said on Tuesday that over 1520 insurgents were killed and more than 800 injured in a total of 154 military operations conducted over the last one week.The Aghan defence operations included land operations, airstrikes, and artillery shells.General Shinwarai also accused the Taliban of killing 14 civilians and injuring nearly 30 more during the same period, The Khaama Press reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-diaspora-hold-protest-march-in-california-against-taliban-atrocities-101627441774667.html
28-07-2021||World||'Putin has a real problem': Biden says Russia messing with 2022 polls, warns cyberattacks could spell war||Joe Biden, the president of the United States of America, on Tuesday, accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of trying to disrupt the 2022 US midterm elections, slated to be held in November next year, when all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate will be contested. Referring to Putin as "dangerous", the US president alleged that his Russian counterpart is leading an economy that only has nuclear weapons and "nothing else".Biden made these remarks to about 120 representatives of the US intelligence who gathered on this day at the headquarters of the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI) in northern Virginia."Look at what Russia doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation," said the US president, referring to the information he received during his daily briefing. Without elaborating much on the matter, Biden said that the Russian president's actions are a "pure violation" of the United States' sovereignty."Putin has a real problem," Biden said. "He is sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and nothing else. He knows he is in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous in my view."The US president also pointed out the recent increase in cyberattacks, including ransomware, allegedly conducted by Moscow. "If we end up in a war, a real shooting war, with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach," Biden warned, adding that the ransomware attacks typically see hackers encrypting victims' data and then demanding money for restored access.The US midterm elections are scheduled to be held on November 8, 2022. As many as 39 state and territorial gubernatorial and numerous other state and local elections are also slated to be held around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-has-a-real-problem-biden-accuses-russia-of-messing-with-2022-polls-101627438431162.html
28-07-2021||World||Vaccinated people in high Covid-risk areas of US need to mask again||People vaccinated against Covid-19 in high-risk parts of the United States should resume wearing masks indoors, the top health authority said Tuesday, a major shift in coronavirus guidance that underscores the country's struggle to suppress the Delta variant.President Joe Biden said the announcement showed that America needs to "do better" on vaccinations, adding that a mandate for the country's more than two million federal workers was now "under consideration."Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky relayed the mask decision in a press call, citing new data that shows that while vaccines remain highly effective, rare breakthrough cases involving Delta have an increased risk of onward transmission."In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor settings," she said.According to the latest CDC data, much of the southern United States is experiencing high or substantial transmission, while highly vaccinated parts of the Northeast are mostly experiencing moderate rates of community transmission.Substantial is defined as being between 50 to 100 daily cases per 100,000 people over a seven day average, while high is defined as more than 100 daily cases per 100,000.In a statement following the move, Biden said he would lay out new steps on Thursday to overcome a lag in vaccinations, which have stalled badly for months despite the fact the United States has the highest supply of any country.In a separate address to the US intelligence community, when asked about a possible vaccine mandate for US federal workers, Biden replied: "That's under consideration right now."On Monday, the Veterans Affairs department said it would require its frontline health workers, some 115,000 people, to get the shot, becoming the first federal agency to institute the requirement.- 'Temporary' measure -Walensky stressed that so-called "breakthrough" cases among people who are vaccinated remain rare -- authorized shots reduce the risk of symptomatic disease seven-fold, and hospitalizations and deaths by a factor of twenty.However, new CDC research showed that when a vaccinated person does become infected, their viral load is similar to an unvaccinated person."That leads us to believe that the breakthrough infections, rare as they are, have the potential to forward transmit at the same capacity of an unvaccinated person."To stem the spread of the Delta variant, the CDC will recommend schools adopt universal masking, including teachers, staff, students and visitors -- regardless of vaccination status -- when they reopen in fall, she added.As recently as last week, the CDC defended its May decision that vaccinated people do not have to wear masks indoors in most circumstances, with exceptions including public transit and hospitals.But infection numbers are now swelling, thanks to the Delta variant, which accounts for around 90 percent of cases.The latest seven day average of daily cases is more than 56,000, similar to levels last seen in April.Forty-nine percent of the US population is fully vaccinated, but the vaccination rate is heavily skewed between politically liberal and conservative parts of the country.Walensky stressed she saw masks as a "temporary" measure, adding: "What we really need to do to drive down these transmissions in areas of high transmission is to get more and more people vaccinated."- Vaccines the solution -Eric Cioe-Pena, director of Global Health at Northwell Health in New York, told AFP that rather than being a reflection of vaccines losing their efficacy, "this is a solution to a problem that exists because we have high levels of people that are not vaccinated.""The main predictor of how much Covid is going to surge in an area is the vaccination rate," he added, so areas that are highly vaccinated will be de facto exempted from the new guidance.According to a recent paper in the journal Virological, the amount of virus found in the first tests of patients with the Delta variant was 1,000 times higher than patients in the first wave of the virus in 2020, greatly increasing its contagiousness.Last month, Israel reinstituted mask mandates, just 10 days after lifting them, due to the Delta variant, and local US jurisdictions, including Los Angeles County, have taken similar steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-in-high-covid-risk-areas-of-us-need-to-mask-again-101627436058377.html
28-07-2021||World||Considering mandatory vaccines for federal workers: Biden||President Joe Biden said he is weighing a requirement for federal workers to get vaccinated as the highly contagious delta variant spreads throughout the USA Covid-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers is “under consideration,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday after visiting the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Virginia.The White House is considering whether to require workers to confirm that they’ve been vaccinated, or submit to regular testing and follow strict protocols like wearing masks, even in areas where there isn’t significant community spread, according to a person familiar with the matter.The president’s comments reflect the heightened concern among American public health officials about the delta variant. He made the remarks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tightened mask guidance, advising that fully vaccinated individuals cover their faces indoors in places where the virus is rapidly spreading.“The more we learn, the more we learn about this virus and the delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned,” Biden said.The White House on Tuesday told staff that they must again wear masks at the complex.Covid fatalities in the US surged 48% over the past week to a daily average of 239 and hospitalizations are also on the rise. The CDC says the delta variant now makes up 83% of all sequenced Covid-19 cases in the US, up from 50% at the beginning of the month. Areas of the country with limited vaccination coverage are allowing spread of the highly transmissible variant.CDC Director Rochelle Walenksy said recent data suggests that some vaccinated people who get infected with the delta variant can spread it to others. Yet Biden, Walensky and other health officials stressed that getting a Covid-19 vaccine offers the best protection against death, hospitalization and illness.Just over 69% of American adults have had at least one vaccine shot, still short of the 70% goal Biden set for the country to meet by July 4.“There’s only one thing we know for sure: If those other 100 million people got vaccinated, we’d be in a very different world,” Biden said Tuesday. “So get vaccinated. If you haven’t, you’re not nearly as smart as I said you were.”In a written statement, Biden called the revised CDC guidelines “another step on our journey to defeating this virus.” He said he would follow it when he travels to areas with high rates of infection. Biden also said that on Thursday he would “lay out the next steps” for getting more Americans vaccinated, but did not specify them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/considering-mandatory-vaccines-for-federal-workers-biden-101627427718562.html
28-07-2021||World||Mask up: CDC set to tell Americans||US health officials will return to tighter guidelines for the use of masks, advising that fully vaccinated individuals wear them in public indoor settings in places where the coronavirus is spreading rapidly as part of a response to the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is expected to recommend that teachers, staff, students and visitors to K-12 schools wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status, according to a preview of the guidance. Children should return to full-time, in-person learning in the fall with prevention strategies in place, the preview said.Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, has warned that the US is moving in the wrong direction in combating a new Covid wave spurred on by Delta.CDC director Rochelle Walensky is planning a press briefing where she’ll discuss breakthrough infections in vaccinated people and using masks to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission.A growing number of public-health experts have urged the agency to recommend that even fully vaccinated people wear face masks in public amid the resurgence of cases fed by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.Fauci said new recommendations on face masks were under active consideration on CNN on Sunday.China: Nanjing sealed offThe city of Nanjing in eastern China has been virtually sealed off and residents advised to stay indoors after 31 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday in the past 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections up to 112 in the ongoing outbreak. Authorities said genetic sequencing of the virus from the cluster turned out to be of the Delta variant.Beijing calls on WHO to probe Fort Detrick labChina hit back at the US over the investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 virus, with Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the country’s foreign affairs ministry, suggesting on Monday that if labs are to be investigated, then the World Health Organization (WHO) should also probe Fort Detrick, which is a military base in Maryland, US.“If labs are to be investigated, then the WHO experts should go to Fort Detrick. The US should act transparently and responsibly as soon as possible and invite WHO experts for an inquiry into the Fort Detrick lab. Only in this way can truth be revealed to the world,” Zhao tweeted. The remark came in response to calls for a second round of investigation into the origin of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mask-up-cdc-set-to-tell-americans-101627419566102.html
28-07-2021||World||Vatican in the dock: Biggest criminal case in its modern history underway||A trial opened on Tuesday, within Vatican City’s imposing walls, of 10 defendants including a once powerful cardinal in a case based on a sprawling probe into the allegedly criminal management of the Holy See’s portfolio of assets, including donations by countless Catholics from the pews.Among the defendants is an Italian prelate, Angelo Becciu, a long-time Vatican diplomat whom Pope Francis raised to cardinal’s rank in 2018. After a web of scandals started unravelling during a two-year investigation, Francis gave Becciu the boot last year as chief of the Catholic church’s saint-making office. Francis also has removed Becciu’s rights as a cardinal.Less than three months ago, it would have been impossible for a cardinal to be in the dock in Vatican City state, which has its own justice system and even a jail. But Francis had a Vatican law changed so that Vatican-based cardinals and bishops can be prosecuted and judged by the Holy See’s lay criminal tribunal as long as the pontiff signs off on that. Becciu, 73, is charged with embezzlement and with pressing a monsignor to recant information he supplied to prosecutors about the handling of a disastrous Vatican real estate investment in London. Becciu has denied any wrongdoing.The presiding judge, Giuseppe Pignatone, is a retired chief prosecutor of Rome who earlier in his career took on the Mafia and economic wrongdoing in Sicily.To accommodate the largest criminal trial in the Vatican’s modern history, the hearings are being held in a large hall converted into a courtroom in the Vatican Museums. Defendants are alleged to have had various roles in actions that effectively cost the Holy See tens of millions of dollars in donated funds through poor investments, dealings with shady money managers and purported favours to friends and family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-in-the-dock-biggest-criminal-case-in-its-modern-history-underway-101627419382734.html
28-07-2021||India||On 2 cases from UP and Odisha, SC makes 1 point on detention after charge sheet||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that a person’s custody may not be necessary after filing of charge sheet if he has remained on bail during the period of investigation.The court was dealing with two cases that posed similar questions concerning the liberty of the accused. In the first case, a person charged with a graft case in Uttar Pradesh was issued non-bailable warrants for not appearing despite being served summons by the trial judge. The accused was on bail throughout the investigation and even the charge sheet was filed in the case.The second case from Odisha presented similar facts before the court. An accused in a chit fund scam was denied permission to appear virtually before the trial judge due to the Covid pandemic and faced non-bailable warrants from the trial judge. In this case too, the charge sheet was filed and at no point during the investigation, the accused had been arrested.The bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy protected both the accused from arrest by staying the non-bailable warrants. The court directed the accused to appear before the trial court and posted the matter for hearing on August 18.Both cases were probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In the UP case, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra appearing for the accused Satender Kumar Antil, pointed out a disturbing trend prevailing in the state. “The system sought to be followed especially in the state of Uttar Pradesh is that even if a person is not arrested during investigations, on charge sheet being filed, more so, in such cases of CBI, a person is sent to custody.”It was this apprehension that forced the accused to seek anticipatory bail that was rejected by the Allahabad High Court on July 1.Commenting on this trend, the bench said, “Prima facie, we cannot appreciate why in such a scenario is there a requirement for the petitioner being sent to custody. It will be appropriate to lay down some principle.”Antil was working as assistant provident fund commissioner when he was accused in August 2020 of being a beneficiary of ₹9 lakh bribe paid to an inspector working under him. The charge sheet was filed in October 2020, following which the special CBI court in Ghaziabad issued summons asking him to appear on February 2. The accused could not appear and his anticipatory bail was quashed by the trial judge, and non-bailable warrants issued.The top court on Wednesday wondered why the accused did not move a regular bail plea since the investigation in the case was complete. Luthra pointed out that in UP, once an accused appears on the summons, he is sent to custody regardless of the bail plea being filed.The bench felt that the issue raised a question of a person’s liberty. It was presented with the same situation while dealing with the Odisha case. This related to Amanpreet Singh, an accused in a chit fund scam. Singh was issued the summons to appear before the special chief judicial magistrate on June 9. Due to the pandemic, he requested for virtual appearance. The trial court rejected his request and issued non-bailable warrants.Senior advocate Maninder Singh, who appeared for Amanpreet, cited a June 4 order of the Orissa high court which only permitted entry into court premises to staffers due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Throughout the probe, CBI never sought his arrest and now his regular bail plea was rejected by Orissa High Court on July 9.The bench protected the petitioner from arrest and asked him to attend the trial proceedings virtually till there is a possibility to attend the courts physically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-2-cases-from-up-and-odisha-sc-makes-1-point-on-detention-after-charge-sheet-101627495429653.html

Dismissing speculations that with Yediyurappa being active in Karnataka politics, he might not have actual power, Bommai said, "In our system and the constitution there is the position of the Chief Minister, there is a cabinet, there is bureaucracy, executive and judiciary. The Chief Minister is first among equals, he is the team leader and I want to take everyone together.""When I say I will work under the guidance of Yediyuyrappa it means, following the strong and pro-people decisions taken by him during Covid. Despite corona and financial distress he had formulated several schemes in the budget and has given a good administration," he said making the power equation clear.Thank you Prime Minister @narendramodi ji for your kind wishes. I will definitely continue the good work done by state govt under able leadership of @BSYBJP. We, as team will work for the development of the state and the nation under guidelines of all our senior leaders https://t.co/WL6svbRTMXAs Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Basavaraj, he heaped praises on Yediyurappa and tweeted, "No words will ever do justice to the monumental contribution of Shri @BSYBJP Ji towards our Party and for Karnataka’s growth. For decades, he toiled hard, travelled across all parts of Karnataka and struck a chord with people. He is admired for his commitment to social welfare." Replying to PM Modi's tweet, the new chief minister wrote, "Thank you Prime Minister @narendramodi ji for your kind wishes. I will definitely continue the good work done by state govt under able leadership of @BSYBJP. We, as team will work for the development of the state and the nation under guidelines of all our senior leaders." Yeddyurappa too congratulated Basavaraj and wished him a successful tenure.On Thursday, the new CM will visit the flood-ravaged Karwar and then he has plans to fly to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and BJP chief JP Nadda, which will depend on the availability of PM's appointment. He will also discuss cabinet expansion with the national leadership, he said.As Basavaraj Bommai took charge, lobbying for cabinet berth has already begun. When questioned whether he will continue with the same Ministers, Bommai said all these are part of the cabinet formation exercise and "everything will be decided together", PTI reported.Jagdish Shettar who was a minister in the Yediyurappa cabinet said he won't be part of the new cabinet as he is senior to Bommai and has served as a chief minister earlier. "As I am a former Chief Minister and have seniority, I have decided not to be a part of the new cabinet. I was Minister in the Yediyurappa cabinet despite being a former CM as he (Yediyurappa) is senior to me and I had worked in his government in the past too, but now keeping seniority and morality in view I am not ready to be part of the new cabinet," he told new channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-be-a-rubber-stamp-cm-karnataka-s-new-cm-basavaraj-bommai-has-a-message-for-yediyurappa-101627492959039.html

Additional sessions and district judge Uttam Anand was out for his daily morning jog when a three-wheeler hit him.The SIT was set up after CCTV footage emerged in which the three-wheeler was seen suddenly swerving to the extreme left of the road and hitting the judge before fleeing the spotThe accident took place a little over 5am on Wednesday.Judge Uttam Anand was rushed to the city’s medical college by passers-by but doctors said he was dead by the time he was brought. No one knew who he was.It was only much later when the judge’s family, worried that he hadn’t returned home by 7am, notified the police.The judge’s driver who accompanied the police team after it was informed of a road accident, identified his body at the hospital. “I have constituted an SIT led by the city SP who will look into all possible reasons. The CCTV footage and all related aspects would be analysed and identify the vehicle. We have respected the victim’s family members to file a complaint and we will register an FIR,” said Dhanbad senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sanjeev Kumar. The judge is reported to have recently rejected the bail plea of an alleged contract killer from Uttar Pradesh, who is in Dhanbad jail in a high-profile murder case.

28-07-2021||India||CAA, farm laws, China, Afghanistan figure in Blinken’s civil society meeting||Inter-faith relations, the farmers’ protest, freedom of expression and the Pegasus spyware issue figured at a civil society roundtable held by US secretary of state Antony Blinken ahead of his meetings with the Indian leadership on Wednesday.Concerns over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and China’s aggressive actions were also raised by the seven civil society representatives who joined the roundtable with the theme “Advancing equitable, inclusive, and sustainable growth and development”, according to participants who declined to be named.Ahead of Blinken’s visit, the US had said it intended to raise human rights and democracy during his engagements in New Delhi. The US has in the recent past spoken out on issues such as the situation in Kashmir and movements such as the farmers’ protest on the outskirts of Delhi.Besides Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of the Tibet House in New Delhi and Inter-Faith Harmony Foundation of India head Khwaja Iftikhar Ahmed, the roundtable was joined by representatives of the Ramakrishna Mission and Sikh and Christian organisations. The seven representatives spoke for a few minutes each during the roundtable that lasted almost an hour.“The farmers protest, CAA, restrictions on the media, freedom of expression, rights of minorities, inter-faith relations and the Pegasus surveillance issue were all raised by the representatives but there was no substantial discussion on these matters,” said a participant who declined to be named.Besides issues of concern within India, regional issues such as the security situation in Afghanistan and China’s aggression were part of the discussions, said another participant, who too declined to be identified.Ahmed said he had spoken on the need for inter-faith relations to come to the centre stage while pointing out the challenges to the region due to developments in Afghanistan. “Afghanistan is a priority for both sides and it is high time for them to collaborate on this issue in the larger interest of global peace and security,” he said.The role of civil society in India also figured in the discussions, with Blinken saying in his opening remarks that democracies such as the US and India need a vibrant civil society if they are to be “more open, more inclusive, more resilient, more equitable”. He added that “all people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect”.Blinken said India and the US should continue to stand together as leading democracies at a time when global threats to democracy and international freedoms are increasing. Both sides talk about issues such as democracy as friends “because doing the hard work of strengthening democracy and making our ideals real is often challenging”, he said.Referring to efforts in the US to become a “more perfect union”, Blinken said that “sometimes that process is painful, sometimes it’s ugly, but the strength of democracy is to embrace it”. Blinken also tweeted about “India’s pluralistic society and history of harmony” and said civil society “helps advance these values”.It is understood that Blinken flagged the concerns of the US regarding democracy and human rights during his talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Asked about these issues at a joint media interaction with Jaishankar, Blinken said shared values and democratic traditions “were very much a part of our conversation today”. He described Indian democracy as a “force for good in defence of a free and open Indo-Pacific and a free and open world” and said both countries have “self-righting mechanisms” made up of free citizens of different faiths, a free media and independent courts powered by a system of free and fair elections.Jaishankar said he made three points to Blinken, including the fact that the “quest for a more perfect union applies as much to the Indian democracy as it does to the American one”.In an apparent reference to the Indian government’s actions such as enacting CAA, Jaishankar said it is the “moral obligation of all polities to right wrongs when they have been done, including historically, and many of the decisions and policies you have seen in the last few years fall in that category”.He also said freedoms are important but one could “never equate freedom with non-governance or lack of governance or poor governance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-farm-laws-china-afghanistan-figure-in-blinken-s-meeting-with-civil-society-101627491829146.html

28-07-2021||India||Maken in one on one meeting with Rajasthan Cong MLAs before cabinet rejig||In the run up to the cabinet rejig in Rajasthan, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of the state Ajay Maken engaged the Congress legislators in a consultation and feedback exercise on Wednesday to gauge their mood. Maken, who is in the state capital on a two-day visit, held one-on-one discussions with the legislators at the state assembly on Wednesday, inviting criticism from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which called it a misuse of a Constitutional building for a political party’s programme.Congress leaders aware of the developments said Maken had a set of close to a dozen pre-decided questions that he posed to the MLAs to get feedback on ministers’ performances in different districts and implementation of state government’s flagships schemes. Former BSP MLAs who merged with the Congress as well as independent legislators have also been called to the feedback exercise that would conclude by Thursday evening. The exercise was undertaken following a demand by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his loyalist legislators to be accommodated in the government. Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs had revolted against chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s leadership in July 2020 and had been demanding an overhaul in the cabinet and political appointments at the earliest. The demand gained momentum after the Congress Central leadership addressed similar disgruntlement in the party’s Punjab unit. Even as Maken was engaging with the MLAs in Jaipur, Pilot was camping in New Delhi, where he was expected to meet the top Congress leaders. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, on the other hand, will be reviewing the implementation of the party’s election manifesto promises. On the feedback, Transport minister and civil lines MLA Pratap Singh Khacharyiawas said that Congress was a democratic party and the high command hears all its members. “Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had said to us that he is our guardian. Maken is also holding meetings as the guardian,” he said. Khachariyawas said there was no dispute in the party and a cabinet reshuffle was the prerogative of the chief minister and a decision on this will be taken in discussion with the party high command. Chaksu MLA Vedprakash Solanki, a vocal MLA from Sachin Pilot group, said he had apprised Maken of all the issues. “I gave my suggestions and whatever I had to say, I told him. I am satisfied that our viewpoint is now being communicated directly to the party high command. Now, the high command is not listing only to us, but [is] listening to all [the] MLAs,” Solanki said. At the same time, leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria said the need to hold one to one discussion with MLAs made it clear that the government was not able to function well. “Such governments are not able to function well and serve the people,” he said. He also questioned the decision to hold Maken’s dialogue with MLAs in the assembly building. Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi dismissed his concerns calling it a meeting of party MLAs. In the assembly of 200 members, Congress has 106 MLAs while most of the 13 independents are in support of the ruling party. AICC general secretaries Maken and KC Venugopal had held meeting with Ashok Gehlot over Cabinet reshuffle last Saturday and Sunday. After Wednesday’s feedback meeting, Maken said the entire process of cabinet expansion, and political appointments were nearing completion.“I am very satisfied with the feedback. The MLAs I met today, over 50, (which also included the disgruntled) appreciated the government and development work done in their respective constituencies,” he said.He claimed that his interaction revealed how things had changed since his interaction with MLAs last year. “I interacted with the MLAs last year (during the internal crisis in state Congress) and now today. There is a huge difference, all are happy and satisfied,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maken-in-one-on-one-meeting-with-rajasthan-cong-mlas-before-cabinet-rejig-101627489128849.html

Dongchung presented Blinken a scarf from the Dalai Lama and conveyed the CTA’s gratitude for the US administration’s backing for the Tibetan cause, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The meeting was one of the most conspicuous contacts between American and Tibetan officials since President Barack Obama met the Dalai Lama in Washington in 2016 and former CTA head Lobsang Sangay was invited to the White House last November.The meeting also came two days after US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and raised American concerns about human rights, including abuses in Tibet, the anti-democracy crackdown in Hong Kong, and the genocide in Xinjiang.“Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to meet briefly this morning in New Delhi with a representative of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Central Tibetan Administration representative Ngodup Dongchung,” a US state department spokesperson said without giving details.Another US official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said: “The Dalai Lama obviously is a globally revered spiritual leader and so the gesture was gratefully received and appreciated.”The people cited above said the meeting was being seen as a strong signal of support for the Dalai Lama and was also significant as it was held in India at a time when New Delhi and Beijing are locked in a standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“It was a clear signal that the Biden administration will continue the Trump administration’s high-level engagements and support to the Tibetan side. It also has to be seen in the context of the Tibet Policy and Support Act passed by the US Congress last year, which calls for the Tibetans to have the final say in choosing the successor to the Dalai Lama and the setting up of a US consulate in Lhasa,” one of the people cited above said.Geshe Dorji Damdul, the director of the Tibet House in New Delhi, was among the select group of people invited for a civil society roundtable with Blinken shortly after the meeting with Dongchung.There was no immediate response from the Chinese side to the meeting between Blinken and Dongchung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-signals-support-for-tibet-cause-with-blinken-meeting-dalai-lama-s-representative-in-new-delhi-101627486368750.html

Cash prizes of up to ₹5 lakh in each category! Last date for entries is 15.08.2021," Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a tweet.The setting up of a DFI was announced by the finance minister in Budget 2021-22.In March, Parliament passed the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) Bill."Infrastructure is essential to building a new India. This would mean new projects, expanding existing infra and revitalizing decrepit infra. The National Infrastructure Pipeline of ₹111 lakh crore was a recognition of this need and accordingly over 7000 projects were identified. However, the execution and completion of these projects will require timely finance and the requirement of funds is large," according to mygov.in website.This Infra DFI will be a development bank with credibility and a mandate through explicit government support and this DFI will crowd in, not elbow out, other lenders, it said."It will not do everything itself. Therefore, it will not only be a provider of credit and credit plus services but equally, be an enabler and a catalyst for a new ecosystem for infra based on collaboration and on partnership. Its operations will prioritize risk mitigation, product innovation, accessing green and ethical funds and helping to develop a vibrant bond market," it added.The Department of Financial Services under the finance ministry has invited citizens to coin a name, suggest a tagline and design a logo for the DFI.It should in effect be like a visual signature, easy to recall and pronounce. Each of the three elements would stand out on its own but would represent a synergised approach, as per the website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-invites-entries-for-new-dfi-s-name-logo-101627483023669.html
28-07-2021||India||Assam Congress leaders prevented from visiting Mizoram border, lash out at CM||A group of Assam Congress leaders including Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president Bhupen Bora, Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Debabrata Saikia, parliamentarians Gaurav Gogoi and Pradyut Bordoloi, deputy CLP Rakibul Hussain, president of All India Mahila Congress Committee Sushmita Dev, and APCC working president and lawmaker Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha were stopped few kilometres from the Mizoram border on Wednesday by Assam Police, citing the need to not let the situation turn volatile.The Congress leaders protested the move and attacked Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma.“Himanta Biswa Sarma was showing a strong attitude on Monday but we were shocked to hear what he said on Tuesday while visiting Silchar. We thought he is a strong personality but he turned out to be a weak man crawling before the Centre. [We] did not expect him to say that he will hand over Barak Valley or Nalbari, both in Assam, to anyone if the Centre instructs,” Sushmita Dev said.Gaurav Gogoi said the violent clash between people and police forces of Assam and Mizoram was due to the failure of the Central government and its policies.“We wonder how the Central government’s intelligence could not figure out that such a big attack was being planned. This is not a new issue but the discussion has been going on since long. At this moment, BJP has governments both at the Centre and in the state. Mizoram government is also a friend of the BJP. They could not initiate proper dialogue and provoked the common people to be violent. It is a failure of the Central government led by the BJP,” Gogoi said addressing a press conference at Indira Bhawan in Silchar.The Congress delegation appealed to Assam and Mizoram residents to maintain peace.BJP MP from Silchar Rajdeep Roy dismissed Congress criticism and said the saffron party did not want “suggestion or criticism from a failed leadership like the Congress party”. He added that the BJP was working “strategically” for overall development of entire northeast. “Congress has lost relevance in all Northeastern states and they are now trying to make themselves visible by accusing the BJP on false grounds,” he said.Roy said, “Congress ruled these states for almost 95 percent of the time since Independence but didn’t solve any issues. Present government in Assam is only 3-months old, how can one expect it to solve such long-pending issue all of a sudden,” he asked.He also criticised the Congress delegation alleging they were acting irresponsibly. “After the firing incident, Assam-Mizoram border has become a sensitive area. Even chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma did not go there immediately. But the Congress team led by Sushmita Dev tried to go there today and now they are making baseless allegations. This shows that she doesn’t have any administrative responsibility.”Meanwhile, shutdown called by various organisations in Assam’s Cachar district on Wednesday to protest the violence that led to deaths of six Assam policemen and one civilian received support from the residents. The protesters burnt an effigy of Mizoram chief minister ZoramThanga and called for a complete boycott of Mizoram.A group of students staged a protest in front of Mizoram Circuit House in Silchar. They were seen carrying banners condemning the Mizoram government. Throughout the demonstration, slogans like Mizo Police go back, Mizo aggressors go back, were heard.Protestors also removed a portion of the railway tracks in Hailakandi district, which connects Mizoram’s only railway station Bhairavi to other parts of the country. It was later restored by the railway department with the help of police.A 25-year-old driver Abdul Ali Laskar from Khulicherra area under Dholai constituency of Assam, who sustained bullet injury on Monday, said, “We are victims of violence from Mizoram’s side for years. We went to support the police but did not expect to get bullets on our bodies. A local chemist operated on my wound and took the bullet out from my forehead. We don’t want this sort of violence anymore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-leaders-prevented-from-visiting-mizoram-border-lash-out-at-cm-101627485229234.html

I am a person from the street,” she said.However, Banerjee evaded questions regarding the face of Opposition in the 2024 elections, citing that she isn’t a “political astrologer.”Also Read | 'Khela hobe', says Mamata even as she skirts Delhi leadership queries“We will sit together and decide, I am not a political astrologer.

28-07-2021||India||Assam, Mizoram to withdraw own forces; CRPF to take over till a solution: Centre||Assam and Mizoram will withdraw their respective police forces and Central paramilitary troops will be deployed at the disputed border site till a permanent solution is found. This was decided on Wednesday in a meeting called by Union home secretary to mediate between the sparring states, people familiar with the development said.The crucial meeting, called following clashes between the two sides on Monday resulted in deaths of five Assam policemen and a civilian, was attended by Assam chief secretary Jishnu Baruah and director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta and their respective Mizoram counterparts Lalnunmawia Chuaungo and SBK Singh, apart from the director general of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) – Kuldiep Singh.After more than two hours of discussions, both the states agreed for deployment of a neutral force, therefore a Central paramilitary force will be posted along National Highway-306 under a senior officer, said a home ministry official, requesting anonymity.Subsequently, both the states decided to withdraw all their police officers from the site and “agreed to continue mutual discussions to resolve the border issue in an amicable manner”, this officer said.Assam CS Barua told reporters after the meeting, “Paramilitary forces will take over Veringte border. The process of withdrawal of state police is being worked out.”Mizoram CS Chuaungo said the situation was currently peaceful at the border. “We will try to maintain peace. There is no point indulging in violence. Forces are being withdrawn from the area”.MHA officials said they will continue to facilitate talks and monitor the ground situation.The CRPF already has five companies (around 500 personnel) deployed there while two companies are on standby.Assam and Mizoram had been talking through their chief secretaries in a Centre-chaperoned dialogue process to douse interstate border tensions before police forces of the two northeastern states fatally clashed on July 26, shocking the country.One round of talks in the national capital was held on July 8, an official aware of the development said. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, too, told the media on Tuesday, putting out his version of the dispute that the talks failed at the final stage of a proposed memorandum of understanding.The official cited above said the talks between the two sides were focussed on some kind of “status quo ante”, which refers to a return to earlier positions. The process failed because differences persisted over what should be the point of the status quo ante, the person said.Assam proposed a satellite-based mapping of the disputed interstate border, a proposal that found its way into a draft memorandum of understanding, while Mizoram proposed chief secretary-level talks monitored by the Centre.“My proposal to him (Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga) was that we will carry out satellite photography of the borders as on the day of my swearing in (May 10 2021). In the talks, Assam had said that whatever is the status quo situation, be that on May 10 or six months ago or as on date, we should maintain status quo on the border as determined through satellite mapping,” Sarma said in one of his several media briefings on Tuesday.Northeastern states have a history of ethnic strife. Internal border disputes go back at least a century. The triggers often are disputed claims over land, forest resources, encroachment, ethnic differences and even rumours.Assam’s border disputes have their roots in how the state was carved up to form other states in the region. Mizoram, which became a state in 1987, was once a part of Assam.Mizoram’s home minister Lalchamliana declined to comment on the talks but said: “Mizoram stands for peaceful resolution of the border dispute. Assam policemen first crossed into our areas and overran police posts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-to-withdraw-own-forces-crpf-to-take-over-till-a-solution-centre-101627482348265.html

28-07-2021||India||Kishtwar Cloudburst: 7 bodies recovered, 17 rescued, 6 critical, 26 missing||At least seven people were killed and 17 others were injured, five of them critically while 26 remained missing after flash floods hit Honjar village in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kishtwar district following a cloud burst early Wednesday. Officials said they managed to rescue 17 people amid heavy rain in the region.“Seven bodies have been recovered so far from the debris and 17 injured were rescued. Out of the injured, six critically injured were shifted to Kishtwar district hospital,” additional director general of police (ADGP) Mukesh Singh said. He added that a rescue team of Kishtwar police was at work.Another officer at the Kishtwar police control room said 26 people remained missing and “chances of their survival looked grim”. He said the cloud burst was reported at 4 am on Wednesday and initially 28 people were reported missing. A defence spokesman too confirmed that approximately 26 persons were feared to be missing.“On a request from the civil administration, two columns of the Indian Army were launched to carry out rescue operations in village Honzar. The village was caught in a flash flood due to a cloud burst, which led to the sudden rise in water level in the Malu and Nath rivulets. Approximately 26 persons are feared to be missing and more than 15 houses and dhoks (sheds of nomads) have also been submerged under the water or were washed away,” he said.The Indian Army has also made provision of meals for 100 persons and provided dry rations to the affected. The weather conditions over the village continue to remain poor, thereby increasing the difficulty in rescue and relief operations.Earlier, Kishtwar’s senior police superintendent Shafqat Bhat said they believed 30 to 40 people were in Honjar village, around 50km from Kishtwar district headquarters, at the time of the cloudburst. He said bridges have been washed away in the area and a local river was in full spate.In a tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Centre is closely monitoring the situation. “...in the wake of the cloudbursts in #Kishtwar and #Kargil (Ladakh). All possible assistance is being made available in the affected areas. I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being.”Officials said air force, army, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were rushed for the rescue operations.Union Home minister Amit Shah said saving as many lives as possible was the priority. “I have spoken to the L-G (lieutenant governor) and the DGP (director general of police) of Jammu & Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kishtwar. SDRF, Army & local administration are carrying out the rescue operation. NDRF is also reaching there.”Officials said SDRF teams from Doda, Udhampur, and Jammu have been rushed to Kishtwar while a team of NDRF and SDRF each were on standby in Srinagar. SDRF commandant VK Singh said a police team left for the scene on foot. “The area is in the upper reaches of Kishtwar, not accessible by road. Jammu SDRF is on standby. The weather is inclement. One team of SDRF from Srinagar is ready to be airlifted,” said Singh.A number of big and small bridges in Dachhan, Kundal and Chasoti area of Paddar and Dachan in Kishtwar had been washed away along with several other bridges between Gulabgarh to Machail.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said widespread intermittent rain was most likely to continue till July 30 in Jammu & Kashmir. “Heavy to very heavy rain is also possible at some places,” it said. The department warned that heavy rains may lead to flash floods, mudslides, landslides, and water logging in low-lying areas. “Accordingly, people are once again advised to remain alert and very cautious as water levels have risen in all rivers. Don’t venture out on hilly and landslide, mudslide prone areas.”Meanwhile, another cloudburst triggered flash floods near the cave shrine of Shri Amarnath in South Kashmir on Wednesday.“The incident occurred near the cave shrine. There was no loss of life but big boulders came crashing down in the flash floods near the cave shrine. Security personnel deployed near the cave shrine had a narrow escape,” said a police officer.The pilgrimage was cancelled for the second year running in view of the Covid pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kishtwar-cloudburst-7-bodies-recovered-17-rescued-6-critical-26-missing-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101627480668071.html
28-07-2021||India||Explained: Does Kerala have lowest immunity against Covid-19?||The Union health ministry on Wednesday released state-wise seroprevalence data which showed that Madhya Pradesh has the highest percentage of seroprevalence while Kerala has the lowest. The Centre has also asked the states to conduct local seroprevalence surveys in consultation with the Indian Council of Medical Research so that district-level data can be generated on the percentage of people who have antibodies against Covid-19. The state-wise seroprevalence data is part of ICMR's fourth national serosurvey in which it was found that one-third of the Indian population is still vulnerable to the infection, while two-thirds have antibodies.According to the ICMR's 4th serosurvey, conducted in 70 districts of the country, Madhya Pradesh reported the highest seroprevalence of 79 per cent. Madhya Pradesh is followed by Rajasthan (76.2%), Bihar (75.9 %) etc.Also Read: How close is India to achieve herd immunity? What experts sayThe lowest seroprevalence was reported from Kerala (44.4%), preceded by Assam (50.3 per cent) and Maharashtra (58.0%).Overall, 70 per cent of Indians have antibodies against Covid, the survey, published a few days ago, revealed.Statewise seropositivity rate and the significance of the dataKerala scores lowest in serosurvey: What does this mean?Does this mean that Kerala scores lowest in herd immunity? In a way yes, as the present Covid-19 situation of the state also highlights the same. The state is now contributing to 50 per cent of fresh cases being reported daily in India. The fact that these many people are contracting the infection at a time when the pandemic is on the decline in most other states implies that this population of Kerala did not have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Kerala Covid expert committee member Dr Anish told ANI that Kerala has vaccinated proportionately more people than the national average. The centre should give more vaccines to Kerala since it is behind the national average of herd immunity threshold.Natural infection plus vaccination is seroprevalenceSerosurvey reveals how many people have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies might be a result of vaccination or natural infection. Kerala's Covid expert committee's Dr Anish said since Kerala's vaccine coverage is proportionately more than many other states, its low score in herd immunity implies that the number of people developing antibodies through natural infection is low.Serosurvey and third waveHow telling are the serosurvey findings in connection with the possible third wave of the pandemic? The bottom three states in herd immunity against Covid-19 are Kerala, Assam and Maharashtra. While the situation in Kerala is worrisome with daily cases not going down, the Covid-19 graph in Maharashtra has plateaued. Northeast states are also reporting a higher number of Covid-19 cases. States which have lower seroprevalence are still reporting a higher number of fresh infections and thereby are at a greater risk of any possible future wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-scores-lowest-in-icmr-s-seroprevalence-survey-madhya-pradesh-highest-explained-101627478969937.html

The Trinamool Congress supremo's visit to Kejriwal followed her meetings with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi earlier in the day and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday.Mamata Banerjee is in the national capital for the past five days, during which she met a host of opposition leaders, including Congress' Kamal Nath and Anand Sharma on Tuesday.Following her stellar victory in the assembly elections in West Bengal, where she faced the Bharatiya Janata Party in a do-or-die battle, Mamata Banerjee emerged as a prominent figure among the opposition camp's attempt at stitching together a unified anti-BJP coalition ahead of the 2024 general elections.ALSO READ | Khela hobe: Congress, TMC display bonhomie ahead of Mamata's Delhi visitThe talk of an anti-BJP front gained pace after leaders of various political parties and prominent individuals gathered at NCP chief Sharad Pawar's New Delhi residence last month.Mamata avoided comments on leadership queries and said the opposition parties would convene and decide on the prime ministerial face against PM Modi.“Poore desh me khela hoga. It's a continuous process...

28-07-2021||India||'Legal protection must,' says Gavi as Moderna, Pfizer still await India's nod||Pfizer and Moderna doses through World Health Organization's vaccine alliance Gavi have reached Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But in India, the issue is still stuck at the question of indemnity, or legal protection, as the government has not yet decided to extend legal protection to foreign companies, as that would raise similar demands from Indian vaccine makers as well. "Our team is in continuous dialogue with Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to discuss and address various issues including the issue of indemnity," Bharati Pravin Pawar said in Parliament on Tuesday.According to a Reuters report, Gavi authorities said that legal protections for vaccine suppliers were mandatory. "All facility participants must have signed indemnity agreements with the manufacturers in question in order to receive doses through COVAX – which would also be true for doses received via bilateral deals," a Gavi spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. India is also a participant in the Gavi alliance.When will Moderna, Pfizer, J&J vaccines will arrive in India?The government had earlier announced that vaccines that are already recognised by WHO and similar other authorities of other countries won't have to undergo local trials. Moderna applied for permission to the Drug Controller General of India which was granted but Pfizer and J&J did not yet apply.Attributing to government sources, Reuters reported that Moderana's Indian partner Cipla had offered to shoulder some legal responsibilities which Moderna rejected. "The government cannot give indemnity to anyone. The government is saying domestic companies can give indemnity on behalf of their foreign partners," Reuters said quoting sources.It has been one month since Moderna was okayed by the Indian drug controller, but the United States is yet to receive a green signal from India, which is stuck over the issue of legal protection. The foreign vaccine manufacturers do not want to be dragged to court in case of any post-vaccination adverse effect. But India has not yet extended this protection to any vaccine maker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legal-protection-must-says-gavi-as-moderna-pfizer-still-await-india-s-nod-101627476497942.html
28-07-2021||India||48% parents unwilling to send kids to school till they are vaccinated against Covid-19: Survey||A recent survey conducted in India with more than 32,000 parents across 361 districts showed that 48% of the parents were not willing to send their children to school till they are vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), news agency PTI reported on Wednesday. Of these 32,000 parents, 47% were from tier 1 districts, 27% from tier 2 districts and 26% were from tier 3, 4 and rural districts.Several states including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh partially reopened schools earlier this month amid a downfall in their daily cases of the viral disease. On the other hand, states such as Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh are in the process of reopening their schools from August.“Vaccinating children in the coming months is going to be key if children are to go to schools for physical classes. Forty-eight per cent of the surveyed parents said they are not willing to send their children to schools till they are vaccinated,” the survey conducted by an online platform, Local Circles, said.It pointed out that only 21% of the respondents agreed to send their children to schools whenever they reopened. While 30% said they will send their wards to schools if Covid-19 cases come down to zero in their districts, the survey by Local Circles further showed.Schools across India were shut in March 2020 when the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the viral disease. They were partially reopened in October in adherence with Covid-appropriate behaviour but were again closed in April this year as the country witnessed a highly infectious second wave of the pandemic.India has so far recorded 31,484,605 cases, 422,022 deaths and 30,663,147 recoveries due to the coronavirus disease till now. On Wednesday, the country saw 43,654 new cases and 640 more deaths. Even though the daily cases haven’t spiked since the peak of May 7, India continues to stare at an upcoming third wave of the pandemic, which is likely to affect children most.In a major development on Tuesday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that the Centre is likely to begin administering vaccines to children from next month.“In BJP Parliamentary Party meeting today, Union Health Min Mansukh Mandaviya said that the government would likely start vaccinating children next month for Covid-19,” sources told news agency ANI on Tuesday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/48-parents-unwilling-to-send-kids-to-school-till-they-are-vaccinatedsurvey-101627476421521.html

In a letter to the chief secretaries of states and Union territories, secretary of the Union home affairs ministry Ajay Bhalla asked them to ensure strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour in each districts."There is no room for complacency," Bhalla wrote in his letter and said the process of relaxing restrictions should be carefully calibrated. The letter comes at a time when many states and Union territories have begun to relax lockdown-like measures and reopening activities in a phased manner, as Covid-19 cases are gradually declining. Highlighting the possibility of gathering of people during festive days ahead, Bhalla asked the states and the UTs to focus on five-fold strategy of testing, tracking, treating, vaccinating and adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour to effectively manage the containment of Covid-19.He directed the states to hold officials responsible for any laxity in "strict enforcement" of Covid-19 protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-guidelines-for-states-uts-extended-till-august-31-101627473543645.html
28-07-2021||India||Govt says facial recognition different from authentication, experts disagree||The Central government on Wednesday informed the Lok Sabha that facial recognition is distinct from facial authentication measures, with the latter “utilising one-to-one face matching for authentication after obtaining consent of the individual”, even as the use of the technology continues to be mired in controversy with experts raising concerns regarding privacy and skewered access to government schemes. “Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual’s identity using their face. Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. Right to privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. Any solutions employing facial recognition technology should address privacy concerns,” union minister of state for electronics and information technology Rajeev Chandrashekhar said in response to an unstarred question. He added that facial recognition technology is distinct from face authentication mechanisms. “Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is using one-to-one face matching for providing digital marksheets to students through a consent-based framework,” he said. Also Read | ‘Modi ji sent a weapon in your phone’: Rahul Gandhi attacks govt on PegasusThe question was put forth by Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Abhishek Banerjee’s name recently appeared on Pegasus’ database, reports regarding which alleged that opposition politicians, journalists, activists and even government’s own ministers were snooped upon using the Israeli surveillanceware. To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation into the alleged snooping explains, the presence of a number on the database of the alleged targeted numbers does not indicate an individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.In response to his question regarding whether the government was planning to integrate facial recognition with Aadhaar, Chandrashekhar said that the project is in the proof of concept (PoC) phase. “Face authentication may be used as one of the authentication mechanisms apart from biometric and iris-based authentication procedures with the informed consent of the individual,” he said.The government also courted controversy when it proposed integrating Aadhaar-based facial authentication system with the Covid-19 vaccination process. HT reached out to National Health Authority chief RS Sharma for updates on the process, but did not receive a response immediately. Anushka Jain, associate counsel for surveillance and transparency at the Internet Freedom Foundation said that facial recognition is not different from authentication-- the latter is actually part of the larger recognition process. “Facial recognition comprises 1:1 authentication and 1:n identification, thus authentication is a part of facial recognition. For facial authentication, the technology still needs to recognise your face and match it to the one on the pre-existing database to provide you with access to the government scheme for which it is being used,” she said. She further added that the use of the technology for government schemes is extremely harmful, as the technology is not perfectly accurate, it could lead to false negatives wherein the person’s identity is not authenticated against the database, thereby leading the person to be excluded from access to government schemes. “The government is using facial recognition technology for multiple reasons; the NCRB is using it to develop AFRS which will help with police investigations, the MCA is using it to facilitate paperless travel wherein a person will be able to check-in using their face, the Telangana election commission is using it for voter verification. Additionally, a number of government departments are using it for attendance purposes,” Jain said. Jain cautioned that use of the technology could lead to mass surveillance. “Use of this technology in the absence of a data protection law, strong surveillance reform and a specific FRT regulation will mean that it could potentially be used for state-sponsored mass surveillance as we will not know how it is being used, by whom and for what reasons, and there will be no legal safeguard in place to protect the privacy of citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-facial-recognition-different-from-authentication-experts-disagree-101627475449997.html
28-07-2021||India||As Kerala battles rising Covid cases, opposition says govt’s tall claims exposed||Amidst the threat of a possible third Covid wave, a steady rise in infections in southern Kerala is posing a big challenge to the state’s overstretched health system and exposing the government to opposition attacks.On Tuesday, the state accounted for 22,129 out of 42,498 cases recorded in the country, nearly 50% of the national figure and its average test positivity rate of 12.35% was almost four times the national average of 3%. Kerala was the first state to report a Covid case in the country in January 2020 and the pandemic has shown no signs of abating here in the last three months, health ministry statistics show.It is the first state in the country to report over 20,000 Covid-19 cases in the last two months, leading to a worried Union health ministry asking it to ramp up its virus control measures. A team of state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday urging him to ensure that the state takes proactive measures to contain the surge in cases.The intensity of surge in Kerala can be gauged when compared with the situation in the neighbouring states. Cases in Tamil Nadu have come down from 20,421 on June 6-- the last occasion when any Indian state reported more than 20,000 infections-- to 1,767 cases on Tuesday. Karnataka, which witnessed a high volume of cases in April-May, only reported 1,501 new cases on Tuesday with a TPR of 1.46%. Kerala, on the other hand, continues to report a high number of cases, which have now crossed 3.3 million, second only to Maharashtra which has a caseload of 6.2 million.Out of 450,000 active cases in the country, Kerala’s share is 145,000.Most of the vacant Covid beds are getting occupied in the state and demand for ventilators is also on the rise while an estimated 14.8 million residents above 18 years of age are still to be given the first dose of Covid vaccine due to limited supply. Worried experts suggest a steady rise in cases could be the sign of a possible third wave in the state.The fourth round of the sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed antibody prevalence was 67. 7% nationally but it was only 42.7 % in Kerala, meaning a huge chunk of its population is still susceptible to the virus.With high density of population (859 people per sq km) and a large number of elderly population (at least 15% are above 60 years of age) and high volume of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, the state will have to go an extra mile to contain the contagion. Experts said low testing rate, obsession with rapid antigen tests and over dependence on bureaucracy was among the reasons responsible for slowing down Kerala’s fight against the pandemic.“The government sniffs politics in every aspect of the pandemic. Experts and medical bodies have been kept away deliberately. Inflated records won’t stand forever and now it stands exposed,” said Dr S S Lal, a public health expert who worked with the World Health Organisation for many years. “Mere lockdown won’t do any good. It is time for the state to redraw its strategies,” said Dr N M Arun, another public health expert.Though there is no shortage of oxygen or beds, the health system is still overburdened. Compared to last week, there was a 14% hike in demand for beds and 80% of Covid beds were occupied this week, health ministry statistics show. 10 of the 30 worst Covid affected districts in the country are in the state. Malappuram tops the chart with 4,037 active cases.Despite the grim reality, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has put up a brave face saying the situation is well under control. “Second wave started late in the state and about 50% of the state population are yet to contract the virus. So we expected this increase,” he said. He said there was a shortage of vaccines which was delaying the state’s universal inoculation programme. But the opposition parties, the Congress and the BJP say the government is to be blamed for the sorry state of affairs.“Its lies are falling flat. The government fudged data to give a rosy picture but now skeletons are tumbling out of its cupboard. The RTI reply we received shows more than 7,316 [Covid] fatalities were not accounted for. And its Covid stimulus package [has] turned out to be a big farce,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. He said the government relegated virus management to bureaucrats and they framed rules and regulations with no thought for human woes.“We have appraised the Union government and party central leadership about the ground situation in the state. The state government can’t hide the truth for long,” said BJP state president K Surendran. He said at many places, local CPI(M) leaders were controlling the vaccination process. But the ruling CPI(M) denied these charges and blamed opposition parties “for playing dirty politics” even during the pandemic. “Both the Congress and the BJP are in the same boat and are yet to learn a lesson from their recent assembly poll debacle,” said party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-kerala-struggles-with-rising-covid-cases-opposition-says-govt-s-tall-claims-exposed-101627475027904.html
28-07-2021||India||11 million people took flights from April to June amid Covid second wave: Centre||Nearly 11 million people availed of flight services between April and June this year amid the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Union minister of state for civil aviation VK Singh informed the Parliament on Wednesday. The number is 53 per cent less than the January to March period when India was reporting comparatively lesser number of new cases daily.“The domestic passenger traffic has decreased from over 23 million in January to March 2021 to around 11 million in the April to June period – a decline of 53%. This has had an adverse impact on the financial position of the airline industry,” the minister added in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.He further informed the House that as many as 5,637 domestic flights were cancelled during the March to June period this year. At the moment, owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and various restrictions imposed by state governments across the country, full-scale domestic flight operations are yet to resume.According to the rules laid down by the Union ministry of civil aviation, Indian carriers cannot operate more than 65% of their pre-Covid domestic flights.Meanwhile, various domestic airlines saw a reduction of more than 7,900 employees between March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021 due to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic, Singh said in his reply. On March 31, 2020, around 74,800 employees were associated with the airlines and the number diminished to nearly 66,900 as on March 31, 2021.Last month, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data revealed that domestic passenger traffic witnessed over 63% drop in May this year as opposed to April due to the second wave of the virus outbreak. As many as 5.7 million domestic passengers travelled via flights in April, whereas the number dropped to around 2.1 million in May.Domestic flights were suspended last year in March soon after the nationwide lockdown was imposed at the start of the coronavirus crisis. It was resumed only with limited operational capacity on May 25, 2020 following a gap of two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-million-people-took-flights-from-april-to-june-amid-covid-second-wave-centre-101627473560511.html
28-07-2021||India||Why I went to the SC on Pegasus: MP John Brittas||Ever since the Pegasus row erupted, after an international media consortium reported that numbers of many Indian politicians, activists, business executives and journalists were on a list of potential surveillance targets, Parliament has not functioned effectively.Rajya Sabha member of Parliament and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader John Brittas, last week, took the demand for an inquiry to the Supreme Court. The first time MP, who served as Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s media advisor, spoke to HT about the issue:Why did you take the Pegasus issue to the Supreme Court?I am a member of Parliament, but more than that, I feel I am a journalist. I have been in journalism for the last 30 years, and I think that the Pegasus issue is eating into the vital organs of democracy. For a week now, we have been trying to shake the indolence of the government, trying to extract a statement from the government as to whether they have bought the Pegasus spyware or they haven’t. So far, the government has been evading this and they have not spoken categorically in the reply to the parliament.In this context, I had only one option — to seek the help of the Supreme Court. I filed a writ requesting the court to go for a special investigation team (SIT) investigation, monitored completely by the Supreme Court to ensure that the truth is found.Also Read | BJP seeks Shashi Tharoor’s removal as House panel headThe government has pointed out that the stories on Pegasus and statements of groups such as Amnesty say that it is not clear if all the numbers on the list were hacked. Do you think that kind of takes away from the shock value of this particular case?Just dragging Amnesty International cannot absolve the government of the responsibility. Let us be very clear about it. Seventeen media organisations — and some of them are very reputed — have vetted everything and have categorically said that India is one of the countries where spying, snooping or surveillance is involved. Now, if the Indian government says that they are not part of this Pegasus spyware, then a foreign agency must be doing this. It’s all the more important. That means it’s a breach of our sovereignty and the independence of the nation.So, it is for the government of India to be categorical and make its stand very clear whether they have bought or hired Pegasus spyware. Since the government of India is evading this cardinal question, the only way to unearth the reality or the truth is to seek the intervention of the honourable Supreme Court.Also Read | To reopen schools, India must go localOtherwise, just think about which are the organisations that have come under the spyware — the media, legislature, political personalities, investigating officers, activists, a judge; none is left out of the Pegasus network. So in this context, to reassure Houses that India is a democratic country, we need to have the reality.The government has been trying to get the House to run. What are the managers of the ruling party saying to you about this?I don’t think the government is very sincere with regard to the functioning of the House. The only thing is that the government has to make it categorical whether they have bought the Pegasus spyware or hired it. In 2019 itself, when this issue came up in Parliament, the then minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hadn’t replied to it properly. So, this issue is looming over India for the last two or three years and now we have to get an answer to it. The Bengal government has gone ahead and ordered a judicial inquiry but we really want an investigation that is fruitful.I think a lot of people feel that this is an elitist issue in the Indian context. People are worried about survival; they may not be worried about their phones being listening devices or relaying their location or privacy. Do you think that this is true? Do you think that this is something that will resonate with voters across the country?It is very easy to belittle the issue. In fact, when the session started, there were multiple issues at the fore — price hike, fuel prices, farm laws and agitation. Pegasus was one among the issues. We really want all these important issues to be debated and deliberated on the floor.But on Pegasus, let’s understand that if democracy has been crippled, if all the pillars of the democracy are being crippled, then what is the purpose of the constitution that we swore to? It is not just an invasion of privacy but crippling of the democratic system and democratic process. Since Supreme Court is the custodian of this democracy and the constitution, we feel that it can come up with a probe that will bring the reality out.(Transcribed by Umar Sofi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-i-went-to-the-sc-on-pegasus-mp-john-brittas-101627474067397.html

However, candidates from the OBC category have been denied reservation under the all-India quota,” the letter said.The meeting comes a day after the PM held a review meeting on the issues pertaining to OBC and EWS reservation in the all-India quota for medical education.

The INTACH team believes it is one of the earliest temples of the post-Gupta period and may date back to the 6th-7th century Common Era. "Ratnachira Valley is a gold mine of ancient Kalingan monuments, most of which were undocumented till recently," Pradhan wrote.Also Read: Puri becomes the first city in country to have ‘drink from tap’ facilityThe Ratnachira river which runs in the valley has mythological significance as it is believed to have been created by Lord Rama to quench Sita’s thirst, a point which Pradhan highlighted in his letter, reported news agency PTI.Pradhan insisted that the temple, which is locally revered amongst the masses as a temple of Lord Shiva, is estimated to be around 1,300-1,400 years old and is one of the best-preserved examples of early Kalingan architecture in the region.

28-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh govt rejects allegations against TS Singh Deo levelled by Cong MLA||The Chhattisgarh government on Wednesday said that Congress lawmaker Brihaspat Singh’s allegation that his convoy was attacked last Sunday at the behest of senior party leader and health minister T S Singh Deo was false.The allegations had exposed the rift within the state Congress with Singh Deo walking out of the assembly on Tuesday, demanding to know where the state government stood on the allegations made by Singh, who had also claimed that the attack by the minister’s man was a result of Singh's support to chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.However, on Wednesday, Singh apologised in the assembly and said his allegations against Singh Deo were an “emotional outburst”. “If I have hurt anyone’s sentiments ...I apologise for that,” the MLA said.Chhattisgarh home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu said the incident involving Singh’s convoy was that of road-rage and Singh Deo had no connection with it.“The allegations levelled against him are false and baseless,” Sahu said, clarifying the government’s stance on the matter. On Tuesday, Singh Deo had walked out of the assembly saying he was upset with the home minister’s short statement on the issue, which was not “clear”.After the government’s statement on Wednesday, Singh Deo came to the House and attended the proceedings. “The issue has been resolved and the focus will now be on discharging the responsibilities towards the state as a team,” he said.It all started last Sunday when Singh, the MLA from Ramanujan seat, alleged his vehicle was attacked by three persons including a relative of Singh Deo. Singh further alleged that he was attacked since he had praised chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and backed him to continue in his post for the rest of the term inviting Singh Deo’s anger.Singh Deo is seen as one of the top state Congress leaders who were contenders for the chief minister’s position after the party came to power in Chhattisgarh in December 2018. Since then, speculations have been rife about possible formula for top leaders to share power. However, this was recently ruled out by the chief minister.After the whole issue blew up in the government’s face on Tuesday with Singh Deo walking out of the assembly and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanding a probe into the issue, the state Congress issued a notice to Brihaspat Singh last night, seeking his reply within 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-rejects-allegations-against-ts-singh-deo-levelled-by-cong-mla-101627468771492.html

Stating that she is not a political astrologer, Banerjee said the matter will be discussed at the appropriate time and all the parties will work together.On a political high since her recent thumping win against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Bengal Assembly election, Banerjee has been keen on stitching an Opposition alliance to take on the saffron camp in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. On Tuesday, she met several top Congress leaders, including Kamal Nath and Anand Sharma. In the evening, she also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence and discussed various issues related to the state.On Wednesday, she said Opposition parties will sit together and decide who would become the candidate against Modi. “When Modi will fight the next election, it will be with the country.”She said there are three more to go before the next general election is held. “I am meeting (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi, (AAP convener) Arvind Kejriwal. Discussions about our political future will start soon.”Reiterating her party’s winning slogan for the assembly election ‘khela hobe' (game on), the TMC supremo said, “I am not a political astrologer. The leadership issue depends on the situation, structure and system in place. It is not that everybody can take the lead. When the matter is discussed, we can work together.”Speaking about the Pegasus controversy, Banerjee said her phone has already been hacked. “When I talk to (election strategist) Prashant Kishor, (nephew and TMC general secretary) Abhishek Banerjee, my phone is hacked.

28-07-2021||India||'Modi ji sent a weapon in your phone': Rahul Gandhi attacks govt on Pegasus||The voices of Opposition parties echoed louder on Day 7 of Parliament's ongoing monsoon session where key parties like Congress, Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party among several others put up a united front against the government on Pegasus snooping allegations. Led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Opposition pressed its demand for a discussion on the purchase of the spying software by the government to tap on privacy of many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists. The leaders representing India's democratic institutions were potentially targeted by Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software, Pegasus.Demanding an answer from the government, Gandhi asked, "We want to ask just one question. Has the Government of India bought Pegasus? Yes or No. Did the government use Pegasus weapon against its own people?""We have been told clearly by the government that no discussion will take place on Pegasus in the House," he said, addressing the media outside Parliament.So far, the government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the spyware but has rejected reports of snooping.Explaining the controversy and directing a question to people, Gandhi asked why should the issue not be discussed in the Parliament."I want to know from the youth of the country - Narendra Modi Ji has sent a weapon in your phone. This weapon (Pegasus) has been used against me, Supreme Court, many leaders, people in the press and activists. So why it should not be discussed in the House?" Gandhi asked.Accusing the government of using software meant for terrorism activities, Gandhi said, "This weapon (Pegasus) has been used against India. It should be used against terrorists and anti-nationals."Even as Parliament session enters the second week, both the houses have seen repeated and consecutive adjournments on the premise of protests by the Opposition parties demanding discussion over Pegasus in the Parliament. "It is being said about us that we're disturbing Parliament proceedings. We are not disturbing the House. We just want to fulfil our duties," Gandhi said."We want to know from Narendra Modi and Amit Shah - why you used this weapon (Pegasus spyware) against India's democratic institutions," he asked, terming the controversy a matter related to nationalism and treason."This weapon has been used against democracy. For me, it's not a matter of privacy. I see it as an anti-national act. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah Ji have attacked soul of India's democracy," Gandhi alleged.The entire Opposition is and will remain united on the issues of national security and farm laws, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, standing alongside Gandhi, said outside Parliament.Opposition protest intensified post noon and Congress members were seen throwing papers at the Chair and Treasury benches while protesting Pegasus and other issues, following which the House was adjourned.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation into the alleged snooping explains, the presence of a number on the database of the alleged targeted numbers for snooping does not indicate an individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The leaked database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices associated with 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of the 37, 10 were in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-ji-sent-a-weapon-in-your-phone-rahul-gandhi-attacks-govt-on-pegasus-101627460767612.html

On Tuesday, Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra was arrested and was remanded in police custody till July 27. On Tuesday, as his custody ended, he was sent to 14 days' judicial custody, while the bail plea was slated to be heard on Wednesday. As the hearing started, the public prosecutor opposed the plea and said that as he is an influential person, he can intimidate the witnesses which will derail the probe. To this, Kundra's lawyer said, "Is Raj Kundra a terrorist?"Kundra's lawyer also said that the chargesheet was already filed in April and many of the accused are out on bail. But the prosecution objected and said Kundra is a key conspirator of the case and rejected the bail plea of both Kundra and his business associate Ryan Thorpe.Raj Kundra earned ₹1.1cr from app in 5 months: Mumbai PoliceOn Wednesday, a fresh FIR has been lodged in connection with the pornography case against Raj Kundra in which the name of actor Gehana Vashishth has also been mentioned.

The case will again come before the high court on Thursday.In the latest updates in the ongoing case, the Mumbai crime branch has appointed forensic auditors to look into the financial transactions and bank accounts of Kundra. Actor Shilpa Shetty who was interrogated in connection with the case is also not above doubt, Police said.Investigations into Kundra's HotShots app, which was officially owned by Kudra's brother-in-law, revealed that Kundra earned at least ₹1.17 crore between August and December in 2020 before the app was taken down by Apple and Google Playstore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-kundra-s-bail-plea-rejected-by-esplanade-court-is-he-a-terrorist-asks-lawyer-101627463743722.html

28-07-2021||India||Assam, Mizoram were in talks in Delhi before their police forces fatally clashed||Assam and Mizoram had been talking through their chief secretaries in a Centre-chaperoned dialogue process to douse interstate border tensions before police forces of the two northeastern states fatally clashed on July 26, shocking the country.One round of talks in the national capital was held on July 8, an official aware of the development said. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, too, told the media on Tuesday, putting out his version of the dispute, that the talks failed at the final stage of a proposed memorandum of understanding.Top bureaucrats and police chiefs of the two states on Wednesday were due to arrive in Delhi for fresh talks. Five Assam policemen and a civilian were killed in Monday’s clashes along a stretch in southern Assam, bordering Mizoram.Several people and policemen were reportedly wounded on the Mizoram side, although Mizoram has not put out a number.The official cited above said the talks between the two sides were focussed on some kind of “status quo ante”, which refers to a return to earlier positions. The process failed because differences persisted over what should be the point of the status quo ante, the person said.Assam proposed a satellite-based mapping of the disputed interstate border, a proposal that found its way into a draft memorandum of understanding. Mizoram proposed chief secretary-level talks monitored by the Centre.“My proposal to him (Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga) was that we will carry out satellite photography of the borders as on the day of my swearing-in (May 10). In the talks, Assam had said that whatever is the status quo situation, be that on May 10 or six months ago or as on date, we should maintain status quo on the border as determined through satellite mapping,” Sarma said in one of his several media briefings on Tuesday.Northeastern states have a history of ethnic strife. Internal border disputes go back at least a century. The triggers often are disputed claims over land, forest resources, encroachment, ethnic differences, and even rumours.Assam’s border disputes have their roots in how the state was carved up to form other states in the region. Mizoram, which became a state 1987, was once part of Assam.Mizoram’s home minister Lalchamliana declined comments on the talks but said: “Mizoram stands for peaceful resolution of the border dispute. Assam policemen first crossed into our areas and overran police posts,” he said.A Mizoram government statement late on Tuesday said: “With the intervention of the Honarouable Union Home minister (Amit Shah), who spoke to both the chief ministers, Assam police have withdrawn from the place and the duty post have (sic) been handed back to CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) personnel.”In his version of the events, Sarma said he telephoned his Mizoram counterpart on the day of his swearing-in. “...I rang up Mizoram chief minister Zomramthangiji. During the conversation, I had told him friendly relations must go on so that economic development can carry on.”The Assam leader claimed that a draft memorandum of understanding would have gone through had Mizoram agreed to sign it.

28-07-2021||India||India, US should stand together as threats to democracy, freedom rise: Blinken||India and the US should continue to stand together as leading democracies at a time when global threats to democracy and international freedoms are increasing, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday.Addressing a civil society roundtable on the theme “Advancing equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and development”, Blinken said both countries also need a vibrant civil society in order to make their democracies more open, inclusive, resilient and equitable.Ahead of Blinken’s visit, the US side had said it intended to raise human rights and democracy during the secretary of state’s engagements in New Delhi. The US has in the recent past spoken out on issues such as the situation in Kashmir and movements such as the farmers’ protest on the outskirts of Delhi.Also Read | US’s Antony Blinken in India: Afghanistan, Covid, economic recovery on agendaThe Indian side has usually been sensitive to such criticism and said before Blinken flew into New Delhi on Tuesday that is open to engaging on human rights and democracy with those who recognise the value of diversity. Defending its achievements in human rights and democracy, the Indian side also said both issues extend beyond a “particular national or cultural perspective”.In his opening remarks at the roundtable, Blinken described India and the US as democracies that are “works in progress”. Both sides talk about such issues as friends “because doing the hard work of strengthening democracy and making our ideals real is often challenging”, he said.“At a time of rising global threats to democracy and international freedoms – we talk about a democratic recession – it’s vital that we two world leading democracies continue to stand together in support of these ideals,” Blinken said.Referring to efforts in the US to become a “more perfect union”, he said: “That’s an acknowledgement from day one of our country that in a sense we will always fall short of the mark, but that the way to make progress is by constantly trying to achieve those ideals.”He added, “As I said before, sometimes that process is painful, sometimes it’s ugly, but the strength of democracy is to embrace it.”Blinken, on his first visit to India since becoming secretary of state, said India’s achievements include a “free media, independent courts, a vibrant and free and fair electoral system – the largest expression of free political will by citizens anywhere in the world”.All successful democracies include thriving civil societies, and this ensures citizens become more fully engaged in the life of their communities, Blinken said.“It’s how we organise and provide the resources to respond to emergencies. And we’ve seen people and organisations come together throughout Covid-19 in creative and incredibly generous ways, and civil society is also where we’re able to build meaningful connections across our social, religious, and cultural differences,” he said.“In short, if we want to make our democracies more open, more inclusive, more resilient, more equitable, we need vibrant civil society,” Blinken said, adding that he wants to support more connections between civil society organisations in India and the US to make the partnership between the two democracies even stronger.Later in the day, Blinken will meet National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During these meetings, he said he would talk about many critical issues the two sides are working on together, including Covid-19, climate change, defence, mutual security, trade and investment, education, energy, and science and technology.“When you put it all together, the relationship between our countries is one of the most important in the world. And I think that’s because not only is it a relationship between governments...but critically it’s through relationships between the Indian and the American people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-should-stand-together-as-threats-to-democracy-freedoms-increase-blinken-101627455509774.html

Blinken held talks with representatives of civil society organisations in Delhi, following which he said democratic values are reflective of India's pluralistic society and history of harmony.Taking to Twitter ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the senior US official wrote, "I was pleased to meet civil society leaders today. The US and India share a commitment to democratic values; this is part of the bedrock of our relationship and reflective of India's pluralistic society and history of harmony.

28-07-2021||India||India, world’s 3rd-biggest emitter, skips key climate meet; only nation among 51||Global efforts to tackle climate change suffered another setback this week as India -- the world’s third-biggest emitter -- failed to attend a key diplomatic gathering in London.India was the only one of 51 invited countries that didn’t attend a two-day ministerial meeting in the UK capital, hosted by the incoming president of the COP26 United Nations talks, according to people present at the summit who asked not to be named.The conference was designed to lay the groundwork for a successful COP26, which is due to take place in Glasgow in three months time. COP26 President Alok Sharma has said it will be the last chance to ensure global temperature increases don’t exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius -- the lower limit of the Paris Agreement. A Group of 20 meeting last week failed to clinch a more ambitious agreement on climate, and India was a key holdout.The London event was positioned to follow on from the G-20 with a broader group, meeting mainly in person. India had been due to attend the conference, according to a statement released by Sharma’s office beforehand.Gaurav Khare, a spokesman for India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said the government had decided against attending in person as the country had already made its views known at the G-20 in Naples. Then technical issues prevented it from taking part virtually.Sharma “has constructive ongoing dialogue with his counterparts in India, having visited the country earlier this year where he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” a spokeswoman for COP26 said.India’s failure to show was perceived as a snub by the COP presidency, one of the people present at the London summit said. With all of the Group of Seven nations now having committed to eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the presidency is seeking to put pressure on emerging economies such as China and India.Sticking PointsThe main sticking points to achieving the goals of the Paris accord are agreeing on concrete actions and a firm timeline to phasing out fossil fuels and subsidies, as well as commitments to ditch coal, the people said. The world’s richest countries are also falling well short of financial pledges to support energy transitions in developing countries, they said.India held out at the Naples meeting last week, with the final communique from the gathering included a footnote saying the country rejected the language agreed on net-zero emissions.India is not alone in resisting these efforts, with a handful of other countries reluctant to sign up to the plans in full.The nation -- which has often taken the position that the richest countries should lead in cutting emissions -- criticized those that have promised to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050. It instead urged G-20 nations to make a pledge that focused on per-capita emissions.While India is the third-largest emitter on a country basis, it is also the second-most populous. As a result, emissions per head are extremely low, ranking 134, according to the Global Carbon Atlas project.“Keeping in view the legitimate need of developing countries to growth, we urge G-20 countries to commit to bringing down per-capita emissions to global average by 2030,” India said in a statement attached to the final G20 document.Earlier this year, India had been mulling setting its own net-zero target by 2050, according to people familiar with the matter. A statement about the plan had been expected during a White House climate summit in April, but never came.“With less than 100 days until COP26, India faces a clear decision: follow its friends in favor of an ambitious outcome on climate in Glasgow, or leave itself starkly isolated on the world stage by continuing to oppose the need for accelerated climate action before COP26,” said Tom Evans, a researcher at the think tank E3G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-world-s-3rd-biggest-emitter-skips-key-climate-meet-only-nation-among-51-101627453456369.html

28-07-2021||India||Researchers observe never before seen short gamma-ray burst from collapsing star||Astronomers from across the world, including those from four Indian institutions, observed a 0.65 second gamma-ray burst (GRB) in August last year using NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope. The high-energy gamma-ray burst that has been travelling towards Earth for half of the present age of the universe was picked up by several instruments. Researchers were able to pinpoint its location.What was unexpected was a supernova found at the origin of the gamma-ray burst for the first time.Astronomers believe that short gamma-ray bursts of less than two seconds originate when two black holes, two neutron stars, or a black hole and a neutron star merge with each other. The long gamma-ray bursts were thought to originate from a massive star collapsing at the end of its life.“A supernova is never formed during a merger; it is formed when a massive star collapses. This observation completely challenges the traditional classification of gamma-ray bursts; there is a need to relook all the bursts observed so far,” said Shashi Bhushan Pandey of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences.Also Read | Jeff Bezos offers NASA a $2 billion discount for Blue Origin Moon landerPandey was one of the Indian astronomers to participate in the study.The study challenges two notions – not all short-duration gamma-ray bursts observed so far might have originated from a merger and not all collapsing massive stars end up producing long duration gamma rays. It helps resolve a long-standing puzzle in astronomy – there is a far greater number of supernovae than there are long gamma-ray bursts.“We already knew some GRBs from massive stars could register as short GRBs, but we thought this was due to instrumental limitations. Now we know dying stars can produce short bursts, too,” said Bin-bin Zhang of Nanjing University in China and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.The researchers believe this particular gamma-ray burst, named GBR200826A, almost did not occur. “We think this event was effectively a fizzle, one that was close to not happening at all. Even so, the burst emitted 14 million times the energy released by the entire Milky Way galaxy over the same amount of time, making it one of the most energetic short-duration gammas-ray bursts ever seen,” said Tomás Ahumada, a doctoral student at the University of Maryland and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre.When a massive star reaches the end of its life, a black hole starts forming at its centre that sends out jets of particles at near-light speed. When the particles breach the surface of the earth, gamma-ray bursts are observed. “If this piercing does not happen properly, we would not observe a burst at all or we might observe a short burst. Now, we need to relook the data of the existing GRBs,” said Pandey.“Of the overall known population, two-thirds are long duration and one third are short. Now, the massive stars are supposed to be found in the star-forming region of the galaxies whereas the merger events should be on the outskirts. But there have been instances of short duration GRB from the star-forming regions; those could be an instance such as this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/researchers-observe-never-before-seen-short-gamma-ray-burst-from-collapsing-star-101627453349303.html

We will make a decision after they leave,” said Bommai. He added they would not take much time. “For all the work that needs to be completed, we need a full team (of ministers). So, we will do it (Cabinet formation) at the earliest.”Bommai was the home minister in Yediyurappa’s council of ministers. The council was dissolved after Yediyurappa’s resignation on Monday. Considered to be a close confidant of Yediyurappa, Bommai is son of former chief minister S R Bommai. Basavaraj Bommai started his political career with the Janata Dal and worked with leaders including H D Devegowda and Ramakrishna Hegde. He left the Janata Dal (United) and joined the BJP in February 2008.A graduate in mechanical engineering, he was elected as a member of the Karnataka legislative council in 1998 and 2004 from Dharwad. He has been thrice elected to Karnataka legislative assembly from the Shiggaon constituency in Haveri district in 2008, 2013 and 2018.The selection of Bommai, who is from the Lingayat community, comes after several pontiffs from Lingayat mutts in the state warned the BJP central command against removing Yediyurappa, a tall leader of the community. The community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and has have been a loyal vote base for the party. Even though there was speculation that the BJP may appoint a leader from a different community, it eventually chose a Lingayat leader.Yediyurappa’s resignation on Monday ended months of speculation following growing dissidence within the Karnataka unit of the BJP. The 78-year-old leader made the announcement in an emotional speech at an event celebrating two years in power before submitting his resignation to the governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/basavaraj-bommai-sworn-in-as-karnataka-chief-minister-101627453289299.html

Poreseram ignored the diktat and paid with his life for defying the Maoists. The killing did not deter the area’s residents, who closed ranks and pursued the demand more seriously even if Maoists kill all of them. The efforts of the villagers paid off when the government in October 2018 sanctioned two bridges at Pahurnaar and Karka. Their construction started in February 2019 and they are now nearing completion. Three more bridges were sanctioned in the region in May 2020.The bridges will connect the region of over 20,000 people with the rest of Chhattisgarh. Dantewada police superintendent Abhishek Pallava said the Maoists summoned villagers, threatened Poreseram in February 2018, and asked him to take back their application for the construction of a bridge. He added Poreseram was killed three months later for defying the diktat.“ After the killing of the sarpanch (village head), villagers got united and made it clear to Maoists that they want a bridge and are ready to face any consequences,” said Pallava.The region is strategically important for the Maoists. “(They) hold meetings in these villages and carry out recruitments....,” said an intelligence officer, who did not wish to be named, as he explained why Maoists opposed their construction. The officer added one of the bridges will provide access to Handawara waterfalls, which has the employment generation potential through tourism. The bridges will also help security forces set up camps in Abujmaad.Poreseram’s son, Dhani, said his father sacrificed his life for the people, who were suffering. He added he wants one of the bridges to be named after his father. “He sacrificed his life for it. The villagers also want the same hence I demand the government to consider this appeal.”Abujhmad is located near the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border and encompasses 6,000 square kilometre thick forest, which has not been surveyed since the British era. Officials said at least 100 villagers have lost lives their lives over the last two decades while crossing the river that divides the region from the rest of the state on primitive boats in the absence of bridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridges-near-completion-in-remote-c-garh-region-yrs-after-maoists-kill-panch-for-demanding-one-101627451489243.html

ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has been asked to share a list of those who participated in the vaccine trial. The certificate will be generated only for those who got the actual vaccine and not the placebo,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, at a press briefing on Tuesday. Such certificates will only be issued for trials that have been completed so that the integrity of ongoing trials is maintained, he said.So far, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has completed its phase III large clinical trials that found it to be 78% effective in preventing symptomatic infection. The study of children is going on. Also Read | Covid-19 can infect embryos, result in miscarriages: StudySerum Institute of India’s Covishield has completed its immunogenicity bridging trial to show that it produces a similar immune response as seen elsewhere.Only the interim data for the indigenous vaccine by Zydus Cadila has been analysed so far. The trial participants for ZyCoV-D will have to wait for such certificates.The protein subunit vaccine by BiologicalE is also in phase III clinical trials.In phase III clinical trials, a proportion of a large number of participants is administered a placebo (an agent without therapeutic value) to evaluate how many infections the actual vaccine prevented. The studies are usually double-blinded, meaning neither the participants nor those administering the vaccine and studying its impact know whether a person has received a vaccine or placebo.The data is unblinded only once a certain pre-decided number of infections happen among the participants.So far, the participants in vaccine trials in India have received a certificate from the trial sites. However, these are not accepted as proof of vaccination.“The persons who had participated in clinical trials had received paper-based certificates initially. A QR code-based certificate will be generated on CoWIN for them. They will be able to download it using their mobile numbers. The certificates will be generated only for the vaccines that have already received an Emergency Use Authorisation,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/completed-clinical-trials-data-for-covid-19-vaccines-to-be-unblinded-101627449988825.html

The TMC renewed its contract with I-PAC, the company launched by election strategist Prashant Kishor, till the 2024 Lok Sabha polls after helping it win the March-April Bengal assembly elections. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee wants to see her party play a bigger role in national politics.At least 23 members of I-PAC were on Monday asked to stay inside a hotel in Agartala till their Covid-19 test reports arrive, the Tripura police have said.West Bengal minister Bratya Basu insisted the I-PAC members have been detained. “I think the situation is not right there. Democracy is being violated. To take stock of the situation, I along with Moloy Ghatak, state law minister, and TMC leader Ritabrata Banerjee would go there.”The I-PAC members arrived in Tripura last week to assess the TMC’s potential to expand its base in the north-eastern state where polls are due in 2023. The Bharatiya Janata Party heads the government in Tripura.The Tripura police said some of the I-PAC members were found moving around amid Covid-19 curfew and all of them underwent Covid-19 tests on Monday and were asked to stay inside a hotel until they get clearance from the health department.Banerjee on Tuesday said I-PAC workers went to Tripura and were put under “house arrest”. This should not be done, she added.Samik Bhattacharya, a BJP spokesman in West Bengal, said it is entirely the Tripura government’s decision. “Only the Tripura government can comment...” He added TMC has contested elections in Tripura and was rejected. “Why is the chief minister (Banerjee) giving statements when workers of an agency have gone to Tripura?

While the US and its friends are committed to inclusion and freedom of the seas, China had shown “unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law”, he said. Opposing China’s claim to the majority of the South China Sea, Austin said: “We have also seen aggression against India…destabilising military activity and other forms of coercion against the people of Taiwan…and genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.” The US and India are closely coordinating on regional security issues, such as Afghanistan, and are also partnering to strengthen the global Covid-19 response, on issues ranging from addressing infectious disease outbreaks to securing global supply chains.Besides working to expand cooperation in international organisations, the US will host the fourth 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uss-antony-blinken-in-india-afghanistan-covid-economic-recovery-on-agenda-101627446388146.html

28-07-2021||India||Covid-19: Mumbai doctor tests positive thrice, infected twice post-vaccination||A 26-year-old doctor has tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease thrice in the past 13 months -- twice after receiving both doses of a vaccine against the virus. Swab samples of Dr Shrusthi Halari, who worked at the Mulund Covid Centre in the city, have been collected for genome sequencing as part of a study into occurrence of the infection after being completely inoculated.According to reports, the doctor's family members, including her father, mother and brother, all of whom have comorbidities, have also contracted the virus. All of them got infected for the first time this month, after receiving both doses of the vaccine.“The reinfections are confusing,” Dr Halari, adding that ahead of being infected for the third time she was mostly at home preparing for post-graduation with very little chances of being exposed to the virus.The doctor was on Covid duty at the Veer Savarkar Hospital in Mumbai when she tested positive for the first time on June 17 last year with a mild infection. Her entire family received the first dose of Covishield vaccine on March 8 this year and the second one on April 29.A month later - on May 29 - Dr Halari tested positive for the second time, again with mild symptoms and she got treated at home.On July 11, the doctor contracted the disease again and this time, it was the entire family. All of them have been hospitalised and being treated with Remdesivir."I suffered more the third time. My brother and mother have diabetes and my father has hypertension and cholesterol problems. My brother had difficulty breathing, so he was kept on oxygen for two days," Dr Halari was quoted as saying by NDTV. A test for Covid antibodies in the blood has also returned positive results.While it is yet to be ascertained why and how the doctor got infected thrice, doctors said the reasons could range from variants of the virus, low immunity levels to an incorrect diagnosis, a report in Times of India said.Speaking about the efficacy of the vaccines against the virus, doctors said the doses do not translate to immunity. Their benefit is that breakthrough infections (caused after inoculation) are milder, rarely require hospitalisation and very unlikely to be fatal.Two studies -- one byBrihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and another by a private hospital -- are being conducted to look into the causes of the reinfections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-mumbai-doctor-tests-positive-thrice-infected-twice-postvaccination-101627439030500.html

28-07-2021||India||Rakesh Asthana appointed Delhi Police commissioner||Director general of the Border Security Force (BSF) Rakesh Asthana, a 1984-batch Indian Police Service officer from the Gujarat cadre, was on Tuesday appointed the commissioner of the Delhi Police, three days before he was to retire.The Union government gave additional charge of the Delhi Police to Balaji Srivastava after the retirement of SN Shrivastava on June 30, and there was no indication at the time that the charge was temporary.Asthana, who has previously headed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), was exonerated in a 2018 bribery case registered by the then Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chief Alok Verma. He held the post of the special director in the investigative agency.Asthana was moved out of CBI along with Verma on January 10, 2019, after a very public falling out of the two top officers of the agency that threatened to derail its functioning. He was the front-runner for the top job in CBI in May but was dropped after the Chief Justice of India, NV Ramana, pointed to a Supreme Court ruling that said no officer with less than six months of tenure left should be named to a top police job.Asthana was key in the unravelling of Indian Mujahideen’s strategy in Gujarat. As the chief of NCB, he was at the forefront of drug seizures and directed the probe into the influx of cocaine and synthetic drugs in the Mumbai film industry. And as BSF DG, he led the force at a time tunnels used by Pakistan-based terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab were busted.Senior IPS officer Balaji Srivastava took over as the 23rd commissioner of the Delhi Police earlier this month. Srivastava, a 1988 batch IPS officer, served as the director general of police in Puducherry and Mizoram. As a special commissioner in Delhi Police, he led special cell, intelligence and economic offences wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-asthana-appointed-delhi-police-commissioner-101627426413655.html
28-07-2021||India||Same person appointed in 2 posts: Twitter to HC||Twitter has appointed the same person as the resident grievance officer (RGO) and the chief compliance officer (CCO) in India, the social media company told the Delhi high court in an affidavit filed earlier this month.After being asked for it by the HC in a hearing on July 8, Twitter’s Vinay Prakash filed his personal affidavit on July 13 disclosing that he is the resident grievance officer as well as the chief compliance officer for Twitter – an appointment mandated under the Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021.Prakash submitted that he is not an employee of Twitter and had been engaged as a “contingent worker” through a third party. In his affidavit, Prakash said that he was appointed as chief compliance officer by Twitter on July 6 while on the next day; he was designated as resident grievance officer.Twitter, in a separate affidavit filed on July 13, told the court that they have appointed an Indian resident as the CCO and RGO whose services have been taken via a third party contractor. The official, the company added, would perform functions and duties as per applicable law. The company added it would require two weeks to appoint a nodal contact officer (NCO) through a third party.Twitter asked for eight weeks to appoint the CCO, RGO and NCO as a direct employee and on a permanent basis.Advocate Akash Vajpai, for the petitioner, said that since the new Rules do not mention or state in as many words that separate officers have to be appointed, Twitter has taken advantage of this grey area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/same-person-appointed-in-2-posts-twitter-to-hc-101627426061731.html
28-07-2021||India||How the pandemic and lockdown have hit labour markets||The 2019-20 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), which was released last week by the National Statistical Office (NSO), shows a fall in the unemployment rate from 5.8% in 2018-19 to 4.8% 2019-20. Since PLFS follows a July-June timeline rather than the fiscal year (April-March) period, the 2019-20 report includes the 68-day-long hard lockdown. Does this mean that there was no distress in labour markets during the lockdown? An HT analysis suggests that the headline employment numbers in the latest report might be misleading, and a careful reading of the report and the unitlevel data does show signs of pandemicdriven distress in labour markets.1) What do the headline numbers show?The three most important numbers in the PLFS report are labour force participation rate (LFPR), work participation rate (WPR) and unemployment rate (UR). LFPR is the share of population in a given age group which is either working or looking for a job. WPR is the share of population which is actually working. UR is the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force. There have been three PLFS reports so far, the latest one covering the period from July 2019 to June 2020. A comparison of the three reports shows that LFPR was the highest in 2019-20 and unemployment rate the lowest But these numbers hide more than they reveal. Here is why.2) Covid forced a distress-driven rise in rural jobsImages of thousands of migrant workers walking back to villages after the lockdown are among the most graphic memories of economic distress during the pandemic. The 2019-20 PLFS offers the first official proof of this distress. In keeping with established wisdom on economic transformation, the share of agricultural employment in India has been falling gradually. But 2019-20 was an exception to this trend when agricultural employment actually increased from 42.5% in the 2018-19 PLFS to 45.6% in the 2019-20 PLFS. A comparison of absolute number of jobs by sectors shows that agriculture more than compensated for the job losses in all other sectors of the economy in the April-June 2020 period.The picture becomes even clearer once we look at the quarterly numbers for April-June 2020 and April-June 2019. On a year-on-year basis, urban India saw a reduction of 11.05 million jobs in the April-June 2020 period and rural India saw the addition of 14.7 million jobs. However, the unemployment rate – or the share of people looking for jobs who didn’t find one – increased in both rural and urban areas. As is obvious, unemployment rate increased more sharply in urban areas (from 8.9% to 20.8%) than in rural areas (from 8.7% to 12.2%). The reason unemployment numbers did not increase on an annual basis despite a sharp rise during the lockdown months is simple. They decreased sharply in the July-September 2019 and the October-December 2019 quarters, and to a lesser degree even in the January-March 2020 quarter. That there was distress in urban job-markets was obvious from the quarterly PLFS report for April-June 2020, released in March this year which covers only urban areas. Where the annual report really offers an insight is the rise in what seems to be distress-driven rural employment.3) What happened to wages during lockdown?The short answer is they fell sharply. PLFS gives wage data for three kinds of employment categories: regular wage/salaried, casual workers and self-employed. The self-employed were the worst hit during the lockdown, while regular wage workers suffered a contraction in incomes only in rural areas. The plight of self-employed workers was the worst in urban areas, where real wages fell to 75% of what they were a year ago. While regular wage workers do show an increase in wages at the national level, they only account for about a quarter of the total workers in the data from Periodic Labour Force Survey.4) Underemployment increased as wellTo be sure, both employment and wage statistics do not capture the actual stress in labour markets after the pandemic. This is borne out by another statistic in PLFS; the average number of hours for which work was available to different kind of workers. An average worker worked for 46.5 hours in a week in the April-June 2019 period. This came down to 37 hours in the April-June 2020 period. Urban areas reported a bigger reduction because both regular wage and self-employed recorded a big decrease in hours worked (on account of the hard lockdown). The self-employed were biggest losers in urban areas, while regular wage-earning workers were the biggest losers in rural areas.“An unprecedented increase in share of agricultural employment underlines the rise in distress-driven employment during the pandemic,” said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “It is a well-known fact that more people join the workforce during periods of economic distress to compensate for the loss of incomes and the situation must have become worse given the fact that the government offered very little in terms of direct support during the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-pandemic-and-lockdown-have-hit-labour-markets-101627421254987.html
28-07-2021||India||Cannot jail people indefinitely: SC raps CBI on Bhanwari murder case||People’s personal liberty has value and they cannot be put behind bars indefinitely just because the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is unable to conclude its trials in time, said the Supreme Court on Tuesday, as it reproached the agency for opposing bail of an accused in a murder case that involved Congress leaders from Rajasthan.“If CBI is not able to prosecute people for years together, what are we expected to do? It is the agency which has not been able to do its job well. There is some value to people’s personal liberty. We cannot keep everyone behind bars,” observed the bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy while granting bail to the accused.The remarks came when the court heard the bail plea of Paras Ram Vishnoi in the 2011 Bhanwari Devi murder case, in which Rajasthan’s former cabinet minister Mahipal Singh Maderna and former MLA Malkhan Singh Bishnoi were named as prime accused. CBI charged 17 people, including the Congress leaders, some of their family members and paid assassins, with the abduction and murder of Bhanwari, who was 36 at the time of death.According to the CBI’s chargesheet, Bhanwari, a trained midwife and nurse, disappeared in September 2011 after a CD surfaced that showed Maderna in “a compromising position” with her and amid reports that she was blackmailing him with the CD. Maderna, who was then Rajasthan’s minister for water resources, was arrested in 2012 along with Bishnoi, also a Congress MLA who allegedly had an affair with Bhanwari before he introduced her to Maderna.CBI said the two political rivals plotted together to get rid of Bhanwari after they were fed up with meeting her demands. In January 2012, nearly four months after Bhanwari’s disappearance, her mortal remains were found in a canal in Jodhpur, near a pit where her body had been set on fire.The Rajasthan high court had in July 2020 refused to grant bail to Vishnoi, who is the brother of Bishnoi, following which Vishnoi had approached the Supreme Court. In February this year, the court asked the trial judge to expedite the trial and hear the case on a day-to-day basis.However, on Tuesday, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Vishnoi, pointed out that the trial was still going to take a lot of time to conclude in view of 16 other accused deciding to examine the defence witnesses as well.Additional solicitor general SV Raju, representing CBI, opposed bail saying it was a sensational case and releasing one accused on bail may affect the outcome of the trial.But the law officer’s submissions failed to cut ice with the bench that said: “You are saying it is a sensational case but you have not been able to conclude it in the last eight and a half years. A person will remain in jail not knowing when the trial will conclude and whether he is going to be convicted at all or not. We don’t agree that bail will have any impact on the outcome of the case. It is indeed a very serious matter but we cannot keep people behind bars forever.”The bench added: “We did not want to say this but there are special courts meant only for your (CBI’s cases) and trials have been pending for the longest time there. We have come across instances where your prosecutors do not even get their own files to argue cases and borrow the files of the court.”The court then granted bail to Vishnoi and recorded in its order: “We have no doubt that the matter in issue is a serious one and the offence is also heinous. However, we are faced with a position where the appellant, amongst other accused, has been in custody for eight and a half years... we are of the view that pending the trial we cannot keep a person in custody for an indefinite period of time.”On July 23, another bench in the top court had pulled up CBI when it sought to get bail of another accused in this case cancelled. A bench led by justice L Nageswara Rao had noted that CBI had failed in getting one of its key witnesses to the witness box in the last eight years. It gave CBI eight weeks to get Amber Carr, a forensic expert from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to India.Carr had examined the burnt bones recovered by CBI from the canal near Jodhpur and the agency claimed her testimony could establish that the body recovered was of Bhanwari. While CBI insisted on recording her deposition through video-conferencing, the Jodhpur trial court rejected the agency’s plea after underscoring that Carr had never specifically said that she was unable to travel to India and hence, the agency was lacking in its efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-jail-people-indefinitely-sc-raps-cbi-on-bhanwari-murder-case-101627414040322.html
28-07-2021||India||Can’t take elitist view of banning beggars from streets: SC||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would never take an “elitist view” and order the removal of beggars and homeless from the streets, because this is “socio-economic problem arising out of lack of education and employment opportunities.” Even as it asked the Union and the Delhi governments to suggest measures to rehabilitate and vaccinate beggars to protect them from Covid-19, the top court was emphatic that it would never give the impression that “the Supreme Court of India wants beggars kept away” from the eyes of the public. The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a lawyer, Kush Kalra, who sought directives to the Union and the state governments for rehabilitating beggars and ensuring they are vaccinated to prevent spread of coronavirus. But the first prayer in the petition, which was filed through advocate Mohit Paul, asked for restraining beggars, vagabonds and homeless people from asking for money at traffic junctions, markets and public places in all states and Union territories across India so as to avoid the spread of Covid-19 . Referring to this, the bench said that there was no way the court was going to entertain the petition if it was premised on a prayer to direct removal of beggars. “It is a function of poverty. As a Supreme Court, we won’t take this elitist view that we don’t want to see beggars on our streets. Why do people beg? Because they have no choice. They are deprived of sufficient means of livelihood. Nobody wants to beg otherwise,” remarked the bench. It added: “If we issue a notice on this petition in the way it has been drafted, people will think the Supreme Court of India wants beggars removed from their eyes. We can’t say ‘keep them away from our eyes’. We will never do this. This is a socio-economic problem which the Centre and states must address as a wider issue of social welfare policy. There should rather be education of the children who we see on the street begging.” Senior advocate Chinmoy Pradip Sharma, arguing for the PIL, agreed that the petition was not properly worded and emphasised that the prayer could be confined to rehabilitation and vaccination of the beggars. Advocate Mohit Paul too submitted that the petitioner wanted the plea regarding a restraint against the beggars withdrawn since they were in the court primarily to seek rehabilitation. Following this submission, the bench agreed to issue notices to the Centre and the Delhi government , seeking their response on “how to deal with this human situation” for urgent need to vaccinate beggars, vagabonds and homeless people and provide basic amenities during the pandemic. The court further requested solicitor general Tushar Mehta to assist the court on the next date of hearing. In its order, the bench recorded that the petition will be amended in order to do away with the prayer on removing the beggars from the streets. “At the outset, we have indicated that the court is not inclined to countenance a prayer seeking a direction in the above terms. The reason why people are required to take to the streets to beg is to eke out an elementary livelihood in the absence of education and employment. It is a social-economic problem and cannot be remedied in this way,” the court noted in its order as it fixed the matter after two weeks. Kalra’s petition said that the Union government and states were not only duty-bound to secure the right to health of each and every individual in our country but to ensure that the beggars be rehabilitated across the country. “The respondents (Centre and states) should be directed to prepare a road map to rehabilitate the beggars and the vagabonds with the help of social welfare departments and the district magistrates of the concerned states,” stated the plea. It added that till date there was no legislation or policy in India providing for rehabilitation of beggars either at the central level or at state levels despite the fact that the number of beggars in all states and UTs is at least 400,000 according to official data of the Government of India issued in March 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-take-elitist-view-of-banning-beggars-from-streets-sc-101627413980253.html
28-07-2021||India||India sees you with pride: President in Kashmir||Srinagar: President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday said that democracy has the capacity to reconcile all differences and bring out the best of citizens’ potentials, and that the people of Kashmir were “happily” realising this vision.The President also asserted that Kashmir is bound to acquire its rightful place as the crowning glory of India and the younger generation will slowly realise this dream.Speaking at the 19th annual convocation of University of Kashmir at Sheri Kashmir International Convocation Centre (SKICC), Kovind said: “Kashmir, happily, is already realising this vision. Democracy lets you build your own future, a peaceful and prosperous tomorrow. The youth and women especially have high stakes in it, and I am sure they will not let go of this opportunity to rebuild lives and rebuild Kashmir.”Kovind also said that exciting new possibilities are opening up in the region.“The whole of India is watching you with admiration and pride. Kashmiri youth are scaling new heights in a variety of sectors, from civil service exams to sports and entrepreneurial ventures,” he said, adding that he wishes to see the Valley as paradise on earth.“I am squarely banking on the younger generation of Jammu and Kashmir to realise this dream which I am sure will come true sooner than later. Kashmir is bound to acquire its rightful place as the crowning glory of India,” he said.The President, who arrived in Srinagar on Sunday for a four-day visit to the Union territory, also urged the younger generation to learn from Kashmir’s rich legacy, saying that violence, which was never a part of the Valley, became a daily reality. It was most unfortunate that this outstanding tradition of peaceful existence was broken, he added.“Violence, which was never part of ‘Kashmiriyat’, became the daily reality. It is alien to Kashmiri culture, and it can only be termed as an aberration – a temporary one, much like a virus that attacks the body and needs to be purged. Now, there is a new beginning and determined efforts to regain this land’s lost glory,” he said.The President said that Kashmir has always been a beacon of hope for the rest of the country. “Its spiritual and cultural influence has its imprint all across India,” he said.“It is impossible to write a history of Indian philosophy without referring to Kashmir’s contributions to it. One of the oldest manuscripts of the Rigveda were written in Kashmir… Hinduism and Buddhism flourished in Kashmir, as did Islam and Sikhism after it arrived here in later centuries,” he added.Quoting the Valley’s medieval spiritual poetess Lal Ded, Kovind said one can see how Kashmir provides the template for communal harmony and peaceful coexistence.“This is also reflected in all aspects of life here, in folk arts and festivals, in food and dress. The core nature of the place has always been inclusive. Almost all religions that came to this land embraced a unique feature of Kashmiriyat that shunned orthodoxy and encouraged tolerance and mutual acceptance among communities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sees-you-with-pride-president-in-kashmir-101627413860264.html
28-07-2021||India||‘People must have faith in govt’s promise of statehood’: J&K Guv Manoj Sinha||In the run-up to the second anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370, and against the backdrop of recent outreach efforts by the Union government, Jammu & Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha spoke to Hindustan’s Shashi Shekhar on his administration’s plans and strategies, during a long conversation at the Raj Bhawan in Srinagar. Edited excerpts:My tongue fumbles as I try to say ‘Lieutenant Governor.’ When would I be able to address you as Mr Governor?I will try to give a direct answer. You want to know when it [Jammu & Kashmir] will get the status of statehood? Home Minister Amit Shah has given a clear assurance in the country’s Parliament that statehood will be announced at the appropriate time. The Prime Minister also said this when he addressed the nation. Recently, when representatives of various political parties met in Delhi on June 24, the question was raised again. Even there the Home Minister repeated that statehood will be given at the appropriate time. You will understand the significance of something said in the national Parliament. I believe the people of the nation and Jammu and Kashmir must trust them.A number of promises were made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. You have even promised the homecoming of Kashmiri Pandits. When will be the proper time for their return?I will come to the Kashmiri Pandit question later, but I would like to draw your attention to the promises that were made and fulfilled in the last few years. A programme runs under the name of Prime Minister Development Fund (PMDP). After the bifurcation , broadly speaking, development projects worth ₹55000 crores are being run as part of this programme and I am happy to announce that when I had come here, the portion spent was about 23% and , despite two waves of Covid,that has today risen to about 67%. Today Jammu and Kashmir has an Indian Institute of technology, an Indian Institute of Management, two central universities, and two All India Institutes of Medical Science are being set up. Plus, new medical colleges are coming up. A National Institute of Fashion Technology has been set up, along with one Bone Institute and two Cancer Institutes, and seven paramedical and nursing colleges. Here I am talking about just one region. Last year we completed more than 16,000 projects and this year, this number will reach 30,000 . We have modified the land laws and many people have a difference of opinion over these. I would like to mention just a few laws. You needed the excise minister’s approval to set up an orchard and even to cut its produce. I don’t think there could have been a worse law for farmers. There is no need to seek permission to set up an orchard now. We are moving towards a new Jammu and Kashmir.What about Kashmiri Pandits…Let me share two facts about Kashmiri Pandits with you. The Government of India promised to create 6,000 jobs and build 6,000 houses. This was being disrupted for one reason or another. Today, except 164 posts that are vacant, everybody else has got a job. The remaining posts will be filled in three, four months. As far as accommodation is concerned, 1800 flats are being built quickly as one-room sets that will be complete in six, seven months. The remaining land has also been identified. These houses will be built over the next two years, but I believe just jobs and accommodation are not enough to rehabilitate Kashmiri Pandits. We have taken a number of decisions that will create a conducive atmosphere for their return and rehabilitation. Secondly, we are going to take many other administrative decisions that will make it convenient for them to return. You will certainly see the results in the next six months.The unemployment rate in Kashmir is almost double the rest of the country. Some of them are sitting idle at home without jobs. How will you address this imbalance?Our unemployment rate was at 19.3 in March, which went up during the pandemic but the new statistic for this month is 10.3 or 10.4. We are better than Goa, Delhi and Rajasthan.Why didn’t you name Uttar Pradesh?It didn’t occur to me. At this time, I would like to submit that if you want to understand Jammu-Kashmir (J&K), you must know one fundamental fact: The population of J&K is 13 million and the budget passed by Parliament is to the tune of ₹1.08 lakh crore. This hasn’t happened only this year. The figure was ₹1 lakh crore last year and ₹90,000 crore before that. Since Independence, this has been seven or eight times compared to other states. Despite this, 970 villages do not have road connectivity. There are many places that don’t even have grid electricity. We haven’t been able to organise clean drinking water for many. This is the misfortune of J&K. We launched a ‘Back to the Village’ programme and kept a target of identifying two young people from every panchayat and providing them self-employment and offered a loan of up to ₹10 lakh loan at a subsidised rate. I am happy that we were able to provide loans to 19,873 people. Of these, 4500 are women. We have a target of providing loans to 50,000 young people for self-employment.There are complaints that announcements have been made for MSMEs, but the banks don’t disburse loans… There is no such complaint in Jammu and Kashmir. Secondly, we are setting up youth clubs in the Panchayat. Through these, we are initiating skill development at a very rapid pace, in association with Tata Technology. Children are being provided 360-degree training in financial services along with the Bombay Stock Exchange. Young people who have completed school can easily earn between ₹25,000 and ₹30,000 with just three months of training.Are you doing anything special for women?Our focus is on women and young people. A number of schemes have been launched including Hausala and Tejaswini. Apart from government officials, youngsters from IIM came forward to train students. Women have traditionally been part of the workforce here. If you look back at history, you will discover that Kashmir is the only region in which a guerrilla army of women was formed. Women here are already empowered. We are giving encouragement to this by creating a conducive atmosphere for them. Our sisters in Kashmir are very talented and they are coming forward to take their rightful place in society. You took along members of the Gupkar Alliance last month but their tone changed when they returned. On the one hand it is said they don’t have the people’s mandate on the other, they are invited for talks.I think the political process had begun before I took over. When I was coming here, the PM told me two things. One, increase dialogue with common citizens as much as possible. Secondly, Panchayati Raj institutions need to be strengthened. A three-tier Panchayati Raj system has been implemented for the first time.The panchayat polls were quite successful here, but the poll percentage was less in the Valley…Please compare the votes polled to those polled in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections for the past 3-4 times. The constituencies that saw a voting percentage of 8% saw a 28% turnout this time. The nation needs to know that an election was held for the first time in 20 years in which not even a drop of blood was shed in Jammu-Kashmir. You won’t meet any person who can say the election wasn’t impartial. Meanwhile, it would be wrong to say that just the Gupkar alliance was invited. Leaders of all political parties had gone [for the all-party meet].Granted, no blood was shed in the elections, but attacks on the armed forces and their family members have increased. Elected representatives are being targeted. What is your policy regarding this?The armed forces are in a better position today. Cross-border incursions have stopped as a whole. Violent incidents have also reduced and stone-throwing is history. Still, a few incidents that took place could have been avoided. Those who have given patronage to terrorism, those who have financed it, wherever they are, even if they are they are part of the government machinery, are being dealt with firmly.Now drones are being used for attacks. Why haven’t we been able to thwart the conspiracy being hatched by foreign agencies to worsen the situation in Kashmir and trouble its citizens?Drones have been seen in the last few months. A few drones were shot down by BSF personnel, some were captured, particularly those being used for smuggling of arms and narcotics. Now a drone was seen at the Jammu air base. As far as the international scenario is concerned, the country’s ministry of external affairs and the Government of India will worry about it. Whatever needs to be fixed here is our responsibility and we will do it without any delay.Do you see any impact of the developments in Afghanistan here?I have already made it clear that we won’t wait for things to happen… whatever needs to be done, will be done.Coming back to the economy and jobs, until the nation’s industrial houses invest here, it won’t be easy to create jobs and economic development. Are you doing anything special in this direction?A new industrial scheme has been launched in which we are extending an incentive of ₹28,400 crore. Arguably no other state in the country can boast of such an industrial policy. We are giving a 300% incentive in GST. This means you can gain the incentive, provided you begin manufacturing. Investments of around ₹25,000 crore were expected to come to the state and between 4 lakh and 5 lakh people were expected to gain employment, but looking at the enthusiastic response, I feel investment to the tune of between 40,000 crore and 50,000 crore will come here and between 8 lakh and 9 lakh jobs will be created.How much of this Is in Jammu and how much in Kashmir? How many of them are coming to the Valley?Plenty of people are coming to the Valley as well as Jammu. There may be a difference of 5-10%, but there isn’t any imbalance.How did you win the war against Corona? Your vaccination levels are perhaps the best in the country.Deaths have occurred here as well. We have deep empathy for those who have lost their loved ones and we have launched a scheme called Saksham for those who have lost family members to the pandemic. The administration must have a humane face. Looking at this, we have taken up the responsibility of their family members. There wasn’t even a single day when we had to say we don’t have oxygen beds. As many as 98 per cent of those over the age of 45 have been vaccinated.List three achievements you are proud ofOne, restoring the democratic process and Panchayati Raj institutions for the first time since Independence. Two, creating an entirely transparent administration and three, creating an administration that is answerable to people.

28-07-2021||India||NHRC team on a witch-hunt, says Bengal govt in affidavit on poll violence||Kolkata: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) enquiry committee looking into post-poll violence in West Bengal is merely spearheading a witch hunt against the Mamata Banerjee-administration in Bengal as part of a concerted effort to discredit a democratically elected state government, the West Bengal government said in an affidavit filed on July 26 before the Calcutta high court. “The Committee has been deliberately constituted to spearhead a witch hunt against the entire state machinery in West Bengal….In conclusion it is stated that concerted efforts are being made by those behind the Committee to completely discredit a democratically elected state government,” stated the 95-page affidavit. In June a five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court directed NHRC to constitute a committee to examine all cases of alleged human rights violation during violence after the assembly polls, the results of which were declared on May 2. The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party fought a bitter and intense electoral battle; the latter expected to win at least 200 seats but it was the TMC that swept the elections and returned to power. While the seven member committee headed by NHRC member Rajiv Jain submitted an interim report on July 2, the final report was submitted on July 13. The state government affidavit also said that some of the committee members have a close association with the Bhartiya Janta Party or the BJP-led Union government. They were deliberately chosen to give a negative report against the state, it argued. “Several members of the Committee are either members of the BJP or are known to be closely associated with the ruling dispensation in the central government. Therefore, the credibility of the Committee inasmuch as they are expected to investigate in an unbiased and neutral manner is questionable,” stated the affidavit, while calling the PILs on post-poll violence politically motivated. A senior official of NHRC declined comment on the state government’s affidavit saying that the matter was being heard by the court. “The enquiry committee was formed on the HC’s direction. The NHRC report is based on facts provided by the state’s DGP which shows that the police received at least 29 murder complaints. Still the CM is saying nothing has happened. Whether recommending a CBI probe is beyond the NHRC’s purview it is for the court to decide,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state. The NHRC report recommended that incidents of post-poll violence should be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and trials held outside the state; it added that the spate of violence in the state shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus. “The committee has no power to recommend any course of action, as has been done in the report…Thus, in purporting to recommend the investigation by CBI and trial of post-poll violence outside the state of West Bengal, the committee has exceeded its mandate and in doing so, the committee has clearly demonstrated its bias,” the state’s affidavit stated. The NHRC report slammed the Mamata Banerjee administration calling the clashes a “death knell” for democracy. It had also said that the situation in the state of West Bengal is a manifestation of law of ruler, instead of rule of law. The state’s affidavit on Monday chose to reply in the same terms saying that such concerted efforts to discredit a democratically elected state government are the real “death knell to democracy in this great nation”. The matter is likely to be heard by the five-judge bench headed by acting Chief Justice of the Calcutta high Court Rajesh Bindal on July 28. At least two TMC legislators, Jyotipriyo Mullick and Partha Bhowmik, who were branded as ‘notorious criminals / goons’ in the NHRC report have separately moved the Calcutta high court challenging the report. The report named more than 123 people, some of the local TMC leaders, and tagged them as notorious criminals and goons. The list includes former TMC MLA Udayan Guha and Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in Nandigram, Sheikh Sufiyan.“I have been named in the list as a goon under Sandeshkhali police station. Not a single FIR or GD is lodged against me in that police station. Then how my name was included? I have faith on the judiciary,” Mullick told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-team-on-a-witch-hunt-says-bengal-govt-in-affidavit-on-poll-violence-101627413800279.html
28-07-2021||India||Mamata calls on PM, seeks all-party meet on Pegasus||“The Lok Sabha election is a long way from now -- but the planning has to be done in advance,” West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said on the secondday of her five-day visit to the national capital, explicitly stating what many see as one of the main objectives of her visit, the first after her party returned to power in the state, defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).On Tuesday, she met three senior Congress leaders, Kamal Nath, Anand Sharma and Abhishek Singhvi. Party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and poll strategist Prashant Kishor were also present in some of the meetings. According to one of the leaders who met her, the meetings were primarily focused on ways to strengthen Opposition unity. She is scheduled to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday for what she called “chai pe charcha” (a conversation over tea).Amid furious protests over the targeting of phones of journalists, politicians, activists, businessmen, and others using military grade spyware Pegasus, Banerjee said after her meeting with the PM that the government should call an all-party meeting and supported calls for a Supreme Court monitored probe.“I sought time from the PM after winning for the third time with the blessings of the people,” she said, adding that the two chatted for “more than half an hour” and that Prime Minister Modi was in a “good mood”. A Trinamool leader said that Modi even asked Banerjee if she is still walking 20 km a day, to which the chief minister replied that she now walks only 18 km a day.During her interaction with the Prime Minister, Banerjee sought more vaccine doses for her state. The TMC claims that as against a quota of 7.5 million doses, Bengal, with a population of 110 million people, has received only 2.3 million doses thus far in July. “I also asked him to expedite the change in name of West Bengal (to Bangla) since the proposal has been pending for more than three years.” The two leaders also discussed the Pegasus issue.While the PM-CM meeting was more about the state’s development issues, Banerjee’s Delhi visit is also aimed at consolidating her position in the Opposition camp and to explore the possibilities of more Opposition unity with an eye on the 2024 general election.“I am always hopeful of an Opposition unity. We will definitely have a meeting of all Opposition parties but only after Covid subsides. Soniaji has called me tomorrow over tea. We will have chai pe charcha,” the Bengal CM said, riffing off the series of events Modi held under that branding ahead of the 2014 polls.Banerjee will not go to the Central Hall of Parliament as reported in some quarters, but she is expected to meet Shiv Sena leaders, the Nationalist Congress Party’s Sharad Pawar and other opposition leaders.When reminded about how personal aspirations have often ruined grand alliances, she evaded talk of leadership issues and quipped, “The country will lead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-calls-on-pm-seeks-all-party-meet-on-pegasus-101627413620231.html
28-07-2021||India||Free colour TV scheme: Over 1,000 TVs bought under DMK tenure, found locked||Chennai: More than thousand colour television sets purchased by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government during the fag end of its previous regime (2006-2011) have been found locked up inside a community hall in Semmandalam in Cuddalore district for 11 years. These colour television sets were not distributed after the AIADMK was elected in 2011 and remained in power until this year.The television sets were part of DMK’s free colour television scheme which it had promised before the 2006 assembly elections.After the DMK came back to power this May, the local residents who wanted to use the community hall and local vernacular media drew the attention of the newly appointed district collector K Balasubramaniam that the television sets have been lying idle stacked up inside cartons.“There are likely to be 1,000 TVs. We will count them shortly,” said Balasubramaniam . The hall where the TVs are stored is now locked and sealed and two police constables are working in shifts to protect the premises round-the-clock. “We don’t want anti-social elements to enter,” the collector said. The district officials are planning to rope in engineers to check the condition of the TVs. The working TVs will be distributed to government-run institutions such as anganwadis and hospitals.HT reached out to Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Department Corporation but they did not respond to calls and messages.In June 2011, J Jayalalithaa scrapped the flagship free colour TV distribution scheme of the M Karunanidhi regime she had decimated in the assembly polls. She had ordered that the 127,000 remaining television sets that were to be distributed be given to hospitals, schools, orphanages and panchayats.A senior bureaucrat who worked in the chief minister’s special cell at that time recalled this order. “Also all districts were instructed to send the TVs that were not distributed to warehouses,” the official said, not wishing to be identified. “All districts followed the instructions. There could have been some law and order issue why Cuddalore district didn’t distribute or send it to warehouses.”Ariyalur district collector P Ramana Saraswathi has asked revenue officials to inspect and report if any such television sets purchased under the scheme are stored away as in the case of Cuddalore. Saraswathi who was the revenue officer of Tirunelveli district during the previous regime said that they had distributed the excess television sets. “There were only about a 100 TVs left in Tirunelveli in 2012,” she says. “We distributed it to hostels run by the Adi Dravidar and Tribal welfare department and to old age homes. Now that I’ve been appointed in Ariyalur, I’ve voluntarily asked for officials to follow up on this.”It was among several programmes of the Karunanidhi government that Jayalalithaa reversed which she termed corrupt after returning to power; riding on the 2G-spectrum scam. She accused the DMK of running this scheme to favour local cable television franchises, which was owned by the Marana brothers, Kalanidhi and Dayanidhi, who are grandnephews of Karunanidhi.At that time, Jayalalithaa had said in the Tamil Nadu assembly that the DMK had planned to distribute 1 million TV sets in the 6th phase of the scheme when the government was in transition. Of these some 0.75 million TVs had to be procured but Jayalaithaa cancelled them.The DMK has defended providing colour televisions as a means to offer exposure to the economically weaker sections via TV programmes and as a mark of self respect so that poor people didn’t have to watch television through the windows of others’ homes. “In 2011, several TVs were stored across Tamil Nadu but we don’t know what happened to them,” says R S Bharathi, DMK’s organising secretary and Rajya Sabha MP. “Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) had issued a statement that they were not being distributed to beneficiaries. Jayalalithaa freezed the scheme which she should have continued,” he said adding that concerned government departments are following up on this case.The DMK government had spent around ₹3,687 crore in the five years in its 2006-2011 regime to purchase 10.64 million television sets. The average cost of a television set was about ₹2,265 purchased by ELCOT (Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited). “People are still using these TVs. The picture clarity is substandard but free TVs meant for public lying idle for a decade is definitely dumping the taxpayers money in the dustbin,” said political commentator Maalan Narayanan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-colour-tv-scheme-over-1-000-tvs-bought-under-dmk-tenure-found-locked-in-cuddalore-101627413560262.html

A two-judge bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and R Hemalatha also directed the actor to pay the balance 80% of the entry tax within one week. They posted the case for hearing on August 8. The senior counsel appearing for the actor submitted that while other petitions were dismissed without any observations,adding “the learned single judge had dismissed the present writ petition making damaging observations against the appellant and also imposing a cost of Rs.100,000.” “Further, the learned senior counsel submitted that in the event of the authority issuing demand challan to the appellant claiming the balance 80% of the entry tax, he would pay the said amount within a period of one week,” the court noted. The case relates to an order passed by a single judge-bench of Justice SM Subramaniam on July 8. The senior counsel for Vijay said that the actor is aggrieved by the observations made by the single judge as well as the imposed fine of Rs1,00,000. The judge had made several critical remarks against the actor including differentiating between a real and reel hero. “This court is of the considered opinion that the non-payment of entry tax by the petitioner, can never be appreciated and the petitioner has not respected nor responded to the lakhs and lakhs of his fans, who has paid by viewing his movies and from and out of such money, the petitioner / actor purchased the world’s prestigious car for his personal usage,” the judge had said in his orders dated July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rolls-royce-case-hc-stays-remarks-against-actor-vijay-asks-him-to-pay-tax-101627413500263.html
28-07-2021||India||Let us hope govts respond, says SC on plea seeking implementation of 2012 law||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked central and state governments to respond to a petition seeking implementation of a law prescribing minimum standards for affordable and quality healthcare that has been in operation since February 2012.The petition filed by NGO Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Patients’ Rights Campaign and activist KM Gopakumar sought the implementation of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act 2010, the Clinical Establishment (Central Government) Rules, 2012 and the Patients’ Rights Charter prepared by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) along with Union Health Ministry in August 2018.Linking the petition to the present Covid-19 pandemic, the petition filed by advocate Srishti Agnihotri said: “The lack of implementation of provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act and rules has exposed a majority of the population to the potential exploitation by private healthcare providers, leading to the denial of the right to health during the Covid-19 pandemic.”A bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana and justice Surya Kant said the bench will issue notice. “Let us hope the Governments will respond.”The petition argued by senior advocate Sanjay Parikh said 70% of the healthcare sector falls within the domain of private hospitals. This law provides for common conditions for registration of clinical establishments, minimum standards of facilities and services, the requirement of personnel, fixation of rates for each type of medical and pathological procedure and services within the range of rates determined by the central government issued from time to time, for all times than for specific situations of the pandemic, he submitted.Parikh said the 2010 law applies to 11 states and six union territories. The Act provides for the establishment of the National Council for Clinical Establishments and State Council/ UT council in the respective states/UTs to prescribe standard guidelines for treatment rates to be charged, medical infrastructure and facilities. Even the National Health Policy 2017 recommends implementation of patients’ rights as key process standards, along with setting up a medical tribunal for resolutions of complaints by patients.The bench observed, “The Rules of 2012 expect small laboratories to have academically qualified persons. It is a very burdensome thing for them. Ultimately they will pass the burden to the patients.” The petition pointed out that having a law that is not implemented as also the patients’ rights charter amounts to a violation of citizens’ right to health guaranteed under Article 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-us-hope-govts-respond-says-sc-on-plea-seeking-implementation-of-2012-law-101627413441414.html
28-07-2021||India||Pegasus row: Key TN activists on target list slam move||Chennai: Key figures in Tamil Nadu who have been potentially snooped for clients of the Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, expressed that they are not surprised being on the list but condemned the move. Paris-based journalism non-profit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International which had access to the list shared it with 17 news organizations in 10 countries including The Wire, an online news portal. Among more than 50,000 phone numbers that included surveillance targets, names of key figures from Tamil Nadu have been found published by the portal. The list of potential targets include S Seeman, founder of Naam Thamizhar Katchi (NTK), Thirumurugan Gandhi, founder of May 17 movement, K Ramakrishnan founder of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam and V Kumaresan, treasurer of Dravidar Kazhagam. All of them have a common factor that binds them-- an ideology following the tenets of EV Ramasamy or Periyar, the father of the Dravidian movement.“In principle, Tamil nationalism based on Periyar or Dravidian ideology is against religious fundamentalism and caste atrocities which is a threat to the BJP’s Hindutva,” says Gandhi who has more than 40 cases filed against him including three sedition cases. He was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in 2018 but the case was eventually dropped. “I’ve had intelligence officers following me in whichever city I lived in,” said Gandhi, adding, “So being monitored isn’t new to me but it’s disturbing that they have used such sophisticated and expensive software to target us. If you see the list, there is no one from a terrorist organisation. It only has those who are working in the public front for peace. So it’s a weird operation. It raises the question if they are targeting us politically.” Gandhi, who has a masters in software engineering, started the May 17 movement following the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009. He has rallied for the rights of the Sri Lankan Tamils in the EU parliament in 2018, for human rights in Tamil Nadu and spoke out against BJP’s economic policies. Gandhi’s family, like that of other activists, has been affected given his nature of work. Even before the Pegasus revelation, his wife lost her job, he had to shift his daughter to a different school and move several homes. “How do you talk to your wife or father when you know someone is watching you?” But Gandhi doesn’t want to dwell on how this affects him personally stating that activists like Sudha Baradwaj and late Stan Swamy have gone through worse. “The larger issue is that this is an attack on democracy. If we don’t stop this now, it will become the norm,” warns Gandhi. “This sort of surveillance will lead to real dictatorship and worse, we will be victims if we don’t think or act the way government wants us to. If we get there, we can never break the system.”If required, Gandhi has offered to give his android phone to those associated with the Pegasus project for forensic analysis. He has used the same phone number for two decades. Kumaresan who has been with the Dravidar Kazhagam for more than three decades said they were made a target due to their ideology. “We are diagonally opposite to the RSS’ ideology so who else will they spy on?” Kumaresan asked. Around the time when RSS was founded in Nagpur is when Periyar began to advocate the self-respect movement in Tamil Nadu. Periyar later founded Dravida Kazhagam, the ideological parent of Tamil Nadu’s Dravidian parties-DMK and AIADMK. DK has kept out of electoral politics. “Our ideological commitment has remained the same unlike political parties who change according to circumstance. So it doesn’t come as a shock to us that they want to watch us,” said Kumaresan. “But this infringes my fundamental right to privacy,” he said. Kumaresan, who also uses an android phone plans to continue using the same number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-row-key-tn-activists-on-target-list-slam-move-101627413440251.html
28-07-2021||India||As K’taka grapples with floods, BJP busy playing politics: Congress||A day after the BS Yediyurappa resigned from his post of the Karnataka chief minister, the Congress party attacked the BJP for not paying attention to the flood-affected areas of the state. On Monday, Karnataka Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot accepted Yediyurappa’s resignation and asked him to continue as the caretaker CM till the next CM takes oath while dissolving the council of ministers headed by Yediyurappa with immediate effect. Eshwar Khandre, working president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) said that the state doesn’t have a government when it is going through a severe calamity. “When people have lost their livelihoods, the legislators of the BJP are fighting within for power. The BJP has failed the people,” he said. He added that people have seen misgovernance from the BJP and the party will not last long in power. “As per my assessment, because of the fights within the party, there will be a requirement for fresh elections,” Khandre said. Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah, too, took on the BJP, alleging that the Centre has failed to come to the aid of the state during the floods. He said this was witnessed during the 2019 floods and the current situation. Siddaramaiah told reporters here on Tuesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi neither visited the state during the 2019 floods when the condition was severe nor during the current situation. “The state government has also not released funds to aid the flood-affected people. It should cut down on other unwanted expenses and mobilise funds to manage the flood situation and provide relief to the affected. Managing the flood situation should be the first priority of the government, he said. The former chief minister said Congress party leaders are visiting the flood-affected areas and would submit a report to the government to provide funds for flood-affected areas. “We shall also demand convening of a legislative session to discuss the flood situation,” he noted. Siddaramaiah later left for Khanapur and Hukkeri taluks to inspect the flood situation. The flood situation in Karnataka continues to remain grim with 10 people losing their lives in rain-related incidents and two people reported missing so far. Even though former chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said that he would write to the Centre to release funds for carrying out flood relief work, officials in the know of the developments said no such letter has been written so far. Districts of the Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, Dharwad and Haveri bore the brunt of the heavy downpour among the 11 affected districts.

28-07-2021||India||Bill to acquire Chhattisgarh medical college triggers row||A controversy has erupted in Chhattisgarh over the Bhupesh Baghel government’s plan to acquire a privately-run medical college with the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that the decision, highlighted in a media report on Tuesday morning, was designed to bail out the loss-making college because it was run by a board that has one of the chief minister’s relatives as a member.Chief minister Baghel on Tuesday tweeted his rebuttal , insisting that his only aim was to save the medical college and benefit the state’s students. “By acquiring (it), we will save the time to open a new medical college and we will get 150 doctors every year,” the chief minister said.Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo is slated to introduce a bill in the state assembly on Wednesday that seeks to acquire the privately-owned Chandulal Chandrakar Memorial Medical College (CCMH) in Durg district.According to its website, the college, named after senior Congress leader and five-time member of Parliament Chandulal Chandrakar, was set up in 2013 and is run by a 59-member board. Among those on the board is a member of the joint family into which Baghel’s daughter is married.The opposition alleged the government was pushing the deal to help the loss-making college.BJP spokesperson Gauri Shankar Srivas said public interest clearly wasn’t driving the government’s hand.“This is a serious issue… We will raise the issue in the state assembly and knock on the doors of the high court if needed. This government is benefitting their relatives which is a matter of concern.”Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (Jogi) president Amit Jogi claimed the college has an outstanding debt of ₹125 crore and was not recognised by the MCI since 2017.”If after all this, the government is acquiring the college, it is because of the chief minister’s relative,” Amit Jogi said.Government spokesperson and senior minister Ravindra Chaubey said this wasn’t true.“The aim is to benefit people of the entire state of Chhattisgarh. Secondly, to open a new medical college, we need around ₹500 crore only for infrastructure. This college has got permission of Medical Council of India (MCI) and they have already got infrastructure hence we are acquiring it at half its actual price.”Dev Chandrakar, who is on the college’s board of directors, said the family of the chief minister’s son-in-law was not linked with the college in any way. The board only asked the government to acquire the college since “we were not able to run it”, he said, declining to elaborate.Baghel, who put out a string of tweets in defence of the decision, did not give details of the bill but underscored that if the government concludes that something is in the public interest, it will acquire a private medical college as well as the plant in Nagarnar, a reference to his government’s offer to buy the National Mineral Development Corporation-run steel plant if the Centre wants to divest its share.“As far as benefiting family members is concerned, I want to tell the people of the state, Bhupesh Baghel is accountable to them and always done politics of transparency...When the deal is done, everything will be clear,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-acquire-chhattisgarh-medical-college-triggers-row-101627411283520.html
28-07-2021||India||HC halts probe in Jarkiholi case as SIT chief on leave||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Tuesday ordered a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the alleged sex-for-job scandal involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi to stop its investigation after it transpired that the SIT chief has been on medical leave since 1 May.The bench, which also barred the SIT from submitting its final report, said it must first examine the legality of the investigation conducted in the absence of Soumendu Mukherjee, the senior Indian Police Service officer who was designated to lead the SIT in March this year.Ramesh Jarkiholi resigned from the BS Yediyurappa cabinet on March 3 after a video emerged in which a person resembling the minister was seen with an unnamed woman. A self-proclaimed social activist who released the video clip, screenshots and a telephonic conversation, accused the minister of sexually exploiting the woman. The Gokak legislator, however, insisted that he was innocent and after his resignation, linked the accusation to a political conspiracy against him.The SIT, headed by Somendu Mukherjee, was formed a day after Jarkiholi alleged a political conspiracy.On Tuesday, the bench of chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and justice NS Sanjay Gowda said it couldn’t find any order that empowered another officer to lead the probe.“We have perused the report dated July 19, filed by Joint Commissioner of Police Crime. In the said report it is mentioned that Soumendu Mukherjee IPS, Additional Commissioner of Police is on medical leave since May 1, 2021. We may note here that under the order dated March 11, which is the subject matter of challenge in two of the four petitions, it is mentioned that Soumendu Mukherjee is the leader of SIT. The question is, in the absence of the head of SIT, whether the investigation could have proceeded,” asked the bench.The bench said that it was not known if the report submitted on behalf of the SIT had been approved by the head of SIT. “...Therefore, apart from the issue of legality and validity of the constitution of SIT, the issue of the legality of the investigation carried in the absence of the head of SIT will have to be gone into by this court,” the bench added.The bench directed the Karnataka government and the SIT to respond to the query if the SIT could continue its investigation in the absence of its head when nothing has been placed on record to show that the Bengaluru police commissioner has appointed a new SIT chief.Senior lawyer Indira Jaisingh, representing the victim, contested the order constituting the SIT and submitted that the team’s probe was “mala fide and shows complete prejudice”.She also cited a news report on Tuesday that indicated the SIT hasn’t found any evidence to initiate prosecution in the sexual assault case filed by the woman but has found evidence to prosecute the woman and two others who were allegedly involved in extortion from the BJP MLA. It also added that the SIT has proposed to file a closure report in the sexual assault case and a charge sheet in the extortion caseThe bench indicated its displeasure at the SIT sharing the report with the media. “Let us first see the report first. Your (SIT) report is of July 19 and if it is leaked in the media then you (SIT) owe an explanation,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-halts-probe-in-jarkiholi-case-as-sit-chief-on-leave-101627411282953.html

Additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj termed this figure “unrealistic”, citing numbers from Maharashtra (412), Madhya Pradesh (885), Gujarat (947) and Rajasthan (781).A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “The information that is filtering to us does not appear to be credible and reliable. We are not prepared to believe this figure that in a big state like West Bengal, only 27 children were orphaned.”Advocate Sayandeep Pahari appearing for WB said it was an ongoing exercise and there was no reason for NCPCR to doubt the state’s figures. The bench said, “If you are steadfast in saying 27 children became orphans in such a big state, we can order an enquiry from an outside agency.” Later during the hearing, advocate Suhaan Mukherjee appeared for the state and sought an opportunity to come back with updated figures.To ensure that schemes available for orphans and children affected due to Covid-19 reaches maximum number of children, the top court directed district magistrates throughout the country to engage in a massive survey to find such children by using the help of police, district child protection units, Child line, civil society organisations, Gram Panchayats, Anganwadi and Asha workers.The Centre through ASG Aishwarya Bhati informed the Court that this exercise of collecting information about children orphaned during Covid-19 by district magistrates is underway as part of implementation of PM Cares for Children scheme. Under this scheme, children who lost both or surviving parent or adoptive parents/legal guardian due to Covid-19 will be entitled to ₹10 lakh financial support, to be available on attaining 18 years till they reach 23 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-believe-your-figures-on-covid-orphans-sc-to-bengal-govt-101627411282357.html
28-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh minister walks out of Assembly over allegations of attacking MLA||Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo on Tuesday walked out of the legislative assembly demanding that his government issue a “clear statement” addressing accusations that he was behind an attack on fellow Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh, triggering a crisis for the ruling Congress party in the state. Tuesday was the second day of the monsoon session that witnessed sharp exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches over the alleged attack that occurred on July 24 in Surguja district. Singh, the legislator from Ramanujanj, alleged that a vehicle in his convoy was attacked by three people, including a relative of the health minister. Singh Deo had denied the charge and said that he had instructed the police to take strict action against the perpetrators. Singh Deo was seen among the contenders for the chief minister’s post when the party swept back to power in 2018. Singh has linked the alleged attack to his praise of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and for advocating that the incumbent continue. He alleged this was a reason behind the attack. On Tuesday, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu gave a statement in the House and described it as a case of road rage. But the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) raised doubts about it and claimed the statement didn’t refer to allegations made by Singh on Singh Deo. Leader of opposition and BJP leader Dharamlal Kaushik called it an unfortunate incident for the Congress as well as the state since such allegations have never been levelled by any lawmaker in the state in the past. On Monday, too, the BJP had demanded that the House take suo motu cognisance of it and institute an inquiry. It reiterated its point on Tuesday and said the statements of both the health minister and the MLA should be recorded in the case. Subsequently, assembly speaker Charan Das Mahant said that since he hasn’t received any complaint, either from MLA Singh or the health minister, there was no basis for him to ask them to speak on the issue. Amid the commotion that ensued, Singh Deo stood up and said, “Yesterday (Monday), the chief minister (Bhupesh Baghel) had called us to his chamber and a discussion took place (on the alleged rift). Even after that, a limited statement (from the home minister) came before the House.”“I do not believe that I am in a position to attend the House till the government presents a clear reply on the issue… I do not consider myself eligible to participate in the proceedings of this House till the time the government does not put out a clear reply in my context,” he said, before walking out of the House and refusing to speak to the media. This led to uproar in the House, following which the speaker adjourned the proceedings for 10 minutes. When the House reassembled, the opposition members, including BJP’s Brijmohan Agrawal and Ajay Chandrakar, said till the issue is not resolved, other business should not be taken up in the House. Kaushik and former chief minister Raman Singh said for the sake of the dignity of the House and its members, the matter should be probed by a House panel. The BJP MLAs trooped into the well of the House in support of their demand, following which the Speaker adjourned the House for the day. Later, Singh Deo returned to the assembly and told reporters that he got a call from his cabinet colleagues and had come back. He was then seen going to CM Baghel’s chamber in the assembly, and when he returned, he told the media that he had spoken with Baghel and PL Punia, who is the All India Congress Committee’s Chhattisgarh in-charge. Congress spokesperson and senior leader Shailesh Nitin Trivedi later said that he isn’t aware of what transpired in this meeting, but “everything is fine”. Experts, however, aren’t convinced and suspect the state Congress is experiencing internal turmoil. “The crisis in the ruling party is not only unfortunate but also wholly avoidable and should have been solved in-house. It is sad that instead of focusing on the pre-poll promises made to the people of Chhattisgarh, the ruling party is doing all this. If this persists, the next election will be a cakewalk for the BJP, which so far doesn’t look battle-ready,” said Sudiep Shrivastva , a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh.Parivesh Mishra, another political expert, said the development is unfortunate for the Congress in Chhattisgarh. “T S Singh Deo is perceived by the people as polite, suave — basically, a nice guy. Brihaspat Singh, on the other hand, has a history of publicly accusing a district collector, an IAS officer, and a BJP parliamentarian of the same offence. The charges didn’t stick in the past, and they are unlikely to stick this time too,” Mishra said, adding that the party would damage itself if it accords any credibility to Singh’s charge. Congress governments have seen internal turmoil in recent times, requiring the high command to get involved in quelling trouble in Punjab and Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-minister-walks-out-of-assembly-over-allegations-of-attacking-mla-101627411281788.html
28-07-2021||India||India skips key meet on climate change||India failed to attend a two-day meeting of 51 countries where key issues regarding the Paris climate deal were discussed over the weekend and through Monday, according to officials who cited technical difficulties.The meeting was closed-door ministerial conference which was meant to take stock of global efforts to fight the climate crisis and the efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C (as part of the Paris climate accord) ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow this November.The meeting was called by COP26 president-designate, Alok Sharma and India was invited following the G20 joint ministerial on energy and climate last week.“We attended the G20 ministerial and made our stand clear. The UK Climate ministerial was right after that. It was being held in the middle of the Parliament session so it was decided that this time we cannot be present. On an official level we wanted to participate virtually but we couldn’t because of various technical issues” said Gaurav Khare, spokesperson, ministry of environment, forest and climate change.On the outcome of the ministerial meeting, Sharma’s office said: “Climate ministers have taken a step forward towards a successful COP26, as a constructive meeting in London concluded with countries coming closer together on key issues such as actions to keep the 1.5C goal alive, adaptation finance and concluding the Paris rulebook.” The Paris rulebook is basically the implementation guidelines to execute the Paris Agreement.According to a note issued by the UK government on Monday, Sharma was quoted saying: “We made progress over these two days. And there was a clear spirit of cooperation. However, the issues we have discussed are complex. There are still significant differences that persist. We have moved closer together. But still, on these vital issues we are not yet close enough.”The statement also said that over the past two days, countries had reached a common understanding that COP26 needs to keep 1.5°C within reach. Ministers participating at the meeting called for all countries to deliver long-term strategies towards net zero before COP26.The meeting will take place in a year when multiple freak weather events have brought back focus on climate change, especially in the western world. These incidents include unprecedented flooding and deaths in parts of Germany, flooding in parts of US and an unusual heatwave across parts of north America and Canada.One of the key agreements at the meeting was on finance. Sharma has called for a plan from developed countries on how they are going to deliver the $100 billion a year in international climate finance, which has been promised since 2009 but has been delivered. Now, the amount will have to be delivered between 2020 and 2025.India said in its official statement at the G20 energy and climate joint ministerial meeting on Saturday that the target of reducing emissions to net zero by mid-century, proposed by some countries, will not be adequate in view of the fast-depleting global carbon space. It urged the G20 nations with per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above the world average to reduce the levels by 2030.According to data provided by the Climate Watch by World Resources Institute, India emits 7.1% of global emissions and has per capita emissions of about 2.47 Tco2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), as compared to the global average of 6.45 tco2/per capita.Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav said on Friday at the G20 Climate ministerial that the world should not be shifting goalposts, possibly referring to diplomatic pressure on every country to raise ambition to meet a 1.5 degree C goal.“At COP26, India should be the voice of the vulnerable, and the conscience-keeper for the rich countries. By proffering even stronger climate action, India can reap health and economic co-benefits. But we clearly need clean technology partnerships for industrial processes,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of the Climate Program at World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-skips-key-meet-on-climate-change-101627411280069.html
28-07-2021||India||Newly-anointed K’taka CM a Lingayat leader, BSY aide||For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Basavaraj Bommai is the ideal candidate to replace BS Yediyurappa as the Karnataka chief minister. The 61-year-old is a Lingayat, obedient to the central leadership and a close associate of the outgoing CM. According to party insiders, all groups within the BJP are happy with the decision and believe that the change of power, which could have affected the party adversely, has culminated well with Bommai’s appointment.Unlike Yediyurappa, who was part of the BJP from its inception, Bommai started his political career with the Janata Dal. He worked with senior leaders, including former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and Ramakrishna Hegde during this time. In 2008, he left the Janata Dal (United) and joined the BJP.A graduate in mechanical engineering, Bommai was elected as a member of the Karnataka legislative council in 1998 and 2004 from Dharwad. He was thrice elected to Karnataka legislative assembly from the Shiggaon constituency in Haveri district in 2008, 2013 and 2018.This is the second time in the state’s political history that a father-son duo has held the chief minister’s post -- after HD Deve Gowda in 1994 and HD Kumaraswamy in 2006 and 2018. The incoming CM’s father SR Bommai was instrumental in the Janata Party forming a government in the state for the first time in 1983 and became the chief minister in 1988, after then chief minister Ramakrishna Hedge had to resign over snooping charges.However, his socialist father is best remembered for a landmark battle in the Supreme Court — SR Bommai versus Union of India — that he fought for five years after his government fell following defections in 1989. The 1994 judgment in that case laid down certain guidelines against the misuse of Article 356 of the Constitution by the central government to impose President’s Rule on states with unfriendly governments. He had moved court against the governor’s refusal to provide him the opportunity to prove majority on the floor of the House.The selection of junior Bommai comes after several pontiffs from Lingayat mutts in the state had warned the BJP central command against removing Yediyurappa, a tall leader of the Lingayat community. The Lingayat community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and has been a loyal vote base for the BJP. His appointment is expected to appease the community, according to BJP leaders.During this term as the home minister, Bommai made headlines over his October 2019 announcement to create Karnataka’s own National Register of Citizens (NRC) on the lines of the one in Assam even before the Union government issued any orders. However, following a backlash, he claimed that it would only be a survey of foreigners overstaying in India and no NRC.He was also a trusted lieutenant of Yediyurappa and often spoke in the assembly on behalf of the government. “Even though he was the home minister, he knew about developments in all departments. You would find him often in the assembly, answering questions on behalf of several departments with clarity,” pointed out a BJP leader on condition of anonymity.Political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, A Narayana, said the appointment of Bommai was a win-win situation for all stakeholders in the party. “First of all, he is a Lingayat, which takes care of the party’s biggest vote bank. He is close to Yediyurappa, which makes the veteran leader less disgruntled about the new appointment. For Modi and Amit Shah, he is someone who would be obedient, and since he doesn’t have a strong ideological background, even the RSS can push their agenda through him,” he said.However, another senior BJP said that even though Bommai is close to Yediyurappa, more than his own appointment, the position that would be given to his son would decide his approach towards the party. “As long as Bommai doesn’t become a powerful leader who can push back against the central leadership, he will remain in the post. As of now, he is an ideal candidate for the central leadership,” said the leader who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newlyanointed-k-taka-cm-a-lingayat-leader-bsy-aide-101627411220770.html
28-07-2021||India||Assam raises pitch in Mizoram border row||Assam and Mizoram were locked in a political standoff on Tuesday over a violent showdown at the interstate border that killed seven people and injured 41 others as the Union home ministry rushed troops to the troubled region and called an urgent meeting to defuse tensions.Assam said it will deploy 4,000 commandoes to guard the 164.6km border and approach the Supreme Court to stop Mizoram from building roads on its side. In response, Mizoram said it bolstered its security forces and blamed Assam Police for the 30-minute-long gunbattle on Monday .“People have sacrificed their lives but the boundary has been protected which we will continue to do at any cost. There is very strong deployment of police inside our border and not an inch of land will be allowed to be encroached,” Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said.Mizoram rejected the allegations. “Yesterday’s incident was unfortunate, but Assam Police should not have entered Mizoram forcibly and remove residents,” said state home minister Lalchamliana.Uneasy peace prevailed at the border between Cachar district’s Lailapur village and Kolasib district’s Vairengte town on Tuesday as central forces patrolled the area. “Five companies (close to 500 personnel) have been deployed and another two are on standby...the current situation is peaceful,” said Central Reserve Police Force director general Kuldiep Singh.The border checkposts are manned by central forces as they fall in the no man’s land between the two states. While there were attempts by some locals on the Assam side to block NH 306 that leads to Mizoram, the border between both states was open during the day.In Delhi, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla summoned top bureaucrats and police officers of both states in his office in Delhi on Wednesday, said ministry officials on condition of anonymity. Other senior officers of the MHA as well as intelligence agencies and paramilitary forces are expected to attend the meeting.“North East MPs Forum has made an appeal to people of Mizoram and Assam, particularly people living in border areas, to maintain peace and harmony. We must ensure complete peace all along with border areas. Home ministry is looking into it,” Union law minister Kiren Rijiju said.The decades-old border dispute sparked violent clashes on Monday morning, prompting a public spat between the two chief ministers and an intervention by Union home minister Amit Shah.Violence broke out around 11.30am on Monday over allegations of encroachment. Thousands of civilians on either side of the border hurled stones and charged at each other and security personnel with sticks and rods. Visuals showed policemen firing tear-gas shell and air pellets as people torched vehicles and huts.The gunbattle came two days after the chief ministers shared a stage with Shah and spoke of resolving the border dispute amicably. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power in Assam and Mizoram is ruled by the Mizo National Front, a part of the North East Democratic Alliance headed by the BJP.Assam’s Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6km long border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. Mizoram was a part of Assam till 1972 when it became a Union Territory. It became a state in 1987. The territorial dispute has festered since then and fuelled sporadic clashes, the latest of which rocked the region in August 2020 and February 2021.The dispute stems primarily from a difference in perception. Mizoram goes by an 1875 border agreement but Assam follows a 1933 demarcation.Assam declared three-day state mourning and announced an assistance of ₹50 lakh each to the kin of the deceased. “I called Mizoram CM six times when firing was taking place. He said ‘sorry’ and invited me for talks in Aizawl. No one can take even an inch of our land. We’re committed to securing our territory. Police are on the border,” Sarma told reporters in Silchar.He alleged Mizoram was encroaching on its forests, constructing roads and clearing vegetation for cultivation. and said Assam will move the apex court to protect forests.“We can’t do what Mizoram has done yesterday. Assam will never use bullets against any Indian citizen, this is not in our DNA. We don’t have political fight with Mizoram but there is a reason behind yesterday’s incident. We have discussed the matter and asked Mizoram to investigate properly,” Sarma said.Lalchamliana rejected Sarma’s claim. “We have been carrying out developmental activities in our territory, whereas people from Assam are regularly entering our area and trying to block the works,” he said.On Tuesday, Lalchamliana visited Vairengte . A Mizoram government statement said state police was deployed at three places along the border where “tension surged up recently due to incursion by Assam Police”.Mizoram didn’t mention the number of injuries due to Monday’s violence but a staffer at the Mizoram CM’s office told HT over phone that three people had sustained injuries.When asked about the reasons for the violence, Sarma alleged that the Assam government stopped illegal activities like drugs, cattle smuggling and infiltration from Mizoram in the past few months. “People who have entered Mizoram from Myanmar are trying to come to Assam and stay in Dima Hasao district. But we did not allow them,” he said.Lalchamliana dismissed the allegations. “One shouldn’t believe all statements made by the Assam chief minister. It was Assam Police personnel and civilians who entered Mizoram’s territory on Monday and created problems. When Assam Police started firing, our forces had to retaliate to save themselves,” he said.On Tuesday morning, Sarma visited Silchar Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) and met the injured police personnel and civilians. He also paid a floral tribute to the police personnel killed and announced compensation of ₹50 lakhs and a government job for a family member.“The moment firing started, senior police officers of Assam and Mizoram were sitting and discussing the dispute. Home minister Amit Shah spoke to Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and me several times since yesterday. We have assured that there will be no violence from our side but we will not let Mizoram to encroach one more inch from Assam’s territory,” Sarma said.Stating that it is a boundary dispute between states and not a political issue between parties, Sarma said that there were conflicts between Mizoram and Assam even when Congress was in power in both states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-raises-pitch-in-mizoram-border-row-101627410921344.html
28-07-2021||India||Basavaraj Bommai to be new Karnataka CM||Basavaraj Bommai, 61, will replace BS Yediyurappa as the chief minister of Karnataka, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) legislative party decided on Tuesday, with Bommai set to be sworn in on Wednesday, two days after the 78-year-old announced his resignation at an event to commemorate two years of his government.Bommai, a Lingayat like Yediyurappa, was minister for home affairs, law, parliamentary affairs and legislature in Yediyurappa’s council of ministers, which was dissolved on Monday, and is considered close to the former chief minister.“The legislative party has elected Bommai ji as its chief,” announced Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who was one of the two central observers for legislative party meeting held at Capital Hill, a hotel in Central Bengaluru. Union minister G Kishan Reddy was the other central observer at the meeting.“The new leader’s proposal was made by senior leader BS Yediyurappa and was supported by Govind Karjol, R Ashok, KS Eshwarappa, B Sriramulu, ST Somashekar and Poornima Srinivas,” he added.After the announcement, Bommai said he will work towards completing the projects initiated by the former chief minister. “It is a big responsibility in the given situation… BS Yediyurappa has worked for more than 40 years to build this party. He has taken the state through two Covid-19 waves and floods. The directions given by him will help me work for the Dalits, farmers, backwards communities, women and young.”“This (fulfilling Yediyurappa’s projects) will be a priority. Secondly, we are facing Covid-19, and floods as well. This will remain a priority as well,” Bommai said.Yediyurappa resigned on Monday, exactly two years after taking charge, “on health grounds”, even as dissent against him was growing within the BJP in Karnataka. He has vowed to work for the party in Karnataka and said he will not take a central government responsibility.Basavaraj Bommai is son of former Karnataka chief minister SR Bommai, who was removed as the Janata Dal chief minister in 1989 following large-scale defections without being given the opportunity to prove majority on the floor of the House. It was on SR Bommai’s petition that a nine-member bench of the Supreme Court, in 1994, imposed restrictions on dismissal of state governments under Article 356 of the Constitution.Basavaraj Bommai began his political career with his father’s party and worked with senior party leaders such as HD Deve Gowda and Ramakrishna Hegde before he left and joined the BJP in February 2008. According to a party leader, Basavaraj joined the BJP at the behest of Yediyurappa. He has over 33 years of legislative experience, having been elected to the legislative council in 1998.At the legislative party meeting, Yediyurappa proposed his name, which was approved unanimously, Pradhan said. “The legislative party meeting ended in just five minutes and everyone agreed to his (Bommai’s) name,” a BJP legislator said on condition of anonymity.According to another leader, Bommai’s elevation should ensure smooth transition of both the government and the party from Yediyurappa, a four-time chief minister and the most powerful BJP leader in the state. “Bommai is likely to retain the same cabinet as Yediyurappa to prevent dissidence and would accommodate rebel Congress legislators who joined the BJP,” the senior party leader said, asking not to be named. He, however, did not rule out a reshuffle of portfolios.Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar congratulated Bommai on his selection as the new chief minister. “Congratulations to Sri @BSBommai for being selected as the next Chief Minister of Karnataka. Congress party and the state hopes that the focus will be back on governance now,” Shivakumar tweeted.The selection of Bommai, who is from the Lingayat community, comes after several pontiffs from Lingayat mutts in the state advised the BJP central leadership against removing Yediyurappa, a tall leader of the community.The Lingayat community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and has been a loyal vote base for the party. Even though there was speculation of the BJP appointing a leader from a different community, eventually, it zeroed down on the Lingayat leader.The new chief minister was announced after Yediyurappa’s resignation ended months of speculation amid growing dissidence within the BJP in the only southern state.The 78-year-old made the announcement in an emotional speech at an event celebrating two years in power before submitting his resignation to governor Thaawarchand Gehlot.“I’m not sad. I’m happy. I can’t thank in words PM Modi, Amit Shah, and JP Nadda to let me be the chief minister even though I was over 75 years,” said Yediyurappa. “There is no question of political retirement for any reason, I’m with the karyakartas and the people.”Arun Singh, incharge of party affairs in Karnataka, along with Pradhan and others held the crucial meeting of the MLAs in Bengaluru. Bommai was informed about the party leadership’s decision to appoint him as the CM about half an hour before the legislative party meeting, the second leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/basavaraj-bommai-to-be-new-karnataka-cm-101627410920670.html
28-07-2021||India||Unesco declares Harappan city in Gujarat a world heritage site||The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) on Tuesday added Dholavira, a Harappan-era city in Gujarat, to its list of world heritage sites, making it the 40th such Indian location on the list.Gujarat now has four world heritage sites — Dholavira, Champaner near Pavagadh, Rani ki Vav in Patan and the Historic City of Ahmedabad.World heritage sites are protected under international convention and selected for their unique cultural significance by Unesco, which also provides “emergency assistance for World Heritage sites in immediate danger”.“Dholavira: A Harappan City, in India, just inscribed on the @UNESCO #WorldHeritage List. Congratulations!” Unesco tweeted on Tuesday.According to Unesco, today what is seen as a fortified quadrangular city set in harsh arid land was once a thriving metropolis for 1200 years (3000 BCE-1800 BCE) and had an access to the sea prior to decrease in sea level.Earlier on Sunday, the 13th century Ramappa temple in Telangana’s Warangal was included in the list during the 44th session of Unesco’s World Heritage Committee.“Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple received its inscription as a World Heritage Site on 25 July and Dholavira: A Harrapan City was inscribed on the World Heritage List today, 27 July, bringing India’s number of World Heritage sites to 40,” Unesco said in a statement.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “absolutely delighted”, adding that Dholavira was an important urban centre and an important linkage with the country’s past.“Absolutely delighted by this news. Dholavira was an important urban centre and is one of our most important linkages with our past. It is a must visit, especially for those interested in history, culture and archaeology,” he said in a tweet.“As CM of Gujarat, I had the opportunity to work on aspects relating to heritage conservation and restoration in Dholavira. Our team also worked to create tourism-friendly infrastructure there,” he said.Newly appointed Union minister for culture G Kishan Reddy said India has now become a member of the “Super-40 club”. “It gives immense pride to share with my fellow Indians that #Dholavira is now the 40th treasure in India to be given @UNESCO’s World Heritage Inscription. Another feather in India’s cap as we now enter the Super-40 club for World Heritage Site inscriptions,” he tweeted.“Since 2014, India has added 10 new World Heritage sites - one fourth of our total sites. This shows PM @narendramodi’s steadfast commitment in promoting Indian culture, heritage and the Indian way of life,” the minister said.The current session of the World Heritage Committee, being held virtually between July 16 and July 31, is being chaired from Fuzhou in China.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unesco-declares-harappan-city-in-gujarat-a-world-heritage-site-101627410920119.html
28-07-2021||India||Discontent brewing since Oct escalated on Monday||Monday’s violent clash along the Assam-Mizoram border that claimed seven lives, including those of six policemen, and left 41 others injured on the Assam side was the culmination of simmering discontent between the two states since October 2020, when skirmishes left several injured on both sides and resulted in a blockade of NH-306, the lifeline to Mizoram, for 12 days.Though it wasn’t the first time violence has erupted along the 164km boundary between both northeastern states, Monday’s incident was the bloodiest till date. The border dispute between both states is nearly five decades long and started after Mizoram, which was earlier a part of Assam, was declared a Union territory in 1972 and gained statehood in 1987. While Assam claims Mizoram has encroached its “constitutional boundary”, the latter maintains the area belongs to it.Three districts of Assam, Cachar, Hailakandi, and Karimganj, share borders with three districts of Mizoram, Kolasib, Mamit, and Aizawl. The main bone of contention is a 509 square mile stretch of the inner line reserve forest on the interstate boundary that Mizoram claims as its own. The origin of the dispute lies in two different notifications issued during the British era.Mizoram wants delineation of the border based on a 1875 notification framed under Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 that sought to demarcate the Lushai Hills (the earlier name of Mizoram) from the plains of Cachar (in Assam) and also introduced the inner line permit regime (ILP) that regulates entry of outsiders to the area, now Mizoram, even today. Assam follows a 1933 notification through which delimitation of the earlier boundary between Lushai Hills and the former princely state of Manipur was modified.As expected, there have been allegations and counter allegations on what ignited Monday’s clashes.Mizoram’s home minister Lalchamliana issued a statement in the evening accusing Assam police personnel of entering the state and indulging in violence. The statement added that Mizoram police retaliated after tear-gas canisters and grenades were hurled by Assam’s security forces.Late at night, Assam responded by issuing a statement that blamed Mizoram of breaching existing agreements and status quo on the border and accusing police of the neighbouring state of firing on its security forces and civilians using light machine guns (LMGs).Earlier in the day, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma indulged in a blame game on Twitter. It ended with intervention of union home minister Amit Shah, after which the two CMs talked over phone, agreed to maintain status quo and work for peace.Besides Mizoram, Assam has border disputes with Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Assam shares an 804km-long boundary with Arunachal Pradesh. Though there was no dispute initially, over the years allegations of residents of one state encroaching land on the other have led to disputes and violence. A suit has been pending in Supreme Court since 1989 on the issue. Earlier this month, Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu had expressed hope of solving border dispute with Assam out of court.Nagaland and Assam share a 434 km boundary and a dispute that’s going on for over five decades. Both states have refused to accept recommendations of two commissions set up by Centre to solve the issue and a suit is pending in Supreme Court on the issue since 1988. There have been several violent clashes on the issue. Over 100 people have been killed, most of them on the Assam side, in attacks by armed men from Nagaland in separate incidents in 1979, 1985 and 2014.The Assam-Meghalaya border dispute is at least four decades old and there is contention between both states at 12 points along the 733km boundary they share. Several rounds of talks have failed to solve the issue. Last week, the CMs of Assam and Meghalaya met and agreed to use a pragmatic approach to sort their boundary problems.The long-standing border disputes were expected to change with change in power equations in the region over the past five years. Since 2016, when a BJP-led coalition first formed government in Assam, the Congress has been virtually wiped out from the region.The BJP is heading governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and is part of the ruling coalition in Meghalaya and Nagaland. In Mizoram, Mizo National Front (MNF), which is a constituent of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led front of anti-Congress parties in the region formed in 2016, is in power.Monday’s incident came two days after Amit Shah interacted with CMs of all eight northeastern states in Shillong where the pending interstate border disputes were also deliberated upon. The Union home minister urged all states to resolve their issues before the 2024 general election. Significantly, during the 4th NEDA conclave held in Guwahati in September 2019, Shah urged all chief ministers of the region to address all border disputes in a timebound manner before India celebrates 75 years of Independence in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discontent-brewing-since-oct-escalated-on-monday-101627410200031.html
28-07-2021||India||BJP members boycott IT committee meeting||Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday staged a walkout from a meeting of the information technology standing committee led by Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, people familiar with the matter said.“When the House is functioning, how can meetings be scheduled at the same time? It is our job as MPs to help the Parliament function, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said. “I had raised the issue during the last session as well,” he said.BJP MPs came to the meetings to lodge their protests and left without signing the register, said the person quoted above. “Over nine members were present, which is the base number needed for quorum and for meetings to continue,” the person added.Dubey added that members from the ruling party will not be attending Wednesday’s meeting either, wherein the panel is set to discuss the controversial Pegasus Project with the government. He said that the agenda for the meeting was not discussed with the members beforehand. The person mentioned above, however, said that all procedures and protocols were followed before the meeting was scheduled.The Pegasus project reports claim that the Israeli spyware was used to infiltrate the phones of activists, journalists, opposition leaders and even the government’s own ministers. The Centre has vehemently denied the charges, with Union minister for electronics and information technology, whose name was on the list, saying that reports were completely devoid of facts. The opposition has sought a probe into the allegations.The panel will hear from the minister of home affairs, electronics and information technology and communications on Wednesday regarding the issue which has become a political flashpoint.Meanwhile, industry representatives, such as actor and director Kamal Haasan and members of the Producers Guild and India Broadcasting and Digital Foundation informed the panel that they had not been consulted before the amendments to the Cinematograph Act were made. The person mentioned above said that the industry representatives were “aghast that the government could have such revisionary powers”.The amendments propose that the Central government can ask the chairperson of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to review the approval given to a movie on the grounds of sovereignty, integrity of India and threat to public order. The amendment has caused outrage among the industry, with producers, directors and artistes writing to the government that the move will stifle creative expression.A second person familiar with the matter said that overall there was sense that constructive and productive discussion was needed. “It is clear that there is need for further consideration,” the person said. “The ministry discussed the issue comprehensively.”The second person said that four key issues were raised Tharoor at the meeting, the question of the government having retrospective power for review and its financial implications, the new age classifications which put the onus on the exhibitor, the issue of censorship versus classification and who is allowed to ask for a movie to the be taken. “The power for retrospective review was contested across the industry,” the person said. “As for the committee that recommends this, it was suggested that it not only have members from the government but from the film fraternity as well.”The first person added that the ministry argued that since India is vast and diverse country, exceptions need to be made for public good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-members-boycott-it-committee-meeting-101627410080071.html
28-07-2021||India||10 parties meet to form Pegasus issue strategy||Ten opposition parties, at meeting on Tuesday, decided to move “joint adjournment notices in the Lok Sabha” as a part of a united strategy to counter the government on the Pegasus snooping row.“We have now decided that there will be better coordination among all of us as the government doesn’t want to discuss the matter at all. We will now be giving joint adjournment notices in Lok Sabha,’’ said one of the leaders, who attended the meeting, requesting anonymity.The meeting was attended by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham’s TR Baalu and Kanimozhi, Nationalist Congress Party’s Supriya Sule, Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant, Hasnain Masoodi of National Conference, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Ritesh Pandey, Kerala Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Revolutionary Socialist Party and Indian Union Muslim League.The Pegasus row erupted last Sunday before the beginning of the current monsoon session after an international investigative consortium reported that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were potentially targeted by Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software, Pegasus.Earlier in the day, Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, speaking to the reporters outside the Parliament, said “The Telegraph Act says permission is needed for the surveillance and added that a Supreme Court monitored probe should be carried out so that the truth about the alleged hacking could finally come out.”Kharge alleged dictatorship prevails in the country. “(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi is not ready to solve issues in a democratic manner. We are ready for discussions.”The government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the spyware but has rejected reports of snooping..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-parties-meet-to-form-pegasus-issue-strategy-101627410020528.html
28-07-2021||India||PM Modi tells party to ‘expose Oppn’ over House disruptions||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday told his party colleagues to “expose” the Congress-led opposition for disrupting Parliament in, what he said, was their attempt to derail the government’s efforts to discuss important issues such as the Covid pandemic, and to explain to people that the opposition hadn’t contributed to fighting the pandemic, people familiar with the matter said.“The PM told the MPs that the onus is on us to fight the challenge as the opposition is only interested in disruption and how even after the house is adjourned they resort to abusing,” a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker said after Modi addressed the party’s parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday.This is the second time since the monsoon session began on July 19 that Modi has blamed the opposition for disruptions and asked BJP lawmakers to publicise it. The first week was a near-complete wash-out, mostly over protests over the Pegasus snooping controversy and farm laws, but the government managed to get Lok Sabha to pass two bills amid the din.Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh blamed the government for not taking up important issues. He tweeted, “The entire Opposition is united. Parliament isn’t a forum to pass Govt Bills without debate and discussion. This is happening because Govt is just not ready to discuss urgent public issues like Pegasus and repeal of the black farm laws, despite repeated notices.”A second BJP functionary said Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya told MPs that India is on track to begin vaccination for children. “He said the vaccination drive for children will roll out by September. He also said that India was among the countries that were at the forefront of the war against the pandemic; India sanctioned ₹900 crore to undertake research for vaccines,” he said.BJP president JP Nadda also said that over the course of the next one month, 750 million people will be administered Covid-19 vaccines, said the second person. India has so far vaccinated over 345 million people.PM’s Independence Day planPM Modi also urged all MPs to think of innovative programmes to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence. He has instructed them to ensure that at least two people from the party spend 75 hours in 75 villages of each assembly constituency to reach out to the people.“He told the MPs to visualise the India that they want to see in 2047,” said a third functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodi-tells-party-to-expose-oppn-over-house-disruptions-101627410019980.html
28-07-2021||India||Day 6 of monsoon session: Oppn protests continue to disrupt House||Parliamentary proceedings continued to be disrupted for the sixth day on Tuesday after opposition parties continued to block proceedings to demand that the government agree to a discussion on the Pegasus snooping controversy, provoking presiding officers of the two Houses to repeatedly express their displeasure at the conduct of the members.“All of you should introspect if this is what we make of our exalted parliamentary democracy. I will never accept any such dictation by anybody. Dictation or dramatics are not going to be accepted by the Chair, whoever is in the Chair,” Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said amid sloganeering when ministers were laying down government notifications on the table of the House in the Rajya Sabha.In the Lok Sabha, speaker Om Birla told Opposition MPs: “Don’t compete for sloganeering in the House. You should compete to raise the problems of the people. But you are competing in sloganeering. Remember, the people are watching you”.The reprimand, however, did not have much of an impact on the Opposition which intends to work closely with each other to escalate their protests over the alleged use of Israeli firm NSO’s software on Indian citizens and the three farm laws.“If the opposition members have even the slightest regard for the farmers, they should sit in their places peacefully. You should raise your issue through these questions and listen to the reply of the government,” Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on the opposition strategy of disruption.The din in the House not only hurts the dignity of the house but also reveals the true character of the opposition parties in the context of farmers, he said.The BJP’s deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi later told reporters that the government held talks with the Opposition on Monday night and Tuesday morning to resolve the issue. “Government is ready for discussion. But the opposition is not ready, they are running away from a discussion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-6-of-monsoon-session-oppn-protests-continue-to-disrupt-house-101627409959996.html
28-07-2021||India||Standoff, stone pelting: How the Assam-Mizoram clash unfolded||On Sunday, a day prior to Monday’s violent clashes along Assam-Mizoram border, Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga’s convoy passed through national highway (NH 306), which connects the two states. He was returning to Aizawl a day after attending a meeting of union home minister Amit Shah with chief ministers of all states in the Northeast at Meghalaya’s capital Shillong. On his return journey, Zoramthanga halted briefly along the route on the Assam side and was greeted by deputy commissioner of Cachar district in Assam, Keerthi Jalli, and the district superintendent of police VC Nimbalkar.Less than 24 hours later, violent clashes, which both Assam and Mizoram claim to have been started by the other side, killed killed 7 persons including 6 policemen and injured 41 others on the Assam side. Superintendent of police Nimbalkar was among those injured. The IPS officer, who sustained grievous bullet injuries on his lower body, was airlifted to Mumbai by an Indian Air Force aircraft on Tuesday for treatment.Assam shares 164 km of border with Mizoram and though both states have a long pending dispute regarding their boundary it intensified last year when some miscreants bombed a government school in Khulicherra area in Assam’s territory. Local residents claimed that it was done by Mizoram, which, in turn, claimed that Assam government personnel had forcefully constructed schools and RCC bridges on their land. Mizoram also stopped several top officials of Assam government as well as the central government from visiting those places.On Monday morning Assam police officials captured a camp near Lailapur border which was reportedly built last year by India Reserve (IR) battalion of Mizoram Police. According to locals on the Assam side, the number of Assam police personnel was much larger than the IR battalion. But when the news about presence of Assam troops broke in Vairengte in Mizoram, hundreds of locals started gathering at the spot. As per Assam government officials, around 11:30 in the morning, a group of people started pelting stones from Mizoram’s side. Cachar deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli’s car was attacked with stones but she managed to escape unharmed. Other police officers immediately rushed to the spot and more forces were called.According to journalists present at the site on the Assam side of the border, stone pelting continued from both sides for several hours till the firing started. Cachar DC Jalli along with SP Nimbalkar and other Assam officials were at the camp near Lailapur border. Around 4:00 pm, superintendent of police of Kolasib district in Mizoram came to the camp and Jalli gave him her chair. But 20 minutes later, as the officials of the two states were discussing the issue, three tear gas canisters fell on the road on the Assam side; soon the place was full of toxic smoke. Few minutes later there was the sound of guns being fired. Police personnel, local residents and journalists ran for cover. Few people sustained injuries and were rushed to nearby government health centre , according to eye-witnesses. They were immediately referred to Silchar Medical College and Hospital (SMCH) in Assam.Several journalists from Assam who were covering the developments were injured , but not by bullets. Internet and phone connections remained disrupted at the site for several minutes and the place felt like a war-zone. Local residents on Assam side were armed with stones and sticks, but not guns. They claim the attackers from Mizoram were armed with guns.The firing continued for at least half-an-hour. A 25-year-old Assam resident Fajar Ali who sustained an air gun injury on his right hand. “I was near border area when people from Mizoram started firing. We tried to run away but a bullet hit my right arm and I fell on ground.” Later in the evening it became clear that five Assam police personnel and a civilian had been killed in the incident.The Mizoram version of how the events unfolded is different. The state home minister Lalchamliana in a statement issued on Monday blamed Assam police of entering Mizoram territory and indulging in violence. It stated that around 200 Assam police personnel came to Vairengte in Mizoram ariund 11:30 am on Monday and forcibly crossed the duty post manned by CRPF personnel and also damaged several vehicles that were travelling along the National Highway between Vairengte and Lailapur.“Upon learning of the arson committed by Assam Police, residents of Vairengte town, Kolasib District proceeded to the site to inquire. These unarmed civilians were assaulted by Assam Police by lathi charging them and firing tear gas, thereby causing injuries to several civilians,” read the statement. “The confrontation continued and a volley of tear gas canisters and grenades were launched at Mizoram Police followed by firing from Assam side at around 4:50 p.m. Mizoram Police responded spontaneously by firing back at Assam Police.”Talking to HT over phone from Aizawl on Tuesday, Lalchamliana reiterated that Assam police personnel and civilians entered Mizoram and forcibly removed residents. He added that firing started from the Assam side and Mizoram security personnel retaliated in self-defence. “Assam police personnel came heavily armed and were the first to open fire. Our personnel, who were also armed with automatic weapons and light machine guns (LMGs), responded to the attack. Whatever has happened in unfortunate.”Mizoram information and public relations minister Lalruatkima who was stationed at the border told PTI on Tuesday that the central para-military forces posted on both sides of the border between the two states didn’t act to defuse the tension. Following a Centre’s directive last year, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp is stationed on Mizoram side of the border and a Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) post is located on the Assam side as neutral forces and to take measures of situation between both sides went out of hand. “The bloody clash could have been averted had CRPF prevented Assam police from entering Mizoram territory ,” PTI quoted Lalruatkima as saying.On Tuesday, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma visited Silchar and met with those injured in Monday’s attack. He also paid tribute to the five police personnel killed. Assam has announced a three-day state mourning for them. Sarma reiterated the claim that firing started from Mizoram side and announced compensation for family members of those killed and injured.Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana said that the situation along the border was peaceful and there have been no new developments on Tuesday. He informed that on Wednesday, chief secretaries and police chiefs of both states would meet union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla at New Delhi to discuss Monday’s incident and the border dispute.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/standoff-stone-pelting-how-the-assam-mizoram-clash-unfolded-101627409839969.html
28-07-2021||Today's||West Asia: The parable of two Mohammeds and what it means for India||The blink-and-you-missed-it meeting on July 19 in Riyadh between crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) of Abu Dhabi was an event as banal as it was profound, depending upon where one looked.At a superficial level, it was de facto leaders of two neighbouring states meeting to exchange Eid al-Adha greetings. However, as the two have not been seen together in public since November 2019, this was more than a festive gesture. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have plenty of duality in their ties. While they have a lot in common, there are also significant differences. They are largely absolute Sunni monarchies with a low threshold for political discourse, be it Arab nationalism, the Arab Spring, the Muslim Brotherhood or the export of Iran’s Islamic revolution. They are both pro-West, oil-based economies, professing free market, with a strong role for the public sector. Although sharing the long-term goal of economic diversification from oil, they also realise that global oil consumption may peak soon and are busy ramping up production before the value of the commodity erodes.Ironically, several of these commonalities have, in turn, triggered their geo-political and geo-economic competition. Till 2019, MbS and MbZ pursued a common agenda of curbing the al-Houthis of Yemen and isolating Qatar. However, lately, mutual differences have stymied both these campaigns: The UAE withdrew its forces from Yemen in 2019 and armed a separatist militia in the south, complicating Saudi’s exit strategy from an unwinnable conflict now in its sixth year. While the campaign to isolate Qatar was led by the UAE in 2018, the Saudis called it off at the al-Ula Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit earlier this year — an event MbZ pointedly did not attend.Meanwhile, the UAE has also pursued an aggressive foreign policy marked by normalising ties with Israel, warming up towards Iran and supporting rebels in Libya. This unilateralism has upended the Kingdom’s relatively staid foreign policy.Lately, their economic competition has also been driven by mutual antipathy. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and the Arab world’s largest economy, decided that from 2024 it would award government contracts, under MbS’s $2 trillion Vision 2030 only to those multinationals with regional headquarters in the Kingdom, cajoling them to relocate mostly from Dubai. Riyadh has also recently imposed several restrictions on the movement of goods and persons from the UAE. On other hand, the UAE demanded a higher oil production quota earlier this month, disrupting the Saudi-Russia OPEC+ consensus. This led to a rare bilateral row in public. The revised production-sharing agreement was reached only on the eve of MbZ’s visit to Riyadh.Against this backdrop, MbZ’s dramatic journey to Riyadh last week acquires significance. While the anodyne press statements offer scant clues about its outcome, the effusive public praise of the Kingdom and MbS by MbZ, and the laconic replies from the other side, hinted that the visitor was on a fence-mending mission. Given the deliberative style of Saudi diplomacy, the bilateral space needs to be watched over the next few months for a reset in their ties.A genuine MbS-MbZ reconciliation can have profound implications. It can reduce the Gulf’s geopolitical volatility and stabilise the global oil market by allowing OPEC+ to expand production gradually. A winding down of the Abu Dhabi-Riyadh competition can revive the GCC, allowing it to unlock longstanding regional stalemates such as Yemen, Afghanistan and Iran. It can also prevent some players from pursuing a divide-and-rule strategy in the Gulf.India has growing bilateral ties with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE, our third- and fourth-largest trading partners and among our top five oil suppliers. Taken together, in 2019-20, they accounted for $90 billion of trade and nearly $24 billion in remittances for India from our five-million-strong diaspora. They have also emerged as major investors in India, often acting in concert, particularly in the oil sector. Their coming together can only help our attempts to leverage the growing economic ties with these two neighbours in the post-Covid-19 era.Mahesh Sachdev is a former ambassadorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/west-asia-the-parable-of-two-mohammeds-and-what-it-means-for-india-101627473228940.html
28-07-2021||Today's||To reopen schools, India must go local||For nearly 17 months now, schools in much of India have been shut. The psychological, developmental and educational costs of this prolonged closure are being felt in every home in the country and research is pointing to its long-term impact.Yet, policy action and public demand for reopening schools have been conspicuously absent. Given the costs of prolonged school closure, the issue for debate ought to be “how”, not “when”. In the last few months, after the deadly second wave, decision-makers and businesses have found ways to reopen malls, gymnasiums and factories. It is inexcusable that schools and children have been ignored.Opening schools is not trivial. The safety of students, parents and teachers has to be prioritised and confidence needs to be built about the ability to maintain safety protocols. To do this, school actors and parents have to have a dialogue. With pandemic-related uncertainties looming large, schools will need to be better equipped for flexible and quick decision-making. But doing this right will require innovative policymaking that enables local action, ground-level engagement and a shift away from the current centralised, one-size-fits-all approach that shapes education governance. At a minimum, there are three distinct policy steps that need to be taken.First, leverage parent-teacher engagement in mission mode and make parents partners in reopening. Engaging parents and ensuring schools are accountable to them has been a failed aspiration in India’s education policy despite setting up parent-led school management committed under the right to education law.An unexpected silver lining from prolonged school closure and the shift to remote and distance learning is that schools, teachers and parents are, for the first time, in regular contact regarding children’s’ learning. The 2020 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey found that nearly one-third of enrolled students had received some learning material either through WhatsApp or via direct contact with teachers in the week preceding the survey. Several states such as Punjab and Delhi have activated parent-teacher meetings. Himachal Pradesh launched a door-to-door campaign encouraging teachers to visit students’ homes. These nascent engagements are a unique opportunity for institutionalising parent-teacher engagement and opening up a dialogue on reopening and continued learning.But to do this, the Centre and state governments will need to encourage innovation and empower school committees to take decisions in consonance with the local administration. One possibility, now that the second wave has ebbed, is to launch a month-long, nationwide mission, where parents meet teachers in schools once a week on rotation. This will bring parents and teachers into schools and build confidence. It will also allow parents of children who do not have access to online facilities to re-engage. Crucially, schools can use this as an opportunity to assess student’s academic needs and prepare a new pedagogy for when schools reopen. Once these interactions are formalised, school management committees can develop Covid-19 protocols that are realistic and aligned with their resources, capabilities and local realities. Second, and relatedly for parents, committees and schools to be partners, policymakers will have to recognise that decisions on school opening (and closure) are best taken in response to ground realities. Therefore, decision-making has to be decentralised and made as local as possible.Covid-19 is here to stay. Schools have to be prepared for three possible scenarios — a strict lockdown; partial movement where teachers can attend schools even as students are kept away; and when all restrictions are lifted and schools can reopen. How schools organise themselves, whether they open partially or fully, to respond to these realities has to be localised.After all, cases surge at different times across geographies. Governments — both in states and at the Centre — have an important role in devising appropriate protocols and guidelines, coordinating across districts and above all, building public confidence through careful and continuous communication. But without decentralised decision-making, this will not be achieved.Third, genuine decentralisation will require greater financial resources at the school level. This is not about more money but about inverting the pyramid so that schools can direct expenditures according to their identified needs and priorities. In the current schema, schools have little spending autonomy. They receive an annual grant. But this amounts to a mere 3-4% of the budget for elementary schools and just about 1% for secondary schools and can be used only for regular maintenance.Empowering schools to make decisions will require giving them greater expenditure discretion. This is also a unique opportunity to involve local governments in school functioning. Under the 15th Finance Commission grants, local governments are mandated to receive a health-specific grant. Flexibility ought to be introduced to empower local governments to use these funds for putting Covid-19 protocols in place in schools.If government schools lead the way, the path for private schools to restart, safely and securely will be opened. India cannot afford to ignore the costs of prolonged school closure. Local innovation with parents as partners is the path forward. The time to act is now.Yamini Aiyar is the president and chief executive of CPR.

28-07-2021||Today's||How NEP can transform higher education in India||India today has over 1,000 Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs), including over 150 of national importance. Over the years, it has also become a hub of scientific research.HEIs have shown a consistent growth in both the quality and the quantity of research in the past decade. India currently ranks third globally in terms of the total research output, accounting for 5.31% of the total of research publications. Of three aspects — education, knowledge generation (research and development) and innovation — Indian HEIs have performed very well, in relative terms, in the first two aspects, but lack on the innovation front.It is striking that universities in the United States (US), in the early 19th century, were in a similar state. Just as Indian research primarily follows on the research taking place in the West today, US universities in the 19th century were primarily following the well-established universities in Germany and the United Kingdom, which were considered pioneers at that time for research in natural sciences, religion and theology.The watershed moment for US universities was the introduction of Morrill Act in 1862 when land-grant universities were allowed to be set up that focused on local requirements. Most leading US universities of today were set up as land-grant universities and achieved their eminence by focusing on finding solutions to the problems faced by society.India found its Morrill moment with the approval of New Education Policy (NEP) exactly a year ago, on July 29, 2020. NEP is expected to transform the landscape of higher education in India by making HEIs work on “solutions to the problems” rather than “solutions looking for a problem” in the following specific ways.One, Indian academia has traditionally been focused on R&D without much emphasis on relevance and delivery. The establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF) is expected to connect our academia with ministries and industry and fund research that is relevant to local needs. Under the framework of NRF, each government ministry, be it central or state, is expected to allocate separate funds for research.NRF, therefore, is expected to pose well-defined problems to the researchers, so that they can find solutions in a goal-oriented and timebound manner. Indian institutions have the potential to do so, whether it is Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) or Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), as they have done in the last few years, or our HEIs during the pandemic. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi focused on problems related to virus detection, protection and treatment, launched the world’s most affordable RT-PCR and antigen-based testing kits and developed export-quality personal protective equipment (PPEs) through the startup ecosystem. Covid-19 technologies developed at IIT-Delhi have touched over 10 million people and helped the nation fight the pandemic. Two, in order to unleash the technology development potential of HEIs, our institutions need to not only become multi-disciplinary in their scope and offerings, but also collaborate among themselves. Bringing “unlike” minds together in terms of disciplines (multi-disciplinary schools and centres), cultures (international programmes) and attitudes (academia-industry collaborations) is the need of the hour. This is required for unleashing the creative potential of researchers at our diversified set of HEIs. Multi-disciplinary universities, as envisaged in NEP, rightly emphasises on this aspect.Three, with the goal of increasing the gross enrollment ratio (GER) from the current 26% to 50% by 2035, India needs to not only open new HEIs and universities but also scale-up existing HEIs. This massive expansion will not only require additional financial resources but also calls for a new governance model. It is no coincidence that NEP speaks of achieving graded autonomy for HEIs. Over time, independent boards will manage the HEIs with active participation from alumni and experts from academia, research and industry.Four, NEP is expected to bring in significant funding. For higher education, for the first time, government promises a budget allocation for education as a fixed percentage of Gross Domestic Product at 6%. This will be a game changer for HEIs.And finally, under NEP 2020, Indian HEIs will focus on 3Is – interdisciplinary research, industry connect and internationalisation, the three pillars needed to elevate our institutions to global standards. Until now, Indian HEIs lacked international diversity and remained predominantly local; they hired only Indian faculty and trained only domestic talent. The lack of international faculty and students in Indian elite institutions is one reason for the poor rankings of Indian institutions. NEP has enabled mechanisms for Indian HEIs, such as IITs, to venture out and open international campuses across the world. This will not only increase their international footprint but also improve their perception globally.Indian academia welcomed NEP and embraced it with enthusiasm when it was launched. In the past year, institutions have also taken concrete steps for the implementation of NEP. The results will be visible soon.V Ramgopal Rao is the director of IIT-DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-nep-can-transform-higher-education-in-india-101627470511761.html
28-07-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | There’s more to losing weight than counting calories||The world is getting fatter. It is a problem that humans have not had to face for most of our history. Our ancestors spent much of their lives foraging or farming food. They were subject to the vagaries of nature. Famines were common. Industrialisation pulled many people out of poverty and made energy-rich food readily available. For most of the world, these changes happened in the last century. Our brains have not evolved to deal with modern food choices and lifestyle changes in this time. As a result, there are approximately two billion adults who are currently overweight. Childhood obesity is on the rise globally too.The standard view of obesity is that if you eat more than you metabolise, then you put on weight. Or in other words, more calories ingested than are burned leads to weight gain. And this is by and large correct. But it is also simplistic because metabolism isn’t just defined by calories.What kind of food calories are we tied to, when we eat, and how good our bodies are at breaking down (and storing) the biological molecules of food play a role in determining how successful we are in maintaining or changing body weight.Also Read | Dieting impacts a person’s energy balance by altering gut microbiome: StudyOur body shape is also determined by a large extent by the genes we inherit and our gut bacteria. Even if you set a table for one, you never eat alone. Your body has around 40 trillion microbes, many of which are in your gut. In fact, there may be as many or more bacteria in your body as there are “human” cells. When you eat, they eat with you.Our bodies also tend to find metabolic equilibrium so it becomes difficult to make radical changes. This is a likely reason why children quickly put on weight they have lost once they recover from illness.There’s also a growing body of research that indicates when we eat influences our ability to metabolise food because of the activity of hormones and bacteria in our gut. Staying up and eating late compared to the natural light-dark cycle results in a higher risk of increased body weight and glucose intolerance (including pre-diabetes).Scientists have known for a few years that late-night work is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Even if you eat the same food with the same calories, your body may not metabolise the food the same way. So, it is probably not advisable to eat the biggest meal of the day late at night or raid the refrigerator for energy-rich midnight snacks.In his new book, Why Calories Don’t Count: How We Got the Science of Weight Loss Wrong, Giles Yeo, an obesity researcher at Cambridge University, mentions how calorie counting is misused. Yeo is quick to point out that calories do matter in terms of what and how much you eat. A calorie is a unit that defines energy. If you eat twice as much of the same food, then your body will obviously have to figure out what to do with the extra energy.But the obsession with counting calories to control weight obscures the fact that not all calories are used by the body the same way. Some energy-dense foods such as sugars and fats — we always seem to have room for dessert — give us a spike while others take longer to digest. Likewise, the amount of energy that is available to us from different foods with the same calories will differ.It takes energy to break apart food and that number is not reflected in nutritional labels. Simply counting calories for different foods gives us an estimate of the total energy we might get from them. Yeo gives the specific example of proteins, which take more energy to metabolize than sugars. For every 100 calories of protein eaten, around 30 are used up in breaking down and absorbing the protein. That leaves 70 calories that are available. The conversion rate of proteins is different from other kinds of nutrients. Not all calories are equal.Yeo’s example reminded me of a blind spot in another field. There is an emphasis on lower carbon emissions of electric vehicles compared to vehicles running on fossil fuels. But there is a cost to extracting the energy sources that produce the electricity that often gets overlooked. In other words, the source of the electricity used by an electric vehicle matters — while overall emissions might be lower than that for a petrol vehicle, it will be substantially lower for wind and hydro-generated electricity compared to coal and natural gas.What is becoming amply clear is we need to broaden our view beyond the standard model of obesity. We need to take a holistic approach to weight control, because there’s more to it than just counting calories.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From FictionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/scientifically-speaking-there-s-more-to-losing-weight-than-counting-calories-101627449448852.html
28-07-2021||Editorials||The Supreme Court is right on begging||The Supreme Court (SC), on Tuesday, refused to ban begging and issued a notice to the Centre and Delhi government, seeking their responses within two weeks on a petition requesting Covid-19 vaccination and rehabilitation of beggars. The SC bench observed that it is a socio-economic problem and people are forced to beg to eke out their livelihood due to the absence of education and employment. The court’s observations are in line with past judicial observations. In 2018, the Delhi High Court struck down a law that made begging in the Capital a crime, saying that criminalising begging “violates the fundamental rights of some of the most vulnerable people”.India has no federal law on begging and destitution. About 20 states have adopted the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, which carries a penalty of detention of three to 10 years in beggar homes. Activists argue that it is an oppressive law, and allows the police to detain or arrest anyone who is poor, including nomadic communities, street performers and migrant workers.While traditionally, seeking alms was an accepted way of life in India, a shift in mindset towards the criminalisation of begging occurred during colonial rule. To the Victorians, beggars represented laziness, moral degeneration and a threat to public health. Independent India absorbed this colonial attitude. This approach lacks empathy and absolves the welfare State of failing to provide citizens with their basic minimum requirements — food, housing, education and health. Let the SC’s observations mark a new conversation on begging, and how to improve the lives of India’s destitute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-supreme-court-is-right-on-begging-101627471711972.html
28-07-2021||Editorials||Time to break the stalemate||It has been eight working days since the monsoon session of Parliament began. It started out with the hope that both the treasury and Opposition benches have a common interest in a functional session. The government wanted to push through its legislative agenda and was prepared to address the issue of the management of the second wave of Covid-19 this summer. The Opposition saw an opportunity to hold the government accountable on public health, price rise and national security. But with the Pegasus revelations storming the Indian public sphere, the script changed. The Opposition has now demanded that unless there is a full discussion in both Houses on Pegasus and an enquiry, it won’t allow Parliament to run. The government has issued two perfunctory statements on the issue but doesn’t want a discussion. And so there is a stalemate.For the sake of India’s parliamentary democracy, it is crucial to break the stalemate. In principle, the Opposition is right. The fact that the numbers of key political figures, business executives, bureaucrats, activists and journalists were on a potential surveillance list, and some of their phone devices were found to be infected with Pegasus — a military-grade spyware — is cause for concern. It throws up questions about who was culpable, what it means for the right to privacy, liberty, dignity, and indeed, the very idea of democracy. Parliament is the best forum to discuss the issue — and it is indeed beyond the purview of just the information technology minister to address it.The government is in a bind. It cannot admit to procuring and using Pegasus — given that hacking is illegal in India and it will raise difficult questions about its democratic credentials. It cannot deny using Pegasus — given that this means a foreign government was possibly deploying it against Indian citizens. And so it has relied on a defence based on how all interception and surveillance in India has to be legally sanctioned. But the fact is that at some point, if not in the House, then in the courts where a bunch of petitions have been lined up, the government will have to give a detailed response. The government may think that the disruption is costing it little; it is still able to get legislative business through amid the din and is able to evade more uncomfortable electoral issues such as price rise. But the spirit of democracy dictates that the Opposition must be allowed its say, even if the government has its way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/time-to-break-the-stalemate-101627471351986.html
