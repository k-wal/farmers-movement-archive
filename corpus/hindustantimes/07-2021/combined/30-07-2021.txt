30-07-2021||Delhi||GST amendment Bill passed in Delhi assembly||The Delhi Assembly on Friday passed the Goods and Services (Amendment) Bill 2021, which the government claimed is aimed at smoothening the taxpaying process, strengthening accountability and minimising room for tax evasions, amid protests from the BJP legislators.“One of the key features of this amendment is the removal of the requirement of compulsory submission of audited annual accounts and reconciliation statements for the registered taxpayers, which had earlier made traders dependent on chartered and cost accountants. Further, in case of detention, seizure of goods..., the goods can now be released on the payment of penalty, as against the earlier practice of paying up the tax too. Third, the interest charged in case of delay in filing GST was previously charged on gross amount which has now been changed retrospectively (from 1.7.2017) to the net amount,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who tabled the Bill on Friday -- the last day of the Monsoon session of the Assembly.When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators in the House protested that they were not consulted about it, Sisodia said that these amendments were approved in the meeting of the GST Council, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, held in March this year.“There have been small changes in 15 sections in the Bill, and Schedule II, paragraph 7 is being omitted from the Bill. These changes have been incurred after looking at the experiences and receiving feedback of the business people and these amendments have been approved in the 39th GST council meeting after wide deliberations,” said Sisodia.He further said, “To stop tax evasion, the GST council has ascertained that attachment of property and bank accounts is permitted not only of the taxable person but also of the other beneficiaries. This amendment is targeted at those individuals who set up fake firms under names of other individuals and get away with claiming taxes.”The Bill was eventually passed with a majority in the 70-member assembly which has 62 AAP legislators and eight from BJP.Bed and breakfastOn Friday, the Delhi assembly also passed a Bill allowing registration of “bed and breakfast” establishments within 30 days, as against an earlier time frame of up to 90 days.“In the light of the pandemic, the declining tourism sector will get a boost from these positive changes in the ‘Bed and Breakfast scheme’ of the Delhi government. Under the existing ‘Bed and Breakfast scheme’, 1,630 rooms in 347 houses are registered so far in Delhi. The registration process for any house currently takes up to 90 days under the scheme. With this Bill, we aim to reduce it to a maximum of 30 days,” said Sisodia, who tabled the Bill.He further said, “The number (of bed and breakfast facilities) will increase once the scheme is implemented and boost tourism. House owners can now get their certificates online. There is no need to go to the government offices for this purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gstamendment-bill-passed-in-delhi-assembly-101627669752615.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Longest serving MLA from Maharashtra Ganpatrao Deshmukh passes away||Former minister and Maharashtra’s longest serving elected representative Ganpatrao Deshmukh passed away on Friday at the age of 94. He was critical for the past few days.Deshmukh, a member of the Peasants and Workers party (PWP), has set a record of being elected 11 times from Sangola constituency in Solapur and was an MLA for 55 years till 2019. In his entire career in electoral politics, Deshmukh contested 13 Assembly elections till 2014 and lost only twice – in 1972 and 1995. In 1995, he lost to a Congress candidate by a margin of merely 192 votes.In 2019, he announced his retirement from active politics and did not contest the Assembly polls.In the 2014 Assembly election, Deshmukh had defeated Shahaji Bapu Patil by more than 25,000 votes.Interestingly, Deshmukh was mostly in the opposition, barring 1978 and 1999 when he briefly served as a minister – first in the Sharad Pawar-led government and the second time when the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) formed the government with support from PWP.Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari condoled demise of the veteran. He said, “I was saddened to know about the demise of the senior-most leader of PWP and the longest term member of the state legislature Ganpatrao Deshmukh. A model people’s representative, Shri Deshmukh maintained his chord with farmers, workers and ordinary citizens all his life. He was an epitome of simple living and high thinking. A man of peace and restraint, Shri Deshmukh was a fearless leader, having friends across the political spectrum. In his demise the state has lost an institution in the state legislature.”“We have lost a simple man from politics. He has set a record of electing maximum times in Maharashtra, but for me it is important that he lived his life with simple and high thinking. He has also set an example that will remain a benchmark in the political world for years to come,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in his condolence message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/longest-serving-mla-from-maharashtra-ganpatrao-deshmukh-passes-away-101627669453651.html
30-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Kalra says registration certificates of Khan Chacha, Town Hall cancelled||Businessman Navneet Kalra on Friday informed the Delhi high court that the registration certificate to run his restaurants, Khan Chacha and Town Hall, in Khan Market has been cancelledby the policeover alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators. Kalra, through his counsel, had argued that there was no provision to suspend registration certificate merely on the grounds of registration of FIR.Delhi Police on May 7 said that in a search operation during the second wave of the pandemic, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from Khan Chacha and Town Hall in Khan Market, and Nege & Ju in Lodhi Colony, which are owned by Kalra.Kalra was subsequently arrested on May 16 and granted bail on May 29. On July 20, Kalra, through his counsel, moved high court challenging the suspension of license of the two eateries in the upscale Khan market.On Friday, the court was informed that a final order had been passed and the registration certificates were cancelled by an order of July 23. Taking note of the submission, the judge said he can challenge the cancellation order in in accordance with law.Kalra had challenged the May 11 order-cum-show cause notice issued by the Joint Commissioner of Police (Licensing) O P Mishra and the subsequent suspension of the registration certificate to run the two eateries in Khan Market.“After taking into account the written and oral submission of the licencee and the serious nature of violation of the terms and conditions of the registration certificate, I...hereby cancel the registration certificate of...Khan Chacha... with immediate effect,” said one of the orders signed by Mishra on July 23.The businessman had contended that the suspension was illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Delhi Eating houses Registration Regulations as it did not confer power of suspension at the stage of issuance of a show casue notice.“The order of suspension is also bad as recovery of oxygen concentrators made from the restaurant premises is no ground nor is it given as a ground for suspension of licence. The order of suspension adversely affects the business, reputation and livelihood of all employees working in the restaurant,” the plea had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-kalra-says-registration-certificates-of-khan-chacha-town-hall-cancelled-101627669211280.html

Besides, gold ornaments weighing around 1.5 kg worth over ₹60 lakh were also found in his house.“We are yet to calculate how much of it was disproportionate to his known sources of income,” said the vigilance SP.Sahoo joined government service as a lowly junior stenographer in the forest department in 1981. He was transferred to Odisha Staff Selection Commission in 1994 as a senior stenographer. The Odisha Staff Selection Commission was established in 1993 to select candidates for Group-C posts such as field assistants, inspectors of supplies, assistant training officers, laboratory assistants, junior librarians, excise sub-inspectors, district culture officers, industries promotion officers, junior typists, traffic sub-inspectors, junior stenographers, welfare extension officers, marketing intelligence officers, amins, junior MVIs and junior engineers.In 2006, he became private secretary to the member of the Staff Selection Commission.

The state vigilance filed 222 criminal misconduct cases under the Act in 2017. As per section 13 of the Act, a public servant who habitually accepts any gratification other than legal remuneration is liable to be charged under it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-anti-corruption-sleuths-trace-assets-worth-rs-3-79-cr-from-class-3-employee-101627668613632.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Day 1 of door-to-door drive: 37 get vaccinated in Mumbai||Thirty-seven beneficiaries who are bedridden due to medical or physical illnesses were vaccinated at their homes, the Day-1 of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination drive, on Friday. These also include 14 senior citizens living at an old age home — Wagh Nursing Home in Jogeshwari (East). With help from a non-profit organisation, Project Mumbai, BMC kick-started the door-to-door vaccination drive on a pilot basis in the K East ward corresponding to areas in and around Andheri (East). Four vials were used for the drive on Friday. Each vial contains 10 vaccine doses. Two separate teams of medical professionals were on the field with two separate ambulances, for the pilot drive. Both ambulances were equipped with oxygen support. Each team comprised a doctor, a nurse and a member of the BMC staff to accompany the team. As per the BMC, the drive will now start across Mumbai. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “From Monday, we will start the drive in all wards of Mumbai. Each ward will have at least one team on the field for the door-to-door visits.” On Friday morning, Daya Joshi, 79, a resident of Vijay Nagar in Andheri (East) became the first beneficiary to get vaccinated at home. Shishir Joshi, from Project Mumbai, said, “We called beneficiaries and asked them what time they were free to arrange a visit at home. The first beneficiary was free at noon. We also had an orientation session with the two teams in the morning, before they went on the field.”Dr Niteen Joshi, Daya Joshi’s son, said, “My mother went through a coronary illness. There are three other members in our family, and all are vaccinated except my mother. Now she has received her first dose as part of the door-to-door drive. Our housing colony had earlier circulated a message about this drive, and we signed up for my mother. The entire process was very smooth.” The two teams started their day by visiting the same locations together, to draw from each other’s experience. Later in the day, the two teams split up and began to visit separate beneficiaries. The teams waited in the homes of the beneficiaries for a short while after they were vaccinated, before moving to the next home. They approached each home with contact information about the nearest municipal hospital and dispensary, a phone number of the nearest physician associated with BMC. The civic body’s ambulance was also on standby in case of emergency, according to official information. One of the main reasons why BMC kick-started the door-to-door only in one ward on Friday was to draw learnings from its experience on the field and fine-tune its standard operating procedures when the drive becomes large scale across Mumbai Monday onwards. Kakani said, “The most important aspect is that beneficiaries need to have a consent letter from their physicians ready beforehand. If that is not available when our team visits their homes for vaccination, the trip will be futile.” As per requirement, each beneficiary needs to have a consent letter from a physician certifying they are fit for vaccination. The beneficiary should also ensure a family physician can watch over the person during the 30-minute observation period after vaccination. “These are challenging in some cases, as every beneficiary may not have a doctor who can watch over them for 30 minutes after vaccination,” Shishir Joshi said. For Friday’s drive, the medical teams’ phone called about 90 beneficiaries who had signed up for the drive. About 15 of them were already vaccinated, as many had taken their first dose, and a handful did not have all documents in place. Hence a total of 37 beneficiaries were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-1-of-door-to-door-drive-37-get-vaccinated-in-mumbai-101627668131798.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra administers over 10 million doses in July, so far||In another milestone, Maharashtra has administered over 10 million doses in this month so far — its highest number in a month. Earlier this month, the state achieved a feat of going past 40 million doses since the drive started on January 16. According to the state health department’s data, this month (till July 29), 10,643,344 doses have been administered.State health department officials said that steady stock supply from the Centre and greater awareness among the population has boosted their numbers. State immunisation officer, DN Patil said, “This is another milestone for us. We have administered over one crore (10 million) doses in a month for the first time.”In June, the state had touched 9.86 million (9,864,317) doses. Maharashtra saw a 55.13% jump in vaccination numbers in June from the previous month due to the availability of doses from the Centre. In May, the state had administered 6.35 million (6,358,454) doses. However, the jump in the number of doses in July from the previous month is not high. July (till 29th) only saw a 7.89% increase in doses from June.Senior state officials said that though the Centre is providing steady doses to the state, the numbers have to increase in proportion to the state’s population. The state has the infrastructure to administer one million jabs a day, said, officials. “We have demanded 30 million doses every month as we have the manpower and infrastructure to utilise that much stock. Such a proposal has also been passed last month in the state legislature. Our daily average is about 300,000 doses, which is slow, but it is due to low stock,” the official said requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, on Friday the state had administered 656,156 doses till 7pm, as per the Co-WIN portal data. Of the doses administered, 32,784,013 were first doses and 10,967,047 beneficiaries are fully vaccinated. In all, 43,751,060 doses have been administered till 7pm, as per the Co-WIN data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-administers-over-10-million-doses-in-july-so-far-101627667892377.html
30-07-2021||Other||‘Border issue can be solved on basis on 1875 notification alone’: Mizoram panel||Amid brewing tension with Assam over the state’s border following Monday’s clashes, a boundary committee constituted by the Mizoram government declared on Friday that the dispute can be resolved on the basis of an 1875 notification itself that started the inner line permit (ILP) in the area, HT has learnt.The decision was taken at the first meeting of the committee constituted last week and headed by deputy chief minister Tawnluia. It includes four ministers, members of NGOs, political parties, the chief secretary and state police chief. “The demarcation of Mizoram’s boundary/border on its northern side is to be found only in the Inner Line of 1875. Hence, the committee will continue its stance that the Mizoram-Assam boundary be desirably resolved on the basis of this document alone,” stated a resolution issued by the committee on Friday. The committee said border issues can’t be resolved through force and the matter should be resolved through dialogue. It approved the steps taken by the state government to address the issue and urged it “to continue taking steps courageously”.“As the border issue is intertwined with ethnic issues, it is our appeal to the people that they remain united in this matter and show fortitude in the face of any inconveniences arising out of this situation,” said the committee. It appealed to Mizo people not to create hardships for non-Mizos in the state because of the current border situation “The boundary committee intends to protect our land as it was occupied by our forefathers to its utmost ability and asks the people of Mizoram for their solidarity and support,” the committee said. Stating that most illegal drugs entering Assam was coming via Mizoram, the Assam government issued an order on Thursday saying all vehicles entering the state from Mizoram will be thoroughly checked. Responding to the order, Mizoram’s home department issued a release on Friday saying that the move will create unnecessary hardships for “innocent citizens” travelling from Mizoram to Assam. “There is no such restriction on the movement of non-residents of Mizoram travelling within Mizoram through the Mizoram-Assam border. This order (the one issued by Assam) may however be viewed as another way of creating an opportunity to harass all vehicles and passengers from Mizoram by Assam Police,” the release said. Countering Assam’s allegations, the release said that in the past 10 years, large quantities of illegal drugs coming from Assam have been seized in Mizoram and 395 persons from the neighbouring state were arrested in the matter. “The issue of drug trafficking can be better solved by better communication between the states... instead of threatening and harassing innocent civilians without any reasons,” said the release. The Assam-Mizoram border dispute is based on two notifications issued by the British. The first one issued in 1875 was framed under Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 that demarcated Lushai Hills (the earlier name of Mizoram) from the plains of Cachar (in Assam), both of which were part of Greater Assam. The notification also introduced the inner line permit regime (ILP) that regulates the entry of outsiders to the area, now Mizoram, till this date. Since the decision was taken in consultation with Mizo chiefs at that time, Mizoram wants the border delimitation done on the basis of the 1875 notification. In 1933, another notification was issued through which delimitation of the earlier boundary between Lushai Hills, the former princely state of Manipur and Cachar in Assam was modified. Mizoram doesn’t accept this notification based on which it was declared a Union territory in 1972 and a state in 1987 as it wasn’t done in consultation with Mizo groups and because some parts of the region went to Assam. Following Monday’s clashes, an undeclared economic blockade is prevailing at Lailapur in Assam along the NH306, the lifeline to Mizoram that passes through Assam, and several trucks carrying essential goods have been stranded. On Friday, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga tweeted saying, “Essential commodities and Covid-19 related medical equipment for Oxygen Plant should never be blocked!” He appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to intervene and sort the border issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/border-issue-can-be-solved-on-basis-on-1875-notification-alone-mizoram-panel-101627667834255.html

The said group has been earning huge revenues through unaccounted sale of paan masala and unaccounted real estate business. This income was laundered back into the concerns through a vast link of shell companies, according to a press statement issued by the I-T department. Digital and paper evidence found during the search revealed a nationwide network of such shell companies created by the group. The directors of these companies are persons of with no financial means, claimed the press release. “While some of these persons are not even filing income tax returns, some others who file returns, do so of extremely meagre amounts,” said Surabhi Ahluwalia, spokesperson, CBDT.Field investigations further revealed that these paper companies did not exist at the addresses mentioned and never conducted any business.“Surprisingly, these companies advanced so called loans and advances to the real estate group amounting to ₹226 crore in just three years. A network of 115 such shell companies has been found. Forensic analysis of the digital data is in progress. The main ‘directors’ also admitted that they were only ‘dummy directors’ and signed on the dotted lines as and when required in return for commission for their ‘services’,” according to the press statement.During the search, the I-T teams also discovered hideouts where troves of documents containing details of unaccounted money and their process of laundering, reads the press note.The team uncovered the modus operandi, including the role of ‘cash handlers’.The modus operandi is similar with respect to the business of paan masala. They too have laundered back their unaccounted income through an extensive network of such shell companies.Unaccounted loans and premium received from such paper companies exceeding ₹110 crore in three years have been detected.Forensic analysis of evidence is in progress. So far, 34 bogus bank accounts of shell companies have been found. Deductions claimed under Income Tax Act, 1961 with respect to treatment of biodegradable waste are under scrutiny. It has also been discovered that through some of these paper companies based in Kolkata, bogus sale and purchase of manure has been shown, amounting to ₹80 crore, so that cash can be deposited into bank accounts, the press note stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unaccounted-transactions-of-rs-400-cr-to-fore-after-searches-on-paan-masala-group-101627667771865.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 may affect sperm count among patients, say doctors||Though Covid-19 is a respiratory disease that primarily affects the lungs, it can also temporarily affect the process of spermatogenesis— formation of sperms leading to low sperm count — among patients. It takes two-three months to regain normal count, post-Covid-19 recovery, said, doctors.Previous studies have shown that viral diseases like Hepatitis C, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), herpes and Ebola, affected spermatogenesis, sperm count, hormone levels and sperm motility. Doctors said the same pattern is also being observed among male patients infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“Covid-19 causes fever which affects the spermatogenesis in a patient. We have observed that post-infection, the sperm count among the recovered patients decreases, but it is temporary. Thus, we always advise couples who want to conceive through IVF treatment to delay their procedure,” said Dr Richa Jagtap, clinical director, consultant reproductive medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, Mumbai. “It can be said that Covid-19 affects fertility, but it is just temporary.”Dr Kshitiz Murdia, chief executive officer and co-founder of Indira IVF also shared a similar observation. “We have noticed that men are more susceptible to the Covid-19 infection which impacts short-term sperm quality. But within two-three months, they recover completely. I have not observed any permanent damage among any patient,” he said.During viral infections, the body temperature increases in reaction to the pathogen, which may cause a blood-testis barrier — the immunological barrier which gives way into the male reproductive tract. This can affect the reproductive capacity of the patient, said doctors.“A few researchers have shown that reproductive organs have ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors which provide an entry point for Sars-Cov-2. Researchers across the globe have found the virus in the reproductive organs in infected males. So, there is a possibility that the virus may lower the sperm counts but more studies are needed,” said a researcher from National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH).A study — Impaired spermatogenesis in Covid-19 patients published in the science journal, Lancet stated that impairment of spermatogenesis was observed in Covid patients, which could be partially explained as a result of an elevated immune response in testis. “Our results demonstrated the impaired spermatogenesis caused by Covid-19. Even for the patient who showed a sperm count above the lower reference limit, the impairment of spermatogenesis cannot be entirely excluded,” concluded the study.Sexologists claim that depression and stress among Covid-19 patients during their treatment can also contribute to their short-term infertility. It also affects their sexual performance.“Covid-19 causes depression and anxiety among patients which can also be a contributing factor in decreasing their sperm counts. It also impacts their sexual desires, arousal and eagerness for intercourse. But the patient is critically ill and suffered severe damage to the lungs, he recovers within two-three months,” said Dr Prakash Kothari is founder, professor, head of the department of sexual medicine at KEM Hospital, Parel.Doctors have suggested that Covid-19 recovered patients consult doctors if they face any kind of changes in their sexual behaviour or while planning pregnancy after recovering from infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-may-affect-sperm-count-among-patients-say-doctors-101627667712014.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Notice to 33 illegal structures on Worli-Koliwada seashore||In a major drive against illegal structures, allegedly constructed by reclaiming sea, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has issued notices to 33 owners in Worli-Koliwada. The civic body has cited the change in monsoon patterns in the city for a couple of years and said that these structures located on the seashore are a safety hazard to residents.The civic body conducted site visits following complaints of illegal construction and to ensure that human lives are saved timely by stopping illegal construction on the seashore.A BMC official said, “We have issued notices to 33 structure occupants and more 10 to 15 notices will be issued in a day or two. Our main contention is that several illegal structures are built beyond the retaining wall in the Worli-Koliwada area by reclaiming the sea. During heavy rainfall, the sea has remained choppy, and water has entered into these houses, hence there is a threat to human lives.”The BMC official added, “We have for now issued notices to understand which structures are illegal and which have protection due to it being legal. Even if a structure is legal but is vulnerable to the sea, we may have to vacate such houses. A decision regarding these structures will be taken at the state government level, considering such vulnerable locations are present even in landslide-prone zones in the city.”However, the residents have said that the BMC has no business in sending notices to legal structures.Kishore Velye, a resident who has got notice said, “We have been residing in Worli Koliwada since 1985 and we have all the documents to prove it. How are we illegal in this case? Also, the retaining wall to which the BMC is referring was built around 2004. So, why did they not build in such a way that all houses are covered by it? If they tell us to relocate, we cannot simply go somewhere considering our business and work is here.”Meanwhile, BMC officials said they are not going to demolish any house yet. Proper scrutiny will be done, and demolition will be carried out only on the basis of illegality and threat to human life, civic officials said. In the past one month, over 30 citizens have been killed in several monsoon related incidents including landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-notice-to-33-illegal-structures-on-worli-koliwada-seashore-101627667411719.html

He added that the proposed project will also enhance the road connectivity to the state’s second largest city.The circular road that will be toll-free and is estimated to be used by at least 70,000 vehicles daily, will service 29 villages and connect all the highways skirting past Pune, Shinde further said.“As a result of significant expansion and urbanisation, millions of vehicles arrive in Pune every day, causing air and noise pollution,” he said, adding that the ring road will mitigate the traffic issue.The minister pointed out that vehicles travelling to Saswad, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Konkan and Mumbai pass through Pune thereby causing traffic snarls, and air and noise pollution. “The ring road will also considerably reduce travel time and distance…It will entail the acquisition of roughly 1554.64 hectares of land," he added.A recent National Emissions Inventory (NEI) report had revealed that automobile emissions contribute to 91 per cent of Pune’s air pollution.The Pune ring road will have 14 multilevel interchanges and eight major bridges to aid in smooth traffic management. Stretching 173.7km, the road will also have 18 viaducts, 17 tunnels and four roadways over bridges, officials from the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) earlier said.Officials further stated that the project will be executed in two phases – east and west, at a cost of ₹26,831 crore.The MSRDC has, however so far, managed to complete the land measurement of over 51 per cent of the total area to be acquired for the western side of the ring road. As far as land acquisition of the eastern part is concerned, the process has begun and officials have also commenced to hold meetings in the affected villages.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-ring-road-to-curtail-pollution-by-nearly-25-says-maharashtra-minister-101627666728119.html

Further, the CAG also recommended that the borrowed funds should be utilised to create assets to stimulate growth.“The Revenue Expenditure (of the state) increased by 14.08 per cent during 2019-20 compared to the previous (financial) year, whereas the Capital Expenditure decreased by 3.79 per cent during the same period,” the report stated, adding that the Revenue Expenditure increased mainly due to the increase in salaries and wages, pensions, interest payments and subsidies.Capital expenditure of the state showed a significant decrease during the last two years with a decrease of ₹1,098 crore in 2018-19 and ₹337 crore in 2019-20, it said.The state government registered a nominal decrease of 1.88 per cent in its revenue receipts during 2019-20 compared to the previous year.

The last caste-wise enumeration was done 90 years ago, in 1931. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre has ruled out a caste count, other than among scheduled castes and tribes, in the Census 2021. Kumar’s party Janata Dal (United) is a key constituent of the NDA at the Centre and in Bihar.In a press briefing after meeting the CM, Tejashwi Yadav said Kumar supported the need for caste census and listened to their demand that an all-party delegation should meet the Prime Minister to press for the same. “The Bhartiya Janata Party too had supported the resolutions favouring a caste census passed by the state legislature twice. It is a question of prestige of the state Assembly,” the opposition leader said.“The chief minister has assured us he would write to PM on August 2 to seek time after returning from New Delhi,” Tejashwi said.Kumar left for the national capital on Friday to attend his party JD(U)’s national executive meeting on Saturday. Yadav said he had apprised the CM about the caste census carried out by the Karnataka government in 2018 and demanded a similar decision be taken in Bihar in case the PM does not give time to meet an all-party delegation. “The CM assured us he would look into the matter by getting all papers related to caste census done in Karnakata and its legal aspects,” he said. Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma, who was also part of the delegation, said the meeting with the CM was positive. CPI, CPI-ML(Liberation) leaders also attended the meeting. Though Kumar did not mention his meeting with Opposition leaders, he too has been pushing for a caste census, saying it will help in better decisions for the people’s development and welfare. “We will request the Centre that a caste-based census should be done at least once,” said Kumar. “I have been saying this for a long time.

It was completed in 2013, but was never published,” he said. Both JD(U) and RJD have thrived on the plank of social justice for traditionally backward castes.Meanwhile, BJP MLC Sanjay Paswan said the demand for a caste census as totally unwarranted. “Those demanding caste census are playing divisive politics.

Additional chief secretary (ACS), home, Awanish Awasthi and director general of police (DGP) Mukul Goel along with Lucknow commissioner of police DK Thakur had visited the land identified for the project at Piparsand, Sarojininagar on Thursday to examine the preparation for Sunday. A senior official said the layout of the institute was prepared close on the lines of the Gujarat Forensic Science University. The institute would have departments related to physics, firearms and explosives, cybercrime, DNA, chemistry, poison, zoology and behavioural science. He said the project was equipped to fulfill the requirement of forensic experts to strengthen criminal justice system and create a pool of forensic experts required by the police for advance investigations. In the long run, the experts produced by the university may cater to other independent organisations, he added. He said the institute was not specifically for those who were already in ‘khaki’ but would be open to all those who needed to educate themselves, as well as those willing to make a career in similar fields. He said the initial plan was to offer two courses— M Sc forensic science full time two-year post graduate degree course and post graduate diploma in forensic science one year course. The official said the forensic institute may help the police in different ways by learning the crime trend, pattern, deriving a viable solution to curb the crime, help the common man learn about different criminals’ psychology and cyber security and cyber forensic methods. Later, the experts of the institute may surface as a think tank for the state government to provide suggestions on different aspects of crime and policing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shah-to-lay-foundation-of-state-forensic-sciences-institute-on-aug-1-101627661111525.html

There are multiple reasons, the main one being the Covid pandemic, but there might be other reasons as well.”An officer from the RTO, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Last year people avoided purchasing vehicles mainly due to new cab services. The cab services are very useful and available at any time. You don’t need to drive, park or maintain the vehicle.

However, speaking prior to the Covid review meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar claimed that as per the new “unlock policy”, relaxations will only be given to districts where the positivity rate is 1% or less. On Thursday, health minister Rajesh Tope had announced proposed unlock measures for 25 districts, where the Covid positivity rate is less than the state average. He had specified that Pune is among 11 districts where level 3 restrictions would not be eased. “Relaxations will be given to the areas where the positivity rate has dropped to around 1%. At the last meeting, we discussed the possibility of increasing the timings of business operations till 8 pm. The CM is positive about this. Currently, on Saturday and Sunday everything is closed. We considered giving some relaxations on Saturday. Following Covid norms is very essential,” said Ajit Pawar in Pune on Friday. “Health minister declared that the level 3 curbs in 11 districts would remain the same. Pune is also one of them. However, deputy CM Ajit Pawar has spoken to the CM about allowing some relaxations in Pune. The decision is expected in the next two days. Decisions regarding the changes in shop timings could also be taken,” said Dilip Walse-Patil in Pune on Friday. The positivity rate in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), for the duration of July 22-July 28 was recorded at 3.37%. Earlier, when the state government had announced the five-level restriction plan, the three administrative units in the district had different levels of restrictions based positivity rates and oxygen-bed occupancy. Initially, PMC and PCMC were under level 3 restrictions and level 4 was imposed in the rural parts. Carrot on a stick for business ops in PuneSince Ajit Pawar hinted at relaxations last week, traders and business operators were looking forward to a concrete decision this week. Instead, the statements by leaders have created confusion. “Shop owners have become restless now. They are angry. We are conducting a district-level meeting of all the trader associations on Friday evening. It has become impossible to plan a reopening in such uncertainty,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP). The uncertainty of the decision has created a problem for hoteliers, who were hoping for extended timings from August 1.“We had met the deputy chief minister and had requested him to make a decision. He had assured us that a positive decision would be made. So many restaurant owners started to prepare for the extended operations from August 1. Many called in extra staff from their hometowns. Now again, there is no clarity.. The positivity rate in Pune has dropped below 4%. So what is the problem now?” said Ganesh Shetty, president Hoteliers Association of Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-clarity-on-easing-of-curbs-in-pune-leaves-traders-residents-confused-101627660930826.html

The maximum temperature dropped to 30.4 degree Celsius in Agra city on both Thursday and Friday, with the sky overcast. On Friday, Agra received 30.6 mm rain till the evening. However, the rainfall exposed the poor condition of drainage system and potholes surfaced on roads as the water receded. There were craters too and in some places, the road surface caved in and big holes appeared, making it dangerous to drive. The water also took long to recede and the situation was bad, particularly in localities adjacent to major drains in old Agra. The Agra Nagar Nigam had made tall claims about cleaning of drains but the rain for three consecutive days exposed the pitiable state of drainage. Still, mayor Naveen Jain claimed that the situation was not that bad and though waterlogging was reported, the water receded in a few hours. “A control room has been set up at the nagar nigam office and teams sent to areas facing waterlogging for long. Pumps were used and most of the major roads became motorable despite heavy rain. This was the outcome of attention given to drainage system. Still, there are complaints which are being addressed,” said the mayor. “Similar scenes are witnessed in the national capital Delhi and commercial capital Mumbai and are common in the rainy season. Yet, we are prepared to do the needful and damaged roads would be repaired as part of a drive from September 15,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agra-roads-bad-after-three-days-of-rain-101627659610653.html

The district administration has said that the current number of oxygen cylinders, dura cylinders and cryogenic tanks is more than the estimated numbers required in the estimated third wave. The shortage of oxygen and following deaths had been a major source of concern during the second wave in April. As per the district administration, there is likely to be no shortage of oxygen in case the much anticipated third wave hits the city and even harder than the second wave. In the second wave, the district’s highest requirement for oxygen went up to 361 metric tonnes a day. Now, oxygen storage capacity has gone up to an expected 1183 metric tonnes, almost three times the highest requirement. As of now in the district, hospitals have a storage capacity of 957 metric tonnes while oxygen manufacturers have a capacity of 2,210 metric tonnes, refillers 607 tonnes, industrial oxygen manufacturers have about 152 metric tonnes which takes the total storage capacity to 3348.8 tonnes storage capacity for oxygen at the most. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during his Friday weekly review meeting said, “The administration is ensuring that there would be no shortage of oxygen in case the third wave hits the district. As of now, we have 50 hospital-based generation plants which would be enough for the anticipated third wave. We also have more than required B&D type jumbo cylinders, 12 more than estimated to be required, 35 more dura cylinders, 412 more cryogenic tanks. Currently we have 16 functional oxygen plants and we have proposed 35 more such plants so that the generation capacity increases to 24,000 litres per minute for the district from the current 13,000 litres per minute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sufficient-oxygen-storage-to-tackle-anticipated-third-wave-pune-admin-101627658770637.html

Like, we should not allow seepage of contaminated water. At present, we don’t have any mechanism to check the quality of rainwater going into the ground. However, the state government has formed a district level groundwater council for every district to ensure rainwater harvesting to check depletion of water table.”He said, “In Lucknow, we have lost 70% of water bodies. If you lose big water bodies, then rainwater harvesting is always good to recharge the underground water aquifers.”Groundwater department director VK Upadhyay said, “There are around 2.08 lakh buildings with rooftop groundwater recharge facilities in the state. In Lucknow, according to our records, there are around 20,000 buildings with rooftop rainwater harvesting facilities. But we need to have more buildings to compensate for the water lost during the last so many years.”He added, “We are trying to encourage local bodies to create rainwater harvesting facilities in every park of the city. If done, this will ensure good recharge of groundwater table.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/groundwater-level-falling-by-1-metre-every-year-says-lucknow-mayor-101627657753645.html

30-07-2021||Mumbai||Shilpa Shetty’s defamation suit: Mumbai high court refuses to gag media||MUMBAI: Observing that the right to privacy is required to be balanced with the freedom of the Press, the Bombay high court on Friday refused to grant an interim injunction against various news portals and publications accused by actor Shilpa Shetty of indulging in defamatory reporting of her reactions to the arrest of her husband Raj Kundra in the alleged pornographic film racket case.The court, however, said the fact that the actor was a public figure did not mean that she has sacrificed her right to privacy when it was pointed out that certain articles had questioned her parenting in light of the case.The bench did not pass any orders as some of the organisations were not represented and those who were represented informed that they had taken down the content from the digital platforms, to which the court asked them not to upload the same again. A bench of justice Gautam Patel, while hearing the interim application in a defamation suit filed by Shetty, was informed by senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf and Dr Abhinav Chandrachud that while the actor was not seeking a blanket gag order on the media from reporting anything related to the case of her husband, she sought an interim injunction restraining various media platforms from reporting uncorroborated, defamatory and malicious news about her. Her husband, Raj Kundra was arrested by the property cell of Mumbai Police’s crime branch on July 19 in connection with an alleged pornography racket. The cell has alleged that Kundra controlled the operation of the mobile app used to upload pornographic videos for paid viewership and earned over ₹1.17 crore between August and December last year by means of subscription .Dr Saraf said that the actor took exception to news items which implied that she was indulging in the destruction of evidence pertaining to the case in which her husband was booked as well as the case was affecting her parenting. After some of the 29 defendants who were represented by advocates submitted that they had taken down the objectionable content and assured the court that they would not upload it again, justice Patel said in his order, “I believe some of the issues this suit raises will amount to scrutiny because it is not possible to say at this stage that all statements of all defendants are defamatory in nature.”Referring to the objectionable content reported by the accused publications, justice Patel said, “The material here seems to be prima facie drawn from an understanding of what investigating teams have said or indicated. The report is not of Shetty’s guilt or innocence, but of what an investigative agency suspects. I am not inclined to pass an order on this.” He added that no part of the order should be construed as a gag on the media. “I am making no order, but this is not refusal of interim or ad-interim relief.”When Dr Saraf pointed to the observations made by one of the publishers about Shetty’s parenting while reporting on the circumstances surrounding the case, justice Patel said, “That part is protected by her right of privacy under the wide protection recognised by the freedom of the press to be balanced with the right of privacy. It is possible that freedom of speech may have to be narrowly tailored. But it is not possible to ignore the constitutional pinning of privacy, nor to say that if a person is a public figure, that person is deemed to have sacrificed his right to privacy.” The application will be heard next on September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shilpa-shetty-s-defamation-suit-mumbai-high-court-refuses-to-gag-media-101627654271131.html

In a written reply to Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat, who sought the know the “details of the total number of deaths of Covid patients who died in Goa Medical College Hospital due to shortage of oxygen supply,” Rane said that “at no point in time, the oxygen supplies at GMC ran out of stock and thus, no death has been reported to have caused due to non-supply of oxygen.”The reply is contrary to statements that the Goa government has made before the Bombay High Court at Goa before which it has admitted that “some deaths may have taken place due to “fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to the patients.”“There were logistical issues involved in manoeuvring the tractor which carries the trolleys of oxygen and in connecting the cylinders to the manifold. During this process, there was some interruption, which resulted in a fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to the patients. It is basically on account of these factors some casualties may have taken place,” the state government told the court back in May. It was Rane who first flagged the issue of dropping oxygen levels and called for a probe into the deaths during what he called were the “dark hours” at the Goa Medical College. Rane first claimed that on the night of May 10, 26 people died due to oxygen shortage and on May 11 it was 21 deaths and called for a probe into the deaths. The following three nights 15, 13 and 8 people were reported to have died before the state government finally shifted from using a system of oxygen being supplied through a cylinder manifold that needed to be changed using tractors to supply from a liquid medical oxygen tank. The Bombay High Court at Goa, which took up the issue of oxygen shortage, however, wasn’t willing to buy the excuse.“We have long passed the stage of determining whether patients are suffering from the lack of oxygen or not. The material placed before us establishes that patients are indeed suffering and even in some cases succumbing for want of the supply of oxygen, in the state of Goa,” the High Court, that is hearing the petitions filed by the South Goa Advocates Association among others, said.The Goa Association of Resident Doctors first flagged the issue of oxygen running out as early as May 3 (a whole week before reports of deaths due to oxygen shortage started being reported in the media).“The oxygen supply in various covid wards is not even close to sufficient. The central oxygen flow delivers very low flow oxygen at times and that is inadequate to keep NIVS and ventilators working effectively. Also, the oxygen cylinders being used for patients get over in the middle of the night and it takes at least 2-3 hours for replacement cylinders to come and sometimes more than that and for this time period, the patients are kept without oxygen with saturations dropping to less than 60%,” the resident doctors said in a letter dated May 2 to the Dean of the medical college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-death-caused-due-to-non-supply-of-oxygen-goa-govt-tells-assembly-101627653853637.html

The programmes were set during the core committee meeting of the party state unit on Thursday evening which was led by party national general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh in presence of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, party state president Madan Kaushik, party state in-charge Dushyant Kumar and other senior leaders. During the meeting, Santosh, along with other state leaders, discussed the strategy for the upcoming polls and asked them to implement the roadmap for the same on the ground with all possible efforts. One of the party senior leaders who was present in the meeting, on condition of anonymity, said, “The central leader directed all the state leaders to get actively involved in the preparation for 2022 under which various issues were discussed.” “During that discussion, the issues of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act and demand for new land law for the state also featured prominently as both of them are significantly connected to the people of the state. Santosh took feedback on both to which CM Dhami apprised him of the high-level committee formed for solving the issues related to Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act against which the priest community is protesting,” said the leader, adding that a “consensus was achieved to counter the Opposition parties on the issues and cautiously bringing a solution on the two before elections.” Party state president Madan Kaushik said, “The state unit would hold a three day Jan Ashirvad Rally in the state on 17, 18 and 19 August to increase the mass outreach. Our leaders would also visit various districts and go among the ground workers for the same.” Describing the meeting as a fruitful and important one, Kaushik said, “The Opposition parties are trying to mislead the youth of the state by creating a propaganda induced-environment. However, they won’t succeed in their motives.” “BJP is the only party in Uttarakhand to carry all-round development which it is already doing. People are with us and would once again reject Congress which is spreading false propaganda,” he said. The Congress, on the other hand, seems to be still trying to solve the differences among its leaders after the formation of the new state team under newly appointed state president Ganesh Godiyal. Ever since Godiyal was made the new state head by replacing former state president Pritam Singh, who is now the new leader of Opposition, all seems to be not well in the state unit. It was also evident with the fact the Singh skipped the first press conference taken by Godiyal after taking charge as new state head a couple of days ago. The party leadership, however, refuted reports of any differences in the party and said, “All leaders are united and working collectively towards winning the 2022 polls.” Party state in-charge Devendra Yadav said, “There are no differences whatsoever in the party. The new team has been formed and been implemented to prepare for the polls with all possible efforts.” On the party’s preparations for the upcoming assembly elections, Yadav said, “We have already held a core committee meeting on Wednesday in which the various committees formed for the polls were asked to chalk out their strategies within one week. They would submit a report on the same during the next core committee meeting on August 3 and 4.“The party is fully confident of winning the polls because people are fed up with the BJP government’s misgovernance and anti-public decisions in the last four and a half years of its tenure,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-in-poll-mode-sets-programmes-for-next-2-months-101627653251363.html

The civic body had to stop its proposed riverside road from Vithalwadi to Pune-Mumbai National Highway (NH-4) bypass in 2013 after orders from the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) as it violated environmental rules. PMC plans to develop road on both sides of Mutha river. The proposed Vithalwadi-Nanded City elevated road is 4-kilometre long and 24 metres in width running parallel to Sinhagd road and the elevated road on other bank of Mutha riverside will starts from Karvenagar to Shivane villages. It is around one kilometre and 24-metre wide. After the Supreme Court had given an order to stop the proposed Vithalwadi- Pune Mumbai National Highway (NH-4) bypass stretch, PMC is exploring an elevated stretch between Vithalwadi and NH-4 stretch. It plans to extend elevated road from NH-4 to Nanded City and Karveganar to Shivane as the latter is now within PMC limits after merger of villages. Mahadu Thopate, deputy engineer, PMC project department, said, “The road department has proposed two elevated roads from both sides of Mutha river. In Sinhgad road area, we have extended the elevated road from Vithalwadi to Nanded as earlier it was up to NH-4 highway. The decision has been taken as PMC limits have extended up to Khadakwasla.” “In Karvenagar side, we will develop one kilometre stretch to Shivane villages. It is part of Kharadi-Shivane project. Both roads can be laid as it falls in blueline areas. We have decided to conduct pre-feasibility and environment impact assessment (EIA) study, floated tender and has given six months to the agency to study and submit report to PMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-plans-elevated-roads-on-mutha-riversides-101627652650341.html

Health officials from the state said that 19 people were found with the infection initially while two more cases were found later.All 21 infected people, including eight children between two and 12 years of age, have been admitted to the Sadar hospital in Garhwa, news agency PTI reported citing state officials. Also, all contacts of the patients have been identified and isolated, the officials further said.A single worker, among the many who returned from a colliery area in Madhya Pradesh, was initially found positive for Covid-19. It is suspected that the villagers might have contracted the infection from the worker. Also, the Delta variant of the virus has been detected in the region in MP from where the workers had returned.Also read | Covid-19 R-value rising steadily in India; Kerala, N-E states tops listMeanwhile, the state’s additional chief secretary of health Arun Kumar Singh said that the administration was taking all possible steps to contain the spread. He further said that all officials in the area were kept on high alert following the outbreak."Initially 19 villagers were found positive. All of them have been admitted to Garhwa Sadar hospital. We are taking all possible steps to contain the spread of the virus and have kept officials on high alert in the area," PTI quoted Singh as saying on Friday.

Also, one person succumbed to the illness in the last 24 hours as the death toll climbed to 5,126. The sudden detection of 21 new cases in a short span of two days has raised concerns among health officials as the state has been witnessing a lesser number of daily cases in the past few days.“Our surveillance team is visiting villages and we are taking all possible steps to contain the spread...Special precautions are taken in the village Haradag Khurd with a population of about 300 villagers,” deputy commissioner of Garhwa Rajesh Kumar Pathak said.Dr Kumar said that the sample of the first villager testing positive in the village was collected during a routine sample collection at a railway station. “The health machinery swung into action and 25 persons including all his family members were subjected to tests along with two other families with whom he interacted,” he then said.

State officials said that the samples would be sent to the Regional Genome Sequencing Laboratory (RGSL), Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) in Bhubaneswar for genomic sequencing as the state presently does not have the machinery for sequencing.According to data from the government, 194 out of the 328 positive cases last month were due to the B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant while the Alpha and the Kappa variants accounted for 29 samples each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/21-people-test-covid-19-positive-in-jharkhand-village-in-2-days-as-state-fears-threat-due-to-variants-101627650559102.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Is the Party Over?||“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness…” — Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities “Isn’t it time you wrote a column on the death of Page 3?” a friend enquired recently. What she was alluding to, of course, was not any particular newspaper column or page, but that melding of unbridled confidence, consumerism and celebrity culture that had followed in the wake of India’s economic liberalisation in the Nineties. You remember the Nineties, don’t you? When it seemed as if India was on the radar of every big international corporation and capital for its markets; when beauty pageants began popping out Indian Miss Universes faster than the city’s most-celebrated fertility specialists; when once high-minded mainstream newspapers reserved their most seductive voice for their supplements, where who wore what and left the party with who would be given equal column space as the day’s headline; when nothing succeeded like excess and Mumbai was the mecca and the money machine for a multitude of shiny new professionals — fashionistas, gym instructors, etiquette coaches, wellness gurus, lifestyle consultants , party animals, celebrity chefs, TV anchors, event organisers, wine critics, starchitects, model coordinators, talent scouts, and food stylists. Hostesses would thoughtfully caption and deliver high-resolution pictures to newspaper editors, in time for the next day’s edition, the morning after their big bashes even before they’d wiped off their mascara; A-list businessmen would open their hearts and homes to anyone with a camera and a microphone with abandon; and divas would plot their next photo spreads and the downfall of their rivals in the gossip columns with Mafiosi precision. Page 3 had come to symbolise all that was shiny, commercial and aspirational in Mumbai; if it was a mood, it was buoyant; if it had an attitude, it was “in your face”. And in its favour, it could be said that it fostered a great churning and breaking down of barriers. No longer was fame and fortune the preserve of the wealthy or high-born — Page 3 meant that you could just as well be a gallerist or a tattoo artist, as long as your hair was interestingly streaked, and you had the right attitude. ****************************************************** Paris had its Café Society and New York its Andy Warhol and Studio 54 sets, and throughout history there have been categorisations of social groups and styles such as The Jet Set, The Beautiful People, Hippies, Yuppies, Old Fogies, Foodies and Hipsters — terms afforded to collections of people or trends that represent a homogenous lifestyle, in a public context. So, what had preceded the advent of Page 3, in a new city just beginning to find its feet on seven recently joined islands? Certainly, you could say that with its nightclubs and bistros, cabaret acts and jazz yatras, Mumbai had exuded a cosmopolitan, artsy vibe. In the south, English theatre groups were making waves with their ideas and offerings and next door at Kala Ghoda, the Progressive Artist Group was making its presence felt. At Café Samovar, a whole breed of new-wave filmmakers, poets, journalists and artists could be called a quasi-cultural movement in its own right; at the other end of the city, Prithvi Theatre and Bhaidas auditorium were fostering a flourishing parallel cultural scene of their own; and, of course, the Juhu Gang of hip young film folk attracted comment and coverage; but none of these had quite galvanised or defined the city as much as the Page 3 phenomena, on account of the media and monetisation opportunities that it offered. Because, unlike the new wave art film movement or English theatre groups or the Juhu Gang, Page 3 was backed by big bucks; it had been the goose that laid the golden egg and the party looked like it would never end.****************************************************** It could be argued that even if the pandemic had not upended the Page 3 Ball, its days were already numbered, with the rise of social media. Once the bold and the beautiful realised that the tools for their hype and PR lay in their own manicured hands, things began changing. Now, businessmen, socialites and self-styed celebrities could achieve world domination with the click of a button and an air-brushed picture of themselves with their latest cat, cars or quotes directly on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. Overnight, this resulted in a Tower of Babel where everyone began posting, clicking, uploading and live streaming their private lives, all at once, in a race that seemed to be won by the quickest, loudest, craziest, zaniest, or most extreme. It was a virtual free-for-all platform, and it could have gone on forever, except for a few factors — firstly, it militated against India’s deeply held values of austerity. After all, it is not for nothing that the Father of the Nation is admired as much for his simplicity and non-materialism as his non-violence. Conspicuous consumption and unbridled exhibitionism of one’s lifestyle has long been frowned upon in these parts, and Indian culture and traditions have always extolled people to embrace self-denial and abstemiousness; but more importantly, the rise of the BJP-RSS, the Moral Police and armies of trolls began to make the existence of Page 3 an untenable proposition. Liberalisation might have ushered in the ways of the West, but the fate met by the likes of Vijay Mallya, Nirav and Lalit Modi and later Rhea Chakraborty were lessons not lost on anyone. Gradually aware of backlash in a country where the have-nots far outnumbered the haves and the socio-political environment signalled otherwise, people began to think twice before sharing pictures of their lavish weddings and exotic holidays, their bespoke wine collections and Birkin bags. So, even before Covid appeared on the scene, only the very tone deaf or desperate or foolish wanted to be seen partying or celebrating or having a good time; Page 3 began to asphyxiate; then came along Covid and hammered the last nail in its coffin.****************************************************** So, what will replace Page 3 if or when things go back to normal? My take is that having spent the past year-and-a-half indoors and largely alone, people will be reluctant to go back to their old party-hearty ways. The looming threat of infection and illness will make many continue to embrace more private lives, contract their social engagements and confine themselves to more selective lifestyle options. Celebrations will be more contained and survivor’s guilt, along with concerns for the environment and inner well-being will call for new ways of life and style. Of course, I could be wrong. Deprivation and hardship during World War 1 gave rise to the Roaring Twenties across the world, and in that regard, Page 3 might once again rear its head. But I’m certainly not holding my breath on that one...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-is-the-party-over-101627651211228.html
30-07-2021||Pune||NFAI acquires over 450 rare glass slides of early Telugu cinema||PUNE: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has added more than 450 glass slides of films to its collection. The acquisition films like V V Rao’s trendsetting social drama about widow remarriage “Malli Pelli” (1939), B N Reddi’s “Vande Mataram” (1939), starring Chittor V Nagaiah, and popular swashbuckling hit “Keelu Gurram” (1949) featuring Akkineni Nageshwara Rao and Anjali Devi, another hit N T Rama Rao starrer “Daasi” (1952), critically acclaimed adaptation of Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s classic Devdas Vedantam Raghavaiah’s “Devadasu” (1953) starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri and Lalitha in the central roles and many more. All these glass slides are in black and white covering 70 Telugu films from 1939 to 1955. Last year too NFAI acquired nearly 400 glass slides. NFAI has a collection of over 2,000 glass slides of Hindi, Gujarati and Telugu films. As per a NFAI press statement, “We are delighted to have these glass slides as they are an integral part of the early cinema viewing experience. Made by pressing a film positive between two thin glass squares, these slides were used for announcing new attractions before the commencement of a film or during intervals in theatres. The film positives used to prepare the glass slide were miniatures of the film poster or publicity material for newspapers and magazines.” The glass slides represent the pictorial history of early Telugu cinema from the late 1930s to the mid-1950s and feature frames tracing the gravitas of Telugu films during the early decades of Indian talkie. Prakash Magdum, director, NFAI, said, “Glass slides are exquisite records of Indian cinematic heritage, and we are happy to preserve these in our archival collection. In the wake of fast-changing technologies having these glass slides in such huge numbers is a rare and significant discovery. I appeal to all film lovers to come forward and deposit film footages, photographs, posters, lobby cards and other such material so that it can be preserved.” Commenting on the significance of the collection, Arti Karkhanis, incharge of documentation at NFAI said, “These glass slides give a bird’s eye view of the publicity scenario in the Telugu industry in its formative years. It has a great reference value for film researchers, and we will soon digitise them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nfai-acquires-over-450-rare-glass-slides-of-early-telugu-cinema-101627650130199.html
30-07-2021||Kolkata||Centre, Bengal govt is no show at SC hearing on post-poll violence, deferred||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday will take up a petition seeking a judicial probe into post-poll violence in West Bengal after two weeks as no lawyer appeared for the Centre or the West Bengal government despite the court issuing them notices on July 1.A bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari noted the absence of lawyers. “The office report states that respondent 1 (Union of India) and respondent 2 (State of West Bengal) have been served with the petition but are not represented through any counsel,” the bench said on a petition filed by Ranjana Agnihotri and Jitender Singh.The Election Commission was the only party that was present through advocate Amit Sharma. But the bench noted that the necessary parties to the case were Union and state government, who were missing. The bench allowed the petitioner’s lawyer to again serve the petition on the two governments and directed that the case be put up after two weeks. Advocate Hari Shankar Jain, who appeared for the petitioners, moved an application to make the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) along with five other central commissions as party to the petition. But the bench kept the application pending in order to ascertain the view of the Centre and state. The petition also named West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee as one of the respondents but the court refused to issue notice to her. The petition urged the court to direct the Election Commission to take action against the Trinamool Congress for violation of the model code of conduct and attached text of speeches by TMC leaders during the election campaign to back up its accusation that they indulged in communal politics.The petition filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain sought orders to the central and state government to protect the future of Hindus who, it said, were forced to flee the state during the violence and sought an independent enquiry into the incidents of loot, rape, and murder that had put the life, dignity and liberty of women and children in peril. On July 1, the court sought responses from the Centre, bengal government and the Election Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-bengal-govt-is-no-show-at-sc-hearing-on-post-poll-violence-deferred-101627648990748.html

Seventy-five of them have 1,321 arrear accounts since 1977-78, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India report for the year ending March 31, 2019. The report was tabled in the Bihar legislative assembly on Thursday.According to a mandatory provision under Bihar Finance Rules, companies have to finalise their accounts at the end of the fiscal so that they can be audited. If a company has not done so for 20 years, it is said to have 20 arrear (outstanding dues) accounts.The CAG, as per due process, reports all discrepancies to the departments concerned and seeks explanations. If unconvinced with the explanations, CAG details its objections in its annual report. The report will now be referred to the Public Accounts Committee of Vidhan Sabha.“The state government’s total investment in the 79 PSUs was ₹44,922.71 crore, with the bulk-- ₹40,473.20 crore--in the power sector. Of the 18 PSUs that finalised their accounts up to 2018-19, 10 earned a profit of ₹310 crore, while seven incurred losses of ₹2,778.54 crore, with the overall loss of the 18 PSUs totalling ₹2,467.56 crore in 2017-19,” says the report, which was explained by principal accountant general (PAG) Ramavatar Sharma at his office.Also Read | CAG report flags low job generation under MGNREGA in BiharThe report said that audited final accounts of the Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Limited had arrears since 2003-04, which prevented the company from receiving food subsidy of ₹212.50 crore. “The delay in finalisation of accounts may result in risk of fraud and leakage of public money, apart from violation of the provisions of the relevant statutes. As on March 31, 2018, ₹773.44 crore had been invested in 42 state PSUs for over five years. While the Bihar government has already decided to wind up 31 of them, no action has been taken against the remaining 11 companies,” it added.According to the report, though the Bihar government provided ₹197.93 crore as subsidy to the Bihar State Sugar Corporation Limited for payment of wages etc. during the last three years, the company did not finalise its accounts for the last 34 years. “Several non-functional companies have had arrear accounts for 42 years (since their inception). The shortcomings regarding accounts of Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited from 2006-07 to 2009-10, South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited and North Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited for 2017-18, Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Limited from 1999-2000 to 2002-03 are so serious that CAG declines to give an opinion,” the report said.The CAG report also highlighted how the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited paid its contractors ₹66.25 crore prior to technical sanction, ₹4.08 crore to design consultants without execution of agreement and appointed a supervision consultant on a nomination basis without recording full justification for single-source selection in violation of the Bihar Finance Rules, 2005. “The agency charge on non-admissible items by the Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited also led to a burden of ₹61.73 crore on the state exchequer. The company also lost ₹1.34 crore by not organising its investments to avail higher interest rates on fixed deposits,” said the report.Govt redeems own landThe report underlined how the transport department recovered the entire outstanding loan (principal) of ₹874.81 crore from the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) by taking over its physical property, including some land valued at ₹615.60 crore, which was already owned by the Bihar government--a misrepresentation of facts. BSRTC was given a loan at the rate of 13% per annum, while the average cost of borrowed funds for the government ranged between 6% - 10%, to pay wages and emoluments to its retired/deceased employees by the order of the Supreme Court and high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cag-report-shows-sorry-state-of-bihar-psus-101627645331529.html
30-07-2021||Other||Goa Assembly conducts marathon sitting of 17 hours till 4:30 am||The Goa Legislative Assembly created a record of sorts by holding a sitting for ‘unprecedented’ seventeen hours. The house finally got adjourned after 4:30 am on Friday that included a single continuous twelve-hour-long sitting which started at 4:30 pm on Thursday after the tea break. Opposition legislators questioned the state government for its ‘hurry’ in trying to ‘compress’ what is usually a three-week-long session into three days. “What is going on makes one wonder whether our chief minister is a doctor? If the assembly continues until 4:30 (am) what will happen to the health of those taking part? Which doctor prescribes this type of a routine that you are trying to compress an agenda of ten days in three days?” Opposition lawmaker, Vijai Sardesai, said. It was the second consecutive day when the Goa Legislative Assembly ended late. The previous day’s proceedings also ended past 2 am. While Parliament, as well as state assemblies, are known to have ended proceedings after midnight, the session of the Goa legislative assembly continuing until 4:30 am has been unheard of. In 2019, the Gujarat assembly concluded at 12:09 am in what was then considered a record for the state. BJP MLAs, however, said that the ‘shortened’ three-day assembly session was a necessity, a conscious decision to reduce the numbers that were taken to reduce the chances of avoiding an outbreak of Covid-19 and the consequent blame the government would have to face were that to happen. On Friday, opposition legislators led by Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat asked the government to table the 11 bills that were listed for consideration and passing on the final day but summon a special session to have them passed. “What message do you want to send by tabling and passing 11 bills, including the Mining Corporation Bill, and having them passed without any discussion?” Kamat said. The Goa government has however stuck to its guns. “The decision to hold a three-day session was taken by the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) and the Bills are important,” chief minister Pramod Sawant told the house. The length of the session was, however, too long for some legislators to handle who had long dozed off by the time the proceedings came to a close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-assembly-conducts-marathon-sitting-of-17-hours-till-4-30-am-101627643891656.html

30-07-2021||Pune||Global village idiot: Everyday things we miss about pre-pandemic life in Pune||I miss being stranded at an airport. Miss it. Miss sitting there, staring at the flight information boards, as if my staring would change the weather and get my flight to take off on time. Miss walking aimlessly past the same stores, miss being bored out of my skull window shopping for the same kind of homogeneous branded luxury items. Miss sitting down at an airport bistro, ordering a shrimp chowder or a wholesome potato soup, just so that I can munch on the fresh-baked warm slabs of bread. When I first started flying being at an airport used to be a test of patience. I was never sure what I was supposed to do, or how I was supposed to behave. But, over the last decade, I had come to a place where I very much enjoyed being at an airport, enjoyed being at home at an airport.I miss being on a flight. A long-haul flight. Short flights are fine to get where I want quickly, but long-haul flights are the whole point of international travel for me. Miss exploring the inflight entertainment system before the flight even takes off, just to plan what I will watch on the 16-hour journey. Miss setting up the aisle seat at the right inclination and keeping everything handy (book, blanket, headphones). Miss making friends with my neighbours. Miss reading the menu so I can anticipate the meals they will serve - anticipation is an important step to the enjoyment of a meal. Miss taking walks down the aisles and stretching in the galleys, catching up with cabin crew, learning about their backgrounds, processes, routines, aspirations, families. Walking an aircraft is a test of one’s memory, but for those in airline training, it is an opportunity to learn more about different aircraft and airline procedures.I miss going to a restaurant. Miss greeting and being greeted by the staff- there’s so much variety across the world in that simple minute of common interaction. Miss the table settings, the quaint cutlery, napkins and serviettes, the menus. Miss placing an order, miss the banter with the service staff - though that’s mainly in USA where it’s an art form. Europe has its own flavour of something in the vicinity of a banter, though not at all places; it’s not quite as natural in Asia, where it tends to be more based on familiarity or common culture, though the focus is to get the order done. Pune is an exception, except that you have to go to the little eateries in old Pune to enjoy the banter, where it flows as naturally and freely as a birth-right.I miss taking a walk down MG Road, going into Café Yezdan, and then onto the little shops selling home-made salami and sausages, circling back to East Street to grab a chocolate cake from Kayani (I like their Shrewsbury, but Ross bakes a mean chocolate sponge). I miss Jaws Cafe and the Jazz Garden and watching ‘live’ bands give meaning to life. Miss the tinkling sound of conversation between sets. Miss the feel of a city night life. Miss listening to new artistes making their debuts, and miss waiting for the seasoned maestros to hit their peak in the wee hours at Sawai Gandharva festival.And that’s the way it’s going to be. A generation is often summarised by what they lament missing and I find that we are living in a moment that is seeing the passing of many things that many generations have liked, and are missing, and may forever miss from hereon. A way of life is passing, a sort of historical epoch, induced by the changes forced upon us by the coronavirus pandemic. And while the pandemic may wax and wane at its leisure, and governments may dance the dance to keep politics and economy suitably poised, life it is a changing for us, the common citizens of the very common world.And it is this change that is our ultimate test yet. We are all going through the same test in our own ways, but this is a different exam, a very different exam. Human societies have evolved and grown and changed and adapted in all ages and centuries; but usually, the changes and restrictions and difficulties happened to sections of society, and at different times, and in limited numbers. As of March 2020, almost all sections of all societies across the globe have experienced curbs on almost all activities that usually define a normal life. Simultaneously. And while curbs are being lifted, it is sporadic and random and very dependent on the level of development and financial ability of each nation. Governments are going to do what governments always do: negotiate with each other to find the best possible terms for their peoples.For the common individual, the option is a complete reinventing of daily life and priorities. And it is much tougher to reinvent without realisation that it’s not a temporary situation. Which is why I started by listing all the things I am going to miss as a way of life.Yep. This is a very different exam I am sitting for. It’s taken me 16 months to realise that. I wonder how long it’ll take me to figure out the questions…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-everyday-things-we-miss-about-pre-pandemic-life-in-pune-101627642271471.html
30-07-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: What does Karnataka’s new CM like to dine on?||What does Karnataka’s new chief minister, Basavaraj Bommai like to dine on, I asked my journalist friends in Bengaluru. Through a variety of channels, the answer was the same. He likes Uttara Karnataka’s banana leaf lunches. The ingredients are well-known: jolada-rotti (jowar rotis), badanekayi palya (brinjal sabzi), kadalekai chutney (groundnut chutney) and curd. The CM “used to eat non-veg ten years ago, but now is a pure vegetarian,” his office says.North Karnataka or Uttara Karnataka looms large in the food memory of Bangaloreans. Its green forests, verdant vegetation, delicious foods and gentle people are revered in poetry, prose, the books of Kuvempu, movies and music. The food in Uttara Karnataka in particular fits all the flavour profiles that make Karnataka cuisine special. It is both robust and subtle, incorporating masalas that are doused over meats and vegetables. There are also a variety of salads, called kosambari, that are served with meals. There is a dizzying array of pickles, enough to make Andhra Pradesh jealous. Then there are powders, condiments and sandige or fritters.In Bengaluru, there are many humble darshinis or eateries where you can have the famous jolada-rotti with all the aforementioned accompaniments. I recommend Kamat Yatrinivas in Gandhinagar, if you can find parking. The last time I ate there was before the Covid-19 pandemic. On the top floor here around lunch time, you are shown a table without a word. The items are then served one by one by men carrying those stainless steel vessels where one handle carries four containers. Being a hotel, these men offer more items than the simple home-food listed by the CM’s office.Here at Kamat, there are two powders, one deep brown made with black sesame seeds and other reddish one with ground peanuts. There is chutney with groundnuts and coconut. There is some raita, the famous Karnataka kosambari made with yellow moong dal, shredded carrot, chopped cucumber garnished with black mustard seeds, green chilies, and if you like, diced coriander. There is also a soppu saaru made with greens. Saaru in kannada is some sort of gravy, like sambhar. There is also a dal-type preparation, usually made with sprouted green moong, which is very healthy.The prime mover of this meal is the famous jolada-rotti made of jowar flour. At Kamat, you can peek behind the dining room to see industrial quantities of jolada rotti being prepared by two or three persons. One rolls deftly and the other tosses it over the griddle at lightning speed. It puffs up and is then served. White in colour with a low glycemic index, this is a great bread for those with diabetes. There is usually a slab of butter that is offered with the jolada-rotti.If jolada-rotti is the Gangubai Hangal of Karnataka meals, the accompanying tabla player, Sheshagiri Hangal in Gangubai’s case, is the badanekayi ennegai. This literally means stuffed brinjal in oil (enne means oil). It is a luscious spicy preparation, that is vaguely reminiscent of paneer butter masala. There are those who argue that jolada-rotti is not the main player but the side dish. After all, the jolada-rotti only transports the delicious stuffed brinjal from leaf to mouth, they say. But these are quibbles. One cannot exist without the other. They are like pita bread and hummus, a symbiotic relationship that sings.The brinjal that is used for this is the matta gulla, the tender purple ones with streaks of white. This is stuffed with a masala and then cooked in a gravy made with ground coconut and a variety of spices. If potatoes define Punjabi cuisine, then the brinjal defines Karnataka food. They make a variety of dishes with this vegetable.Bommai hails from north Karnataka, from the Hubli-Dharwad belt. I had assumed that he would pick the Dharwad peda, also very delicious. But it turns out that he is not very fond of sweets. There is another famous sweet from this region called Godhi Huggi, in which whole wheat kernels are cooked with jaggery, ghee, milk and garnished with cashew nuts and cardamom. It resembles the kheer or the payasam in consistency but tastes very different.One of my favourite dishes is called Karindi. It could give all the fermented foods that have become popular a run for their money. It is made with flax seeds which are lightly roasted and then grounded. Separately, you make a ginger-garlic paste. You cut some carrots and cucumber into long thin slices, add salt and turmeric and mix everything. You then add water and pour it into a glass jar. Cover with a piece of cloth and put a rubber band around it to hold it in place. You then place it under the sun till it reduces to half its volume. This will take a few days in north Karnataka. Then you can use this fermented karindi, which is spicy-sour, along with your regular north Karnataka meals. You may never look at Korean kimchi again once you try the Karnataka karindi.As for Mr Bommai, here is raising a jolada-rotti to you. May the roads of Bengaluru be less pot-holed in your government.Shoba Narayan is Bengaluru-based award-winning author.

Evacuation of people living in the Yamuna floodplains has also been stepped up.The water level in the river was recorded at 205.10 metres at the Old Railway Bridge at 6am on Friday, an official from the irrigation and flood control department said. After that, the level gradually started to rise by reaching 205.17 metres at 7am, 205.22 metres at 8am, and finally reaching 205.33 metres at 11am.A flood alert is issued when the Yamuna river surpasses the ‘warning mark’ of 204.50 metres.#WATCH | Water level of river Yamuna crossed the danger mark following parts of Delhi received rainfallVisuals from Loha Bridge area pic.twitter.com/4bjzRIGtyLAs many as 13 boats have been deployed in different corners of the national capital, and 21 others are on standby, the official further stated. All concerned departments of the Union territory’s (UT) administration have also been alerted.Delhi Police and east Delhi district administration has been evacuating people living in Yamuna floodplains because adjoining Haryana is discharging more water into the river. These persons are being moved to shelter homes of the Delhi government in the Yamuna Pushta area, the official said.As per information from the Delhi flood control room, the discharge rate at the Hathnikund Barrage reached its peak at 1.60 lakh cusecs on Tuesday afternoon – the highest this year till now.

30-07-2021||Chandigarh||Papier-mâché to help promote Urdu in J&K||When art meets language, the result is colourful poetry. Kashmir’s traditional art of papier-mâché will soon be used to promote Urdu language and vice-versa. The National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language (NCPUL), New Delhi, and Craft Development Institute, Srinagar, have come together to offer a six-month certificate course in papier-mâché in Jammu and Kashmir. Also read: Tokyo 2020: PV Sindhu triumphs over Akane Yamaguchi to enter semi-finalThe first batch of 40 students will undertake the papier-mâché course in two shifts from October and the medium of learning will be Urdu. An important part of the initiative will be the focus on calligraphy. “The course will help students learn Urdu and they will also get trained in the art and skill of papier-mâché and calligraphy,” said SM Khurram, a research officer at the council. Skilling up for youngsters Papier-mâché is the detailed art of making different shapes of products using paper pulp and then painting those shapes. It involves the application of paper pulp over wooden moulds, sun drying, polishing and painting the final shape with rich colour motifs. The art is believed to have entered Kashmir with Sufi saint Mir Syed Ali Hamadani bringing artists with him from central Asia and teaching this art to Kashmiris in the late 14th and early 15th century. Earlier this month, skill development department secretary and Craft Development Institute director Nazim Zai Khan and NCPUL director Akeel Ahmad signed an agreement, finalising the execution of the course. “The signing is one step forward towards promoting Urdu through handicrafts, increasing awareness, knowledge, skill and employability of local youngsters with mutual understanding of both institutions,” a J&K government spokesman said. Technical, financial and linguistic help Khurram said that CDI has the technical expertise to run the vocational course, while the NCPUL will provide financial and linguistic help. “In the art of papier-mâché, calligraphy is also included. Nowadays, papier-mâché is widely used for decorating homes. The aim is that the students not only learn Urdu but also acquire a skill. So that they can earn after doing the course,” he said. Craft Development Institute faculty member Hina Qazi said that the students will get a skill set of all things related to papier-mâché besides learning about the language. “We are hiring master artisans of papier-mâché to teach the students besides other faculty. At the end, the students will produce products that will be exhibited,” she said. Khurram said that standard study material and books are being put together for the course. “We are translating some quality material and books by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Commonwealth Education Learning on papier-mâché from English to Urdu,” he said. Paper pulp to mesmerising motifs Papier-mâché is made using pulp from scrap paper that is first soaked in water and then beaten in a mortar using a wooden pestle. The paper paste is then given different shapes on a mould and dried in the sun. The raw moulded objects are then given a finish by artists using metal tools and then painted over with mesmerising motifs, colours and shapes. Calligraphy forms an important part of both the Urdu language and papier-mâché painting. Papier-mâché products include vases, boxes, trays, replicas of animals and birds and religious symbols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/papiermch-to-help-promote-urdu-in-jk-101627638312237.html
30-07-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka CM Bommai suggests mandatory testing, tightening borders to check Covid-19 spread in state||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said that there is a need to tighten the state’s borders and suggested compulsory testing for Covid-19 to check the spread of the disease in the state, as the daily Covid-19 infections have been increasing marginally over the week. Bommai is currently in Delhi to meet with the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his first visit to the national capital after assuming office.“We have to tighten our borders. We have to make compulsory testing and vaccination,” he told reporters before meeting Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, news agency PTI reported.Also read | Covid-19 R-value rising steadily in India; Kerala, N-E states tops listAlso, the CM will hold a video conference with the district collectors and health officials of Dakshina Kannada, Chamarajanagar, Mysuru, Kodagu, Chikkamangaluru and Udupi districts after his visit, to discuss the rising Covid-19 cases. He has already spoken with the collectors of Dakshina Kannada, Chamarajanagar, Mysuru and Kodagu regarding the matter, PTI reported.Currently, the passengers travelling by road are being checked. But those that are travelling by train also need to be tested for the disease, Bommai said. “We need to take measures to further strengthen our health infrastructure. The priority is to stop the spread of the disease,” he added. Further, the CM also directed the district collectors and superintendent of police to take up the responsibility of checking and said that he had already spoken to the state chief secretary regarding the issue.The CM's remarks about tightening the borders came as neighbouring Kerala is battling a high number of daily Covid-19 infections in the state. Additionally, the state is also tackling a Zika virus outbreak since earlier this month, in which more than 60 people have been affected so far.Meanwhile, since Monday (July 26), the single-day infections in Karnataka have remained above at least 1,500 cases. On Thursday, over 2,000 people tested positive for the disease as the total confirmed infections so far reached 2,901,247, a bulletin from the state health department showed.

30-07-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee’s national plans pose new challenge to CPI (M)||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s plans to form a coalition against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the 2024 national polls pose another challenge for the Left Front amid rumblings within the grouping following its drubbing in the March-April assembly elections. The Left Front lost power to the Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state after 34 years in 2011. It could not even win a single seat as Banerjee swept back to power for the third time in May.Cracks have emerged in the Left Front as its constituents have blamed the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M)’s election strategy, especially the decision to forge an alliance with the cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front, for the latest electoral debacle. The alliance raised questions about its secular credentials even as Muslims voted for the TMC en masse.Also Read | Bengal govt to set up mangrove resource centre in SunderbanAgainst the backdrop of Banerjee’s efforts, the Communist Party of India (CPI), one of the main constituents of the Left Front, has adopted a resolution saying it will support any party or platform that challenges the BJP and considers it the main adversary. “Our central and state leadership have resolved in back-to-back meets that the CPI will support any party or coalition that treats the BJP as the main threat...wants to overthrow it. It does not matter if the Congress or TMC or regional forces such as the Samajwadi Party are in such a coalition,” said Swapan Banerjee, CPI’s state secretary.The resolution comes as the TMC has tried to reach out to Congress even as the latter contested the assembly elections with the Left parties. In 1996, the CPI (M) prevented Jyoti Basu, the then Bengal chief minister, from becoming the Prime Minister and also refrained from joining the United Front government at the Centre. The CPI joined the government, and its leader Indrajit Gupta became the Union home minister.Observers have cited the 1996 experiment and said joining an anti-BJP platform or supporting one may help in the revival of Left parties.Banerjee has also asked the Left parties and Congress to decide who their main adversary is. “The Congress and the CPI (M) are responsible for what has happened to them in Bengal. They have to decide who is their principal enemy. Is it the TMC? Or it is the BJP?” she asked after meeting Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in Delhi this week.Also Read | PM unveils education schemes on NEP’s anniversaryNaren Chatterjee, the state secretary of the Forward Bloc, a constituent of the Left Front, said If Banerjee wants an anti-BJP platform, she should give more space to parties opposed to communal politics and capitalist imperialism. “Can we expect our candidates in the coming municipal and panchayat polls to get a level playing field?”Manoj Bhattacharya, the state chief of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, another constituent of the Left Front, said it is too early to read much into Banerjee’s intentions. “What she is planning may ultimately help (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi. It is too early to predict or take a call.”CPI (M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra this month focused his attack on the BJP and said voters were confused during the March-April polls. His party earlier accused the BJP and TMC of having a secret understanding. On July 27, CPI (M) leader Asok Bhattacharya told a TV channel that voters saw the TMC as the real anti-BJP force.On Wednesday, CPI (M) Central Committee member Sujan Chakraborty said there is no doubt the BJP is the main enemy but there is no question of having an understanding with the TMC. He blamed the TMC for bringing BJP to Bengal.Academic Udayan Bandopadhyay said the CPI (M)’s stand against the TMC has no strategic or ideological basis. “In the 2011 polls, when the TMC ended the Left’s 34-year-long rule, the BJP’s vote share was 4%. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP secured 17% votes because Left supporters voted for the BJP. The same thing happened in 2019, when votes that the Left lost went to the BJP. It is time for the CPI (M) to realise that TMC has been recognised as the only anti-BJP force in Bengal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-s-national-plans-pose-new-challenge-to-cpi-m-101627633150031.html

Officials said camera trap videos have helped them find out how the cubs learn to hunt in the wild. They added said they will continue to study their behaviour and monitor their growth over the next four months as it is rare for a male tiger to take care of cubs. “The survival of all the cubs without mother in the forest without any human interference is rare of rarest. This study will help us in learning more about behaviour of tigers,” said Alok Kumar, the principal chief conservator of forests.Also Read | BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur seeks renaming of localities in, around BhopalUK Sharma, the reserve’s field director, said the cubs have killed three animals over the last 25 days at night. He added seeing them with the tiger fostering them is a learning experience to understand the softer side of the tigers. “We found the cubs are unable to hunt by chasing the prey. As of now, they are attacking cattle resting in the forest at night.”The visuals have come as a relief for forest officials as they show the cubs are following a proper growth trajectory even though they do not have their mother to train them. Normally, a cub starts hunting in eight to 10 months.A second official, who did not want to be named, said normally a cub learns to prey under the guidance of the mother. “...after losing their mother due to illness, Tiger P243 is taking care of the cubs. He was hunting prey to feed the cubs and also taught them the skill of hunting,” said the second officer.Forest officials said they also noticed the tiger has started maintaining distance from the cubs. “Unlike earlier days when he used to be always with the cubs, the tiger has moved away from them to provide space to the cubs to learn the skill of surviving in the forest,” Sharma said.Camera traps have been installed in the area where the cubs roam around with the tiger to understand their behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/cubs-kill-prey-learn-to-survive-with-tiger-s-help-in-mp-s-panna-reserve-101627628588856.html

30-07-2021||Bhopal||BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur seeks renaming of localities in, around Bhopal||Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Pragya Singh Thakur has written to Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and requested him to rename half a dozen localities in Bhopal as per her promise to voters in her Lok Sabha constituency. “I promised my people that I will remove the blot... Some invaders came to India to destroy our rich culture and tradition. They distorted our history and changed the name of cities and other places,” she wrote.Thakur’s office said her request includes renaming Islampura as Jagdishpura, Idgah as Guru Nanak Tekri, and Obaidullahganj, a town near Bhopal, as Shivpur. Thakur has also sought the renaming of Bhopal’s Habibganj Railway Station after late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.“For generations, we never raised our voices against this suppression. But now I have decided to change the names of places which bring back only bad memories…. The names like Lalghati, which is named after a bloody war, and Halali Dam, which again embraces the idea of mass killing, should be changed immediately,” said Thakur.”Also Read | Madhya Pradesh says no admission for students facing criminal chargesBJP legislator Rameshwar Sharma, who has echoed Thakur’s demand and has been visiting these localities and telling people to use the new names, said they did not need the government’s approval for renaming them. “Did the invaders take our permission before changing the name of our cities and why do we need any. We are renaming the places according to sentiments of local people.”Congress legislator Arif Masood, who represents Bhopal Central in the assembly, said if they want to change names because of bad memories, then maybe they should start with the name of Kurukshetra first where thousands of people died in a war. He called the demand for renaming places “petty politics” to divert attention from the real issues including deaths due to Covid 19 and poor health infrastructure. Masood said they have asked the chief secretary to stop the renaming exercise that has been started.State urban development minister OPS Bhadoria said a committee considers proposals to change names of places. “This committee follows the due processes and takes into account comments from experts and the public so that members of any community do not feel offended. Their voices will also be heard.”BJP spokesperson Hitesh Bajpai said Thakur’s demand is harmless. “Everybody has the right to raise such a demand. Thakur won the (2019 Lok Sabha) election as people voted for her and now, she wants to rename some bad names. What is wrong with it? Who wants to live at a place called Lalghati, where invaders killed a son of Rani Kamlapati and covered the whole area with blood?”Syed Anas Ali, who leads a forum dedicated to the promotion of the city’s heritage, said Thakur and Sharma were targeting places associated with a particular community. “This renaming should stop here otherwise young generation will never know about the real history of Bhopal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/bjpmpseeks-renaming-of-localities-in-around-bhopal-101627623848221.html

Following the judgement, the Orissa high court had filed a writ petition suo motu in cases of Chilika lake and Bhitarkanika National Park. The high court then issued orders to the state government in January 2019 to evict prawn farms from these two wetlands.During the hearing of the PIL filed by the court suo motu in 2017, the high court found that the satellite verification of the areas of the Chilika under encroachment of prawn gherries was far more than what the district administration submitted in their affidavits.While Puri district collector had reported area under illegal prawn culture was 15,827 acres,satellite verification showed 25,870 acres in the lake was encroached upon. In Ganjam too, satellite verification showed more area being illegally farmed than what the district collector mentioned in his affidavit.Amicus curiae in the case Mohit Agrawal said while Kendrapara district reported presence of 391 acres of illegal prawn culture around Bhitarakanika National Park, the satellite verification would make thing clear as to how much area was under encroachment. The amicus curiae points said satellite verification in Kendrapara district has still not been undertaken despite high court orders on May 31.During the hearing, the amicus curiae informed the court that illegal prawn gheries were eating up mangrove forests, which played critical role in preventing storm surges during cyclone. He said unless equipments such as diesel generator sets, aerators, water pipes and electricity wires are seized, the illegal gheries would in all likelihood spring up at the same place soon after their removal.The amicus curiae told the court that to save Chilika and Bhitarkanika wetlands, it is necessary to lodge criminal cases so that the encroachment and pollution activities did not recur.Farmers in Bhitarkanika have long been protesting the illegal prawn gheries which they alleged are destroying the biological diversity of the sanctuary. They alleged that injections for protection and growth of the prawns is destroying the fertility of the soil and contaminating the water bodies as the harmful antibiotics and chemicals like chloramphenicol, neomycin and sulfamethoxazole are getting into the waters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/orissa-hc-orders-satellite-mapping-of-illegal-aquaculture-around-bhitarkarnika-101627618267454.html

30-07-2021||Chandigarh||Woman held for duping couple of ₹87 lakh for Chandigarh Housing Board flat, booth||A woman, who duped a couple of ₹87 lakh after promising to get them a Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) flat and booth through her connections with the UT administrator, has been arrested. The accused, Manjit Kaur, a resident of Sector 49, was nabbed on the complaint of city resident Madan Gopal Gupta.Gupta’s advocate complained to the police that Manjit told his client and his wife that she was close to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore and also a member of the CHB allotment committee. Assuring them of a meeting with the board officials, she offered them an MIG flat and booth in Sector 51 under the senior citizen quota against a payment of ₹87 lakh.To deposit the payment, she gave her own bank account number and assured the couple that she was authorised to allot the properties resumed by the board. However, despite making the payment, no flat or booth was allotted. Therefore, Manjit was booked under Sections 420 (cheating) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested. Police also recovered fake documents showing her as a member of the CHB committee and authorising her to make allotments.The complainant alleged that Manjit had got a temple constructed in Sector 51, where she used to meet devotees and makes false allotment assurances. “She is aware of the resumed properties in the city and thus used to defraud people after taking them to visit the flats and booths,” the complaint stated. According to police, Manjit was previously also booked for duping a resident of ₹1.30 crore. She was presented in court and sent to two-day police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/woman-held-for-duping-couple-of-87-lakh-for-chandigarh-housing-board-flat-booth-101627589759651.html
30-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab focuses on first vaccine dose despite Centre’s directive to prioritise the second||Punjab continues to focus on administering the first Covid-19 vaccine dose even as the Union government has asked the state to inoculate people with second jab on a priority basis. Of the fresh 2.5 lakh vaccine shots the state received following the Centre’s directive, more than half were used as the first dose. On Wednesday, 46,435 jabs were given for the first dose and 44,755 as second. Of a total of 1,02,291 doses given on Thursday, 54,913 were first doses, the health department’s media bulletin revealed. This despite the fact that the state health department had directed the officials concerned to administer 80% of the total jabs for second dose following the Centre’s instructions. Citing a communiqué from the Union health secretary, the Punjab health director had written to all civil surgeons to shift the focus to the second dose. The Union health secretary had expressed concern that the state was going “very slow” on the administering the second dose. “The CoWIN data as on July 17 shows that 9,36, 758 beneficiaries are due for second dose of Covishield and 78,062 beneficiaries are due for second dose of Cavaxin,” the letter read. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “The district heath authorities were asked to keep the second and first dose in the 80:20 ratio. But the figures from the last two days suggest that the ratio is nearly 50:50. A fresh advisory is being issued to them.” A senior health department official said of a total of nearly 97 lakh doses administered so far in the state, 35 lakh should have been given as second dose. “But the number is mere 19 lakh,” he said. Some experts have even suggested to the officials to stop giving the first jab to those aged below 45 for a few days and focus on the second dose only.Vikas Gupta, a 32-year-old employee with a Mohali-based private firm said, “I got the second dose on Wednesday after trying for 10 days. One can well imagine the plight of those who are not educated or cannot spare enough time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-focuses-on-first-vaccine-dose-despite-centre-s-directive-to-prioritise-the-second-101627589639223.html

The protesters under the banner of the Punjab-UT Employees and Pensioners Joint Front, started a protest march from the local grain market to Amarinder’s residence before they were stopped by police near YPS Chowk. Hundreds of police personnel from nearly 10 districts were deployed to maintain law and order situation in the city.Jagdish Singh Chahal, a convener of the front, said the pay commission has come up with ambiguous recommendations the state government is not bothering to reconsider before implementing them.“The government made false claims with the employees and pensioners of providing heft increments and allowances. Instead of increasing remunerations, the government has planned to impose salary cuts through the pay commission,” he said.The protesters also demanded regularisation of contractual employees, reimplementation of old pension scheme and release of pending arrears of dearness allowance. The government should stop rationalisation of posts in different departments and implement the state pay scales instead of central scales besides reducing the probation period of newly recruited employees, they said.The protest led to traffic jams on roads, especially those leading to the CM’s residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/employees-pensioners-hold-protest-march-to-cm-s-residence-against-6th-pay-commission-101627589579920.html

30-07-2021||Chandigarh||Defence accounts officer booked after home guard’s suicide bid in Panchkula||An Indian Defence Accounts Service (IDAS) officer was booked for misbehaving with a home guard, posted on traffic duty, after the latter tried to end his life in Panchkula on Thursday.The home guard, Piyush, claimed he took the extreme step after he was transferred at the behest of the officer for stopping her car for a traffic light violation in Panchkula on July 17.Haryana home minister Anil Vij also directed Haryana DGP (crime) Muhammad Akil to look into the matter.The DGP identified the female officer as Panveer Saini, currently posted at the North-West Headquarters of the Union ministry of defence (MoD) in Chandigarh.Piyush, who consumed poison in the suicide bid, was taken to the Sector-6 Civil Hospital, where he is out of danger.Talking to the media, Piyush said on July 17, he stopped a car after it jumped the red light. The woman sitting inside the car introduced herself as a senior officer and started arguing with him. When he tried to capture the incident on video, she misbehaved with him and tried to snatch his phone, obstructing him from doing his duty.Thereafter, the officer made some calls and within 30 minutes, he was transferred to police lines.“She jumped the red light and then misbehaved. She was wrong, but I had to apologise. Even then she made sure that I was transferred to police lines. On Thursday, she filed another complaint,” he said.Distressed for the past 12 days due to his transfer, Piyush said he could not tolerate the complaint filed against him: “My only misbehaviour was that I stopped the car of a VIP... They harassed me so much that I had to take this extreme step.” ACP Vijay Kumar Nehra said the home guard was transferred to police lines pending an inquiry. “The officer had complained against him. The traffic police cannot shout or argue with people. They should simply issue a challan if there is any violation,” he said.DGP Akil confirmed that he got verbal instructions from Vij to look into the matter. “A probe is underway into the officer’s complaint against the home guard. However, I also ordered an FIR for obstructing a public servant from duty. Another action is to be taken for violating traffic rules. Challan should be issued immediately,” the DGP said.The officer has been booked under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharging his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code, and her driver under the Motor Vehicles Act.The home guard also named a home guard official and blamed DCP Mohit Handa for his condition. “The home guard official always hurls abuses and uses vulgar language. But DCP Handa does not listen to us. Without knowing the full story, he punished me,” Piyush claimed. The DCP did not revert to calls.On these allegations, the DGP said, “An inquiry was underway against the home guard official as well. All facts will be looked into and appropriate action will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/defence-accounts-officer-booked-after-home-guard-s-suicide-bid-in-panchkula-101627589519306.html

He also asked them to go among the people to resolve their problems and popularise government schemes. The Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are due early next year.The chief minister, who arrived in Baghpat on Thursday morning, met party office bearers and workers. He discussed various issues related to the elections and demands of the people in the district. He advised the party workers to assist people and officials in dealing with Covid-19 and serve the people in mission mode.There is very less time left for the assembly elections, for which preparations should be started from now, the chief minister said, according to a BJP spokesman. During a meeting, BJP’s Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh sought approval of several development proposals for Baghpat and the CM assured him that all demands will be considered, the spokesman said, adding that Adityanath said the work on a medical college in Baghpat will start in December.After the chief minister’s helicopter landed at police lines around 11am, he went straight to the district hospital where he reviewed the facilities and interacted with doctors. He appreciated the efforts of the district administration and health officials in containing Covid-19 cases during the second wave and directed them to keep their preparations ready to deal with the possible third wave.Later, briefing him about issues and problems in the district, party office bearers demanded a roadways bus stand in Baghpat, conversion of the J V Jain College of Baraut into an agriculture university, expansion of the Baghpat sugar mill’s capacity, increase the state advisory price of sugarcane and clear the dues of farmers.The chief minister assured them that their demands would be taken care of.He directed the party office bears to be present at fair price shops of their respective areas where mega distribution of free ration would be done on August 5.He said that youths of Baghpat were hard working and a large number of them had been recruited in the police force because of their dedication.People were deprived of development for 60 to 65 years, but the situation changed when many schemes were implemented in the past seven years, he said.“The development and growth of Baghpat is visible now,” the chief minister said.

30-07-2021||Lucknow||Lack of cell phone towers: 143 areas in east UP’s Sonbhadra district in a blind spot||As many as 143 areas in Sonbhadra district of eastern Uttar Pradesh lack cell phone network towers, leaving many villages and even a few police stations in a blind spot from the communications perspective.Situated in picturesque surroundings, the Jugail police station in the district is one of those affected by the problem. As a result, police personnel like station officer inspector Arvind Mishra and others have to go 12 km to catch the cell phone signals from the nearest tower on a hill at Chaura in the Jugail area. Chaura is on the Uttar Pradesh-Madhya Pradesh border.“This is true. Jugail police station and the adjoining areas lack cell phone network. We have to go far from the police station to catch the network,” says Mishra.He adds that he can’t contact the beat constables when they go patrolling in the villages, neither are they able to get in touch with him. Machi is another such police station.Like Jugail police station, some of the 143 areas that do not have a cell phone network include Rampur Barkonia, Machi, Parsoi, Kanhara, Bairpur, Teritain, Pachpendia, Panaura, Aamdih, Chanani, Kuldomari, a few locations each in Ghorawal, Windhhamganj and Duddhi.At several of these places, the locals have to trudge four to five kilometres to catch the network.Mahendra Mishra, a resident of Gothani in Jugail area of Sonbhadra, says, “I have to go five km from my village to get mobile signals. Imagine the kind of ordeal we go through daily!”Jagat Vishwakarma, who often visits these locations, says residents in many pockets of Jugail, Maachi, Myorpur and Duddhi face inconvenience due to the problem.“Whenever I visit these areas, my cell phone becomes just like a toy due to the lack of a network. In many far-flung pockets, the mobile network comes and goes,” he says. Additional superintendent of police (Sonbhadra) Rajiv Singh says, “A letter has been written to BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd) for taking the steps required to provide a mobile network in the police stations in the far-flung and rough terrain of Sonbhadra.” Locals and police personnel flagged the issue before the district administration several times in the last few years. The Sonbhadra district administration has started efforts to resolve the issue of lack of cell phone networks in 143 areas of which 63 are on tough terrains in far flung pockets, says a senior official. District magistrate Abhishek Singh held a meeting with BSNL officials recently and asked them about measures to address the issue, says the official. A senior BSNL official told them a survey was carried out at the instructions of the then district magistrate S Rajalingam by a team of officials with technical expert of BSNL over nine months ago to find out if there was a really lack of mobile network in several pockets of the district. The survey revealed the need to install 143 cell phone network towers in the remote areas.Chief developmental officer (Sonbhadra) Amit Pal Sharma says, “Mobile network towers will be set up in the far-flung areas of the district in near future. Various steps have already been taken.” Sharma says district magistrate Abhishek Singh is taking keen interest in addressing the problem and things are moving fast.A senior official says the communication required for setting up the towers has already been done with the department of telecommunication and the Union ministry of home affairs through the UP government. The officer says the district administration is mulling over using funds from District Mineral Foundation (DMF), if required, for setting up the towers. According to a senior official of the telecom department, on an average, it costs around ₹80 lakh to set up a mobile tower. Junior telecom officer (Sonbhadra) DK Singh says, “The department will provide technical support required for setting up mobile network towers in the remote areas whenever the district administration asks for it.” Soon after towers are set up, the network problem will be solved, he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lack-of-cell-phone-towers-143-areas-in-east-up-s-sonbhadra-district-in-a-blind-spot-101627588859424.html
30-07-2021||Other||Scrapping, revising PPAs will be an uphill task||Patiala The Punjab government’s direction to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to revise/cancel Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with independent power producers is likely to be an uphill task on the two major counts of legality and financial implications. In terms of money, the agreements provide for the PSPCL to bear fixed costs of power generation for three years, before it can terminate the contract. This amount, say experts, will be astronomical and run into thousands of crore rupees. Legally, the agreements are so loaded in the favour of the private companies that a challenge to Punjab’s action will definitely be upheld, experts claim. In Andhra Pradesh, the Supreme Court has rebuked the state government over the scrapping of similar PPAs. A PSPCL official told HT, “In a letter to the Andhra Pradesh chief secretary, the Union power secretary has advised the state to desist from revisiting PPAs in the renewable energy sector, citing the hit on investor confidence and he country’s renewable energy targets. We have to keep this in mind.”Punjab failed to act on previous legal opinion Even as the PPAs, signed during the previous government, have been long flagged as lopsided and faulty, the state government failed to act on two previous legal opinions by its advocate general Atul Nanda. In his latest opinion tendered in the first week of this month, Nanda had observed, “Before I enter into a legal examination on the queries of law, I must record my concern as to the manner in which these PPAs have been structured and signed. The language of both these PPAs puts the PSPCL in an extremely weak bargaining position, loaded with astronomical fixed charges, with all rights under the agreements tilted in favour of private power producers. The documents reads like a one-sided agreement in favour of the private power producers and against the PSPCL.”“On February 18, 2020, I had given a detailed opinion with regard to two PPAs, signed with the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited and Nabha Power Limited, where I had pointed out the error/irregularities in the power requirement, quantities, based on which those PPAs were wrongly entered into. I had also, in detail, advised legal steps to reverse the financial effects of those PPAs,” he observed.“Under these agreements, Punjab is to pay exceptionally high fixed charges to private thermal plants at Talwandi and Rajpura; much higher, when compared to the Reliance Energy owned thermal plant at Sasan. This plant was set up around the same time and is of a similar make as of Talwandi Sabo,” said Vinod Gupta, an expert in power sector and spokesman, All-India Power Engineers’ Federation.“We have started due diligence and a team has been tasked to study the PPAs and present a report within the next week,” said A Venu Prasad, chairman and managing director, PSPCL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scrapping-revising-ppas-will-be-an-uphill-task-101627588379038.html
30-07-2021||Lucknow||Nadda asks Uttar Pradesh BJP MPs to counter Opposition criticism on farm laws||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Thursday tasked the second batch of party MPs from Uttar Pradesh (UP) with countering Opposition criticism against the new farm laws and to visit the rural parts of state with achievements of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and Yogi Adityanath government in the state. The move comes in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, which are due early next year.On Wednesday, Nadda and chief minister Yogi Adityanath had addressed the first batch of party MPs from UP at Delhi’s Constitution Club.The party chief had then tasked MPs and the newly appointed Union ministers from the state with taking out Jan Ashirwad Yatras, possibly from August 16. Emerging from the Thursday’s meeting, the newly appointed Union minister of state for housing and urban development Kaushal Kishore said BJP MPs would talk of the achievements of the Modi-Yogi governments and expose the “opposition canard” on issues, including farm laws. Kishore is the BJP MP from Mohanlalganj on the outskirts of Lucknow.Asked about Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait’s statement that if the government did not budge on farm laws, farmers would converge on Lucknow, Kishore said, “This isn’t a statement by a farmer leader. It’s a statement by Rakesh Tikait who doesn’t represent all the farmers.” All the new ministers, including Maharajganj MP Pankaj Choudhary, were tasked with taking out yatras.“All of us would visit at least three to four Lok Sabha areas other than our own and talk about our government’s achievements,” said SP Baghel, the BJP MP from Agra who was made Union minister of state for law and justice earlier this month. Earlier at the meeting, chief minister Yogi Adityanath also urged the party MPs to effectively counter the Opposition. “Adityanathji spoke of how sugarcane dues of a record number of farmers have been paid over the last four-and-a-half years in UP and blamed the Opposition for misleading farmers on farm laws,” a party MP said after the meeting. A BJP booklet ‘Iradey nek, kaam anek’ too was given to party MPs in which various initiatives of Modi-Yogi governments have been listed, party leaders said.Cartoon posted by official Twitter handle of UP BJP unit generates heatWhile the party MPs were being briefed by BJP top leadership in Delhi, a cartoon tweeted by the official twitter handle of UP unit of the BJP generated much heat with Opposition parties dubbing it a veiled threat to all opposition parties by the ruling party. The cartoon on farmers’ protest showed a character named bahubali alerting another person carrying a mace on which kisan andolan (farmers’ agitation) is mentioned, advising caution while visiting Lucknow where chief minister Yogi Adityanath sits. The BJP clarified that the cartoon wasn’t against farmers.“Having run out of issues, the Opposition is now picking up non-issues. The cartoon has nothing to do with farmers and actually had the Opposition been in right frame, they would surely not have picked a cartoon to make a political issue,” said UP BJP’s social media coordinator Ankit Singh Chandel. “There was nothing political about the cartoon but yes, if one wants to know the larger message, it is this: Our governments are pro-farmer and have repeatedly said they are willing to discuss any issue. But, at the same time, those who are trying to defame the farmers should remember that there is rule of law in UP,” Chandel added. “This shows the BJP mindset. They are now even threatening farmers and all opposition,” said Samajwadi Party MLC Sunil Singh ‘Sajan’. UP Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi targeted the BJP.“BJP has lost the plot completely but the farmers who they are threatening now, would uproot them from power in 2022 UP polls.”Aam Aadmi Party’s Vaibhav Maheshwari too was critical of the cartoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nadda-asks-uttar-pradesh-bjp-mps-to-counter-opposition-criticism-on-farm-laws-101627588258886.html

30-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Door-to-door Covid vaccination trial run today||The Mumbai civic body has identified 4,488 bed-ridden citizens whom it will vaccinate at their homes.Its door-to-door vaccination will start on a pilot basis from Friday in the K/East ward, corresponding to the Andheri (East) area, said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday. This trial will help the civic body improve the drive when it kick-starts across Mumbai in the first week of August. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department said on Thursday, “We chose this area because it has more hospitals, especially the civic-run Seven Hills Hospital. In case of emergency after vaccination, we will be in a better position to rush beneficiaries to this facility.” “Through this, BMC will able to observe and enhance its procedures, when the drive becomes large-scale across Mumbai,” Kakani added. Over the past few weeks, the BMC has identified 4,488 beneficiaries across the city who are bed-ridden due to medical, and/or physical conditions. These have been divided into 216 health posts across 24 wards in the city. Each health post will cater to around 15 beneficiaries. Kakani said, “We are trying to identify clusters as well, to avoid wastage. If there is only one beneficiary per building or block, there are chances of wastage of the vial.” A team of three staffers, including a doctor, a nurse and a paramedic, will visit these beneficiaries in their homes. For 30 minutes after vaccination, the team will stay with the beneficiaries for observation. “We have a 30-minute observation period, which is crucial especially in cases where we are going door to door,” Kakani said. The prime concerns for BMC when doing door-to-door vaccinations is how to manage the 30-minute observation per beneficiary, while covering maximum beneficiaries to ensure an opened vial does not go waste. One vial has 10 doses of the vaccine. In a statement on Thursday, BMC said it will take help from non-governmental organisations as well during the door-to-door vaccination drive. On Thursday morning, BMC received 180,000 vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-door-to-door-covid-vaccination-trial-run-today-101627587779726.html

The state government, however, has not yet agreed to the Centre’s proposal of constructing covered godowns without tenure or rent/lease guarantee. Officers of the state’s four procurement agencies, the Pungrain, the Punsup, the Markfed and the State Warehousing Corporation, discussed the phase-out plan on Thursday. The idea is that 95 lakh tonne open plinth storage in Punjab will be done away in proportions of 25%, 35% and 40% over three years. Grain stored in open plinths are vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and the cost runs into crores.Of the state’s storage capacity of 262 lakh tonne, only 42 lakh tonne is covered under the private entrepreneurship guarantee (PEG) scheme of the Centre. These godowns are being run under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. “We asked for the Centre to give guarantee in terms of tenure and rent/lease as my department apprehended that otherwise there would be no takers among private players. The Centre turned down our proposal and asked us to build godowns without the guarantee, so we have started the process,” said Rahul Tiwari, principal secretary, food and civil supplies.  Tiwari added that the Centre was told that state can’t spend at least ₹4,500 crore for the approved capacity and had decided to involve private players. According to him, of the 63 lakh tonne storage capacity mandated by the Centre, 12 lakh tonne would be constructed and operated by the four state procurement agencies. For the remaining 51 lakh tonne, it is proposed that private players be involved. “Each agency has been asked to construct 1 lakh tonne storage capacity each year for three years, for which they would raise the funds,” Tiwari added. The department has decided to draw up a proposal and take it for cabinet’s approval, following which the tendering process will begin. Sixty locations have been identified for building covered godowns, and most of these are where open plinths exist at present. A storage capacity of 19 lakh tonne silos storage has also been sanctioned in the state for which a separate proposal is being rolled out. As 45% of the total (640 lakh tonne) foodgrain stock in the country is stored in Punjab (at least 300 lakh tonne) and there is no space in state godowns to store more, Punjab has also asked the Centre to increase movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-starts-process-to-build-covered-foodgrain-storage-of-63-lakh-tonne-101627587538565.html

The tourism department has been asked to start the steps that the team has recommended.”A senior ASI official said, “These are remains of the building which were constructed in the late medieval period of the Indian history of 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. It is made of Lahori brick with lime plaster.” Notably, Sikh Gurus’ period, the era of Sikh Misls and the Sikh empire coincide with this period. The official added, “The Punjab government must preserve these remains. We will be available for any help.”The government had razed this structure in 1988. Historians consider this structure as the temains of Gianian Da Bunga which was gifted by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to the family of Giani Sant Singh, the then head granthi of Golden Temple. Descendants of Giani Sant Singh have also claimed that this was their residence till 1988. SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur said, “The tourism department will send its team for a survey.

30-07-2021||Chandigarh||IIT Ropar picked to ready DPR for upgrade of Chandigarh’s waste processing plant||Stepping up the process of upgrade of the solid waste processing plant in Sector 25, the general house of Chandigarh municipal corporation on Thursday awarded the work of preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) and request for proposal (tender document) to IIT Ropar. The IIT will be submitting the report within a month and a half. MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “The IIT has sought three months for submission of the DPR and request for proposal (RFP) but we expect it to be submitted in a month and a half.” Earlier, the MC had sought quotations from Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Chandigarh, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, and Thapar Institute of Technology, Patiala. Thapar Institute didn’t participate, but PEC and IIT Ropar submitted their quotations. The MC opted for IIT Ropar’s bid as it was lower than PEC’s. While PEC sought ₹80 lakh for the work, IIT Ropar submitted a quote of ₹26.77 lakh, plus institute overheads (20%) and taxes (18%). During the debate over the issue in the house, joint commissioner Sorabh Arora, said, “IIT Ropar has better experience in preparing such DPRs and RFPs. It has been associated with the Punjab government on such issues.” DPR of dry, wet and horticulture waste IIT Ropar, along with its quotation, also submitted that it would formulate a DPR and RFP for conversion of dry waste into energy technology, for wet waste management at the existing composting plant by enhancing its capacity and for the processing of the horticulture waste. It will also explore other technologies for horticulture waste management. It will make technical and financial assessment of the project. After finalisation of DPR and RFP, the MC will float tenders and then allot the work. After more than a year of debates, presentations and study tours, the MC General House on July 15, in special house meet, finally had decided in favour of “waste to energy” technology for upgrading the solid waste processing plant in Sector 25 (Dadumajra). In the meeting, it was decided that the MC would seek quotations from IIT Ropar, PEC and Thapar Institute for preparation of the DPR and RFP for the project. The city produces 550-600 metric tonnes of waste daily. Of this, around 200 MT is dry waste, 150 MT is wet (kitchen) waste, mixed waste is 75MT and horticulture waste runs into 100 to 125 MT. However, the plant’s current waste processing capacity is only 70-80 MT. In June last year, the civic body had taken over the plant from the Jaypee Group due to its inability to process the waste completely. But since then, the MC has neither improved the plant’s working nor upgraded the technology and most of the daily waste is still being dumped at the Dadumajra landfill. MC to construct ₹76.40 crore banquet hall The fund-starved MC on Thursday decided to construct a banquet hall after razing the existing Janj Ghar in Sector 47. The banquet, fitted with latest amenities, will have ground, first and second floor. There will also be a basement for parking of vehicles and other purposes. The MC will seek funds from the UT administration or ask the administration itself to build it. The MC has already approved a banquet hall in Industrial Area, Phase 1, but the work is still to start due to fund crunch. When Congress councillors objected to it, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma assured that the MC will get funds from the UT administration. Commenting on the need for the project, councillor Davesh Moudgil, “People will no longer have to go to Zirakpur. MC will also earn revenue from it.” The MC House also decided to undertake special repair and maintenance of back service lanes in Sector 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 at a cost of ₹3 crore. BJP, Congress spar over attack on mayor Heated exchange was witnessed between Congress and BJP councillors when the latter alleged that the Congress was behind the attack on mayor and senior BJP leader Sanjay Tandon in Sector 48 on July 17. Moudgil said to Congress councillors, “Don’t turn democracy into mobocracy. Congress workers were in the mob that attacked the mayor.” Joining him, BJP councillor Gurpeet Singh Dhillon, said, “I am a farmer. Farmers don’t indulge in such shameful acts.” Mayor Sharma added, “Jawab toh humme har tarha ka dena ata heipar hum Constitution ke saath chalte hei (we can give a fitting reply, but we go by the Constitution)” In response, Congress councillor and leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla, said, “Such attacks should not happen. But what about the atrocities committed on farmers. What about their rights being taken away?”“For the last six months, they are sitting in Delhi, but the government is not listening to them,” said Satish Kainth, Congress councillor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/iit-ropar-picked-to-ready-dpr-for-upgrade-of-chandigarh-s-waste-processing-plant-101627586699289.html

While rescuers trawled through debris on Thursday in search of survivors, a senior police officer said, “Chances of finding any survivors look bleak.” According to Jammu and Kashmir Police, 19 people are missing. “Though our rescue teams are continuing with their search operations, the missing are feared dead,” he said. On Thursday, teams of SDRF, NDRF, police and army couldn’t find any survivors or bodies. Till Wednesday evening , seven bodies were retrieved and 17 injured were rescued. Among the 17 injured, six were shifted to Kishtwar district hospital in view of their critical condition. “They removed trees that were uprooted by the flashflood with bare hands and ropes. Rescuers also used shovels to trace missing persons beneath the debris but it is a difficult task as thousand metric tonnes of rubble has accumulated there and earth movers cannot reach the village,” said the officer. Honzar village has no road connectivity and it takes five hours of trek to reach the village from the nearest road. There is no mobile phone connectivity in the area as well. Additional director general of police Mukesh Singh accompanied by Jammu divisional commissioner Raghav Langer reached Honzar on Thursday to take stock of the situation and review the ongoing rescue and relief operations. The police have established camps at Dangadooru and Soundar for dispatch of relief and rescue materials for the flood-affected people of Honzar. Special teams for this purpose have been formed and deputed from the Kishtwar police lines. Early this morning, another SDRF team was airlifted in an IAF helicopter from Jammu Air Force Station to Kishtwar for the ongoing rescue operation. “Another joint team of NDRF and SDRF personnel, which left at 0545hrs from Jammu via road, reached Kishtwar and is heading to the affected village,” said a police spokesperson. “One more team of SDRF and NDRF personnel with rescue equipment took off from technical airport Jammu and landed at Kishtwar by 1220 hrs. They have also reached the affected village and have joined the search operations,” he added. Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “In spite of prevailing bad weather, three helicopters of IAF — one each from Jammu, Udhampur and Srinagar — were utilised for airlifting SDRF and NDRF teams to Kishtwar.” “Simultaneously, evacuation of critically injured people was done from Sondar to Kishtwar. The helicopters flew eight sorties ferrying 44 NDRF personnel, four medical assistants and recovering two stretcher patients from Sondar,” he added.

Some of the key issues that appear on the document are justice in desecration cases, power tariff, drugs and red tape.Sidhu, who was in Jalandhar on Thursday, to hold one-on-one meetings with groups of workers from every assembly constituency, said, “Of the high command’s 18 points, I have picked up five issues, keeping my ear to the ground. These are justice in sacrilege and firing cases; tackling the drug menace; revocation of the three farm laws; cancellation of the PPAs and resolving issues of protesting employees to the unemployed.” “I am happy that there is some movement towards implementation of these five points,” Sidhu, who is an MLA from Amritsar East, said.  Sidhu termed the three farm laws as unconstitutional and an attack on federalism. “We have to resolve and tackle this issue of the three farm bills in our own Vidhan Sabha as well. We have to exhibit similar guts as we mustered on the issue of the SYL (Satluj Yamuna Link) canal.” Sidhu added that Punjab gives power subsidy of ₹10,000 crore, the highest in the country, to its farmers; Delhi, on the other hand, gives only ₹1,700 crore. “We also provide power at cheaper rates to our industries and commercial sector, than Delhi,” he claimed. Sidhu also attacked Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and former Akali minister, Bikram Singh Majithia for not tipping the drug menace in the bud. On his priorities as the Punjab Congress chief, he said, “My duty to build the reputation of government among the people.” Congress state working president and Urmar MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian; Congress MLAs of Jalandhar district including Pargat Singh, Sushil Kumar Rinku, Rajinder Beri, Hardev Singh Laddi Sherowalia, Bawa Henry, Chaudhary Surinder Singh were present during his visit.Three Kapurthala MLAs give the meeting a miss Of four MLAs from Kapurthala, Navtej Singh Cheema from Sultanpur Lodhi; Rana Gurjit Singh from Kapurthala and Sukhpal Singh Khaira from Bholath, gave the meeting a miss.

Similarly, many Chandigarh residents had died of the virus in other states or cities. The variation between the MC and IDSP data are not huge”, said Dr Amritpal Singh, medical officer, health, Chandigarh MC.Dr Amandeep Kang, UT director of health services, said, “We are investigating the death of every Chandigarh resident of Covid and also trying to find if anyone succumbed to the virus at home.

It also advised other CMs to follow suit because it is their duty to protect the rights and freedoms of the citizens as the Centre is not paying heed to opposition’s demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the alleged phone tapping of politicians, journalists and other eminent personalities using Pegasus spyware. The editorial in Saamana said that Banerjee has taken a “bold step” by announcing a probe into the snooping incident and has “awakened” others. On Monday, Banerjee had announced a commission of inquiry into the alleged surveillance of phones using the Pegasus spyware developed by Israeli company NSO Group. Retired Supreme Court judge justice Madan B Lokur and former Calcutta high court chief justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya have been appointed as members of the probe commission. “Her bold step is important. She set up a judicial commission and initiated an inquiry into it [the allegations of phone tapping]. She did what the Centre was supposed to do. In West Bengal, Banerjee fought like a tigress and won. CMs of other states should safeguard the rights of citizens and civil liberties. Banerjee has done the job of awakening all,” the editorial said. It added that it is “mysterious” that the Centre is not taking into consideration the issue of the alleged phone tapping of two Union ministers, some lawmakers, Supreme Court judges, officers of armed forces and journalists. “In this backdrop, Banerjee has given a jolt to the Centre by setting up a judicial commission for probe into the Pegasus row,” said the editorial. Slamming the Centre for not taking cognisance of the Opposition’s demand for a detailed inquiry into the Pegasus row, the Sena mouthpiece said that people of this country will see Pegasus as an “extension” of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax department. “The biggest threat to democracy is that the government does not want the Parliament to function and the issue to be discussed. The people of the country will see Pegasus as another associated branch of CBI, ED and IT department because the Centre is not taking cognisance of the issue,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mamata-banerjee-s-move-for-probe-into-pegasus-row-a-bold-step-shiv-sena-101627586218028.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Covid curbs in Maharashtra: Malls, eateries may reopen at 50% capacity||Malls, multiplexes and restaurants could soon reopen at 50% capacity in Maharashtra, while shops and establishments will likely get extended hours of operation. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met senior health department officials and state Covid-19 task force members on Thursday to look at easing relaxations in 25 districts, including Mumbai, where positivity and growth rates are low. A formal order on partial lifting of curbs will be issued in a couple of days, said state health minister Rajesh Tope. The government will hold further discussion with railway authorities on allowing the general public on suburban local trains in Mumbai.The minister said there was a “positive” discussion on easing curbs. The demand to allow the general public on suburban local trains has been gaining steam for some weeks now. There has been a demand to at least allow people who have taken both doses of the vaccine. The government is also looking at opening up trains for more categories. Also, it is facing a practical challenge of checking commuters’ vaccination certificates.“There were varied views with regard to local trains. Some said it should not be allowed as third wave is expected, while others said if trains are shut, then there is crowding in buses. So, our objective that transmission does not increase is being defeated. To allow those who have taken two doses [of vaccines] we will need a mechanism to check certificates. These challenges will be discussed with railway authorities and a decision will be made by the CM,” Tope said.Meanwhile, the state on Thursday recorded 7,242 cases and 190 deaths, taking the tally to 6,290,156 and toll to 132,335 respectively. The active cases in the state stood at 78,562. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 190,182 samples and had a positivity rate of 3.8%.State government officials added that the Covid Task Force members are not keen on opening up trains for people just yet. An official said that, the government should wait till a fortnight and see the trajectory of the Covid-19 infections in and around Mumbai before taking a decision on local trains.The relaxation are expected to come into effect from August 1, officials said.Currently, districts in the state have level-three restrictions, which involves tighter curbs with limited operational hours for shops and markets. Shops and bazaars remain shut on the weekends, while malls, theatres and multiplexes are completely closed. The opening of malls, multiplexes and dine-in restaurants will be subject to condition, including 50% occupancy and the staff/employees have to be fully vaccinated. “As per the earlier restriction [where shops and markets were] shut on the weekends. Now, it will remain open on Saturdays till 4pm. Positive discussions were held to reopen shops, restaurants, cinema halls with 50% capacity and with the employees being fully vaccinated. On the resumption of local trains, there were varied views. We will hold discussion with railway authorities and a decision will be made at the level of the chief minister,” Tope said after the meeting with CM and the task force members. He further said, “The operational timings of shops, which was till 4pm, will be extended to 8-9pm. Hotels and restaurants will have some restrictions, including capacity and their employees have to be fully vaccinated.” The state government in its order will also issue guidelines for reopening malls, restaurants, hotels, gymnasiums, places of worship and swimming pools. It will also provide guidelines for wedding, cultural, social and political events. Senior government officials said that there will be a cap on attendees for public gatherings, while use of enclosed halls, air-conditioned auditoriums will be discouraged. “Wedding, social, cultural events can have around 100 people. The CM will give decide in a day or two,” an official said.Even as 25 districts would get relaxations, 11 districts — Pune, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Palghar, Beed and Ahmednagar — will continue to remain in level-three of restrictions. “We are not providing any relaxation in Pune, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Palghar, Beed and Ahmednagar. If need be, local administration can decide to tighten the restrictions,” Tope said.He said that relaxations is necessary as several districts are reporting fresh cases in single digits and level-3 restrictions are detrimental for small business and economy. There has been mounting pressure on the chief minister from the allies and opposition alike to provide relaxations to keep the wheels of economy moving. “There are many districts where daily cases very low. At these districts, level-three restrictions is detrimental for small businesses. We need to strike a balance to move the wheels of economy and take precautions to follow Covid-19 protocol,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-curbs-in-maharashtra-malls-eateries-may-reopen-at-50-capacity-101627586098050.html

The Punjab State Welfare and Development of Scheduled Castes (Planning, Earmarking and Utilization of Financial Resources) Sub-Allocation Bill, 2021 will also enable the government to put in place an institutional mechanism to formulate and monitor the implementation of the Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan (SCSP), and matters connected with it, according to an official spokesperson. The legislation, when passed in the assembly, will provide the state government a platform to ensure the overall development of the SCs through effective implementation of various welfare schemes under the SCSP. Punjab has the highest percentage of SC population in the country at 31.94%. Reiterating his government’s firm commitment to the socio-economic and educational development of the SC population, the CM said the bill will give a big boost to his government’s efforts to ensure the welfare of this segment. The directorate of scheduled castes sub-plan would be the nodal agency to ensure formulation of SCSP, besides monitoring its implementation, the spokesperson said. The competent authority would also accord approval to the SCSP simultaneously with the state annual budget of the relevant financial year before submitting it to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. There would be a single mechanism for flow of funds under SCSP, and the finance department would remain the controlling authority for this purpose. The spokesperson said the progress of SCSP would be reviewed and monitored at state, district and block levels, as per procedure and by the committee as prescribed. Each department shall ensure transparency and accountability at all levels in the implementation of the SCSP. The efficacy of the legislation would be ensured by the systematic and exhaustive procedures on all aspects with respect to the formulation and implementation of the SCSP in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-gives-go-ahead-to-put-new-sc-welfare-bill-before-cabinet-101627585737930.html

The victim also held the post of general secretary in the district Congress (rural) and also headed the district youth wing of the party. Daljit was reportedly embroiled in a property dispute and had a police case pending against him.

30-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Passing of the poster boy||Lean and boyish, Old Delhi’s Shanky wasn’t famous like a Bollywood star, but was well known among the collectors of Bollywood memorabilia. He traded treasures for a bargain—once he even let go of a precious cinema ticket of the classic movie Mughal-e-Azam, when it first premiered in a Delhi theatre in the 1960s, for almost nothing. He died on 19 July due to “liver disease”. He was in his late 40s.A factory supervisor’s son, Shanky was a collector of Hindi movie posters—original and reprints. Dabbling with photography swept him into his life’s calling. Film distributors who operated in small towns would come to his photo studio in Maujpur to get their cinema posters touched with glossy colours. In 2006, Shanky shut the studio, threw away his Nikon and jumped into the “poster market.” He would scavenge the collections of “kabadi-wallas,” who scavenged the throwaway raddi (waste) from Delhi’s old-money bungalows. He started making trips to what he called the Bollywood Bazaar, in Mumbai’s Muhammed Ali Road. Within five years, Shanky became a key poster supplier to the city’s curio shops.Every Sunday, he would set up his stall at Daryaganj’s book bazaar. The bigger treasure was in his one-room house in the Walled City. Some original posters that Shanky always showed to his guests were of classics such as Kagaz Ke Phool (1959), Ab Dilli Dur Nahin (1957), Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977) and Raja Harishchandra (1913), India’s first full-length feature film. He also had movie catalogues (including of the Bollywood adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, with Mala Sinha as Ophelia), photographs of film stars (Mumtaz and Feroze Khan holding hands in swim suits) and a scrapbook filled with film-related news cuttings from newspapers.Shanky’s visiting card was printed with miniature posters of Sholay, Mother India and Mughal-e-Azam. His real name was Mohammed Suleman.It is incredible that a man of modest means single-handedly built such an enviable collection of precious souvenirs over the years. Even more astonishing was Shanky’s generosity with these treasures. Sometimes, he would give them away for almost nothing because he liked the purchaser or sensed that the enthusiastic person genuinely couldn’t afford the quoted price.Shanky has been buried in Dilli Gate graveyard. He is survived by his wife, Shahnaz, and three children. His elder son, Osama, 18, has taken over the business. “I feel sad about papa’s passing,” he says, “but I hope I can bring happiness to people as papa would do to his customers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-passing-of-the-poster-boy-101627585477144.html
30-07-2021||Other||Settled 1.5K MCOCA cases, builder held in case linked to Param Bir: Singh said: Mumbai Police||One of the two builders, who are believed to be close to former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, have claimed to have “settled” between 1,000 and 1,500 cases registered under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca) using their clout in the police department. The two builders were arrested by Mumbai Police on July 22.The police made the revelation before a metropolitan magistrate court on Thursday, while seeking the extension of the custody of the builders, Sanjay Punamiya and Sunil Jain. The duo is accused in multi-crore extortion cases along with Singh – now the director general of home guards – and five other policemen.A special investigation team is investigating the case under the supervision of DCP (local arms-1) Nimit Goyal. The five accused policemen, including crime branch deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Akbar Pathan, have been shifted temporarily to the local arms division to ensure that they do not interfere in SIT’s investigation. The accused’s claim of settling Mcoca cases was also recorded by the nephew of the complainant in his cell phone during one of his meetings with the accused. In the recording, Punamiya is also heard talking about the collapse of the Maharashtra government after Singh made allegations of corruption against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, the police said.“While seeking the extension of police custody of the two accused on Thursday, we informed the court that SIT officers are trying to find out against whom these 1,000-1,500 Mcoca cases were registered because it is a very serious issue as Mcoca is filed against organised crime syndicates and anti-national elements,” said special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap.SIT in the remand application also mentioned that the police have extracted 492 GB data from Punamiya and Jain’s seized mobile phones. The data consists of large number of suspicious documents, photos, audio clips of recorded conversations, call logs, chats and archive data. “The nature of this data is extremely sensitive in nature and can’t be disclosed in the open court,” read the remand application. The police are now analysing the sensitive data, a SIT officer informed the court. The police also said that the builders have multiple criminal cases against them and the duo are knowingly giving false information to the investigators to misguide them. The SIT members also wish to question the accused policemen with the builders to verify certain facts. The defence lawyer questioned why the complainant did not raise an objection when the settlement deed was being effected in the dispute. After hearing the prosecution and the defence, the court extended Punamiya and Jain’s police custody by seven days.Meanwhile, Pathan has filed a petition in the Bombay high court, seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) against him. The petition was heard by a division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, who were informed by advocate Niteen Pradhan that the cop was seeking interim protection from arrest. The court declined to grant immediate interim relief and said that it would hear the plea on Friday. While making remarks on the public prosecutors’ submissions that the police would conduct a preliminary probe in the case, the bench said, “If you think you will do a preliminary probe and keep lacunae in law open, it cannot happen like that. It is a serious matter. The petitioner is a senior officer (sic).”The SIT, which comprises of an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), four inspectors and an assistant inspector, is probing a FIR against Singh, who is a 1988 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, and the five other cops. The FIR was registered at Marine Drive police station, based on a complaint by a Bhayandar builder, Shyamsunder Agrawal. He had alleged that the Juhu police had filed a Mcoca case against him falsely accusing him of having links with underworld gangster Chhota Shakeel. Agrawal had claimed that based on this false case, Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of Punamiya, who is his former business partner. Singh is also facing multiple inquiries after he was shunted out from the Mumbai Police chief’s post in March over charges of improper handling of the Antilia explosives scare case. The Maharashtra criminal investigation department (CID) is probing allegations based on the complaint of cricket bookie Sonu Jalan and two others who have claimed that Singh – during his tenure as Singh Thane Police – and his subordinates had extorted money from the three. CID has submitted its inquiry report to director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey. Sources said another FIR on extortion may soon be registered against Singh. The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has also initiated an open inquiry against Singh pertaining to corruption allegations made against him by police inspector Anup Dange. ACB has issued a look out circular (LoC) against Singh’s friend Jeetu Navlani, who is also an accused in the complaint filed by Dange. Singh was booked in an Atrocities Act case in April on the complaint of an inspector from Akola Police. An FIR for extortion and kidnapping was also filed against Singh at Kopri police station in Thane last week.Singh is currently in on leave owing to some health conditions and is in his hometown in Chandigarh. He has not responded to the allegations made against him in the multiple complaints. After his removal as police commissioner on March 20, Singh wrote an explosive letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, claiming that Deshmukh had instructed controversial crime branch officer Sachin Vaze (who has now been dismissed) and other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore every month from the 1750 bars, pubs, hookah parlours and other establishments in Mumbai.Based on this allegation, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) started investigations against Deshmukh on charges of corruption and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/settled-1-5k-mcoca-cases-builder-held-in-case-linked-to-param-bir-singh-said-mumbai-police-101627585557489.html
30-07-2021||Chandigarh||Pearls Group ponzi scam: HC dismisses Bhangoo’s plea against custody to Chhattisgarh Police||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday dismissed a plea by Pearls Group CMD Nirmal Singh Bhangoo against custody to Chhattisgarh Police. A special court at Bemetra in Chhattisgarh in July had ordered that he be produced before it in a criminal case registered on defrauding people through a ponzi scheme. Bhangoo is accused of swindling of ₹45,000 crore from over five crore investors in different states. Bhangoo had challenged a Muktsar judicial magistrate’s order in the HC in which the jail authorities were directed to hand over his custody to Chhattisgarh Police. He had also challenged order on getting him examined at Rajindera Hospital, Patiala, which declared him fit for travel. Bhangoo all along has been citing his ill health against long travel. The high court bench of justice Meenakshi I Mehta criticised the role played by the jail authorities and local health authorities in helping him to “evade” transfer of his custody to Chhattisgarh Police. “The entire afore-referred sequence of the events unequivocally speaks volumes of the fact that the petitioner has abused the process of law by misusing his medical condition and strangely, the jail authorities as well as the authorities at the local civil hospital, also, for the reasons best known to them, seem to be acting in unison with the petitioner to help him out in evading his production at the above said special court,” the bench said, adding that this conduct on their part is “highly deplorable” because all the limbs of the system of the administration of criminal justice need to act and work in the required and desired manner so as to make it achieve the goal of its very establishment. According to the order, a sub-inspector of Chhattisgarh Police presented a production warrant before the superintendent of the jail, Muktsar, for its compliance but Bhangoo said he was not feeling well. He was medically examined at the local civil hospital and doctors opined that he was “unfit” for long travelling. The SI approached the judicial magistrate through assistant public prosecutor for getting his medical examination done and compliance of the Chhattisgarh court order as he raised suspicion over exercise by local health authorities and jail officials. Acting on it, the judicial officer ordered his medical examination upon which a team at Rajindra Hospital examined him and declared him fit for travel. But the jail authorities took him to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, for medical examination, from where he was referred to PGIMER, Chandigarh. On the court’s direction, he was examined at the PGIMER where the doctors’ panel declared him fit for travel. The court did not entertain his argument that the magistrate at Muktsar had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for transfer of custody as he was behind bars in connection with a case in Bathinda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pearls-group-ponzi-scam-hc-dismisses-bhangoo-s-plea-against-custody-to-chhattisgarh-police-101627585499265.html

On Thursday, Behal had parked his two-wheeler only a minute before the portion of the roof collapsed at the very spot. His two-wheeler was badly damaged.As seen in the CCTV footage of the incident, recovered from a camera installed nearby, Behal was barely 4-5 feet away from the collapse site.Even as the remaining portion of the building continues to pose danger to lives, the officials of the municipal corporation (MC) and the owner washed their hands of the responsibility to raze the unsafe building, stating that a case regarding the property was subjudice in a local court.Behal said, “The building was constructed in 1940 and a portion of it had even collapsed in 2013, but we are unable to raze the structure due to a sub-judice case. The old tenant had filed a case regarding possession of the building in 2013 and the court does not allow us to demolish it. If the permission is granted, I will be the first one to demolish it as I had a narrow escape on Thursday.”“I was opening the gate of my shop in the morning when the portion of the building collapsed suddenly. I was shocked, but fortunately no one was hurt. The building is deteriorating and we will present the pictures of the incident in court for getting permission to raze it,” added Behal. Meanwhile, the MC officials also stated that no action could be taken against the building due to the pending court case. Further the officials stated that the owner of the building would be held responsible for any untoward incident.Assistant town planner Mohan Singh said, “The MC cannot demolish the building due to the court case. We have already served notices to the owners of unsafe buildings in the city to get the structures demolished by themselves or they will be held responsible for any untoward incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/owner-escapes-injury-by-inches-as-building-collapses-in-ludhiana-101627585320731.html
30-07-2021||Other||Now, violators to receive e-challan for speeding on Ludhiana roads||To deter residents from speeding on city roads, the Ludhiana traffic police have launched e-challaning for violators.The decision was taken after the tragic death of three youths, including a girl, who died after their car plunged into the Sidhwan Canal on south city road on July 25.The traffic police already issue e-challans for jumping traffic signals and violating zebra crossing rules.The police are installing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) speed-measuring sensors to check vehicular movement, especially speeding. The machines also capture the image of the violating vehicle to generate challan. One such machine has been installed on the south city road as a maximum number of complaints of speeding have been received from that area, the police said.‘Sensor installed on trial basis’Joint commissioner of police (JCP, city and traffic) Deepak Pareek said that the machine has been installed on a trial basis. “The trial will be conducted for a few days and after analysing the results of the machine, more machines will be brought into use and these will be installed at different points on different roads of the city on a random basis.”The JCP added that as of now there are three such machines with the Ludhiana police commissionerate.The traffic police will keep changing the locations of the machine, so that it remains a surprise for the residents, forcing them to improve their habit of speeding.JCP Pareek said that this system will work the same way as the e-challaning process for jumping traffic lights and violating zebra crossing rules. “The device will record the vehicle number and the challan will be sent to the residence of the vehicle owner through post,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-violators-to-receive-e-challan-for-speeding-on-ludhiana-roads-101627585319796.html
30-07-2021||Chandigarh||Indianapolis FedEx shooter not racially motivated: Police||The former employee who shot and killed eight people, including four Sikhs, at an Indianapolis FedEx warehouse in April acted alone and was not racially or ethnically motivated, authorities said on Wednesday.Brandon Scott Hole, 19, used the April 15 attack as an act of “suicidal murder” and believed he would “demonstrate his masculinity and capability” while fulfilling a final desire to experience killing people, Indianapolis police and federal authorities said during a news conference.Eight employees, including four members of the city’s Sikh community, were killed in the attack and five others were injured, police said.Police said Hole considered other locations for the shooting but chose the FedEx building because it was familiar to him. He also believed the site would give him access to a large number of vulnerable victims.Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Indianapolis field office, declined to disclose other potential targets. “He knew the location well,” Keenan said. “He knew there would be a large group of people there that he would consider targets.”Hole had suicidal thoughts “almost daily” in the months prior to the attack and attempted suicide on “more than one occasion,” Keenan said. Although Hole had struggled with mental health stressors “throughout his life,” he had no previously diagnosed mental illness, and he did not share his plans for the FedEx shooting with family or friends.Hole was able to legally purchase the two rifles used in the shooting, even after his mother called police last year to say her son might undertake “suicide by cop.”Police seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole, then 18, in March 2020 after they received the call from his mother. Members of the Indianapolis Sikh community pressed local and federal law enforcement for months for an investigation into the shooter’s motive, emphasising concern that Hole chose a place known for hiring people of colour, specifically a Punjabi Sikh-majority.Important to recognise bias: Sikh Coalition Sikh Coalition legal director Amrith Kaur said that while “it’s impossible” to know Hole’s thinking, she was disappointed police did not release additional details about how they ruled out bias as a possible motive.“It is important to recognise that bias can be a factor in addition to these other issues,” Kaur said in a statement. “Though law enforcement has said this investigation is over, for all the families who lost loved ones, the survivors, the Sikh community, and anyone else impacted by hate violence, these questions will remain forever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indianapolis-fedex-shooter-not-racially-motivated-police-101627585318457.html

The UPEIDA has also completed 60 percent of the Chitrakoot- Delhi expressway.Chief executive officer, UPEIDA, Awanish Kumar Awasthi gave this information on second day of the virtual event “Indigenisation Summit on Defence and Aerospace” (ISDA) 2021 on Thursday. The UPEIDA is the nodal agency to execute the defence corridor project. The defence corridor would come up in Bundelkhand region and is expected to generate more than one lakh jobs. The corridor would have six nodes- Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow. On February 21, 2018, PM Narendra Modi had announced ₹20,000 crore defence industrial corridor in Bundelkhand—considered one of the most backward regions in the state.Speaking on the occasion, UP industrial development minister Satish Mahana, said: “Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, construction work of the expressway connecting Chitrakoot to Delhi is going on at a rapid pace and is almost 60 percent complete.” Mahana also said ancillary industries like food, infrastructure, textile and others would also grow as indigenisation in the armed forces increased. He said the government was also working with several public sector units like HAL, DRDO and others. Uttar Pradesh has nine ordnance factories which are controlled by the ministry of defence.The Yogi government has offered financial benefits for units in defence corridor willing to give year-long skill development training along with job to the youth. The government will pay ₹10,000 per month per youth to such industrial units which are willing to offer year-long skill development training along with job to a youth. Each unit will be entitled to train 50 such youths. As the defence corridor is aimed at generating more jobs for drought–hit Bundelkhand region, the Yogi government has offered capital subsidy for such industrialists that are willing to invest up to ₹10 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aligarh-node-of-defence-corridor-to-open-next-month-upeida-101627585200013.html
30-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra floods: CM meets officials from insurance firms, banks||A day after the decision over the relief package for Maharashtra flood-hit districts was deferred for want of clarity over the potential financial burden, the chief minister (CM) held meetings with officials from 11 insurance companies and bankers, asking them settle the claims immediately and give loans at lower rates. CM Uddhav Thackeray asked officials from insurance companies and banks to take a lenient approach towards the flood-affected people. The insurance companies have been asked to release 50% of the cover of traders and citizens immediately. The companies have also been told to complete the procedure and release the insurance claims at the earliest. Thackeray has also requested Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to direct the companies to consider the assessment done by the state revenue authorities for the settlement of the claims. In a letter to Sitharaman, Thackeray said that the flood-affected people from Konkan and western Maharashtra have been waiting for the settlement of the claims against the insurance of their vehicles, shops and houses. “The insurance companies have agreed to release 50% of the claim amount based on the assessment by the revenue department. However, they will need directives from the Central government to their headquarters and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. The Centre has previously given such directives during the floods in Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir,” the letter stated.Thackeray also asked banks to extend loans for the working capital at concessional rates to traders who have sustained losses in the floods. Banks have also been asked to give waiver to pay the instalments of their pending loans. Thackeray, in the letter, has requested Sitharaman for directives to the banks, too. Banks and insurance companies have also been told to make the procedure consumer-friendly while settling the claims or giving loans. They have also been asked not insist on any tedious process and documentation, considering the situation.State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that the government has asked the Centre to send its teams to assess the losses, at the earliest. He said that the disbursement of ₹10,000 per household as immediate assistance will begin from Friday.Meanwhile, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray faced the wrath of locals during his visit to Chiplun. A resident asked him what he has done as the environment minister. The resident pointed at the silted rivers which caused flooding and the prolonged work of the bridge on Vashishti river. “You please ensure that the rivers are desilted so that they would not cause the flooding. What have you done as environment minister? You should tour the affected areas on foot to realise the plight of the people and visit us at least once a month. People are not intimated in advance while discharging water from the dams and it causes the whole problem,” the resident told Aaditya during their interaction.He, however, heard the resident patiently and said the resident was right. Aaditya also assured the resident that take corrective action will be taken. Later he said, “The residents have every right to express themselves freely as they have been suffering all these days. In fact, we have been touring to understand their plight and what they have faced.” Thackeray also visited a few affected villages in Raigad district. He will visit flood-hit Kolhapur on Friday. After visiting the flood-ravaged villages in Raigad and Ratnagiri on Saturday and Sunday respectively, Thackeray was scheduled to visit Satara in western Maharashtra on Monday, but his helicopter could not land at Koyana Nagar due to bad weather conditions. A few state and national highways are still shut for vehicular traffic. The Goa-Mumbai highway between Khed and Chiplun is partially shut for heavy vehicles and the Ratnagiri-Kolhapur highway is shut in Amba ghat.Sangli collector Abhijeet Chaudhari issued a statement on Thursday warning citizens to take due care in the wake of the additional water discharge from reservoirs, keeping the forecast of heavy rainfall in mind. “To regulate the water level and keeping the potential heavy rainfall in mind, there could be additional discharge of water from the dams, leading to the rise in the water level in Krishna [river] by around 2 feet. The water level in Krishna river may rise up to 42 feet. The villagers and farmers on the banks of the river are warned to take due care,” Chaudhari has said.At 41.4 feet, the water level of Panchganga river receded below its danger level, which is 43ft, almost after a week. Its warning level is 39ft.Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis visited the flood-affected villages in Sangli on Thursday. He criticised the state government for the “delay” in the assistance to flood-affected farmers and villagers. “The state government should immediately release the relief without waiting to complete the formalities. The government has been pointing fingers at the Centre to shrug off its own responsibility. During our government, we had given relief to the 2019-flood affected people on an immediate basis,” he said.The death toll in the flood-ravaged districts since July 22 stands at 213, even as 52 people have sustained injuries and eight are still untraceable. Death of domestic animals stands at 398, while 60,882 poultry birds have been reported to have died. Around 435,879 people from eight districts have been evacuated to safer places, while 53,295 of them are staying in 349 shelters built by the government and NGOs.Half of the NDRF teams have been withdrawn from the affected districts and 16 NDRF teams and two army teams are stationed in seven districts for disaster response work, including Kolhapur (with six teams) and Sangli (with four teams) , which still have heavy rainfall forecast. The state government has deferred its decision of relief package to the flood-affected people as it is wary of the financial burden. “The losses are expected to cross well beyond ₹5,000 crore from the preliminary estimates of ₹4,000 crore. We have already hiked the compensation given to the affected people. Surprisingly, the losses to the crops in districts like Nanded, where severity of the rainfall was not as high as in western Maharashtra, have been reported to be more than 70,000 hectares (ha). We have also witnessed in the past that the figures of the crop losses are inflated extensively.In four districts of western Maharashtra, the losses to the crops, as per the preliminary estimates, is 111,648 ha, while it is more than 100,000 ha in eight districts of central Maharashtra. The total estimated crop losses is more than 350,000 ha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-floods-cm-meets-officials-from-insurance-firms-banks-101627585199534.html

AAP MLA and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema asked the chief minister if he and other Congressmen were sleeping for four-and-a-half years. “If the chief minister is really serious, he should immediately cancel the PPAs in the cabinet meeting and then through the assembly session,” he said at a press conference, promising the principal opposition party’s support in cancellation of power deals. Cheema claimed that this “game of letters” was another betrayal of the people of Punjab and a ploy by the Congress government to waste time. He also accused the CM of running away from convening the cabinet meeting, stating that no meeting of the state cabinet had been convened from the last 41 days. He also demanded that the assembly session should be convened immediately.The AAP leader said the CM’s letter proved that the demand for cancellation of power deals was absolutely right. On the recommendations of the group of experts led by Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Cheema said the committee wanted to end all subsidies, including electricity, given to the people of Punjab. The government reject the recommendations of the expert group through the assembly forever, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/move-on-ppas-aap-calls-it-ploy-by-punjab-govt-to-waste-time-101627585137862.html

Schoolgirls performed folk dances of Uttarakhand to welcome him and even pro-BJP slogans were shouted by some. Even the Gurbani, which is supposed to be played constantly at the gurdwara, was stopped for a while.All this did not go down well with the Sikh devotees, who lodged a complaint with the Akal Takht in Amritsar and gathered in Nanakmatta, demanding action against those responsible for the alleged act of sacrilege.Those who have resigned have been asked to present their side before the Akal Takht within 15 days after which a final call will be taken on the matter. A five-member panel has been constituted to look after the management of the historic gurdwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/violation-of-maryada-4-members-of-uttarakhand-gurdwara-committee-resign-101627584957829.html
30-07-2021||Lucknow||Gaming and learning mobile app by IIT-K grads an instant hit among masses||: Two IIT Kanpur graduates have developed a mobile phone game that boost learning while using interactive traditional games. The application Zupee, developed in 2018 by Dilsher Singh Malhi and Siddhant Saurabh, currently has more than 11 million users in India. “The platform focuses on improving learning abilities, skills and mental aptitude though scientifically designed mental exercises and gamification of day-to-day activities,” said Subi Chaturvedi, head corporate and public affairs for mobile applications. “Majority of these users are from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities with limited internet penetration. Our users not just take up skills like maths, language and general information but can also monetise their general know how,” added Subi. “Beside the focus on skill will also ensure internet hygiene by limiting the time spent by users in the game and pushing them to upgrading their skills,” she added. The application also provide platform to build communities of people with similar interest and boost their knowledge by gamification. “Learning new things or skill is far easier and effective when it’s done in a form of a game. This is the whole idea of the platform. We are also planning to use this aspect of learning new skills in rural pockets where the avenues to do so are absent,” Chaturvedi explained. The IIT graduates Dilsher Singh Malhi and Siddhant Saurabh, the developers of the game, were recently figured in the Forbes 30 under 30 Asia list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gaming-and-learning-mobile-app-by-iit-k-grads-an-instant-hit-among-masses-101627584897300.html

30-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s housing body blacklists 644 projects for delay in completion||In a major crackdown on errant builders, the Maharashtra Housing Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) has blacklisted 644 projects across the state for delay in completion. MahaRera has completely prohibited sale, advertising or marketing of houses of these residential projects. Incidentally, 80% of houses in these projects have been sold.Anarock Property Consultants, a real estate consultancy firm which analysed the data, has revealed that of the 644 projects, 16% were to be completed by 2017, while 84% had 2018 as their deadline. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) leads the pack with 274 (43%) of the total 644 blacklisted projects, followed by Pune with 189 (29%) houses. The remaining 28% (181) projects are in Nagpur, Nashik, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Satara, Ratnagiri and Sangli. Anuj Puri, chairman of the consultancy firm, called the step a positive move. “This move by MahaRera sends out a strong signal to errant developers who have been delaying projects incessantly. Homebuyers have been waiting to get possession since 2017 and 2018,” he said, adding that all these projects were being developed by local developers and not by any reputed or leading developer.Advocate Vinod Sampat said that it was now on flat buyers to take the call on the matter. “Flat owners need to come together and decide on the future of their project. They can call for new developer,” said Sampat.Dr Sanjay Chaturvedi, who deals with issues related MahaRera, said “MahaRera may now come up with the step of blacklisting these errant builders [of the blacklisted projects] so that they cannot take up any project in the future.” Since MahaRera came into existence on May 1, 2017, the state has registered 29,884 real estate projects, of which 24% or 7,245 have been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-housing-body-blacklists-644-projects-for-delay-in-completion-101627584837984.html

30-07-2021||Delhi||HC grants relief to man charged close to ₹12L for parking vehicle on public land||Granting relief to a man who was allegedly charged approximately ₹12 lakh for illegal parking and carrying out “commercial activity” in the public land, the Delhi high court said the civic body could not justify the grounds on which the man’s vehicle was seized and hence, cannot ask for the fine.The aggrieved man in the case, Rahul Kumar, moved court seeking release of his vehicle which was clamped and seized by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) in February this year after it received complaints from various agencies regarding illegal parking and commercial activity being carried out in the public land in front of the Shamshan Ghat at Geeta Colony.The civic body told the court that the petitioner,Kumar,was liable to pay a sum ₹11,99,830 as a penalty for committing the violations.In a judgment dated July 26, justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, while directing the civic body to release the vehicle, said, “Since there is no justification of the respondent (EDMC) in seizing the vehicle of the petitioner, it cannot demand any amount towards removal charges or storage charges of the vehicle…Clearly, the action of the respondent in seizing the vehicle of the petitioner and raising the demand of approximately ₹12 lakhs...for the release of the vehicle cannot be sustained.”The judge also said no show cause notice was given to the petitioner, requiring him to remove his vehicle from the public land or directing him not to park his vehicle on the said location. It added Kumar was not informed of the consequences of parking his vehicle on public land.The court said the civic body’s affidavit did not state as to what commercial activity was being carried out by Kumar on the public land. “No material has been placed on record by the respondent (EDMC) to substantiate the allegations that loading and unloading of goods was being carried out by the petitioner in the public place,” the court said.The judge also said that Sections 321 and 322 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act did not empower the commissioner to remove a vehicle from a public place unless such vehicle is “used for hawking or exposing for sale on any public streets or in other public place”.“The alleged commercial activity of loading and unloading goods in a public place by no stretch of imagination can be covered under the expression “hawked or exposed for sale” as used in section 322 of the Act,” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-grants-relief-to-man-charged-close-to-12l-for-parking-vehicle-on-public-land-101627584002882.html

However, the man’s autopsy report confirmed that he was attacked with a pointed weapon that could be an ice-pick. His brother also suspected a foul play and demanded that a case of murder should be registered, the police said.“We are analysing the autopsy report and further legal action will be taken accordingly. Our teams are scanning CCTV cameras installed around the place where the man’s body was found,” said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani.On Thursday afternoon, many traders and vendors from the Azadpur Mandi staged a protest and blocked the main road for nearly three hours, demanding justice for the dead vegetable vendor and quick police action into the case.The dead vegetable vendor, identified as Jitendra Yadav, lived in Moolchand Colony near Adarsh Nagar. He originally belonged to Sitamarhi in Bihar. Yadav is survived by his wife and two children.A police officer associated with the case said on the condition of anonymity that Yadav was walking towards Azadpur Mandi when the incident took place. “Our preliminary investigation has revealed that he was attacked by four men, who robbed him of his mobile phone and cash.

The institute said they are yet to receive any communication from the DoE, adding that it will wait for it to decide their next step.This is the latest in a series of actions against private schools allegedly hiking fee: on Wednesday, the education department said it initiated steps to take over Apeejay School in Sheikh Sarai for repeatedly failing to roll back the fee hike introduced by them in the last two academic years ; and on July 27,the Delhi government said it will take over the management of Swami Sivananda Memorial School in Punjabi Bagh.Following an “in-depth inspection of the financial statements” of Bal Bharti School for the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18, DoE officials found that the school had total fund corpus of ₹23.82 crore for the year 2017-2018, out of which ₹20.94 crore was estimated to be spent. “The school management had a net surplus of about ₹2,87,44,156. After this, DoE came to the conclusion that there is no need for the school management to increase the fees. In this regard, the directorate refused to accept the fee hike proposed by the school for the academic session 2017-18,” the statement said, adding that the department had also asked the school to adjust the increased fee.“…In the meantime, the Delhi government again received complaints from the parents that the school had increased the fees several times in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and further also asked [parents] to deposit arrears,” the statement said.The statement further said that the education department issued a notice to the school on May 10, 2019, asking why the recognition of the school should not be cancelled or why the government should not take over the management of the school.“The reply received by the school was not satisfactory. In view of this situation, the Delhi government has decided to initiate the process of taking over the management of the school,” the statement said.Meanwhile, the school’s statement said it is hearing about the action only through the media. “We are yet to receive any communication from the DoE and will consider the entire issue once we receive a direct communication. Bal Bharati Public School has always functioned within the provisions of DSEAR and followed all the judgments given by Delhi high court on related issues in the past, and will continue to do so in future also. We want to assure parents of our students that we will always protect the interests of our students,” the statement said.The action committee of private recognised schools condemned the Delhi government‘s “one-sided action through media release”. “By such irresponsible actions, the government is trying to malign the reputation and defame Bal Bharati Public School, Rohini, and also cause unnecessary anxiety to the parents of the school. Even if the government is contemplating any action against the school, they should write to the school and follow the provisions of DSEAR. We would like to reiterate that action committee will take legal recourse to protect the interests of and stand by its member schools,” said a statement issued by the body.The Action Committee for Unaided Recognised schools too condemned the government decision and said they will take legal recourse to protect interests of its member schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-to-take-over-management-of-bal-bharati-public-school-in-rohini-101627584000838.html

Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau said that there is no prima facie material to show that Sidhana was present inside the Red Fort and “if that be so, even no case is made out against him.” It also said that the Investigating Officer (IO) is unable to respond why the custodial interrogation of the accused is further required in the investigation,” the judge said.The court also observed that the Investigating Officer (IO) is not sure as to whether the presence of the accused outside the Red Fort is a very grave offence and non-bailable opining that most of the offences are bailable.The court admitted him on pre-arrest bail on furnishing a personal bond of ₹50,000­ with one local surety of the like amount.The police had opposed the plea saying that he is one of the key conspirators of the violence and was a prominent face at Singhu Border during the protests.“Sidhana was very well versed with the route provided by the Delhi Police to farmers for their protests, but accused in complete violation and disregard of the guidelines instigated the mob not to follow the permitted route,” the prosecutor told the court. His counsel Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, however, told the court that there is not even an iota of evidence to show that he either indulged in any violence or incited anyone to commit it. On January 26, protesting farmers clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen. An FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, Epidemic Act, and Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lakha-sidhana-gets-bail-in-red-fort-violence-case-101627583938469.html

30-07-2021||Delhi||Just three hours of rain enough to set Delhi’s traffic out of order on Thursday||Just a few hours of rain on Thursday led to a now familiar sight in the Capital — waterlogged roads, crawling traffic and long-winded snarls.In tune with contemporary weather patterns, the city was dry for much of Thursday, except for a three-hour span between 2.30pm and 5.30pm, when the city got a bulk of the day’s 72mm of rain.Over the last decade, the Capital has been receiving shorter and more intense spells of rain, experts have said, a change in monsoon patterns that is the primary reason behind increasing instances of urban flooding and flash floods in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).Thursday’s spell of rain, which coincided with the peak traffic hours, was enough to bring traffic to a screeching halt on some of the city’s most crucial arterial roads, including ones in ITO, Dhaula Kuan, Pragati Maidan, Sri Aurobindo Marg (below the AIIMS flyover), Barapullah, Signature Bridge, Hari Nagar and Geeta Colony, showed data from the Delhi traffic police.Commuters laid bare their frustration at the traffic on social media, posting pictures of long traffic jams and waterlogged roads.“There was a heavy traffic jam between AIIMS and Ashram flyover (on the Ring Road). It took around three hours to reach the DND (Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway),” tweeted Jagannath Kar, a commuter.Another commuter, Sonal Maheshwari, tweeted, “What is the problem on the Barapullah flyover? My father is stuck from the last two hours in the same spot. Can someone take action?”Senior traffic police officers said that a large number of personnel were deployed across the city on Thursday evening, the inundated roads led to vehicles slowly navigating through the water, which in turn led to a cascading effect to other arterial roads.The Safdarjung weather station, which provides representative data for the city, received 72mm rainfall till 5.30pm, even as the Palam weather station in South-West Delhi did not receive any rain till Thursday evening.The rain did, however, keep the city cool on Thursday. The Safdarjung station recorded a maximum temperature of 32.1 degrees Celsius, two below what is considered normal for this time of the year, and a minimum temperature of 24°C, three below normal.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that there is a forecast of ‘light to moderate’ showers on July 30-31 as well. “The monsoon trough is persisting in Delhi and hence more showers are likely over the next couple of days. There may be patchy rainfall on August 1-2 as well. This will also keep the temperature in check,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/just-three-hours-of-rain-enough-to-set-delhi-s-traffic-out-of-order-on-thursday-101627583937295.html

Four of them are from Chattarpur in Madhya Pradesh while the fifth is a resident of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, the police said.A mobile video clip in which the women were seen arguing with the five men and accusing them of sexually harassing them had surfaced on July 21, prompting the police to approach the women and register a case of sexual harassment under Indian Penal Code’s Section 509. One of the women had filed a complaint and had alleged that the men had passed “lewd remarks” on them outside a resto-bar, where they were waiting for a cab, said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.During the investigation, a police officer associated with the case said, the investigating team scanned CCTV cameras installed around the place of the incident and found that the suspects had come out of another resto-bar.“We went to that restro-bar and found the name and contact number of one suspect that he had mentioned in the visitor’s entry register. The person was contacted and asked to join the investigation along with his four friends who were involved in the crime. All five joined the probe and we arrested them,” said the officer.The five men told the police that they had come to Delhi for some work and gone to the Hauz Khas Village for partying, the night before they were scheduled to leave for their hometowns, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-5-held-for-molesting-women-near-hauz-khas-village-resto-bar-101627583877311.html
30-07-2021||Other||UP amends policy, specifies more days for prisoners’ early release||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government has made amendments to its policy to allow remission of sentence to convicts facing life term with ease and specifying more important days, including International Women’s Day ( March 8) and International Yoga Day ( June 21) for their release from jails. The amended policy, released on July 28, has also included World Health Day (April 7), Gandhi Jayanti (October 2), Republic Day and Independence Day as days for prisoners’ release. In recent years, the state government has been releasing the inmates on important days like anniversary of Dandi March (April 6), birth anniversary of Dr Sarvpalli Radhakrishnan (September 5), Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti etc but the policy released in 2018 mentioned only the Republic Day as days for their release. “Amendments have been made to the policy to have clear cut provisions for expeditious decision-making. Both Governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath wanted special provisions for women. Norms have also been eased for release of those suffering from serious ailments,” said Avnish Awasthi, additional chief secretary, home and prisons department. Uttar Pradesh has 71 jails that remain overcrowded with 113691 inmates, nearly double the capacity to house 60,805 prisoners. The policy will obviously help in easing overcrowding in jails. The state government has released 2572 prisoners from jails in the past three years. These include 1992 inmates released in 2019 and 394 and 186 prisoners freed in 2020 and 2021 respectively. “Easing of norms is a welcome move. Those who have reformed themselves in prisons should be allowed to go back to society and make their contribution. The state government has powers, and it should liberally use these powers to free those who it feels will not commit a crime when released from prison,” said CB Pandey, former legal advisor to Governor of Uttar Pradesh. Under the amended policy, all the life term convicts suffering from 13 listed serious ailments will be considered for early release if their crime does not fall in listed categories of serious crime. Ailments listed in the policy include advanced bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis, incurable malignancy, incurable blood diseases, congestive heart failure, chronic epilepsy and mental degeneration, advanced leprosy with deformities and trophic ulcers, total blindness of both eyes, incurable paraplegias and hemiplegia, advanced Parkinsonism, brain tumour, incurable aneurysms, irreversible kidney failure and any other terminal disease. It also provides for release of all male inmates who have completed 60 years of age and have completed a punishment of 16 years (without remission) and 20 years (with remission), if the crime committed by them is not covered in the list of serious crimes. The serious crimes’ list includes fleeing from jail or police custody, kidnapping for ransom, to make one handicapped for the purpose of begging, forcing women to marry, importing women, kidnapping of children of less than 10 year of age or committing crime against them or any other crime charged under Section 373 of the Indian penal Code (IPC). A committee headed by additional chief secretary /principal secretary prisons would consider the recommendations/proposals for early release of inmates under provisions of the policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-amends-policy-specifies-more-days-for-prisoners-early-release-101627583757174.html
30-07-2021||Delhi||Constable held for assault, kidnap of fruit vendor; hunt on for 2 more suspects||A Delhi Police constable and his friend were arrested for allegedly assaulting a 28-year-old fruit vendor over a road rage, that eventually led to his death, abducting him and dumping his body in a canal in Uttar Pradesh’s Muradnagar on the night of June 4, said police on Thursday.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap said the constable, Monu Sirohi, who was posted at the Pandav Nagar police station, was dismissed on Thursday. The other arrested man, identified as Harish, repairs air conditioners for a living. Police are on the lookout for two more suspects, identified as Vikas and Vineet, who were involved in the alleged attack.The crime came to the fore on July 20, nearly 46 days later, when a 3.06 minute-long video, which shows four men assaulting the victim, identified as Ajeet Kumar, and his friend Atul, came to the attention of police officers.The alleged assault and kidnapping happened in New Kondli area, that falls under the jurisdiction of New Ashok Nagar police station in east district. On Thursday, the station house officer (SHO) of New Ashok Nagar police station was suspended and sent to district lines for alleged negligence in handling Kumar’s missing complaint that was filed by his family members on June 13--nine days after he went missing. They filed another complaint on June 15, in which they suspected that Kumar may have been abducted and killed, said police.When contacted, Ajeet’s brother Ashok said, “My brother was missing since June 4. Initially, we thought he went to some relative’s house but when he did not return, we filed a complaint where we told police that a neighbour may have had a hand in my brother’s disappearance as he used to threaten us and pass casteist remarks. Instead of finding my brother, the policeman handling our case wanted us to withdraw the complaint and put pressure on us to sign a compromise letter.”A police officer, who did not wish to be identified, said, “The neighbour was examined on July 20, after Kumar’s family filed a complaint with the lieutenant governor’s office for no action on their missing complaint. The complaint was also marked to senior police officers, who sought a report on the action taken from the concerned police station.”“The local police then contacted the neighbour, who not only denied his involvement but also shared a video clip in which four men can be seen beating up Kumar and Atul. The neighbour shot the video on his mobile phone,” said the officer.After seeing the video, the district’s special staff was tasked to investigate the case and identify the people involved in the attack. The investigating team traced the ownership of the Swift car into which Kumar was shoved and found it was registered in the name of Sirohi. A police team also went to Atul’s house and learnt that he had gone out of the city a few days ago but did not tell anyone about the assault.“Sirohi was asked to join the investigation. He initially denied his involvement but eventually confessed to his crime when we confronted him with the video clip. His interrogation led to Harish’s arrest. They confessed that Kumar died because of the assault and that they dumped his body in a canal in Muradnagar along with two of their associates to hide the crime,” said the officer.Police informed that Atul, in his statement, said he knew Kumar was assaulted and bundled in a car but remained silent because he knew the assaulter was a policeman and feared that he might be booked in a false case. Atul had managed to flee the spot where the alleged assault took place.DCP Kashyap said a case under Sections 364 (kidnapping in order to murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder) has been registered against the suspects.Another police officer said Sirohi, who lives in a barrack of the New Ashok Nagar police station, and Harish told police that on June 4, they consumed alcohol and went to New Kondli to buy food. “They said Kumar hit the car’s hood with his hand, which infuriated them, and that led to an altercation,” said the officer.“Following the altercation, the four, including Sirohi, assaulted Kumar and Atul and abducted the former. Kumar’s body is yet to be traced. The car used in the crime has been recovered,” said Kashyap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/constable-held-for-assault-kidnap-of-fruit-vendor-hunt-on-for-2-more-suspects-101627583698602.html

30-07-2021||Delhi||O2 crisis: Drug dept targeting particular party, says Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday cautioned the city’s drug control department against prosecuting the good Samaritans who distributed oxygen cylinders during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic when “both the Centre and Delhi government failed to provide it”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh slammed the department for initiating action against AAP MLA Praveen Kumar, who represents Jangpura constituency, and said it was trying to target a particular political party. The bench said if the department starts prosecuting people like this, it will have to initiate action against “half the city”.“…we observed that it’s a technical type of offence involving oxygen. This way you’ll pick up half of Delhi. Why to proceed against specific political parties then? Proceed against gurdwaras too then. We said we will not permit this. Proceed against every gurdwara, every temple, churches or social organisation and people who had procured and distributed oxygen then.“How can you prosecute him (Kumar)? The State, both Centre and Delhi government, failed in providing sufficient oxygen to people in Delhi. There were some Samaritans who provided oxygen. You can’t prosecute them…. You’re very consciously targeting political parties. It’s very unfortunate. We will not permit this,” the bench said.The high court was hearing a PIL seeking lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure and distribute Covid-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them. An application was later filed in the pending petition making allegations against Kumar and AAP MLA from Tri Nagar Preeti Tomar. Tomar was later given a clean chit.The court’s remarks came after the Delhi Drug Control Department, in a status report, said that it has initiated prosecution against AAP MLA Kumar, after he was found allegedly hoarding oxygen cylinders during the second Covid-19 wave.The report had also said that prosecution has been launched against BJP MP Gautam Gambhir’s Foundation, and AAP MLA Imran Hussain for alleged unauthorised purchase/procurement, stocking and distribution of medicines and medical oxygen.With respect to Imran Hussain, the court said that it had earlier exonerated the legislator after finding that he was procuring oxygen cylinders from Haryana.“All that we wanted to know in that respect was, was he sourcing his oxygen cylinders from refillers in Delhi. He filed an affidavit to say he was getting it from outside, he provided the particulars, challans etc. So, we said alright there is a man who is getting it from outside. He is helping the community and not lodging out of the supply to Delhi itself… therefore, we said let him go and did not take any action. Somebody is doing a similar thing, then how will you prosecute him?” the court said.On Thursday, when the court asked why action was taken against AAP MLA Kumar, the drug controller’s lawyer, Nandita Rao said a probe showed that the legislator procured oxygen from Punjab himself, without any doctor’s prescription. Rao said the department is not doing a “witch hunt” but court responded, “Of course this is a witch hunt. Your second report clearly shows it.”The court also rejected the request from advocate Rao seeking time to file an updated status report on the aspect of prosecution of those procuring and distributing oxygen cylinders.“We are not giving you two weeks. We’re giving you two days. But if you’re deciding to take action against those who were having oxygen, then you should also take action against all gurdwaras and temples, etc. We’ll take details from you,” the bench said.The bench said that even though action against Gambhir was justified because he acted “irresponsibly” by hoarding medicines, action could not be taken against Kumar and others who distributed oxygen cylinders.“Didn’t you see pictures in the media? People wanting oxygen in Delhi….You should not go against a person. He (Praveen Kumar) was only trying to help the society. The reason for picking up Mr. Gautam Gambhir’s case was that he was very irresponsibly having Covid-19 medicines. He may have had the best intentions but he procured 10,000 Fabiflu tablets, stocked them and then distributed them among people in his constituency so much so that he was left with 236 strips,” the court said.During the proceedings, senior advocate Kailash Vasdev, appearing for Gambhir, urged the high court to grant him a hearing as he wished to make certain clarifications and also requested the court to clarify in its order that the adverse observations made against him will not be used against the BJP MP before the trial court where prosecution has been initiated against him.The high court made it clear that the observations made by it earlier in these hearings will not come in the way of proceedings in the trial court.The Gautam Gambhir Foundation, in a statement, said, “The court was informed about the voluntary service done by the foundation from 2012 for society at large. The court was informed how the orders of the court had been misused by vested interests to tarnish the image of a voluntary body and Gambhir, and how the entire matter had proceeded without hearing the affected parties. The court directed that none of its orders would prejudice the parties in any manner and the trial court would decide the case on its own merits.”The matter will now be heard on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/o2-crisis-drug-dept-targeting-particular-party-says-delhi-hc-101627583277943.html
30-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Assembly resolution seeks Bharat Ratna for Bahuguna||The Delhi Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Centre to posthumously confer the Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian award, to environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna, a founding member of the Chipko movement.Speaking on day one of the monsoon session of the Delhi Assembly, Kejriwal said awarding Bahuguna a Bharat Ratna is not just Delhi’s demand, but of the entire nation. “Today we are talking about such a great person who was a visionary leader. In the 1960s and 70s, nobody used to talk about the environment. Nobody used to talk about trees. At that time, he gave the vision of saving our environment not just to our country but to the whole world. At just 13 years of age, he started social work and fought against untouchability. Like BR Ambedkar fought to allow entry of Dalits in temples, Bahunguna too did the same. He created hostels for them and even worked to reduce substance abuse. He even contributed to India’s freedom struggle,” he said.Bahuguna, a native of Uttarakhand, died of Covid-19 at 94 at a hospital in Rishikesh on May 21 this year. A recipient of India’s second-highest civilian award, Padma Vibhushan, Bahuguna’s work revolved around people’s rights over forests in the Himalayas.“In today’s time, grooms put up conditions, like getting a Mercedes or a house, to get married. Bahuguna’s condition to get married was that his wife would have to live with him in rural areas and in an ashram. We all know about his Chipko movement. He travelled 5,000 kms in rural India. His life gives inspiration to the new generations. Bahuguna deserves the highest honour of Bharat Ratna. I feel the Bharat Ratna will be honoured if the award goes to Bahuguna,” Kejriwal told the House.On July 16, Kejriwal had also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to award Bahuguna with a Bharat Ratna.The Aam Aadmi Party had earlier announced that it plans to contest all 70 seats in the Assembly elections in Uttarakhand next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-assembly-resolution-seeks-bharat-ratna-for-bahuguna-101627582677742.html

They escaped with two bags containing gold and cash,” said senior inspector Suresh Warade.Local residents chased the duo and caught one of them, Anil Dubey, who was an ex-employee of the bank and worked for 15 years, and now he is manager of Axis Bank,Naigaon branch. The other accused is absconding. At the time of going to press, the police were in the process of filing a first information report (FIR). Vartak-Chowdhary died on the spot, while Devrukh is undergoing treatment at Sanjeevani Hospital. “We will check the CCTV footage of the bank and vicinity,” said Warade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bank-robbery-in-virar-asst-manager-killed-clerk-injured-1-held-101627582017820.html
30-07-2021||Pune||Babasaheb Purandare turns 99, wishes pour in||PUNE Eminent author, historian and theatre personality, Balwant Moreshwar alias Babasaheb Purandare — who is renowned for his scholarly works on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj — completed 99 years, here on Thursday.Speaking on the occasion, Purandare expressed gratitude towards his parents and teachers for shaping his life. “I learned a lot of things in this journey of 99 years but I still need to do a lot of things,” he said.Top office-bearers and leaders across political parties from governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray, union ministers Amit Shah and Nitin Gadkari, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Chandrakant Patil, and leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis; litterateurs and others made a beeline to wish Purandare on his special day and seek his blessings.Raj Thackeray drove down to the home of the “Shiv Shahir” or Shivaji’s bard, as Purandare is popularly known, kneeled on the floor, and touched his feet.Born on July 29, 1922, at Saswad near Poona (now Pune), Purandare was fascinated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his exploits right from an early age and wrote essays and stories that were later published in a book titled “Thinagya” which is Marathi for sparks.In more than eight decades of his career in writing and theatre, Purandare delivered more than 12,000 lectures on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and studied all the forts and the history of the Maratha Empire, making him an authority on the subject. He penned and directed a historical play titled “Jaanta Raja” in 1985, which became a theatrical magnum opus performed down the years by over 200 artistes, translated and enacted in five languages and clocking over 1,250 stage shows in Maharashtra, Goa, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and the USA.Among Purandare’s prominent works is the monumental two-volume “Raje Shivchhatrapati” and “Jaanta Raja”, “Maharaj”, “Shelarkhind”, “Gadkot Kille”, “Agra”, “Lal Mahal”, “Purandar”, “Rajgad”, “Panhalgad”, “Sinhagad”, “Pratapgad”, “Purandaryanchi Daulat”, “Mujaryache Mankari”, “Fulwanti”, “Savitri” and “Kalawantinicha Sajja”. He was conferred the “Maharashtra Bhushan” in 2015 and the country’s second highest civilian honour, “Padma Vibhushan” in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/babasaheb-purandare-turns-99-wishes-pour-in-101627581899015.html

The two phases are scheduled to be ready by December 2023. Once the highway is complete, there will be a direct link between Delhi and Dehradun,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI.The highway will have four more phases to further connect Baghpat to Dehradun and are in various stages of completion, said Garg.Once ready, the highway will shorten the by-road distance from Delhi to Dehradun by about 70km. Currently, travellers between Dehradun and Delhi take a 250km route through Ghaziabad (Delhi-Meerut Road) and the congested Meerut, Muzffarnagar, Roorkee and Haridwar.The NHAI official said they got a nod from the Union ministry of road transport and highways to schedule the completion of the first two stretches within two and half years from the date of issuing work orders.“The highway will cater to about 20,000-30,000 passenger car units per day (a measure of traffic on a road) and will reduce the burden on the Delhi-Meerut road, which largely caters to the long-distance traffic passing through Ghaziabad,” Garg added.The Delhi to Baghpat section is proposed to be developed with 12 lanes that could also be used to accommodate local traffic, with six lanes of the highway dedicated to long distance travellers. According to official estimates last year, the Baghpat to Dehradun stretch is pegged at a cost of ₹4,830 crore and is estimated to be ready within three to five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/delhibaghpat-section-of-nh-709b-to-be-ready-by-2023-says-highways-authority-101627581117010.html
30-07-2021||Pune||NCRA-TIFR scientist discovers remnant radio galaxy||PUNE: A scientist at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR), Pune - Dr Dharam Vir Lal – has discovered a remnant radio galaxy in the peripheral region of a cluster of galaxies named “Abell2065” using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The research has been recently published in the July 16, 2021 issue of the Astrophysical Journal. About the discovery, Dr Dharam Vir Lal said, “The remnant phase of a radio galaxy is short and only a few such remnants are known in the sky. This discovery showcases the capability of the uGMRT to discover more such objects. Finding more remnant and restarted radio galaxies is important for shedding light on their dynamics and evolution and by extension, the duty cycle of active galaxies. We know that active galaxies are rare and that remnant radio galaxies are rarer because they are short-lived. As a result of their rarity, this dying phase remains a poorly understood phenomenon. By increasing the detection of these rare sources, we will be able to understand different evolution histories of active galaxies and different mechanisms that drive the evolution of the remnant namely, the dying phase of the active galaxy.”“Combining the images in the radio band using the uGMRT and in the X-ray band using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, a hint of possible shock is seen across the remnant radio galaxy. It is likely that the radio emission is re-energised by the passage of possible shock front, and that shows the expected change in radio emission characteristics of the newly-discovered remnant radio galaxy,” Dr Dharam Vir Lal said.For the unversed, a galaxy is a system of stars, gas, and dust bound together by mutual gravity. These galaxies come in different shapes, but the basic structure is the same - a dense core of stars called the nucleus surrounded by stars and gas. However in a small fraction of galaxies, the core is bright and shining with power equivalent to trillions of suns, easily outshining the rest of the light of the combined galaxy. A galaxy that emits such tremendous amounts of energy is called an active galaxy.It is believed that at the centre of such active galaxies is a supermassive black hole having a mass that is million to billion times the mass of (our) Sun. As this supermassive black hole attracts more material from its neighbourhood, it also flashes away long jets of matter and energy from the core up to a distance of millions of light years. These special, active galaxies exhibit strong emission in the radio wavelengths with sizes much larger than seen in the optical wavelength. The long powerful jets responsible for radio emission can also have a substantial energetic impact on both their host galaxy and the surrounding medium beyond the host galaxy.The active phase of such galaxies can last for several tens of million years, after which the nuclear activity stops, and the radio emission starts to fade away. This phase of a radio galaxy represents the final dying phase of the active galaxy, often termed as the remnant or dying phase, and begins once nuclear activity switches-off. This dying phase is relatively short-lived and is difficult to detect. Fortunately, it remains observable for many tens of million years at low radio frequencies, using a sensitive low-frequency radio telescope such as the uGMRT.The GMRT is an array of thirty 45m antennas spread over a 25 square kilometre area in Khodad village, Narayangaon, India, built and operated by the NCRA-TIFR, Pune. Currently, it is one of the most sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ncratifr-scientist-discovers-remnant-radio-galaxy-101627572357631.html
30-07-2021||Pune||PMC citizen participatory budget: Unutilised for two years, fresh proposals invited||Pune: The Covid situation has left the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) unable to carry out minor development works like footpath repairs, change drainage lines and laying waterlines suggested by residents since the past two years. However, it has decided to initiate the participatory citizen budget (PB) process for next year’s annual budget (2022-23). The civic body has recorded non-utilisation of PB funds for the first time since inception. A form of participatory budgeting in the corporation budget was introduced in Pune in 2006 by PMC, an initiative introduced by the then municipal commissioner Nitin Kareer. PMC started implementing PB from 2006-07 in annual budgets and it became one of the crucial parts of the corporation’s annual budget. Normally, PMC allocate around ₹40 crore for PB. The work suggested by citizens of each ward office will be included in the budget along with allocation. The limit of each work should not be more than ₹5 lakh. In 2020-21, citizens suggested ₹37 crore of development works in different ward offices. In the current budget (2021-22), citizens suggested ₹32 crore of development work so far. However, there are few chances to implement PB this year also. Ulka Kalaskar, chief account officer of PMC said, “Due to covid-19 pandemic, the corporation is unable to implement a citizen participatory budget allocation so far. Now, we are discussing whether to consider earlier suggested citizens work or call a new fresh proposal.” One of the ward officers from east part of the city said, “We have not been able to implement PB from last year and it is not going to be implemented this year. So, it is better to carry forward work for next year. The scope of work is very limited in PB. Instead of following all processes, it is a practical way to implement earlier suggested work by citizens.” Major General SCN Jatar (retd) of Nagrik Chetna Manch who is taking active part in PB said, “PMC is not interested in implementing PB in the city. Now, they should have to maintain earlier PB works and carry forward two years’ budgets which have not been implemented yet. Corporators are aggressive in implementing their budget. But, no one take care of PB implementation.” The PMC account department has issued a circular and instructed all 15 ward offices to start the PB process for the annual budget of 2022-23. Offices should provide online forms to citizens because of Covid situation and conduct ward level meetings for suggestion of citizens. Corporation has set a limit of ₹1 crore for four wards and ₹75 lakh for three ward offices to suggest development works. The individual development work should not exceed ₹5 lakh. The process should be complete and each ward office should send proposals of work by October 8, 2021. The categories in which citizens may suggest works are footpaths/ cycle tracks, road, street lights, traffic signals, bus stops, public parking, public toilets, solid waste management, water (supply), stormwater, gardens, public buildings, signages and others.

The BJP said the state’s “unmindful relaxation” during Eid-Al-Adha last week led to the spike in cases, but the CPI(M) said the union government’s “poor vaccine distribution policy” led to the current situation. “50% of the Covid positive cases come from Kerala, thanks to Eid relaxations. But as expected the narrative would always be built around kumbh or Kanwar yatra. Hmmm... Kerala model,” tweeted BJP spokesman Sambit Patra. BJP leader Amit Malviya also criticised the Pinarayi Vijayan government, pointing to the Muslim-majority Malappuram district recording the highest number of cases to buttress his point on Eid. For the last two days, the state has been reporting over 20,000 daily cases, after a gap of two months. The CPI(M), however, criticised the BJP for making the issue communal, saying the virus has no religion or caste. “Kerala has lowest seroprevalence rate. People here are more vulnerable to infection. The present policy of vaccine distribution punishes the state that protected larger portion of people from infection, Provide more vaccine to Kerala than free advice,” tweeted former finance minister Thomas Issac. Issac said the country will have to pay a heavy price for “Modi’s vaccine folly” and the state is proud of its record. A BJP delegation from the state, which is currently camping in the national Capital, alleged that local CPI(M) leaders were controlling the vaccination drive in several areas, and they “behave as if the state government procured it for a price”. A team sent by the Union government visited the state in the first week of July too. The union health secretary has written to the state again, indicating that it should give equal preference to containment measures and treatment. Several experts have also asked the state to move from containment to mitigation measures and redraw its present strategies.The state reported 22,056 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the second consecutive day it recorded over 20,000 cases, at a test positivity rate (TPR) of 11.2%, according to the health department’s daily bulletin. It also reported 131 deaths in last 24 hours, taking the toll to 16,457. On Tuesday, it accounted for nearly 50% of total caseload on the day in the country (22,129 out of 42,498 cases) and its average test positivity rate (TPR) at 12.35% was almost four times the national average of 3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-cases-rise-in-kerala-bjp-cpi-m-engage-in-war-of-words-online-101627539113915.html

Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar said an alternative route was thrown open to light motor vehicles along the left bank of Bhaga river via Tandi-Peukar, but only commuters headed for Leh were allowed on it. “Now, the highway has been opened for heavy traffic to and fro,” said Kumar. The deputy commissioner also informed about 175 tourists, including 60 women and 16 children, are stranded in Pattan valley of Udaipur. He said the Pangi-Killar road is closed and is not expected to reopen by Friday. We have sought helicopter support for evacuation, he said. He said though no loss of life has been reported in the incident that occurred near Shansha village, but traffic on the state highway was stalled owing to the damage. Seven people were killed and three are still missing after a cloudburst flooded the Tozing Nullah near Keylong on Tuesday night. The gushing waters had swept away a camp for labourers and two vehicles. The search for the missing is on. Meanwhile, the Kalka-Shimla highway that was blocked due to landslide has been cleared for the traffic. The road was blocked near Kaithlighat in Solan. The traffic was diverted through Chambaghat-Kandaghat route till the debris was removed. Overall, 94 roads are still closed across the state. Besides, 71 water supply schemes have also been affected. Retaining wall collapses near CM”s residenceA retaining wall in CM residence Oakover’s compound collapsed on Thursday morning, prompting the authorities to vacate three nearby buildings. Nearly 30 members of six families have been shifted to the Circuit House. Shimla (Urban) SDM Manjeet Sharma said the buildings have been vacated as a precautionary measure. He said the PWD has pressed men and machinery to rebuild the retaining wall. There are reports of flashfloods at Hilutwan in Pangi and Gumma in Rohru subdivision. Fields were washed away in Hilutwan, while four vehicles and a bridge were damaged in Gumma. No loss of life was reported.

Johnson & Johnson Inc has not yet requested full approval for its one-dose Covid-19 shot.Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said full approval by the FDA could also help spur more Americans to get the Covid-19 vaccine as it might reduce their fears about the safety of the shot and make local officials more comfortable about implementing vaccine mandates."Given what we've been through now and the number of months that have gone by since the (emergency use authorization), I would hope that within the very reasonable period of time in the future we'll see that. I hope as we get into the middle of August that we're almost there," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-hopes-us-regulators-fully-approve-covid-19-shots-by-midaugust-101627665794591.html

Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan.UNAMA said no U.N. personnel were hurt in the incident.Herat city is the second provincial capital the Taliban have entered in the last 24 hours. Insurgents entered the capital of the southern province of Helmand a day earlier, and clashes are under way there. Civilians rushed to evacuate the city."Since Thursday morning the Taliban have launched attacks from several directions on Lashkargah city," a government official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Lashkargah is the capital of Helmand, a southern province bordering Pakistan.With U.S.-led foreign forces nearing a complete withdrawal of troops, the Taliban have made swift territorial gains over the last two months but have not yet captured any provincial capitals.A United Nations report this week said civilian casualties had been surging in recent weeks in Afghanistan, with as many killed in May and June as in the previous four months. The report did not cover casualties in July, when fighting has intensified further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-headquarters-attacked-in-western-afghanistan-at-least-one-guard-killed-101627663164754.html

Official explains||Russia on Friday blamed a “short-term software failure” for an incident that threw the International Space Station (ISS) out of control after a research module was docked. The ISS was knocked off its course due to an unplanned firing of jet thrusters of the Russian research module Nauka, causing “loss of attitudinal control” that lasted for a little more than 45 minutes, according to the manager of Nasa's space station program.Vladimir Solovyov, designer general at Energia, a Russian space agency company, said in a statement that a direct command was “mistakenly implemented” to activate the thrusters of the multipurpose laboratory module, turning on the engines for withdrawal. He said that the software failure led to “some modification of the orientation of the complex as a whole.”"The crew is now busy balancing the pressure in the Nauka module. In the afternoon, the crew will open the hatches, enter the module, turn on the necessary means of purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work," Solovyov added.On Thursday, Nasa assured that ground teams had regained attitude control and the motion of the space station was stable. The ground teams restored the attitudinal control and orientation of the space station by activating thrusters on another module attached to it. Quoting Nasa specialists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, Russian state-owned news agency RIA described the struggle to regain control of the space station as a “tug of war” between two modules.The US space agency stressed that the seven crew aboard the ISS were never in any immediate danger. The malfunction, however, prompted Nasa to postpone the launch of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft until August 3.Currently, three Nasa astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts, a Japanese astronaut and a European space agency astronaut from France are onboard the space station."Dear friends, I’m reading your numerous comments. Don’t worry! Our work at the International Space Station to integrate the newly arrived Nauka module continues! Tonight we are going to open the hatches. Will keep you posted!" tweeted Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who is onboard the ISS.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-russian-module-nauka-knocked-space-station-out-of-control-official-explains-101627660977332.html
30-07-2021||World||Nuclear reactor shut down in southern China over fuel rod damage||China has shut down a reactor at a nuclear plant in the southern Guangdong province to repair fuel rod damage, the state-run operator said on Friday weeks after a reported increase in radioactivity levels had sparked fears of a leak.The plant operator China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in a statement published on its website that it had shut Unit 1 at the Taishan nuclear plant in Guangdong province after “lengthy” talks with technicians.“After lengthy conversations between French and Chinese technical personnel, Taishan Nuclear Power Plant ... decided to shut down Unit 1 for maintenance,” CGN said on Friday, adding that “a small amount of fuel damage” occurred during the operation of the reactor.Taishan is the first nuclear plant in the world to have a new kind of reactor, known as EPR.The EPR is pressurised water reactor design produced in partnership with Electricite de France (EDF), a French company.CGN said that the two units of the plant had “maintained safe and stable operations throughout” and the faulty reactor was “completely under control”.Engineers would now “find the cause of fuel damage and replace the damaged fuel”, the statement added.The group said it always followed the “safety first” policy at the plant.In June, the Chinese government admitted damage to fuel rods at the plant but said no radiation had leaked.China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said the problem was “common” with no need for concern.The Chinese government response came after CNN reported that the US government was assessing a reported leak at the facility.The Taishan plant began commercial operation in December 2018.EDF had warned of an “imminent radiological threat” after damage to fuel rods, the CNN had reported, citing a letter to the US department of energy.In the letter, the French power company reportedly accused the Chinese safety authority of raising the acceptable level of radiation outside the power plant, a report denied by the Chinese government.The China Atomic Energy Authority (CAEA) wrote to the international Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that there was no radiation release and no environmental concerns at the plant.In the notification to the IAEA, the CAEA said, “Unit 1 of the plant recently experienced a minor fuel rod cladding failure, which resulted in increased radioactivity in the unit’s primary reactor coolant.”The CAEA further told IAEA that the situation, a common phenomenon in nuclear power plant operations, was dealt with in accordance with accepted standards and procedures. According to on-site monitoring and an expert assessment, the unit’s performance indicators, including the radioactivity of the primary reactor coolant, remain within the range of normal conditions and technical specifications.By the end of 2020, China had 49 operational nuclear power units with more than 51 gigawatts of installed nuclear power capacity, the third-largest globally, the China Nuclear Energy Association (CNEA) told state media in June.Nuclear power makes up around 5% of the country’s total generation, compared with 70% in France, 19% in the United States and 12% in Germany, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported.The CNEA predicts that China will surpass France as the world’s second-biggest nuclear power generator in 2022 and overtake the United States four years after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-reactor-shut-down-in-southern-china-over-fuel-rod-damage-101627659072643.html

Announcing the decision, Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah told a press conference that Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan, will be the focus during the partial lockdown because of its “serious situation.”In the last 24 hours, Pakistan reported nearly 4,500 new Covid-19 cases and 86 related deaths, of which 14 deaths were reported from Karachi. Health experts have warned that Eid-al-Adha, the Muslim holiday, and elections held in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) could prove as superspreader events.The Delta variant, first detected in India, is believed to be responsible for Pakistan’s fourth Covid wave. Citing data from Aga Khan University Hospital, Shah said that there is almost 100% prevalence of the Delta variant in Karachi."If you help us, we will be able to contain the spread of this disease. People are asking what will happen after August 8. We have to take measures so that our hospital facilities are not choked," the provincial chief minister said.The announcement came a day after Pakistan’s federal government banned staff from entering public offices, schools, restaurants, transport, shopping malls and air travel without vaccination certificates despite low vaccination coverage. Less than 3% of Pakistan’s population has been fully vaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“I know, people will not be comfortable with lockdown, but it is inevitable we have to bring the numbers down,” Shah added.According to the lockdown guidelines issued by the chief minister’s office, restaurants will be allowed only for delivery and no takeaway or dine-in will be permitted. There won’t be any restriction on the movement of citizens but inter-city travel will be banned. All markets will remain closed except pharmacies and grocery stores, that too only till 6pm.

It is as contagious as chickenpox, according to news reports citing the CDC document.The document indicates vaccinated people, though protected from severe illness, can transmit the Delta virus as much as the unvaccinated. If infected, vaccinated people were found carrying the same amount of measurable viral load as those unvaccinated and it was this finding, the news reports suggested, that was behind the CDC’s course-reversal on masks.The health agency changed its two-month-old guidance allowing vaccinated people to do without masks and issued a new recommendation calling for the use of face coverings in certain high-risk conditions earlier this week.The US is witnessing a surge in new infections, with about 70,000 every day. And the CDC believes vaccinated people are also spreading the virus, although at a far lesser intensity than those unvaccinated. The data shows there are roughly 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans, the New York Times reported on the basis of the CDC document.The internal document recommends vaccinated people with weak immune systems must wear masks even in low-risk conditions and so should vaccinated people who come in contact with children or older adults, according to the NYT report.But the current masking guidance is unlikely to be enough and the CDC report said, “Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-as-contagious-as-chickenpox-report-101627656131078.html

The nine countries include Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.The Philippines had earlier imposed the travel ban on India on April 29 which was extended. On July 14, the government further extended the travel ban on India along with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the UAE, and Oman till July 31, according to news agency PTI.Also Read| Philippines reports first locally transmitted cases of Delta variantHarry Roque, the Presidential spokesperson for President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, said on Friday the current travel ban will be in place from August 1 till August 15. The orders came after President Duterte expressed concerns over the Delta variant, according to a report by Manila TimesThe Philippines has so far reported 216 cases of the Delta variant, which was first discovered in India in October 2020. However, experts pointed out there might be more unidentified cases due to the sluggish pace of the country’s genome sequencing capacity, PTI reported. Two weeks back, the country reported its first locally transmitted cases of the variant.The government on Friday also imposed a lockdown in the Manila capital region from August 6-20 to curb the spread of the Delta variant. The capital region covers 16 cities and is home to over 13 million people. “While it is a painful decision, this is for the good of all,” Presidential spokesperson Roque was quoted as saying by Reuters.Also Read| Philippines to impose lockdown in Manila to curb Covid-19 Delta variant spreadAs per the lockdown rules, people will not be allowed to step outdoors except for shopping for essential items. Dining in at restaurants will be banned and only take out and home deliveries will be permitted.

Beaten repeatedly, the 27-year-old jumped from a window but was dragged back, beaten again and finally beheaded. A childhood friend has been charged with her killing.The gruesome death last week in an upscale neighbourhood of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, is the latest in a series of attacks on women in Pakistan, where rights activists say such gender-based assaults are on the rise as the country barrels toward greater religious extremism.Mukadam was the daughter of a diplomat, and her status as a member of the country's elite has shone a spotlight on the relentless and growing violence against women in Pakistan, said prominent rights activist Tahira Abdullah.But the majority of women who are victims of such violence are among the country's poor and middle classes, and their deaths are often not reported or, when they are, often ignored.“I could give you a list longer than my arm, only in one week” of attacks against women, said Abdullah. “The epidemic of sexual crimes and violence against women in Pakistan is a silent epidemic. No one sees it. No one is talking about it.”Still, Pakistan's Parliament this month failed to pass a bill that seeks to protect women from violence in the home, including attacks by a husband. Instead, it asked an Islamic ideology council to weigh in on the measure — the same council that previously said it was OK for a husband to beat his wife.Data collected from domestic violence hotlines across the country showed a 200% increase in domestic violence between January and March last year, according to a Human Rights Watch report released earlier this year. The numbers were even worse after March, when COVID-19 lockdowns began, according to the report.In 2020, Pakistan was near the bottom of the World Economic Forum's global gender index, coming in at 153 of 156 countries, ahead of only Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan, which held the last spot despite billions of dollars spent and 20 years of international attention on gender issues there.Many of the attacks in Pakistan are so-called honor killings, where the perpetrator is a brother, father or other male relative. Each year, more than 1,000 women are killed in this way, many of them unreported, say human rights workers.“The authorities have failed to establish adequate protection or accountability for abuses against women and girls, including so-called 'honor killings' and forced marriage,” according to the HRW report.Rights groups have been sharply critical of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and his government, saying he panders to the religious right and excuses the perpetrators of attacks on women.A former cricket star who has married three times, Khan once had a reputation as a womanizer but has now embraced a conservative Islam. He keeps close ties with a religious ceric who blamed COVID-19 on “the wrongdoing of women."He once appeared to blame women for attacks by men saying, “if you raise temptation in society ... all these young guys have nowhere to go, it has consequences in the society.”His information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, says Khan's statements have been taken out of context and denied violence against women is on the rise, without offering evidence. He said his government encourages women in politics and sports and in provinces where Khan's party dominates human rights legislation has been strengthened.“I think this perception is not really close to reality, that in Pakistan women are not safe or maybe that there's a misogyny in practice in Pakistan,” Chaudhry said in an interview.Yet last week, one of Khan's Cabinet ministers, Ali Amin Gandapur, told a rally of thousands of mostly male supporters, that he would “slap and slap” a female opposition political leader.Last September, a senior police officer blamed a woman who was ambushed and gang raped in front of her two children, saying she should not have been travelling at night and without a man.Such remarks reflect an increase in ultraconservative and even extremist religious values in Pakistan, said Amir Rana of the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies.The country has seen an explosion of religious organizations and religious political parties, many with extreme beliefs, said Rana, whose organization tracks and documents extremism in Pakistan.These organizations have tremendous reach in most cities and towns, where they provide services from education to health care, and thus have extensive ability to influence social values, said Rana.The history of religious extremism in Pakistan is complicated, and Chaudhry, the information minister, argued that America shares responsibility for the role it played in the region in the 1980s.At that time, Pakistan's military dictator aided by the U.S. used religious fervor to inspire Afghans to fight an invading Soviet Union. Many of those Afghans ended up in Pakistan as refugees.“And very conveniently now, the US media and US authorities ... blame everything on Pakistan and have left the region," he said.But Abdullah, the rights activist, said Pakistan cannot shirk its own responsibility, noting that same dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia-ul Haq, introduced Islamic laws that, among other things, reduced women's rights to inheritance, limited the value of their testimony in court and made reporting a rape almost impossible by requiring four male witnesses.In Mukadam's assault, police have charged Zahir Jaffar, the son of a wealthy industrialist, with murder. Initial reports say she was killed after spurning his marriage proposal. It's not clear whether Jaffar has a lawyer.The brutality of the assault — the attacker used so-called brass knuckles — and the fear that his high social status means he could be freed, galvanized many in Pakistan to speak out. They have held protests and a candlelight vigil and launched a social media campaign #justicefornoor to preempt attempts to use influence and money to whisk the accused out of the country.In one petition circulating online, the author demanded the country's judicial system “hold perpetrators of violence responsible. We demand justice. We demand it swiftly. We demand it for Noor. We demand it for all women.”Zarqa Khan, a student who attended a candlelight vigil for Mukadam, bemoaned how religion now pervades so much of life in Pakistan and how today she fears walking alone on the streets.“I just didn't feel safe outside anymore,” said Khan. “And that shouldn't be the scenario.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rights-groups-warn-assaults-on-women-on-the-rise-in-pakistan-101627634748744.html

An increase in radiation inside Unit 1 reactor of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant had sparked fears of a leak, according to a CNN report."After lengthy conversations between French and Chinese technical personnel, Taishan Nuclear Power Plant ... decided to shut down Unit 1 for maintenance," China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in an online statement.The Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, owned by CGN and Electricite de France (EDF), began commercial operation in December 2018. EDF had warned of an “imminent radiological threat” after damage to fuel rods, reported CNN citing a letter to the US department of energy.Also Read | 5 fuel rods broken in Taishan nuclear power plant, no radiation leak: ChinaIn the letter, the French power company reportedly accused the Chinese safety authority of raising the acceptable level of radiation outside the power plant, a report denied by the Chinese government. While the ministry of ecology and environment admitted the power plant had five broken fuel rods, it said no radioactivity leaked.The ministry claimed on its social media account that the radiation was contained by barriers that functioned as planned. “There is no problem of radioactive leakage to the environment,” the ministry statement said. It also downplayed the damage saying it was a “common phenomenon” and the damaged fuel rods accounted for “less than 0.01 percent" of the 60,000 fuel rods in the reactor.After China’s admission of minor damage to the plant, a spokesperson for EDF told CNN that it was a "serious situation that is evolving." The spokesperson said that EDF would have shut down the reactor if it was in France due to "the procedures and practices in terms of operating nuclear power plants in France," reported CNN.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-fears-of-leak-china-nuclear-plant-operator-says-reactor-shut-down-for-maintenance-101627647221019.html

He said that this decision was made after “considerable research and analysis” and that its information would be shared around the world.″The only way we can defeat Covid is together. Together means sharing information. Together means sharing methods, technologies, insights, and actionable steps,″ said Bennet said Friday.More than 57% of the country’s 9.3 million citizens have received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and over 80% of the population over 40 is vaccinated.Neither the US nor the EU has approved coronavirus booster shots, and the World Health Organization said earlier this month that there is not enough evidence to show that a third dose is needed.Most studies — and real-world data from Britain and the US — so far show that the Pfizer vaccine remains powerfully protective against serious illness. Just Wednesday, Pfizer released data from its long-running 44,000-person study showing that while protection against any symptomatic infection declined slightly six months after immunization, protection against severe Covid-19 remained at nearly 97%. Earlier this month, Israel’s Health Ministry announced that protection against severe disease was around 93%.Israel has carried out one of the world’s quickest and most successful vaccination campaigns. They reached a deal with the pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, to purchase enough vaccines for its population in exchange for sharing its data with the drugmaker.The vaccination program allowed Israel to reopen its economy before other countries. The Israeli government had planned to reopen the country to vaccinated tourists in July but has pushed the date back following concerns over the rise in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-israel-administers-booster-shots-of-vaccine-to-citizens-over-60-101627643581956.html

The study came at a time when nearly 60% of citizens in Europe have received at least one dose of the vaccine.Probability of a vaccine-resistant variantA pan-European team of experts studied the chances of a vaccine-resistant strain of the coronavirus emerging in a population of 10 million people over three years. The study was done to predict how the SARS-CoV-2 might mutate in response to vaccination campaigns.Many variables such as vaccination, mutation and transmission rates, including recurring "waves" of infections and the fall in cases in response to lockdowns were considered for the study.As expected, the model showed that a faster pace of vaccination would reduce the risk of the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain.Also read | Fourth wave of Covid-19 hits Middle East, WHO sounds alarm over delta variantHowever, the authors also said that the risk of a resistant strain emerging was the highest when a large proportion of the population was vaccinated but not large enough to achieve herd immunity. They called this scenario “counter-intuitive.” The authors also said that their model estimated a threshold of 60% population being vaccinated after which, the vaccine-resistant variants appeared more likely to emerge.Co-author of the study Simon Rella from the Institute of Science and Technology, Austria, said that the vaccines are the “best bet” to beat the Covid-19 pandemic. “What our model showed is that when most people are vaccinated, the vaccine-resistant strain has an advantage over the original strain. This means that the vaccine-resistant strain spreads through the population faster than the original strain at a time when most people are vaccinated,” Rella said in an online briefing.The authors, based on the results of the study, urged policymakers and individuals to consider keeping the measures in place throughout the entire vaccination process.Delta variantEurope, which is now witnessing the rapid spread of the Delta Covid-19 variant, is currently in a similar scenario, where 60% of the population is vaccinated. In the US too, where 60% of adults are fully vaccinated, the conditions appear similar. Also, 80% of new cases of Covid-19 in the US were due to the Delta variant. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday recommended wearing a face mask indoors for vaccinated people too, in areas where the prevalence of the Delta variant was higher.While the Delta variant is significantly more infectious than the original variant, there is little evidence currently to suggest that it is more deadly.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dropping-face-masks-social-distancing-rules-may-trigger-new-vaccine-resistant-covid-19-variants-study-101627643796057.html
30-07-2021||World||China seizes locally made maps showing Aksai Chin, Arunachal in India||Chinese customs recently seized a large consignment of locally manufactured world maps, which showed Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh as part of India.China claims the north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet and occupies the India-claimed Aksai Chin region, mostly as part of the southwest Hotan county of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The consignment, worth some $600, was confiscated during a check by the customs department at the Shanghai Pudong international airport.At least 300 packages to be exported as “bed covers” were pulled out of the express channel for closer inspection during the check-up, a report on the website, ThePaper.com said.It was found that the maps on the “bed covers” showed Arunachal and Aksai Chin as Indian territories as Indian maps show.The goods were immediately seized as they violated legal provisions regulating how Chinese maps should be drawn, the report said.The regulations are stipulated under China’s State Council, or cabinet’s “Regulations on the Management of Map Drawing and Publication”.The regulations say Chinese maps should not show content that endangers national unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.The brief article did not mention the identity of the manufacturer or where the maps were to be exported. The consignment of cloth material is likely to be destroyed and the manufacturing company is expected to be heavily fined and censured.Commenting on the report, angry Chinese netizens demanded that the company should be shut down immediately and called on the authorities to punish the owner.In March, 2019, nearly 30,000 world maps showing Arunachal Pradesh as a part of India and Taiwan as a separate country were destroyed by customs authorities in the city of Qingdao in the eastern province of Shandong.“A total of 803 boxes with 28,908 wrong maps were seized and destroyed, the largest amount to be disposed of in recent years,” the province’s Natural Resources ministry said; the maps were taken to a secret location and shredded.China is particularly sensitive to the depiction of Arunachal Pradesh as a part of Indian territory and even opposes the visit of Indian leaders to the state.Last week, China criticised the channel NBC Universal for showing an “incomplete map” of the country in its broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony after a map displayed during the arrival of Chinese athletes did not include Taiwan or the South China Sea.The display “hurt the dignity and emotions of the Chinese people”, the Chinese consulate in New York said in a social media post on its official Weibo social media account.“Maps’ references to self-ruled Taiwan and the disputed South China Sea have stirred controversy in recent years, with Johns Hopkins University last year reversing a decision to show Taiwan as part of China on a map indicating the spread of the coronavirus,” Reuters said in a recent report.China’s sensitivity over territorial claims doesn’t stop at maps.In 2018, India’s national carrier Air India changed the name of Taiwan to Chinese Taipei on its website after China raised concerns about Taiwan being described as a separate region by various airlines worldwide.Air India was among 40 international airlines to do so.Also, last year, the US clothing company GAP had to apologise for selling T-shirts with a map of China which didn’t show Taiwan or the South China Sea.The international hotel chain Marriott had its Chinese website briefly blocked for listing the Tibet Autonomous Region, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau as separate countries in a questionnaire for customers in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seizes-locally-made-maps-showing-aksai-chin-arunachal-in-india-101627643590458.html

The Taliban with Pakistan fighters within ranks have suffered heavy casualties in these attacks.The action against the Sunni Pashtun insurgent group also includes keeping the important highways of the country safe. The Afghanistan government has stepped up the security of Maymana-Aqina, Hairatan–Kabul-Torkham, Spin Boldak-Kandahar city-Lashkarga and Islam Qala-Herat highways to ensure free movement of security forces.The ANDSF cleared several villages along the highway of insurgents and defused at least nine improvised explosive devices or IEDs according to inetlligence reports from Afghanistan. They also foiled an attack on India-built and funded Salma Dam in Herat, in which a number of Taliban fighters were killed and five others injured.The security cover of Kabul and other important cities, including Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad, Kandahar city and Herat, has also been increased.The local leaders are encouraging the people to raise arms against the Taliban. Daikundi-based Shia cleric, Ayatullah Wahizada, has even issued a fatwa to motivate people to do so.The US forces, till the time they are in Afghanistan, are helping the ANDSF eliminate Taliban terrorists. A number of air strikes - both using manned and unmanned strike platforms - has killed key Taliban leaders, the highest (81) in Shiberghan. The US forces have conducted air strikes in Kandahar and Helmand.The Taliban have condemned the US air strikes with their spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warning of "consequences".The Afghan security forces has also killed Pakistani military officials, which points to the fact that Pakistan is actively supporting the Taliban in their endeavours. According to Afghan Army 209 Corps, a Pakistan army officer named Javed was killed by intelligence agency officers. They said that Javed was leading the Taliban in Logar, Paktia, and Paktika provinces.A protest march were held in Pakistan's South Waziristan (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province) on Tuesday to express solidarity with Afghan citizens and oppose the undeclared war against Afghanistan from Pakistani side in which several innocent people have been killed. The march was organised by the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) whose chief Manzoor Pashteen said that the war in Afghanistan has kept the entire region in poverty and stagnation.Meanwhile, Commander of the US Central Command (CENTCOM) General Kenneth F McKenzie recently met Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani to discuss the security situation. After the meeting, he said that the US was prepared to continue air strikes against the terrorists. He termed the battle for Kandahar a "tough fight", and emphasised that while the city had not fallen yet, it’s control was 'critical' for both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buoyed-with-us-air-strikes-afghan-security-forces-push-back-taliban-101627641279016.html
30-07-2021||World||Pakistan reluctant to take back fighters captured in Syria||An international effort to repatriate Pakistan fighters captured by Kurdish groups in northern Syria has run into problems because of Islamabad’s reluctance to acknowledge their nationality or give guarantees about their safety, people familiar with developments said on Friday. The effort was made through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to repatriate at least four Pakistani captured fighters caught by Kurdish forces while fighting for the Islamic State in northern Syria, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Also Read | Imran Khan must stop human rights violations in PoK: JKNAPHowever, there was an impasse between ICRC and Pakistan authorities over formalities related to the repatriation process. The Pakistani side has been reluctant to acknowledge or confirm the identity of the Pakistani fighters and other civilians being held in camps run by Kurdish groups, the people said. Another point of contention has been the requirement of a sovereign guarantee for the safety of repatriated foreign fighters and prisoners and the Pakistani side has been unwilling to commit to this, the people added. Over the years, the Pakistan government has denied reports that fighters from the Pakistani Taliban and other groups had gone to Syria to fight alongside Sunni rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad or with the Islamic State. Any acknowledgement of the presence of Pakistani fighters in Syria at this stage would be a potential source of embarrassment for Islamabad. According to a confidential report, there have been around 21 Pakistani nationals, including civilians, detained in camps run by Kurdish groups in northern Syria since June last year. Some of the detainees are women. Pakistan is among very few countries from which both Shia and Sunni fighters have gone to Syria. The Liwa Zainebiyoun, a pro-government militia in Syria has attracted Shia Muslims from north and northwest Pakistan, primarily Kurram district and Gilgit-Baltistan, since 2013. Several dozen Shia fighters have died in combat in Syria. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed to have sent its men to fight with rebels in Syria, and there were of these fighters setting up a base in Syria with the help of Arabs who earlier fought in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban was helped in these efforts by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a notorious anti-Shia terror group. There were also reports of some 50 Pakistani fighters being killed in action by the Turkish Army and Syrian forces in northwest Syria in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-reluctant-to-take-back-fighters-captured-in-syria-101627637531141.html

Thursday's announcement represents a sizable shift as the White House tries to convince more people to get vaccinated as Covid-19 cases rise due to the spread of the delta variant, The Hill reported.A growing number of businesses have elected to mandate vaccines for employees as a condition of returning to in-person work. Several private colleges have done the same for their students.According to the White House, the federal government will ask employees and onsite contractors to attest to their vaccination status. Those who do not show that they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will need to mask, socially distance and submit to weekly or twice weekly coronavirus testing. Their work travel will also be restricted.The Hill quoting Public health experts reported that the new mandate could help drive up vaccination rates by setting a model for other businesses at a time when the delta variant."We're at the point where some use of mandates is really important," said Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Health Lab.The federal government employs over four million people. It's unclear what percentage of the workforce is currently not vaccinated against COVID-19."I don't have that number to share with you at that time," White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday when asked for an estimate on how many federal government employees the administration believes are not vaccinated.Meanwhile, Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that mask mandates are once again in effect indoors in the United States' capital for everyone over the age of two - regardless of Covid-19 vaccination status.Amid a troubling rise in coronavirus cases and new information on the spread of the delta variant, masks will be required indoors in DC for all people over 2. The new mandate will kick in at 5 am on Saturday (local time), DC Mayor Bowser announced at a press conference.On Tuesday (local time), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance to prevent further spread of the Delta variant in the United States, by mandating vaccinated people to wear masks in certain situations.The recommendation urges fully vaccinated people to wear masks indoors when in areas with "substantial" and "high" transmission of Covid-19, which includes nearly two-thirds of all US counties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-workers-must-be-vaccinated-or-submit-to-regular-covid-testing-biden-101627634885530.html

"No SAEs (Serious Adverse Events) or cases of coronavirus after vaccination. Positive immunogenicity results expected in August," Sputnik V said in a statement.Sputnik V developed the vaccine cocktail approach with two different vectors for two shots (Ad26+Ad5). This mix and match approach has recently gained global recognition, Sputnik V said, adding that the RDIF actively collaborates with other vaccines to show mix and matching is effective against new Covid-19 strains.“As new strains of coronavirus emerge, partnerships between vaccine manufacturers and combining different vaccines are key to successfully fight the pandemic. Based on the high efficacy of the heterogeneous boosting (vaccine cocktail) approach, RDIF was the first in the world to initiate partnerships with other coronavirus vaccine manufacturers," Kirill Dmitriev, RDIF's chief executive, said, according to Sputnik V.Dmitriev said that the first partnership of this kind was a joint clinical trial with AstraZeneca, adding that it looks forward to its success in Azerbaijan and other countries, which will allow more effective implementation of vaccination programs and protect people around the globe. "We consider it important to conduct joint research on combining the first component of Sputnik V with vaccines from other manufacturers for a more effective fight against emerging new strains of coronavirus," Dmitriev added.The first partnership of this kind was concluded in December last year in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin. RDIF, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, AstraZeneca and R-Pharm has signed a memorandum of intent which is aimed at cooperation in vaccine development, Sputnik V stated.“A heterogeneous prime-boosting involving administering components of different vaccines to a patient is one of the most promising vaccination regimens to study. It is becoming especially relevant now when the issue of preventing the spread of new strains of coronavirus infection is acute, and the need for revaccination of the population is also coming to a head," Irina Panarina, general manager of AstraZeneca Russia and Eurasia, said. "That is why the results of the study can be of great importance for those countries where both the vaccine by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford and the Sputnik V vaccine are registered," she said.The studies on the safety and immunogenicity of the combination of the AstraZeneca vaccine and the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine in Azerbaijan began in February this year. To date, 50 volunteers have been vaccinated and new participants are invited to join the trial process. Provisional analysis of the data demonstrates a high safety profile for the combined use of the vaccines with no serious or adverse effects or cases of Covid-19 after vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-russia-s-sputnik-v-astrazeneca-covid-shots-proves-safe-rdif-101627632658843.html

In the process, Tong Ying-kit became the first person to be convicted under the Hong Kong National Security Law, which was imposed on the city by Beijing one year ago to stamp out dissent.Officially called the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the legislation was enacted by the Chinese Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on June 30, 2020, as opposed to it being approved by the Hong Kong Legislative Council.The legislation triggered widespread protests in Hong Kong, as democracy activists took to the streets against the national security law. The Hong Kong administration detained and arrested several protesters over the months for breaking the law, of which the 24-year-old Tong Ying-kit was one.Ying-kit allegedly drove a motorcycle into three police officers while flying a protest flag during a rally on July 1 last year, a day after the Hong Kong national security law was enacted. Charged with terrorism and secession, the Ying-kit's case was under trial in the city.At the sentencing this Tuesday, Ying-kit was convicted of both of the aforementioned charges and sentenced to nine years behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-man-gets-9-years-in-jail-in-first-trial-under-china-imposed-security-law-101627629853144.html

The very first of such evacuation flights landed early in the morning at Washington's Dulles International Airport, reported the Associated Press, citing an internal US government document and a commercial flight-tracking service. The airliner carried 221 Afghans in all, including 57 children and 15 babies, according to the document.Also Read | Videos show Taliban has no interest in peace in AfghanistanMeanwhile, the US Congress is taking steps to expedite visas for the Afghans to help them settle into their new lives in America. The federal government passed emergency legislation earlier on Thursday afternoon that would, among other things, increase the number of visas for allies who worked alongside Americans in the Afghanistan war.The $2.1 billion bill provides for revamped security at the Capitol building in Washington, a measure deemed much-needed after the violent January 6 violence, and also allocates additional funds for the translators and others who worked closely with US government troops and civilians in Afghanistan.Also Read | Photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was executed by Taliban: ReportThe US evacuations are meant to resettle former translators and others who fear retaliation from Afghanistan’s Taliban for having worked with American service members and civilians. Just one week ago, the Taliban beheaded a translator, Sohail Pardis, right near his home in capital Kabul. Pardis worked as a translator for the United States army for 16 months during the conflict that spanned over two decades.The evacuation flights highlight American uncertainty about how Afghanistan’s government and military will fare after the last US combat forces leave that country in coming weeks, the Associated Press noted.The interpreters and other allies of the US who are being flown in American flights are also accompanied by their families. They were expected to stay at Fort Lee, Virginia for several days, US officials said earlier this month. Subsequent flights are due to bring more of the applicants who are farthest along in the process of getting visas, having already won approval and cleared security screening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-evacuates-200-allies-who-helped-during-afghan-war-funds-their-visas-101627626200419.html
30-07-2021||World||Fully vaccinated people should get tested after potential Covid-19 exposure: CDC||Fully vaccinated people should get tested three to five days if they have been exposed to Covid-19 infection, even if they don’t have symptoms, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention has said.The latest guidance from the CDC said this is because experts do not know yet how long one is protected after recovering from Covid-19. Even if someone has already recovered from Covid-19, it is possible, although rare, that one could be infected with Covid-19 again, the CDC said.The change in guidance comes two months after the agency eased its initial testing directions. The CDC said in May that Covid-19 vaccinated people face very little risk of serious illness and don’t need to be tested in most cases, even if exposed to someone who was sick. The thinking behind this was that vaccinated people also weren't likely to spread the infection to others.The agency has now said it is reversing that guidance because of the more contagious Delta variant, which now accounts for most Covid-19 infections. The CDC noted that studies have shown vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from Covid-19, but the new data shows vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant could infect others."If you were treated for Covid-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a Covid-19 vaccine," it said.The CDC said that US citizens returning from abroad still have to present a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights, regardless of their vaccination status. It added that anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should still isolate for 10 days."If you or your child has a history of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-A or MIS-C), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered from being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS-A or MIS-C. Learn more about the clinical considerations people with a history of multisystem MIS-C or MIS-A," the CDC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-people-should-get-tested-after-potential-covid-19-exposure-cdc-101627620328711.html
30-07-2021||World||Delta variant may spread as easily as chickenpox: Reports||The Delta variant of the coronavirus may cause more severe illness than all other known versions of the virus and spread as easily as chickenpox, US media reports quoting an internal document from the US health authority said.The document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) outlines unpublished data that shows fully vaccinated people might spread the Delta variant, first identified in India, at the same rate as unvaccinated people, reports said.The contents of the document - a slide presentation - were first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday.Dr Rochelle P Walensky, the director of the CDC, acknowledged on Tuesday that vaccinated people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant carry just as much virus in the nose and throat as unvaccinated people and may spread it just as readily, if less often.But the internal document lays out a broader and even grimmer view of the variant.The Delta variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox, and it is as contagious as chickenpox, according to the document, a copy of which was also obtained by The New York Times.The Delta variant -- originally known as B.1.617.2 -- might cause more severe disease, according to the document.The immediate next step for the agency is to “acknowledge the war has changed,” the document said.The document’s tone reflects alarm among CDC scientists about Delta’s spread across the country, the NYT quoted a federal official, who has seen the research described in the document, as saying.The agency is expected to publish additional data on the deadly variant on Friday.“The CDC. is very concerned with the data coming in that Delta is a very serious threat that requires action now,” the official said.There are roughly 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans, according to data collected by the CDC as of July 24 that was cited in the internal presentation.But the agency does not track all mild or asymptomatic infections, so the actual incidence may be higher.Infection with the Delta variant produces virus amounts in the airways that are tenfold higher than what is seen in people infected with the Alpha variant, which is also highly contagious, the document noted.The amount of virus in a person infected with Delta is a thousandfold more than what is seen in people infected with the original version of the virus, according to one recent study.The CDC document relies on data from multiple studies, including an analysis of a recent outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, which began after the town’s Fourth of July festivities.Walensky told CNN that the Delta variant "is one of the most transmissible viruses we know about. Measles, chickenpox, this -- they're all up there."And she said everyone in schools -- students, staff and visitors -- should wear masks at all times."The measures we need to get this under control -- they're extreme. The measures you need are extreme," Walensky said."The bottom line was that, in contrast to the other variants, vaccinated people, even if they didn't get sick, got infected and shed virus at similar levels as unvaccinated people who got infected," Walter Orenstein, who heads the Emory Vaccine Center and who viewed the documents, told CNN.But vaccinated people are safer, the document indicates."Vaccines prevent more than 90 per cent of severe disease, but may be less effective at preventing infection or transmission," it reads."Therefore, more breakthrough and more community spread despite vaccination," the document adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-may-spread-as-easily-as-chickenpox-reports-101627628178712.html

The Taliban has escalated its offensive against Afghan security forces and civilians and imposed archaic rules in the territories it has captured. According to US General Mark Milley, the Taliban now control about half of the 419 district centres in Afghanistan.While both the US and the UN has warned the Taliban of international isolation and travel sanctions if the Sunni group unilaterally tries to seize power in Kabul, the Islamist group, with its leadership safely ensconced in neighbouring Pakistan is in no mood to change from its 1996 version. The Deobandi group's larger objective is to impose Sharia on Afghanistan by converting it into an emirate and expand the Sunni Pashtun influence all over the country at the cost of the minorities and women rights.Also read | Taliban asks for list of girls, widows to be married to their fighters: ReportsThat the group is in no mood to negotiate peace except for mouthing the words is evident from the reports indicating that Indian photographer Danish Siddiqui was deliberately tortured and killed by the Taliban at Spin Boldak after establishing his nationality.

His body could be seen in one of those clips.Earlier this month reports said the Taliban has ordered women to not leave home alone, set dowry regulations for girls and men to grow their beards among other diktats. According to reports, the Taliban has also issued a statement ordering local religious leaders to give them a list of girls over 15 years of age and widows under 45, reports have said. The Taliban, the reports said, has promised for them to be married to its fighters.In the past as well, the Taliban enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, including public lashings, flogging and stonings. Women were required to cover their bodies and faces in a burqa and were barred from going to school or work or leaving the house without a male relative.The United Nations has expressed concern with the number of reported "serious human rights abuses" and violations. The global body has said that authorities are obliged to respect the human rights and dignity of all Afghans, especially those of women and girls. Reports of killing, ill-treatment, persecution and discrimination are widespread and disturbing, creating fear and insecurity, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has also said.Apart from the torturing people in captured areas, reports also said that Taliban fighters have destroyed 11 sites on the Salam telecommunication network and looted its equipment. Reporterly, an Afghan online portal, said citing local officials that the Taliban fighters also closed seven other sites in Paktia’s occupied districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/videos-show-taliban-has-no-interest-in-peace-in-afghanistan-101627626943691.html

We call on the PRC to act as a responsible nation hoping to welcome foreign media and the world for the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games," the state department.Recently, after Chinese state media hit out at foreign media for their coverage of floods in Chinese cities, citizens harrassed correspondents for several international media outlets on the streets of Zhengzhou city of Henan province over the weekend.According to a report in Hong Kong Free Press early this week, the Chinese social media platform Weibo was filled with angry posts criticising the coverage of foreign correspondents as Chinese cities witnessed heavy downpours and flooding.The criticism was mainly aimed at BBC's China Correspondent Robin Brant for a report that questioned government policies after a dozen people die in a train carriage amid the flooding.Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under President Xi Jinping rules China with an iron fist. The media in the country is tightly controlled and journalists, who are deemed as anti-government, are punished and jailed.According to Reporter Without Borders, China continues to be the world's "biggest jailer of press freedom defenders", with more the 120 currently detained in the country, "often in life-threatening conditions".In recent months, China has been targeting foreign journalists for highlighting the atrocities of the Chinese Communist Party and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.At least 20 journalists have been expelled or forced to leave China since last year, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China has said.The club says Beijing deploys "intimidation" tactics as part of efforts to obstruct the work of foreign reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerned-over-harassment-intimidation-of-foreign-journalists-in-china-101627625383002.html

"We are now in the fourth wave of Covid-19 across the region."The delta variant of the coronavirus has now been reported in 15 out of 22 countries in the Middle East, according to WHO. Most of the new Covid-19 cases and hospitalised patients are unvaccinated. The low rate of vaccination in the region, coupled with the increased transmissibility of the delta variant of the coronavirus, remains a major cause for concern.Iran, Iraq, Tunisia, and Libya are the countries worst hit by the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the Middle East, said the public health body of the United Nations (UN). "Over 310 000 new cases and 3500 deaths have been reported on average on a weekly basis during the last 4 weeks, which is a 55% and 15% increase in the number of cases and deaths, respectively, compared to the previous month," a statement issued by the WHO media centre read."Admission and hospitalisation rates have increased in the last few weeks, and some referral hospitals are reaching full capacity and facing a shortage of intensive care beds and oxygen supplies," it added.Covid-19 management does not only include churning out vaccines that are highly effective against coronavirus disease infection, but also requires an equitable increase in the vaccination coverage, the UN body said. "Until and unless vaccination coverage is increased equitably for everybody, everywhere, the virus will continue to circulate and mutate to produce new variants," WHO said in its statement.Notably, only 41 million people in the Middle East (a mere 5.5% of the region's population) had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 till the last week in July. Among these vaccine doses, 40% were administered in high-income countries in the region, which account for only 8% of the region’s population. Meanwhile, more and more people elsewhere in the region continue to be infected with the virus and succumb to their deaths due to inequitable vaccine rollout, increased social mixing, and poor enforcement of public health and social measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fourth-wave-of-covid-19-hits-middle-east-who-sounds-alarm-over-delta-variant-101627612069509.html
30-07-2021||World||ISS thrown out of control by misfire of Russian module: NASA||The International Space Station (ISS) was thrown briefly out of control on Thursday when jet thrusters of a newly arrived Russian research module inadvertently fired a few hours after it was docked to the orbiting outpost, NASA officials said.The seven crew members aboard - two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a European space agency astronaut from France - were never in any immediate danger, according to NASA and Russian state-owned news agency RIA.But the malfunction prompted NASA to postpone until at least Aug. 3 its planned launch of Boeing's new CST-100 Starliner capsule on an uncrewed test flight to the space station. The Starliner had been set to blast off atop an Atlas V rocket on Friday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Thursday's mishap began about three hours after the multipurpose Nauka module had latched onto the space station. The module's jets inexplicably restarted, causing the entire station to pitch out of its normal flight position some 250 miles above the Earth, U.S. space agency officials said.The "loss of attitudinal control" lasted for a little more than 45 minutes, until flight teams on the ground managed to restore the space station's orientation by activating thrusters on another module of the orbiting platform, according to Joel Montalbano, manager of NASA's space station program.In its broadcast coverage of the incident, RIA cited NASA specialists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as describing the struggle to regain control of the space station as a "tug of war" between the two modules.At the height of the incident, the station was pitching out of alignment at the rate of about a half a degree per second, Montalbano said hours later in a NASA conference call with reporters.The Nauka engines were ultimately switched off, the space station was stabilized and its orientation was restored to where it had begun, NASA said.Communication with the crew was lost briefly twice during the disruption, but "there was no immediate danger at any time to the crew," Montalbano said.A drift in the space station's normal orientation was first detected by automatic sensors on the ground, and "the crew really didn't feel any movement," he said.What caused the malfunction of the thrusters on the Nauka module, delivered by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, has yet to be determined, NASA officials said.Montalbano said there was no immediate sign of any damage to the space station. The flight correction maneuvers used up more propellant reserves than desired, "but nothing I would worry about," he said.After its launch last week from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, the module experienced a series of glitches that raised concern about whether the docking procedure would go smoothly.Roscosmos attributed Thursday's post-docking issue to Nauka's engines having to work with residual fuel in the craft, TASS news agency reported."The process of transferring the Nauka module from flight mode to 'docked with ISS' mode is underway. Work is being carried out on the remaining fuel in the module," Roscosmos was cited by TASS as saying.The Nauka module is designed to serve as a research lab, storage unit and airlock that will upgrade Russia's capabilities aboard the ISS.A live broadcast showed the module, named after the Russian word for "science," docking with the space station a few minutes later than scheduled."According to telemetry data and reports from the ISS crew, the onboard systems of the station and the Nauka module are operating normally," Roscosmos said in a statement."There is contact!!!" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, wrote on Twitter moments after the docking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iss-thrown-out-of-control-by-misfire-of-russian-module-nasa-101627611841026.html
30-07-2021||World||Flawed scientific papers fueling Covid-19 misinformation||Scientific studies with poor methodology and inaccurate findings are exacerbating a Covid-19 misinformation crisis that is discouraging vaccination and putting lives at risk.The intense public interest in the pandemic and divisive debate in the United States over how to address it facilitates the spread of faulty research papers online, including by vaccine opponents. And even if a study is retracted, it is too late."Once the paper is published, the damage is irrevocable," said Emerson Brooking, resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which focuses on identifying and exposing disinformation.Flawed papers "have been fuel to the fire for Covid-19 skeptics and conspiracy theorists. They are frequently the subject of viral online activity. Their findings are further filtered through salacious and misleading articles from fringe websites," Brooking told AFP.Inaccurate information about vaccines is especially dangerous at a time when uptake of the shots has slowed in the United States, where health officials say almost all recent Covid-19 deaths occurred among those who were not immunized.- 'Shock your socks off' -Medical journal Vaccines published a peer-reviewed paper in late June titled "The Safety of Covid-19 vaccinations -- we should rethink the policy." It concluded that Covid-19 shots were causing two people to die for every three they saved -- findings that quickly spread on social media.A tweet from scientist and Covid-19 vaccine critic Robert Malone summarizing the paper garnered thousands of retweets. A video in which conservative pundit Liz Wheeler discussed the study -- which she said "will shock your socks off" -- has been viewed more than 250,000 times on Facebook.But Vaccines then retracted the paper, saying it contained "several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings."At least four Vaccines board members resigned as a result of the study's publication, including Katie Ewer, an associate professor and senior immunologist at the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute."It should have been recognized that this paper would have a big impact," said Ewer, who was not involved in its publication. "That no one at the journal picked up on that... is very worrying, especially for a journal dedicated to vaccines."Malone's tweet about the paper is no longer available, but Wheeler's video still appeared on Facebook weeks later.The Gateway Pundit, a website that frequently publishes inaccurate claims, reported earlier in the year that a Stanford University study found mask wearing, which US health authorities recommended to help slow the spread of Covid-19, to be "ineffective" and harmful.- 'Do a better job' -The study -- "Facemasks in the Covid-19 era: A health hypothesis" -- was subsequently retracted by the journal Medical Hypotheses, which said it selectively cited published papers and included "unverified" data.The Gateway Pundit's article -- which has been shared tens of thousands of times as a link or screenshot on social media -- was updated to say the study's author was unaffiliated with Stanford, but it failed to mention the retraction.Some of the biggest scientific journals, including The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, have retracted papers related to the coronavirus crisis, and even a limited number of faulty studies can cause extensive damage online.Scientific papers have been drawn into the public eye in "an unprecedented way," so experts must "do a better job" of explaining their work to a lay audience that may lack the skills to assess them, said Maimuna Majumder, a computational epidemiologist at the Harvard Medical School."Not all of the studies that have been produced and widely shared during the pandemic have been scientifically robust," Majumder said."This is particularly troubling because poorly-executed studies have proven to be capable of influencing individual-level decision-making during the pandemic, including those pertaining to vaccination."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flawed-scientific-papers-fueling-covid-19-misinformation-101627610220526.html
30-07-2021||World||Saudi Arabia to reopen to vaccinated tourists after 17-month Covid closure||Saudi Arabia announced Friday it would reopen its borders to fully vaccinated foreign tourists after a 17-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic, the state news agency said.However, Riyadh did not announce any lifting of restrictions on the umrah, a pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any time, which usually attracts millions of Muslims from across the globe each year."The Ministry of Tourism announced that the Kingdom will open its doors to foreign tourists, and lift... the suspension of entry for tourist visa holders, starting from August 1," the Saudi Press Agency reported.It said travellers fully vaccinated with Saudi-approved jabs -- Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson -- will be able to enter the kingdom "without the need for an institutional quarantine period", provided they also have proof of a negative PCR Covid-19 test taken within the last 72 hours and register their details with health authorities.Riyadh has spent billions trying to build a tourism industry from scratch, as part of efforts to diversify its oil-reliant economy.The once-reclusive kingdom began issuing tourist visas for the first time in 2019, part of an ambitious push to revamp its global image and draw visitors.Between September 2019 and March 2020, it issued 400,000 -- only for the pandemic to crush that momentum as borders were closed.Covid-19 also hugely disrupted the hajj and umrah pilgrimages, usually a key revenue earner for the kingdom -- in normal times, they together rake in some $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually.Currently only immunised pilgrims resident in Saudi Arabia are eligible for umrah permits.The government has accelerated a nationwide vaccination drive as it moves to revive tourism and host sports and entertainment extravaganzas, all pandemic-hit sectors.So far, 26 million jabs have been administered to the population of 35 million, and the kingdom has said that from August 1, vaccinations will be mandatory to enter government and private establishments, including education institutions and entertainment venues, as well as to use public transport.Saudi Arabia has registered more than 523,000 coronavirus cases, with 8,213 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-reopen-to-vaccinated-tourists-after-17-month-covid-closure-101627608932557.html
30-07-2021||World||Antony Blinken supports virus origin probe||US secretary of state Antony Blinken met the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Kuwait on Wednesday where he pledged his support to the UN agency’s investigation in China into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier this month, the WHO called for all countries to work together to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. China has rejected plans for more checks on labs and markets in its territory.“The U.S. supports the @WHO plans for additional studies into COVID-19 origins, including in (the People’s Republic of China), to better understand this pandemic and prevent future ones,” Blinken tweeted after arriving in the Gulf Arab state.The meeting with Tedros had not been on the US diplomat’s published schedule.In a statement, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Blinken “stressed the need for the next phase (of the investigation) to be timely, evidence-based, transparent, expert-led, and free from interference.”And he “emphasised the importance of the international community coming together on this matter of critical concern”, the statement said.The UN health agency has been under intensifying pressure for a new, more in-depth investigation of how the disease that has killed more than four million people around the world first emerged.The WHO was only able to send a team of independent, international experts to Wuhan in January, more than a year after Covid-19 first surfaced there, to help Chinese counterparts probe the pandemic’s origins.Long derided as a right-wing conspiracy theory and vehemently rejected by Beijing, the idea that Covid-19 may have emerged from a lab leak has been gaining momentum. Beijing has repeatedly insisted that a leak would have been “extremely unlikely”, citing the conclusion reached by a joint WHO-Chinese mission to Wuhan in January.But earlier this month, the WHO said a second stage of the international probe should include audits of Chinese labs, amid increasing pressure from the United States for an investigation into a biotech lab in Wuhan.The first human cases of Covid-19 were reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.China said that such a proposal showed “disrespect” and “arrogance towards science”.Blinken and Tedro also “discussed opportunities for collaboration to continue reforming and strengthening the WHO,” State Department spokesperson Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-supports-virus-origin-probe-101627601658341.html
30-07-2021||World||Ex-Cardinal McCarrick charged with sexually assaulting teen||Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was defrocked after a Vatican investigation confirmed he had sexually molested adults as well as children, has been charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy during a wedding reception in Massachusetts in 1974, court records show.McCarrick is the first cardinal in the US to ever be criminally charged with a sexual crime against a minor, according to Mitchell Garabedian, a well-known lawyer for church sexual abuse victims who is representing the man alleging the abuse by McCarrick."It takes an enormous amount of courage for a sexual abuse victim to report having been sexually abused to investigators and proceed through the criminal process," Garabedian said in an email. “Let the facts be presented, the law applied, and a fair verdict rendered.”McCarrick faces three counts of indecent assault and battery on a person over 14, according to documents filed in the Dedham District Court on Wednesday.Barry Coburn, an attorney for McCarrick, told The Associated Press that they “look forward to addressing the case in the courtroom," and declined further comment.The charges against McCarrick were first reported by The Boston Globe on Thursday.The man said the abuse started when he was a young boy, according to the court records. The man told authorities during an interview in January that McCarrick was close to his family and would perform wedding masses, baptisms and funerals for them.The man said that during his brother's wedding reception at Wellesley College in June 1974 — when he was 16 — McCarrick told him that his father wanted him to have a talk with McCarrick because the boy was “being mischievous at home and not attending church.”The man said that the two of them went for a walk around campus and McCarrick groped him before they went back to the party. The man said McCarrick also sexually assaulted him in a “coat room type closet” after they returned to the reception, authorities wrote in the documents.Before leaving the room, McCarrick told him to “say three Our Fathers and a Hail Mary or it was one Our Father and three Hail Marys, so God can redeem you of your sins," according to the report.The man also described other instances of sexual abuse by McCarrick over the years, including when the man was an adult, the report said.Authorities began investigating McCarrick after Garabedian sent a letter alleging the abuse to the district attorney's office, according to the court records.McCarrick can still be charged in this case because he wasn’t a Massachusetts resident and had left the state, stopping the clock on the statute of limitations, authorities said.McCarrick, 91, was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019 after a Vatican investigation confirmed decades of rumors that he was a sexual predator.The case created a credibility crisis for the church since the Vatican had reports from authoritative cardinals dating to 1999 that McCarrick’s behavior was problematic, yet he became an influential cardinal, kingmaker and emissary of the Holy See’s “soft diplomacy.”It led to a two-year investigation that found that bishops, cardinals and popes downplayed or dismissed multiple reports of sexual misconduct. An internal investigation report released last year put the lion’s share of blame on Pope John Paul II, who appointed McCarrick archbishop of Washington, D.C., despite having commissioned an inquiry that confirmed he slept with seminarians.Anne Barrett Doyle, co-founder of the online research database BishopAccountability.org, said that “for McCarrick, today’s reckoning is long overdue.”"We hope that these charges lead to justice," she said in an emailed statement.Jeff Anderson, an attorney who has represented others who say they were victimized by McCarrick, said in a statement that the defrocked cardinal's “history of prolific sex crimes has been ignored by the highest-ranking Catholic officials for decades.”“For too long Catholic institutions have been self-policing while making pledges and promises without action. McCarrick should be behind bars for his crimes," Anderson said.McCarrick, who now lives in Missouri, has been ordered to appear in Massachusetts for his arraignment on Sept. 3. The hearing was originally scheduled for Aug. 26.Of the thousands of Catholic clergymen implicated in sexual abuse in recent decades, McCarrick was distinctive in having reached the highest circles of church leadership — even as awareness of his suspect behavior spread steadily through the hierarchy.Ordained as a priest in New York City in 1958, McCarrick rose to become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, in 1986 and then archbishop of Washington, D.C., in 2000. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.In June 2018, McCarrick suddenly became the face of the long-festering Catholic sex abuse crisis as Pope Francis removed him from public ministry due to allegations that he abused a teenager while a priest in New York. A church panel determined that a former altar boy’s allegations that McCarrick fondled him before Christmas Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in 1971 and 1972 were “credible and substantiated.”The church also acknowledged that it had made previously undisclosed financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct decades ago. It was apparently common knowledge in the US and Vatican leadership that “Uncle Ted,” as McCarrick was known, slept with seminarians, and yet he still he ascended up the church ranks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/excardinal-mccarrick-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-teen-101627596722298.html

30-07-2021||World||New Covid-19 cases hit record high in Japan||Japan hit a record number of new virus cases on Thursday as Tokyo Olympics organisers defended their Covid-19 countermeasures and dismissed any link to the nationwide surge.Nationwide infections topped 10,000 for the first time, Japanese media said. Meanwhile, Olympic organisers reported 24 new infections among Games participants, the highest yet, bringing the total to 193.International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said there was nothing to suggest a link between the Games and the rising figures in Japan.“As far as I’m aware there’s not a single case of an infection spreading to the Tokyo population from the athletes or Olympic movement,” he told reporters. “We have the most tested community probably anywhere... in the world, on top of that you have some of the toughest lockdown restrictions in the athletes’ village.”Of the Olympic participants reported positive, 109 are residents of Japan, with the rest coming from abroad.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said his government will decide on Friday whether to expand the emergency measures. The government is expected to extend Tokyo’s emergency until August 31 and add the capital’s three neighbouring areas and Osaka.Delta drives virus surge in Mideast, warns WHOThe World Health Organization said on Thursday the Delta variant has led to a “surge” in coronavirus outbreaks triggering a “fourth wave” in the Eastern Mediterranean region, where vaccination rates remain low.Beijing reported two locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Thursday, breaking a six-month streak of zero community infections in the Chinese capital.The virus has killed at least 4,190,383 people worldwide since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally compiled by AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cases-hit-record-high-in-japan-101627592183343.html
30-07-2021||India||Borgohain seals medal,‘now gunning for gold’||Lovlina Borgohain let out a scream so loud it cut through the empty Kokugikan Arena, and hung there for a while, ricocheting off the high-domed ceiling of the revered home of Sumo wrestling.She had just assured India of a second medal at the Olympics -- after weightlifter Mirabai Chanu’s silver on the first day -- beating an opponent she had lost to three times in three matches before this one, to move into the semi-finals of the 69kg (welterweight) in women’s boxing. Both losing semi-finalists get bronze medals in Olympic boxing, but Borgohain has the chance to do something no other Indian boxer has done in an Olympic ring — fight in the final. And she said after the bout that she was gunning for history.“I would talk about my journey, but not today. I have the gold to win,” Borgohain said. “There is only one medal and that is gold, that is what we compete for.”There was more to cheer on Friday as PV Sindhu pulled off a clinical straight-games quarter-final win over her long-time rival Akane Yamaguchi of Japan to take a step closer to a medal.The success of these women fits with an important gender shift in the country’s sporting culture. Sakshi Malik (bronze) and Sindhu (silver) were India’s only medallists at Rio 2016, and Dipa Karmakar’s brave finish just off the podium in gymnastics was the other major highlight.Borgohain, 23, did just enough in her Olympic debut bout on Tuesday for a split decision, but in the quarter-final against Chen Nien-chin from Chinese Taipei, the 2018 world champion was in control for the full three rounds. The lanky boxer from Assam controlled the range with her stiff jab and some nimble footwork. When Chen did find a way in, she was met with a solid left hook to the head. But Borgohain’s best was yet to come. In Round 2, Chen, having lost the first, grew more and more desperate with Borgohain’s control of the ring. Her attacks became more reckless and Borgohain, unfazed and perfectly poised, took full advantage. The round went unanimously in Borgohain’s favour. Between the rounds, coach Raffaele Bergamasco, furiously fanning her with a towel, said: “The whole of India and Assam are watching. You have the opportunity to create history.” In Round 3, still dictating the movement in the ring, still using her quick jab and hook combination, Borgohain did just that. After Vijender Singh’s in 2008 and Mary Kom’s in 2012, India will have another Olympic boxing medal. “I have been working hard for eight years, so I thought I will have to show that hard work. I just wanted to be aggressive from the start,” said Borgohain, sporting a traditional gamosa around her neck after the fight. Borgohain’s path to Tokyo has been hard. Last year, after almost seven months without training or competition because of the pandemic, she tested positive for Covid-19 on the day the Indian boxing squad flew out to Italy for a prolonged training and competition trip in October. Left behind in New Delhi, Borgohain had to be hospitalised for a few days. “She has been very strong mentally. We had to work on her strength and conditioning after Covid and it took a couple of months. She was very dedicated,” said Bergamasco. In December and January, while the rest of the elite women boxers trained as a team, Borgohain worked on her fitness at the Inspire Institute of Sports in Ballari, Karnataka. By the end of January she felt ready to get back into the ring, but there was bad news from home—both her mother’s kidneys were failing. In February, Borgohain made a two-day trip to Kolkata to be with her mother, who was undergoing a kidney transplant there. In her first tournament after this period of chaos, the Boxam International invitational in Spain, she lost in the very first round. By May, the two-time world championship bronze medallist was back in the flow, winning a bronze in the Asian Championships in Doha.Borgohain comes from Baromukhia, a village near Assam’s border with Nagaland. Her father owns a small tea plantation and she has two older sisters, Lima and Licha, (one is in the CISF the other with the BSF). Growing up, Borgohain was fascinated by Lima and Licha training in Muay Thai. When she was old enough, Borgohain started training in the martial art too. In 2012, Sports Authority of India boxing coach Padum Boro was scouting for new recruits because he did not have enough boxers to represent Assam in the upcoming sub-junior nationals. He saw Borgohain in action in her school. Impressed by her height and her skills, Boro convinced her to join the SAI boxing programme in Guwahati. “I was told by the coach, just don’t use the kick, and throw as many punches as possible,” Borgohain had told HT in an earlier interview. She went on to win gold in the nationals with just a few months of training.In her Olympic semi-final on August 4, Borgohain will run into world champion Busenaz Surmeneli, who she has never fought before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/borgohain-seals-medal-now-gunning-for-gold-101627669751361.html
30-07-2021||India||HC refuses to gag media on Shilpa Shetty’s plea but also upholds right to privacy||Mumbai The line between freedom of press and the right to privacy will have to be balanced, the Bombay high court said on Friday, refusing to pass a blanket media gag order on a defamation petition by actor Shilpa Shetty, whose husband Raj Kundra is in judicial custody in a case related to alleged production and streaming of pornographic content on online apps. Justice Gautam Patel was hearing a ₹25-crore defamation suit filed by Shetty against media personnel and media houses. Shetty sought to restrain the media from publishing any ”incorrect, false, malicious and defamatory” content against her and her family in connection with the July 19 arrest of her husband for allegedly producing and streaming pornographic content on apps. Kundra, 45 is currently in judicial custody.“I believe some of the issues this suit raises will amount to scrutiny because it is not possible to say at this stage that all statements of all defendants are defamatory in nature,” justice Gautam S Patel said. “There is a judicial limit on what is good or bad journalism as this comes very close to freedom of press...the line between freedom of press & right to privacy will have to be balanced”.,” he added.Senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf and Dr Abhinav Chandrachud appeared for Shetty and argued that videos uploaded by some publishers were, per se, defamatory.The bench asked them to point out specific instances of individuals uploading defamatory content for ‘salacious’ purpose or mischief. Saraf drew the attention of the bench to the fact that Google, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram had not taken down the content uploaded by individuals and publications, though they were defamatory.But the judge didn’t agree.  “Your (Shetty’s) case that Google, YouTube, Twitter etc. shall exercise control over editorial content is dangerous. The plaint is like if you (media) are not going to say nice things about me, do not say anything at all. You choose a life in the public eye, your life will come under the microscope. What you are asking me to do can have a chilling effect on freedom of press,” he said. Justice Patel ordered the removal of three videos uploaded on YouTube, which referred to Shetty’s moral standing and the quality of her parenting. The court found that they were “malicious and with not even a slightest attempt to investigate into the truth of the matter”.“That part is protected by her right of privacy under the wide protection recognised by the freedom of press to be balanced with right of privacy. It is possible that freedom of speech may have to be narrowly tailored. But it is not possible to ignore the constitutional pinning of privacy nor to say that if a person is a public figure, that person is deemed to have sacrificed his right to privacy,” the bench said.But justice Patel noted that some other articles mentioned in the suit did not seem to be defamatory. “It cannot be like if you (media) are not going to write or say anything nice about me (Shetty) then do not say anything at all. How can this be?” the judge asked.“The material here seems to be prima facie drawn from an understanding of what investigating teams have said or indicated. The report is not of Shetty’s guilt or innocence, but of what an investigative agency suspects. I am not inclined to pass an order on this,” he said.He added that no part of the order should be construed as a gag on the media. “I am making no order, but this is not refusal of interim or ad interim relief.”The HC directed all defendants in the suit to file their affidavits and posted the matter for further hearing on September 20.

30-07-2021||India||'Don't prescribe home quarantine': Tamil Nadu's new measure to check Covid spike||The Tamil Nadu government on Friday asked officials and doctors to get Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals instead of home quarantining them in a bid to identify the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state.State health minister Ma Subramanian said the health department took steps to identify the exact reasons behind the surge in new cases. “On July 28, the state reported 1,756 new cases, but yesterday it increased to 1,859. That is 103 new cases have been added. The state has been witnessing a declining trend in new infections for more than a month and this is the first time it has gone up,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Subramanian highlighted that Chennai, Kanyakumari, Coimbatore, Erode and Cuddalore have recorded a surge in new cases. He said that the chief minister MK Stalin enquired about the reasons that could have led to the rise in new infections. He also said that officials have been advised to admit a Covid-19 positive patient to the hospital instead of prescribing home quarantine and monitor those who have come in contact with the patient.Subramanian opined that one of the possible reasons behind the sharp rise in Kerala could be due to patients preferring to be in home quarantine. Kerala recorded more than 20,000 cases for the fourth consecutive day on Friday with the test positivity rate rising to 13.61%. The state also reported 116 deaths. The Tamil Nadu government is also monitoring those who arrive from Kerala by screening people on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. “We continuously screen people who arrive from Kerala via Coimbatore or Kanyakumari. Recently, in Coimbatore, health department officials screened people in at least 13 locations bordering Kerala,” Subramanian said.He also said that citizens not adhering to Covid-19 preventative measures were also behind the sudden rise in new infections. “Our continuous appeal to the public is to wear masks, wash hands regularly and maintain social distancing norms. Still, people do not follow it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-prescribe-home-quarantine-tamil-nadu-s-new-measure-to-check-covid-spike-101627666221884.html
30-07-2021||India||Hospital orders probe after video shows ants on paralysed Covid patient’s face||A probe has been launched on Friday by the administration of a Vadodara hospital in Gujarat after a recent video showing ants crawling on the face of a paralysed Covid-19 patient in the medical facility’s ICU ward surfaced on social media platforms.The five-minute video clip that was shot by the patient’s relative shows a woman in her 50s lying on an ICU bed of Sir Sayajirao General (SSG) Hospital in Vadodara. When the relative asks the patient if she wants something, she only shakes her head to answer. At this point, he notices ants coming out from the corner of the patient’s swollen mouth. The video then shows the relative complaining to the nurse, who informs him that due care of the patient was taken by on-duty staff, and that her mouth was also cleaned the preceding night.The video of the incident that took place in the state government-run SSG Hospital was shot by the relative a few days before.The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Ranjan Aiyer, has ordered the inquiry into the matter and assured of action if any lapse in part of the medical facility’s staff comes to light.“All the staff have been given strict instructions to maintain high standards of hygiene and also remain alert in attending patients,” he said, adding that spillage of food from the feeding tube “might have attracted the ants".This development comes after the hospital authorities initially reportedly denied the allegations.Before the inquiry order was issued by Dr Aiyer, the administrative nodal officer of the hospital, Dr Osman Belin, dismissed the video, citing that only one ant was found on the patient’s face. Dr Belin further stated that edema (a medical condition that causes swelling of body parts) that was visible in the Covid-19 patient’s face is not a result of ant bites but heavy medications, The Indian Express reported.Meanwhile, Gujarat on Thursday recorded 27 fresh Covid-19 cases and no fatality – for the 11th successive day, while 33 patients recovered from the virus, the state health department data showed. Following this, the cumulative tally of the state reached 824,829 and the overall recoveries stood at 814,485, the data revealed.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hospital-orders-probe-after-video-shows-ants-on-paralysed-covid-patient-s-face-101627666062435.html

The Union minister also launched the website of the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC).The aim behind the guidelines is to provide a framework for sharing and exchanging biological knowledge, information and data. “It will be applicable to high-throughput, high-volume data generated by research groups across the country. These guidelines do not deal with generation of biological data but are a mechanism to share and exchange information and knowledge generated according to existing laws, rules, regulations and norms of the country,” the statement said.The new framework will also ensure in avoiding duplication and ensuring better decision-making and equity of access. It further said that the guidelines will act as a mechanism for sharing data publicly and within a reasonable period of time after data-generation ensuring maximum utilization of the data.Singh said that the guidelines will be implemented with the help of the IBDC at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology supported by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). Later, the existing datasets and data centres will be bridged to this IBDC which will be called bio-grid.The bio-grid will be the national repository of biological knowledge, information and data. It will also be responsible for enabling exchange of data, developing measures for safety, standards and quality for datasets and establishing detailed modalities for accessing data, Jitendra Singh said.Singh said that being a nation with a population of over 135 crore and due to India’s heterogenous nature it was necessary to have its own exclusive database for Indian research and solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-introduces-guidelines-to-provide-framework-for-sharing-biological-data-101627665231292.html
30-07-2021||India||TN opposes Vedanta in SC to produce oxygen, claims stock full||The Supreme Court will take up an application filed by Vedanta Limited to be allowed the production of medical oxygen at its Tuticorin plant in Tamil Nadu next week even as the state government opposed this request claiming to have enough stock of medical oxygen, HT has learnt.Vedanta’s Sterlite copper plant in Tuticorin was shut in May 2018 following serious environmental breaches observed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. Even as the company is fighting a legal battle in the Supreme Court against the state’s decision to keep its copper plant closed, in April this year, the company came with a proposal to open its plant solely for the production of medical oxygen that was in high demand during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Supreme Court on April 27 allowed the opening of the oxygen plant on a “stand-alone basis” till July 31 and decided to assess later whether the operation needs to be continued.The company claimed that its oxygen plants have a total capacity to produce 1,050 tons per day (TPD) and the same would be supplied for free to the nearby hospitals and various state governments.A bench headed by Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, while passing the April 2021 order said, “We are inclined to allow the prayer for permitting the operation of the oxygen plant on a stand-alone basis for meeting the national requirements during the pandemic. This shall not create any equities in favour of the applicant (Vedanta) to demand or expect the running of the plant as a whole in the future.”On Friday, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Vedanta, mentioned the matter before a bench of Justice Chandrachud and sought permission of the Court to continue with the production of medical oxygen. The bench agreed to list the matter next week. But the Tamil Nadu government represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal opposed Vedanta’s proposal.Sibal said, “We have enough stock of medical oxygen. We do not need any oxygen further. We oppose the application moved by Vedanta.”The bench agreed to consider all arguments at the next hearing. The April order had made it clear that staff or officers of Vedanta shall not be entitled to enter upon the copper smelting plant or any of its appurtenant facilities, including for maintenance. The state was directed to expedite the grant of necessary permissions for obtaining electricity and other utilities for the closed oxygen generating units of Vedanta....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-opposes-vedanta-in-sc-to-produce-oxygen-claims-stock-full-101627665911737.html
30-07-2021||India||Many concerns over Kerala's Covid-19 situation, says central team||The central team sent from New Delhi to Kerala to look into the Covid-19 situation of the state on Friday said there are many concerns regarding Kerala's Covid-19 situation. The sustained rise in the positivity rate is one. "Let us discuss this with the state. It's a comprehensive situation. Let us see how things unfold," Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control said.For the fourth consecutive day, Kerala on Friday reported more than 20,000 fresh infections, which is 50 per cent of India's total single-day Covid-19 tally as the country at present is reporting around 40,000 daily cases. With 20,772 fresh cases, the test positivity rate in Kerala has risen to 13.61 per cent. In the last 24 hours, Kerala tested 1.52 lakh samples and vaccinated nearly 5 lakh people.Of the new cases, 81 are health workers, 137 had come from outside the state and 19,622 were infected through contact with the source of contact being not clear in 932 cases, the release said.Why are Kerala Covid cases increasing? Study says every 100 people spreading infection to 111The situation in Kerala has become the centre of a political blame game as the BJP leaders have put the onus of the spike on the Pinarayi Vijayan government as he had relaxed some restrictions during Eid-Al-Adha. Reports claimed the union health secretary has written a letter to the state government specifying some superspreader events before the increase in the number of cases. Kerala health minister Veena George dismissed any such letter and said that was a campaign going on against Kerala, while many other states commended Kerala for its handling of the pandemic.Kerala health minister said the spike is owing to the increase in the number of tests and also because of the Delta variant which is more transmissible than any other variant.The 4th serosurvey by the Indian Council of Medical Research has found out that Kerala has the least exposure to the infection with only 44 per cent people having antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CPM leaders credited this low exposure to Kerala's successful restrictive measures for which, they said, many people did not develop antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-concerns-over-kerala-s-covid-19-situation-says-central-team-101627664994735.html
30-07-2021||India||SC to revisit arrest shield in 45 cases, could take up more cases||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to revisit its orders in over 45 cases where an interim order staying arrest was granted after the Centre complained that it was hindering the probe being carried out by federal agencies such as the Directorate of Enforcement and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. The top court’s decision to review the bar imposed on investigators from taking coercive arrest followed a request from solicitor general Tushar Mehta who submitted a list of 45 cases where such orders have been passed over a period of time. Mehta, who was appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, asked the court to set aside the stay orders granted in these cases.These were mostly writ petitions filed by the accused challenging the constitutional validity of provisions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Companies Act, and Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act. At the first hearing, the court would issue notice and grant ex-parte stay of arrest by ordering “no coercive steps”, Mehta, the Centre’s second senior-most law officer, told the three-judge bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar.The bench, also comprising justices Krishna Murari and V Ramasubramanian, said: “Our predicament is that this kind of an order directing no coercive steps has been passed in more than one case. We have to consider this for all cases. It should be a consistent order that is to be passed after hearing the other side. But we are going to revisit it.”A five-page note submitted on behalf of the ministry of finance along with the ED’s list said: “The list annexed contains such matters in which the interim orders require to be vacated since in many of the cases, the proceedings before the competent courts are stayed and investigations have come to a standstill for the reason that this court has directed ‘no coercive steps to be taken’.”When the three-judge bench starts the exercise on August 3, it could go beyond the 45 cases listed by the government.Lawyers appearing for some of the accused have already supplemented the ministry of finance’s list of 45 cases and produced an exhaustive compilation of interim orders in matters relating not just to PMLA but under Customs Act, Companies Act, CGST Act and related laws.The total cases, compiled so far, come to 198 cases. These petitions involve cases against former Home Minister P Chidambaram’s son Karti Chidambaram, former Religare Enterprises promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh among others.Earlier, arguing against the practice of accused seeking relief while challenging the constitutional validity of legal provisions, Mehta pointed out a three-judge bench decision in Devendra Dwivedi v Union of India case in January 2021 where the Supreme Court, while dealing with a petition challenging the constitutional validity of provisions of CGST Act, refused to entertain the same.In this case, the apex court held: “The constitutional challenge can be addressed before the high court, and the grievance with regard to the conduct of investigation can appropriately by addressed before the competent authority (high court) in the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226, or as the case may be Section 482 or analogous provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).”The CrPC provides for the accused to apply for anticipatory or regular bail but this relief cannot be sought under a writ petition, Mehta argued.On Friday, former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh also sought similar interim orders of stay of further proceedings and stay of arrest in the PMLA proceedings against him. The bench directed him to supply a copy of his application to the ED and Centre while posting his application on August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-revisit-arrest-shield-in-45-cases-could-take-up-more-cases-101627664771702.html

The finalisation of the action plan was the main outcome of a virtual meeting of the BRICS counter-terrorism working group (CTWG) held during July 28-29 under the chairship of India, the external affairs ministry said on Friday. The ministry described the action plan as one of the key deliverables during India’s chairship of BRICS in 2021. The action plan contains specific measures to implement the BRICS counter-terrorism strategy adopted by leaders of the grouping in 2020. It is aimed at strengthening result-oriented cooperation between the BRICS members in areas such as preventing and combating terrorism, radicalisation, terror financing, misuse of the internet by terrorists, curbing the travel of terrorists, border controls, protecting soft targets, information-sharing, capacity-building, and international and regional cooperation. “The BRICS counter-terrorism action plan is one of the key deliverables during India’s chairship of BRICS and will be adopted at the meeting of BRICS national security advisors scheduled next month,” the ministry said in a statement. Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary for counter-terrorism in the external affairs ministry, chaired the meeting. Senior counter-terrorism officials from all BRICS states joined the meeting. The BRICS states condemned all forms of terrorism “whenever, wherever and by whomsoever committed” during the meeting, and exchanged views on terror threat assessments at the national, regional and global level. The BRICS members also pledged to enhance counter-terror cooperation in line with the action plan. The BRICS counter-terrorism working group meeting was preceded by virtual meetings of the five thematic sub-working groups on misuse of the internet for terrorist purposes, de-radicalisation, countering terror financing, capacity-building, and countering foreign terrorist fighters during July 26-27. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-states-to-adopt-counter-terror-action-plan-next-month-101627663153102.html

The former Maharashtra home minister skipped at least three summonses of the federal probe agency in the past related to questioning in the case. His wife and son were also summoned but they too did not appear.The summonses were issued in connection with a criminal case registered under the PMLA related to alleged ₹100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket in the Maharashtra police. It also led to Deshmukh’s resignation in April. ED in June raided Deshmukh's premises in Mumbai and Nagpur apart from the ones of his aides and a few others. The raids led to the arrest of two of his aides in the case - personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45).The ED’s case against the former home minister of Maharashtra was made after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked him in a corruption case for allegations of at least ₹100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-issues-fresh-summons-to-maharashtra-ex-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101627660613813.html

The carrier too informed on its social media handle that it will operate additional flights between New Delhi and Newark on August 6, 13, 20 and 27. "These are in addition to the existing flights operating on this sector," Air Indian tweeted on Friday. India and United States have a travel bubble agreement after the international flights resumed in 2020. But the number came down following the US Presidential proclamation during the second wave of the pandemic in India. Now, the carrier will increase the number of flights per week from 10 to 21. The number reached 40 in 2020.#FlyAI: Air India will operate additional flights between New Delhi & Newark on 6th,13th, 20th & 27th August '21. These are in addition to the existing flights operating on this sector.Bookings open through AI Website,Booking Offices,Call Centre & Authorised Travel Agents. pic.twitter.com/9LuleCI72qOn May 4, the US government put restrictions on Indians travelling to the US because of the second wave in the pandemic. "Effective May 4, the entry into the United States of certain nonimmigrant travellers who have been physically present in India is suspended by Presidential Proclamation. US citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPR), and immigrants are not subject to the proclamation," the order said. However, students with valid F-1 or M-1 visas intending t begin or continue academic studies beginning August 1, 2021, or later were exempt from this restriction. Students have to enter the United States up to 30 days prior to the beginning of their studies in which case many students have already reached there but as the US visa process in India got delayed, universities will allow late entry in this session.When will the US lift travel restrictions in general?In July, the United States lowered travel advisory for India from level 4 to level 3, which means US citizens should reconsider travelling to India. Level 4 meant no travel. Though this is meant for US citizens and not for Indian travellers wanting to visit the US, the lowering of the warning implied that the US recognised the improving Covid-19 situation in India.However, the lifting of travel restrictions for India in the US will take time as the US has not yet lifted travel curbs for European countries, because of the spread of the Delta variant. A Reuters report quoting White House officials said US authorities do not intend to lift any entry restriction " at this point".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-to-increase-us-flights-amid-fall-season-admission-101627661405811.html
30-07-2021||India||India, US renew agreement for development cooperation in African, Asian countries||India and the US on Friday renewed for five years a global development partnership agreement to work together in African and Asian countries on key issues such as regional connectivity, clean energy and disaster risk reduction. The two countries signed the second amendment to the Statement of Guiding Principles (SGP) on Triangular Cooperation for Global Development. The SGP agreement, originally inked in November 2014, provides a framework for development cooperation in third countries, especially in Asia and Africa. The second amendment to the SGP agreement extends the validity of the pact till September 2026 and expands the scope of capacity-building activities jointly undertaken by India and the US. It also provides a consultative mechanism for joint biannual monitoring and review of activities undertaken under the SGP, which leverages the combined capacities of India and the US to address development challenges facing countries in the wider region and the world. The external affairs ministry said India and the US will continue to offer capacity-building aid to partner countries in multiple sectors, focusing primarily on agriculture, regional connectivity, trade and investment, nutrition, health, clean and renewable energy, women’s empowerment, disaster preparedness, water, sanitation, education and institution building. “This triangular cooperation with the US will complement India’s other ongoing and future development partnerships, capacity-building and technical assistance with countries globally,” the ministry said. The second amendment to the SGP was signed by Abhilasha Joshi, joint secretary of the development partnership administration-II division of the external affairs ministry, and Karen Klimowski, acting mission director in India for the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “The signing of the amendment signifies strengthening India-US cooperation and our joint commitment to work together and leverage our combined capacities to provide demand-driven solutions for global development,” Joshi said. Klimowski said USAID is enhancing its collaboration on joint development programmes with the development partnership administration in recognition of India’s “dynamic economy and growth trajectory, its status as a leader in innovation, and its diverse set of private and public sector stakeholders”. The two sides will now test and scale innovative development solutions worldwide. “Key areas of focus include disaster risk response, clean and renewable energy, and climate-smart agriculture,” Klimowski added. The US-India development partnership spans more than 70 years, and the two countries share priorities, including tackling the climate crisis, increasing the use of clean energy, forging open and inclusive digital ecosystems, promoting inclusive economic growth, and ending the Covid-19 pandemic, the US embassy said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-renew-agreement-for-development-cooperation-in-african-asian-countries-101627660512948.html

30-07-2021||India||Act against YouTube channel ‘auctioning women’: Priyanka Chaturvedi writes to Ashwini Vaishnaw||Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on Friday demanded that the government must take strict action against online platforms which demean and target women. Chaturvedi in a letter to Union minister for information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw said that such acts cannot be tolerated.Chaturvedi was referring to the incident where a YouTube channel conducted a ‘live auction’ of women who belonged to a particular community. She said that the women ‘were rated’ based on their physical appearance and derogatory comments were also uploaded.She also referred to recent attacks on some women journalists on social media where their pictures were uploaded online without their consent in an attempt to humiliate them. Chaturvedi said that these women were mentally scarred and deleted their social media accounts. A woman who worked in the aviation industry told news agency AFP that she is in a constant state of anger after her pictures were seen in the app. “The fourth picture was mine. They were literally auctioning me as their slave for the day. It sends chills down my spine. From that day till today, I am just in a constant state of anger,” the woman was quoted as saying by the news agency.Chaturvedi said that cops in Delhi and Noida registered cases in both instances but due to lack of stringent laws served as a motivation for the perpetrators.Delhi Police earlier in July registered a first information report (FIR) against unidentified persons after pictures of several Muslim women were uploaded without their consent on an app called “Sulli Deals”. The app tried to imply that these women were ‘up for sale’. ‘Sulli’ or ‘Sulla’ is a derogatory term used to refer to people belonging to the Muslim community. Delhi Police also sent a notice to source code depository platform GitHub asking it to share relevant information.Earlier on Wednesday, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) summoned the DCP of Delhi Police cyber cell and the officer who was investigating the case seeking information if any of the perpetrators were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/act-against-youtube-channel-auctioning-women-chaturvedi-tells-govt-101627658406295.html
30-07-2021||India||Kerala announces ₹560 million Covid-19 bailout package||Amid the high volume of Covid-19 cases and frequent shutdowns, the Kerala government on Friday announced a financial package of ₹565 million to revive the economy that is reeling under the impact of the pandemic.On Friday also the state reported over 20,000 cases, according to the state health ministry. When 1,52,639 samples were tested, 20,772 turned positive for the virus with a test positivity rate of 13.61%. For the last four days, the state has been reporting over 20,000 virus cases, accounting for more than half of the total cases in the country.Announcing the bailout package in the assembly, state finance minister KN Balagopal said the government is committed to helping people whose lives were crippled by the onslaught of virus. He said the government will subsidise loans and two new schemes were announced under the state-run Kerala Financial Corporation and Kerala State Financial Enterprises. “We will give loans to small-scale traders, entrepreneurs and framers. The government will bear an interest of four per cent for six months for loans up to ₹2 lakh. This will be a big boost to farmers, small-scale traders and others,” he said, adding the government will also give concession in rent and power charges to tide over the crisis. The state has witnessed a series of suicides last week.“We have requested banks also to provide loans at a cheaper rate and not to insist for dues in the prevailing situation,” he said, adding that the government will give loans up to ₹10 million at five per cent interest to 500 small enterprises this year. This is the third package announced by the LDF government, he said.But the opposition said it was only a gimmick and asked the government to give details of the earlier packages. “We know the fate of earlier packages. This will remain only in announcements,” said opposition leader VD Satheesan. As Covid-19 cases gallop, experts and medical bodies have asked the state government to conduct more genetic studies and seroprevalence surveys to confirm the presence and depth of various strains in the state. “We are depending heavily on the Indian Council of Medical Research for serosurvey and other tests. We all know the ICMR is taking a small number of samples and doing it randomly. The state can do such things elaborately to get a clear picture,” said Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter secretary Dr P Gopikumar. Meanwhile, the 6-member central experts’ team headed by the chief of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr SK Singh will be arriving in the state later in the night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-announces-rs-560-million-covid-19-bailout-package-101627658291213.html
30-07-2021||India||All railway zones have over 170 illegal religious structures: Ashwini Vaishnaw||As many as 179 illegal religious structures stand erected on platforms and yards across all zones of the Indian Railways, Parliament was apprised of by Union minister of railways Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday. These structures are present in the form of temples, dargahs (shrines) and mosques, and have existed since long, he said in a written reply.“Efforts to remove these illegal religious structures from all station platforms or yards have been taken by the railway administration along with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) with the assistance of local administration and Government Railway Police (GRP),” Vaishnaw said in his reply.He added that these structures have been recorded and monitoring is underway on a daily basis to make sure that “no further expansion or extension takes place.”Speaking about the challenges the railway administration faces in order to remove such illegal religious structures, Vaishnaw said that they often experience public agitation. He added that owing to the matter being related to law and order, the encroachments are difficult to remove without the respective state government’s cooperation, which is found “lacking in most cases".“The railways also makes efforts to amicably settle the issue by persuading the members of the religious structure committee to shift the location of their religious structures to other places outside of railway areas,” the minister said.He added that with strict vigilance and monitoring, “further proliferation or mushrooming of these illegal structures has been prevented.”The discussions occurred in Rajya Sabha earlier in the day before the House was adjourned till 11am on Monday amid continuous uproar by the Opposition MPs over Pegasus snooping project.The Opposition MPs have been relentlessly protesting since the commencement of the monsoon session of Parliament, resulting in both Houses being adjourned multiple times.On Friday, Union parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi urged the Opposition to “allow the House to function,” citing that the Pegasus project is a “totally non-serious issue.” “More than 315 members want the Question Hour. Despite that, behaving like this, it’s more unfortunate. IT Minister (Ashwini Vaishnaw) has given a detailed statement in both the Houses,” Joshi said.He added that there are several “people-related issues” that require discourse and that the central government “doesn’t want to pass the bills without discussions.” “We’re ready for discussion but they’re not allowing it,” Joshi added.Meanwhile, on Thursday Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said that they “only want discussion on the Pegasus issue.” “For that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister’s (Amit Shah) presence is necessary. This (snooping) is treason. If they let us discuss the issue, the House will function properly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-railway-zones-have-over-170-illegal-religious-structures-ashwini-vaishnaw-101627657574283.html
30-07-2021||India||These countries have extended travel ban on India | Explained||Despite India's Covid-19 situation being better, several countries are extending travel ban on India in the wake of the rapid spread of the Delta variant. Delta variant was first reported in India in October 2020. It has now spread to over 100 countries and is being seen as the possible reason for the fresh rise in Covid-19 cases in many countries including the United Kingdom.Indian students, however, are being allowed as Indian missions abroad are pushing for the lifting of restrictions.Saudi Arabia said it will impose a three-year travel ban on citizens travelling to 'red list' countries. The list includes India apart from Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates.The United Arab Emirates has also extended the ban on Indian flights. Etihad Airways said that it is not sure when the ban will be lifted.Canada has banned direct flights from India while Indians can reach Canada from any third destination.The Philippines on Friday extended travel restrictions on India and nine other countries as the country is reimposing lockdown restrictions as well.Apart from these countries, Indians can't travel to Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Italy, Kuwait, New Zealand, Oman, Singapore etc.France has recently removed India from the red list and fully vaccinated Indians can now travel to France. Germany has also eased travel restrictions for India.Why some countries are still not allowing Indian flightsReports said broadly there are two reasons behind countries extending the ban on Indian travellers. One, the Covid-19 situation of that country for which it might be bringing back additional restrictions. For example, the Philippines has imposed a lockdown in the Manila capital region on Friday. The extension of the travel ban is part of the country's restrictive measures.Two, the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19. Delta variant is the latest cause of concern and the US health authority has said Delta variant is spreading as easily as chickenpox. Since the variant was first detected in India, some countries might be apprehensive about Indian travellers. Minister for the state, external affairs, V Muraleedharan recently informed Parliament that the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands have eased restrictions for Indian students. So far, travel restrictions have been eased for Indian students by countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Georgia, and more countries are expected to open up travel in future, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-countries-have-extended-travel-ban-on-india-explained-101627656666241.html
30-07-2021||India||Canadian commission comes to aid of student visa applicants facing issues due to Covid||In a bid to clear the backlog of student visas, the Canadian High Commission in India on Friday came up with a special arrangement and opened a dedicated biometric appointments queue so that the process of biometrics is completed sooner. “Taking into consideration the increased demand from Canada student visa customers in India for earlier biometric appointments, VFS Global and high commission of Canada now provide a dedicated queue on the appointment system with increased capacity. Customers applying for all other visa categories are requested to avoid booking appointments under the student visa category,” Visa Facilitation Services (VFS) Global said in a statement.This comes as the situation of the student visa applicants continues to be grim due to the pandemic. Students who have already booked their biometrics appointment will need to cancel their existing appointment in order to book an earlier date using the dedicated queue on the Appointment Management System (AMS).“This priority service is available only for study permits, short-term study and returning students. VFS will cancel appointments from all other applicants booked under the student-dedicated queue on the AMS. “AMS link” https://t.co/ZxBEaDE98S,” read a tweet from the high commission on Friday.As the student visa applicants remain to be in a dicey situation, reports of fraud agents also have come to light. In a statement issued to the applicants, VFS Global said, “Customers are advised to beware of fraudulent entities who charge fees from customers for scheduling appointments, using VFS Global’s name or independently”.British Deputy High Commission too issued an advisory regarding visa fraudsters.In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the British Deputy High Commission (BDHC) listed tips to avoid visa scams and stressed that UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) and visa outsourcing and technology services specialist, VFS Global, would never ask customers to share personal information via social media, and said scammers could use this for online trickery.Pointing out that UKVI or VFS would never ask for visa payments by email or phone, it said that one should pay for the visa application online and if there were any suspicions or incidents, it had to be reported on the link https://actionfraud.police.uk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/student-visa-applicants-face-issues-due-to-pandemic-canadian-commission-comes-to-help-101627654751381.html

The decision to extend the curfew came following a review meeting chaired by chief minister MK Stalin earlier in the day, as the existing norms are scheduled to end at 6am on Saturday (July 31).However, in its latest order, the government has directed the district collectors and the police personnel to strictly enforce the prescribed guidelines. Further, in places where crowding of people could be observed continuously, the government has also empowered the collectors, corporation commissioners and the police to lockdown the area completely considering public welfare.In its previous order on July 16, Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) and industrial schools were allowed to operate with 50% attendance at a time. Moreover, teachers were also allowed to visit their schools for administrative work such as admissions, distribution of textbooks and planning of syllabus.Since the norms would continue with no new relaxations, the cap on the number of people allowed in gatherings would also remain (50 for marriages and 20 for deaths/funerals).Also read | Tamil Nadu to train healthcare workers to brace for 3rd wave of Covid-19Meanwhile, operation of private and government buses between districts (Puducherry exempted), international air travel other than on routes allowed by the Union home ministry, theatres, bars, swimming pools, social and political gatherings, recreational, sports and cultural activities, schools, colleges and zoological parks would continue to remain barred in the state.

I met several leaders. The outcome is good,” she told news agency ANI.Briefing media persons about her trip, she further said that her meeting with various Opposition leaders was for a “political purpose” and that democracy “must go on". “We need to work together to save democracy. Our slogan is save democracy, save the country,” Banerjee said.The chief minister added she will meet Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar next time. “We want development for all…Farmers are on [the] road. My support for farmers will always be there. My concern is [the] rising petrol-diesel price, unemployment, Covid-19…We will come here (Delhi) every two months,” Banerjee was quoted as saying by ANI.Banerjee’s high-profile visit to Delhi included meetings with multiple important Opposition leaders, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi, DMK MP Kanimozhi and even Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari. She told the media of speaking to RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav over the phone on Tuesday.Banerjee also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday – the first official meeting between the two leaders following her landslide triumph in the recently concluded Assembly elections in West Bengal. Later, she told the media that it was a “courteous” meeting and she had raised the issue of Covid-19 and the need for more vaccines and medicines in her state.The TMC supremo has emphasised on Opposition’s unity at the central level in order to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Referring to the popular “khela hobe” slogan that her party used in the 2021 Assembly elections in West Bengal, she said on Wednesday that in 2024 “poore desh me khela hobe” (game will be played across the country). “When general elections come, it will be Modi versus [the] country,” she added.Also Read | 'Poore desh me khela hobe': Mamata on Opposition’s unity ahead of 2024 electionsBanerjee further stated that in the next general elections, the Opposition will be stronger than the BJP and will “create history.” “It is essential for everyone to come together in order to defeat the BJP. Alone, I am nothing – everyone will have to work together. I am not a leader. I am a cadre. I am a person from the street,” she added.The chief minister also met lyricist-poet Javed Akhtar and his actor-wife Shabana Azmi on Thursday. Following the meeting, Akhtar said that he believes a change should come in India. “There are so many tensions in the country right now…There is the issue of polarisation. Many give aggressive statements…There are incidents of violence,” Akhtar told the media.Also Read | No proof needed; ‘khela hobe’ in India, says Javed Akhtar after meeting MamataHe also said that it is beyond discussion now when asked if Banerjee’s “khela hobe” slogan will resonate all over India. “It does not need proof,” Akhtar said.However, Banerjee averted discussion on the face of the Opposition ahead of the 2024 elections saying that she isn’t a “political astrologer.” “We will sit together and decide, I am not a political astrologer. The decisions depend on the system, and on political parties. I cannot impose my decision on others,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-come-here-every-2-months-mamata-as-her-5-day-delhi-visit-concludes-101627652356211.html
30-07-2021||India||DefExpo 2022 goes to Gandhinagar, focus on projecting India as manufacturing hub||India’s flagship military exhibition, DefExpo, will be held at Gandhinagar in Gujarat in March 2022, with a focus on projecting the country as an emerging defence manufacturing hub, one of the top priorities for the government in the defence sector, officials familiar with the developments said.The biennial show will be held in Gandhinagar from March 11-13, the department of defence production announced on Friday. It comes at a time when the government has sharpened its focus on promoting self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector and positioning India as an exporter of military hardware.In May, the government notified a list of 108 defence items that cannot be imported by the armed forces with the ban kicking off from December 2021. The list, called the ‘positive indigenisation list’, will be implemented progressively from December 2021 to December 2025.This was the second such list to be notified by the government in less than a year. In August 2020, the government prepared a list of 101 items on which there would be an embargo on import to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India movement). The embargo for items in the first list, then called ‘negative import list’, kicked in for different items last year and will run through till 2025.DefExpo was traditionally held in Delhi until 2014 after which it has seen a string of new venues - Goa (2016), Chennai (2018) and Lucknow (2020). The venue was shifted to Goa when late Manohar Parrikar was the defence minister, it moved to Chennai when Nirmala Sitharaman held the portfolio and it was staged in Lucknow with Rajnath Singh as the defence minister.Defence manufacturing firms from across the world participated in the five-day mega event held in Lucknow last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated DefExpo-2020, attended by ministers from almost 40 foreign countries.From raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying two lists of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government has taken a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector over the last two years.The first list included artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, light transport aircraft, long-range land-attack cruise missiles, communication satellites, basic trainer aircraft, multi-barrel rocket launchers, a variety of radars, assault rifles, sniper rifles, mini-UAVs and different types of ammunition.The second list consists of several military systems including specified types of helicopters, next-generation corvettes, airborne early warning and Control (AEW&C) systems, tank engines, medium power radar for mountains, medium-range surface to air missile systems and anti-material rifles.India has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20, said a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) in March.The report on international arms transfers attributed the drop in India’s arms imports mainly to an attempt to reduce its dependence on Russian arms and complex procurement processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defexpo-2022-goes-to-gandhinagar-focus-on-projecting-india-as-manufacturing-hub-101627650310816.html
30-07-2021||India||Kerala opposition boycotts session seeking minister’s ouster||Kerala’s Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) members on Friday boycotted the House proceedings for the second consecutive day demanding the resignation of state education minister V Sivankutty who is accused in the assembly violence case.The Supreme Court had rejected the Kerala government’s plea to withdraw the case on Wednesday and asked all six accused, including the minister, to face criminal proceedings for destroying the House property during a ruckus in 2015. As soon as the House was convened, UDF members started raising slogans demanding the minister’s ouster but chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan remained firm and made it clear that there was no need for Sivankutty to quit. Opposition members wanted to know why was the CM protecting the minister who is facing criminal charges for destroying the property of the House. Opposition leader VD Satheesan said the CM’s clean chit to his minister amounts to disrespect to the apex court. He also questioned the CM’s statement that the case was unnecessarily dragged to the court. But the CM maintained his posture. “Police case on assembly ruckus was unprecedented. Usually, such cases are settled under the purview of the assembly rules and proceedings,” the CM said, adding such actions will set bad precedents and undermine the power of the legislature.But the opposition leader said he was casting aspersion on the SC verdict. The CM said he was questioning the way it was dragged to the court, not the verdict. Later, opposition members stormed out of the House after Speaker MB Rajesh denied an opportunity to raise the issue again. “How can the minister remain in the ministry when he was facing criminal charges? Earlier, many ministers have quit citing adverse remarks from courts. Here, the minister is facing criminal charges. The CM will have to drop him to uphold democratic tradition,” said VD Satheesan.In March 2015, the Kerala assembly witnessed violent incidents after opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget alleging his role in the bar bribery case.Angry members destroyed mikes, threw chairs and furniture and damaged lights and electronic equipment in the melee, which also resulted in two legislators landing up in hospital. The session was live when violence broke out and property worth ₹2.20 lakh was destroyed. Five watch and ward personnel were also injured.In 2016, the government tried to withdraw the case, only for a local court to reject it. The Pinarayi Vijayan government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The government also invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it saying privilege was not a licence to unleash violence in the House. The Supreme Court on Wednesday also upheld the lower court’s verdict and directed all accused to face criminal proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-opposition-boycotts-session-seeking-minister-s-ouster-101627648090656.html

30-07-2021||India||Second hearing held on BJP’s plea for Mukul Roy’s disqualification||West Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee on Friday held the second hearing on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s petition for disqualification of Mukul Roy as legislator under the anti-defection law.BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the assembly, attended the hearing. “The anti-defection law has not been enforced in Bengal in the last 10 years. We have faith in the Speaker,” said Adhikari.The first hearing was held on July 16 when Adhikari submitted a 68-page document to back his demand. He said the BJP might move court.Adhikari said anti-defection law is applicable against Roy. “Despite this, he was made chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC),” said Adhikari.Also Read | Bengal govt to set up mangrove resource centre in SunderbanRoy, who could not be contacted for comments, joined the BJP in 2017 and became the party’s national vice-president.

He was made chairman of the PAC on July 9 before the budget session of the assembly ended. An Opposition leader normally gets the post. BJP MLAs, who were made chairpersons of other standing committees, resigned over Roy’s nomination. The speaker later selected TMC MLAs for these posts.The first meeting of the PAC was also held on Friday, but Roy did not attend it. BJP legislators raised the issue. TMC MLA Tapas Roy said, “Roy informed through e-mail that he would not be present. The Speaker used his discretion and allowed the meeting to be held.

Naidu said it has been brought to his notice that some members were blowing whistles in the House while proceedings were on and using placards and standing in front of ministers.His comments came after at least nine Congress leaders tore placards with protest messages on them and threw them in Lok Sabha on Wednesday. An unidentified lawmaker blew a whistle in the Rajya Sabha as the Opposition protested over the alleged Pegasus snooping and the three farm laws.Naidu made the remarks as soon as the House assembled for the day.Also Watch | ‘MPs whistling...Not a bazaar’: RS Chairman lashes out amid Parliament ruckusSuch actions were taking the House to a new low, he said. “There are two ways to deal with this.

Several members trooped into the Well of the House with placards and raised slogans against the government. The ongoing monsoon session of Parliament began on July 19.

30-07-2021||India||India, China to hold 12th round of military talks on Ladakh row tomorrow||Top Indian and Chinese commanders will hold the 12th round of military talks in the Ladakh sector on Saturday to cool tensions between the two countries that have been locked in a border row for almost 14 months, officials familiar with the developments said on Friday. The talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will begin at 10.30am at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), said one of the officials cited above, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The previous round of military talks between the two sides took place on April 9 when the Indian Army told the PLA that disengagement at all friction points on the disputed border was crucial for the de-escalation of the conflict. “We are expecting forward movement in hammering out a disengagement agreement at Hot Springs and Gogra,” said a second official, asking not to be named. The Indian and Chinese armies began negotiations to resolve the border row in eastern Ladakh on June 6, but the two sides have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at friction points on the contested LAC. Also Read | China seizes locally made maps showing Aksai Chin, Arunachal in IndiaThe Indian Army and the PLA have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6, 2020, to reduce tensions along the border. The only significant outcome of the military dialogue has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks. The focus of the next round of talks will be on resolving problems at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector. On May 28, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said his soldiers were on high alert as the PLA continued to base its troops and mechanised elements including tanks in its “immediate depth” across the LAC from where they could be deployed to forward areas at short notice. (Immediate depth in the context of the Ladakh sector refers to a distance of 150km to 200km from the LAC.) Naravane then said results should not be expected after every round of talks, citing the case of Pangong Tso where disengagement took place after nine rounds. PLA’s reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops and restore the status quo ante of April 2020 has hampered the disengagement process, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated. The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff. The two armies held the first round of military talks on June 6, 2020. However, the Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15, 2020, created severe complications and dashed hopes of any significant breakthrough. The brutal clash that left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead created a huge trust deficit between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-12th-round-of-military-talks-on-ladakh-row-tomorrow-101627645870600.html

Earlier, the DGCA banned international flights till July 31 but extended it on Friday.The DGCA however pointed out that international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a "case to case basis" in its circular. International passenger flights were suspended in India from March 23 last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.International cargo flights were allowed to operate though the ban was extended on commercial international flights. Special international flights were operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May 2020 and under bilateral ‘air bubble’ arrangements with selected nations from July 2020.India has air bubble pacts with 24 countries including the US, the UK, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France.Aviation companies continue to face losses as Covid-19 continues to derail the revival of the aviation industry as well as the travel and tourism industry as cases continue to rise in several parts of the world despite the US, the UK and several nations in the European Union (EU) vaccinating its citizens at a faster pace.Breakthrough infections among people who have been totally vaccinated continue to affect plans of full-scale reopening as governments across the planet try to curb the spread of Covid-19. In India, domestic flights are allowed to operate at limited occupancy. Indian domestic air carriers can operate but with 65% of passengers that they used to carry during pre-Covid times. Domestic passenger traffic also saw a decline of around 53% during the April-June period when India was fighting the second wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-extends-ban-on-international-flights-till-august-31-101627644376722.html

30-07-2021||India||Monsoon to enter active phase with heavy rains over central, NW India||Monsoon is entering an active phase with most of the impact expected over parts of central India and adjoining northwest India according to India Meteorological Department.IMD on Friday warned that widespread and extremely heavy (over 20 cm) rain is expected over east Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh till August 4 with peak activity during July 31 and August 3. Widespread rain will also continue over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana till August 4.Widespread rain with isolated heavy falls is very likely over Uttar Pradesh during the next five days while scattered, moderate rainfall is likely over Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab during the next five days, IMD warned. There are likely to be intense rainfall spells intermittently over Delhi also during the period.The eastern end of the monsoon trough is likely to shift north of its normal position during the next 48 hours. Its western end is very likely to remain to the south of its normal position and active during the next 5-6 days.Also Read | Flood alert issued in Delhi after Yamuna breaches ‘danger mark’ amid heavy rainsA fresh low-pressure area is lying over southern parts of central Uttar Pradesh and the associated cyclonic circulation extends upto 7.6 km above mean sea level. Another well marked low pressure area is lying over Gangetic West Bengal & adjoining Jharkhand. It is likely to move west-northwestwards across south Bihar and southern parts of Uttar Pradesh during the next 2-3 days.“There are two low pressure systems, one over Uttar Pradesh, and another over Jharkhand. They have intensified rain. Also, both winds from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are strong making monsoon very active. The monsoon trough is roughly passing along Ganganagar and Delhi which is why Delhi is also seeing some intense spells. But rains will be very intense over central India in the next 4-5 days particularly east Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and west Madhya Pradesh,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.Widespread and very heavy rain is likely over Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar on Saturday and over East Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh till August 2. Isolated extremely heavy rain (over 20cm) is likely over Jharkhand and over East Madhya Pradesh on Saturday.Very heavy rain is likely to continue over east Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh till August 4 with peak activity during July 31 to August 3. Isolated extremely heavy falls (over 20cm) are likely over East Rajasthan during July 31 to August 3 and over West Madhya Pradesh from July 31– August 2 .The current spell of widespread rains over Western Himalayas is likely to continue Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana till August 4. Widespread rain with isolated heavy falls is very likely over Uttar Pradesh during the next five days. Scattered to fairly widespread moderate rainfall is likely over Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab during the next five days.There is a 1% rain deficiency over the country since June 1 with 3% deficiency over northwest India; 1% excess over central India; 18% excess over peninsular India and 15% deficiency over north and northwest India. Despite extreme rains over the west coast and in parts of northwest India, rain deficiency is yet to be covered. “The deficiency remained in July despite monsoon resuming after a break spell of 10 days earlier this month. This is because the distribution of rains was slightly skewed this month with most rain activity happening over the west coast. But now Punjab to West Bengal entire area will see an active spell. There will be intense spells of rain over Delhi and other parts of northwest India. Central India may see some flooding because very heavy rain is expected over east Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-enter-active-phase-with-heavy-rains-over-central-nw-india-101627642630629.html
30-07-2021||India||70 Delta Plus variant cases found across 16 states, UT: Govt tells Lok Sabha||As many as 70 cases of Delta sub-lineage AY.1, also known as Delta Plus variant, of coronavirus were found in genome sequencing, Union science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said on Friday. In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, the minister said that 58,240 samples of Sars-CoV-2 have been sequenced in India so far, out of which 46,124 were analysed by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG)."A total of 70 Delta Plus strains have been found as on 23.07.2021," Singh said.The detection of the Delta Plus variant had initially caused concerns for authorities as the country was already reeling under the disastrous second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, largely driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. The Delta Plus strain is characterised by the B.1.617.2 variant acquiring another mutation, K417N, also found in the B.1.351 or Beta variant.Earlier this month, however, INSACOG said in a bulletin that the sub-lineages of Delta variant were unlikely to be more transmissible than Delta. The consortium of government panels involved in sequencing noted that the cases of Delta sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2 are declining globally, adding that there was no indication of a rising trend in four of the identified clusters in India.The highest number of Delta Plus variant cases in India was detected in the state of Maharashtra (23), followed by Madhya Pradesh (11), Tamil Nadu (10), and Chandigarh (4). Kerala and Karnataka reported three cases of Delta Plus variant each, while two each in Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, and Telangana. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu, Rajasthan, Odisha and Himachal Pradesh reported one Delta Plus variant case each.The sequencing found 4,172 cases of the Alpha variant and 217 cases of Beta variant across the country.Singh said that INSACOG collects samples through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network for public health purposes to assess the impact on transmissibility and disease severity. The 28 laboratories involved in the task of genome sequencing are located in 13 states and Union Territories.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70-delta-plus-variant-cases-found-across-16-states-ut-govt-tells-lok-sabha-101627641823857.html

30-07-2021||India||Bombay HC on Shilpa Shetty case: 'Reporting what police said never defamatory'||The Bombay high court on Friday made some significant observations regarding the right to privacy and press freedom as it was hearing the ₹25 crore defamation suit filed by Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty in connection with husband, businessman Raj Kundra's arrest in the pornography case."The line between freedom of press & right to privacy will have to be balanced. It is possible that freedom of speech may have to be narrowly tailored. But it is not possible to ignore the constitutional pinning of privacy nor to say that if a person is a public figure, that person is deemed to have sacrificed his right to privacy," Justice Gautam S Patel observed, as reported by LiveLaw.The court observes that reporting of something that the crime branch or police sources said is never defamatory and hence expressed doubt on whether a blanket restraint can be issued.At the same time, the court also observed that Shilpa Shetty is the mother of two minor children and just because she is a public figure, it does not mean that she has sacrificed her privacy.The actor who has been interrogated by the Mumbai Police in connection with Raj Kundra's alleged porn racket and web streaming platform Hotshots moved the high court on Thursday alleging that many media organisations have published incorrect, false, malicious and defamatory content against her. Sensationalising the arrest caused "irreparable harm and damage to ger reputation," the actor's plea said.Apart from several media organisations, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube were named in the petition.During the hearing, some of the content labelled as malicious by Shilpa Shetty's lawyer was brought to the notice of the court. Mentioning a commentary of one particular channel, Shilpa Shetty's lawyer said teh commentator passed on remarks about the quality of Shilpa Shetty's parenting as well. Her lawyer also noted that the said video has been taken down by the channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-on-shilpa-shetty-case-reporting-what-police-said-never-defamatory-101627641328430.html

It is open to the defendant (Ramdev) to say that there is no case. Can't say that I won't give him an opportunity,” Justice Hari Shankar said adding that if there is no reply, he would not grant leave for the institution of the proceedings. Ramdev has been asked to reply within next Friday and the case is likely to be heard against on August 10.The plea against Ramdev's comment against allopathy has been moved by three Resident Doctors' Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneshwar, Association of Resident Doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, Union of Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP); Resident Doctors' Association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut and Telangana Junior Doctors' Association, Hyderabad. Though Ramdev withdrew a controversial video where all controversies started, the plea said that Ramdev is an influential person and if he expresses doubt over modern medicine, allopathic treatment, then it will influence the general public.The associations want a permanent and mandatory injunction agianst Ramdev for his allopathy statement.In its earlier hearing, the high court observed that allopathy is not so fragile to be dented by the opinion of Ramdev. Saying this, the court earlier declined to restrain him. "If I feel some science is fake...tomorrow I will feel homeopathy is fake. Do you mean they will file a suit against me? I put in on Twitter.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the national consultation on the elimination of human trafficking, the Union minister said that the passage of the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021, will enhance the government’s cooperation internationally to address the menace of cross-border trafficking."On international nexus with regard to trafficking, in partnership with the External Affairs ministry, we have decided to set up centres for women who are in challenge or in crisis internationally so the women and children get protection,” Irani said at the event organised by the Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation and its sister group Bachpan Bachao Andolan.Earlier this month, the ministry of women and child development invited suggestions for the draft bill aimed “to prevent and counter trafficking in persons, especially women and children, to provide for care, protection, and rehabilitation to the victims, while respecting their rights, and creating a supportive legal, economic and social environment for them.”According to the draft bill, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) will act as the central investigating authority responsible for preventing and combating human trafficking. It will also be responsible for the prosecution of coordination in trafficking cases, including inter-state or international cases.For the first time, Irani said, the government is looking at “trafficking in its entirety as an organised crime”, with the bill proposing enhanced punishment for a “comprehensive list of different forms of trafficking” which are severe in nature. Citing her conversations with different stakeholders, the minister said that the Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not live up to the expectation of the populace with regard to the stringent punishment for human trafficking."The important one aspect I would like to flag is the issue of mandatory reporting and punishment for those who neglect to report a case of trafficking when it comes before them,” she added.Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi said that human trafficking is one of the most lucrative illicit trades across the globe where there is a price tag on human beings. He stressed the importance of building awareness about the draft bill because “we feel this is going to be one of the best pieces of legislation in the world.”“There will always be room for improvisation that we will keep on working on but today is the time we have to put an end to this menace and build awareness about issues and law," he added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-set-up-centres-for-women-in-crisis-globally-union-minister-smriti-irani-101627638481655.html
30-07-2021||India||Another MLA resigns from Assam Cong; to join ruling BJP on Aug 1||Opposition Congress in Assam suffered another setback on Friday with one of its legislators resigning from primary membership of the party. Sushanta Borgohain, two-time Congress MLA from Thowra in Jorhat district, submitted his resignation by mail to newly appointed Assam Congress president Bhupen Borah. The 47-year-old is likely to join the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on August 1. “In his letter Borgohain appreciated the opportunities given to him by the Congress, but stated that due to some recent developments, he won’t be able to continue any longer,” Borah said. Borgohain, who is yet to resign from the assembly, will be the the second Congress MLA after Mariani legislator Rupjyoti Kurmi to quit the Congress and move to the BJP. The developments come within three months of formation of the second BJP-led government in the state. Also Read | Assam Class 10 state board results announcedDespite repeated attempts, Borgohain didn’t respond to calls. “Borgohain has been in touch with us for some time now. He will officially join our party at an event on August 1,” recently appointed BJP state unit chief Bhabesh Kalita told HT from Delhi. He added that another legislator, Phanidhar Talukdar of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) from Bhabanipur seat, will also join the BJP towards the end of next month. “Assam CM isn’t focused on the task at hand. The state is fast losing friends in the northeast, thanks to his actions like issuing travel advisory urging residents of Assam not to visit Mizoram,” said Congress president Bhupen Borah. “[CM Himanta Biswa] Sarma is indulging in cheap politics like saying there is no need of Opposition. Despite enjoying a majority in the assembly, he and the BJP are busy poaching Opposition MLAs and trying to establish a monopolistic regime,” he added. In the assembly elections held in March-April this year, BJP won 60 of the total 126 seats and returned to power with the support of Asom Gana Parishad which got 9 and United Peoples Party Liberal that got 6 seats. On the other hand, Congress bagged 26 and AIUDF got 16. Less than a month after elections results were announced on May 2, two newly elected MLAs --Leho Ram Boro of UPPL and Majendra Narzary of Bodoland Peoples Party died due to Covid-19 complications. Then Congress’s Kurmi resigned, so three seats are vacant in the state assembly. With the elevation of former chief minister and Majuli MLA Sarbananda Sonowal to the rank of Union Cabinet minister, his seat will also be vacant soon. And now, with Borgohain and Talkudar to join the BJP, two more seats are likely to become empty in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-mla-resigns-from-assam-cong-to-join-ruling-bjp-on-aug-1-101627638249983.html

As expert panel gives nod for trial, here is what we know about this||Covishield and Covaxin are two different types of vaccines both of which have been manufactured in India. There have been cases of individuals being mistakenly administered with one Covishield dose with another Covaxin dose. And such cases did not report any major reaction so far. Experts have time and again warned against mixing up vaccine doses, but at the same time emphasised that there is no need to panic if that happens by the mistake of healthcare officials. Several countries have already taken up studies on the issue of mixing two vaccine doses and the results have not been negative. The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has recently recommended a trial of mixing Covishield and Covaxin. Reports said Christian Medical College in Vellore wants to pursue this study and it will soon take place on 300 healthy volunteers.What we need to knowCovishield and Covaxin have been developed differently. Covishield, which is known as the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine worldwide, has been made from a weakened version of the common cold virus. The vaccine, once administered, teaches the body's immune system to fight the real SARS-CoV-2 virus. On the other hand, Covaxin is developed from real coronaviruses which are inactivated.Can they be mixed?Earlier, Indian experts said that mixing Covaxin and Covishield, though they are two different types of vaccines, is theoretically possible. In May, Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said more studies are required to recommend the mixing of vaccines.As vaccination across the world has gained pace, several studies are being conducted on the mixing of vaccines. For example, AstraZeneca and Pfizer have been mixed for a trial. In the latest development, Sputnik V has been mixed with the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine and no serious adverse events were reported.Mixing of vaccine doses and mixing up of vaccine dosesMixing of vaccine doses requires more study the first of which will be taken up in India as the expert panel has given the nod. This will also be the first study on whether Covishield and Covaxin can be mixed. While mixing of vaccines doses is gaining warm response from the medical fraternity across the world, experts have warned that this decision should not be taken by individuals. World Health Organization recently said individuals should not take any decision on mixing vaccine doses. The recommendation will only come from the highest drug authority of any country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-covishield-and-covaxin-be-mixed-as-expert-panel-gives-nod-for-trial-here-is-what-we-know-about-this-101627637407992.html

Sikkim was cut off from the rest of the country as landslides hit multiple parts of National Highway 10, the arterial road connecting the Himalayan state with rest of India. The Eastern and South-Eastern Railway had to cancel multiple trains, including Poorva Express, Lal Kuan Express and Howrah Bhagalpur Express, while many trains connecting Howrah with Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Mysuru had to be either rescheduled or terminated. “The well-marked low pressure, which triggered the rains, was located over interior Gangetic Bengal and its neighbourhood. It is likely to move in the northwest direction across Jharkhand and southern parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh during the next 48 hours,” said a senior official of India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC) in Kolkata. Several areas in south Bengal and in the coastal districts received extremely heavy rain. Panskura in East Midnapore received around 250mm rain in the last 24 hours followed by Uluberia in Howrah and Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas which received around 220 mm rain each. Kolkata received 150 mm rain, according to RWFC data. Also Read | Bengal govt to set up mangrove resource centre in SunderbanThe hills of Darjeeling and Kalimpong received around 110 to 180 mm of rain resulting in rise in river levels and landslides at multiple places. “There was a camp of labourers, who were working on the Sevoke-Rungpo rail project at Mamkhola near Rungpo. Early Friday morning, due to intense rainfall and fall of boulders, the rivulet near the camp got swelled and eight persons in the camp got washed away,” said Hari Krishna Pai, superintendent of police, Kalimpong. At Howrah and New Town where large areas were inundated due to heavy to very heavy rain, boats had to be deployed to rescue people. Large areas in East Burdwan, Howrah and Hooghly were likely to get inundated as the Damodar Valley Corporation was released more water from the barrages in Maithon and Panchet. The sky over Kolkata, however, started clearing up later in the day as the low pressure moved towards the western parts of the state and adjoining Jharkhand. Even though several roads in Kolkata had knee-deep water, the water level started receding as the rains ceased. “We are monitoring the situation. The situation is under control,” said Soumen Mahapatra, state irrigation minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-killed-4-missing-as-heavy-rains-lash-west-bengal-101627636331189.html

30-07-2021||India||Govt moves key Bills on insurance divestment, NCR pollution in Lok Sabha||The government introduced two key Bills in Lok Sabha Friday, one aimed at divestment of the insurance sector and the other to fight pollution in the national capital region, amid protests by Opposition members on various issues. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021. The government also tabled The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021, following which the Speaker adjourned Lok Sabha for the day due to the pandemonium. The insurance-sector Bill is widely seen as a move to privatise state-run insurance companies, following the finance minister’s budget 2021-22 announcement. While presenting the budget 2021-22, the finance minister had said: “We propose to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22. This would require legislative amendments and I propose to introduce the amendments in this session (budget) itself.” The Bill however was not introduced in the budget session held in February. Also Watch | ‘MPs whistling...Not a bazaar’: RS Chairman lashes out amid Parliament RuckusThe amendments to the parent Act, The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 had been approved by the Modi Cabinet on Wednesday. The insurance amendment Bill is part of a larger divestment target of the government as the Modi government plans to sell stakes in five state-run corporations and speed up its privatisation agenda to draw in foreign investment in a Covid-hit economy. The government hopes to achieve its planned divestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 despite hurdles posed by the pandemic. A panel headed by the finance minister had cleared disinvestment and stake reduction of the country’s largest insurer LIC, the first step towards the finalisation of the Bill. The government has also cleared listing of the insurer on equity markets and initial public offerings (IPO), which refers to offering of shares of a company on the stock market to investors. As the Bill was moved, N K Premachandran, a lawmaker from the Opposition Revolutionary Socialst Party, opposed its tabling. “The House is not in order. I strongly oppose the Bill since it is a Bill to privatise insurance.” The finance minister said: “It is not to privatise, we are certainly bringing some enabling provision so that citizens can have some participation. Our market can give the money from retail funds, through Indian citizens. It can enable faster growth for such insurance companies. The public participation is only going to help us by bringing more resources.” The second Bill, The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021, if passed, will see the creation of a statutory panel to monitor and mitigate pollution in greater Delhi for the first time. Farm unions have opposed an earlier ordinance to install a commission to penalise polluters. Stubble-burning, or the practice by farmers to burn paddy remnants, is a cause of deadly winter pollution in northern Indian states, including Delhi. Farmers in food-bowl states of Punjab and Haryana find it cheaper to clear paddy fields after harvest by setting them on fires, claiming they can’t afford costly farm equipment that can do the job without causing pollution. “Opposing such a Bill is one of the reasons why we are protesting. The government should offer a subsidy for us to stop stubble-burning. Farmers don’t have an option,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a farm union leader currently leading protests against three recent agricultural laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-moves-key-bills-on-insurance-divestment-ncr-pollution-in-lok-sabha-101627635789741.html

The Jharkhand high court has already taken suo motu cognizance of the incident on Thursday. The top court clarified that it does not intend to interfere with the proceedings pending before the high court.Also Read | Supreme Court Bar Association president demands CBI probe in Dhanbad judge deathThe high court took serious note of the incident and asked the police to submit details of the case probe.The decision of the top court to take cognizance of the incident is seen as an attempt to monitor the progress of the investigation. Hours after the incident took place, the CJI spoke to chief justice of Jharkhand high court, following which the secretary general of the Supreme Court took up the matter with the registrar general of the Jharkhand high court.The Jharkhand Police have registered a first information report based on CCTV camera footage of the incident. A 14-member special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted, and two persons have since been arrested. The police have alleged that the two were in the auto-rickshaw that caused the accident. The auto-rickshaw was found to be stolen from Dhanbad. Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president and senior advocate Vikas Singh mentioned the incident before the CJI and demanded a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “This is an attack on judicial independence. If judiciary has to remain independent, judges have to be safe. An ADJ cannot be killed in this manner. This matter should be probed by CBI as local police can be complicit,” he said.Suspecting it could be a murder, Singh said that the ADJ had recently rejected the bail of a notorious gangster and the matter needed to be probed. The CJI had appreciated the concern shown by the Bar and said that the situation is being monitored by the high court and if there is any need for the top court to intervene, it will. The disturbing CCTV camera visual of the incident showed how the vehicle in question swerved to the direction of ADJ Anand knocking him down on the road. Looking at the visuals, Singh had said, “There cannot be a more brazen attack on a judge than this. Any judge in this country can be attacked. This is a serious matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhanbad-judge-death-sc-seeks-report-from-jharkhand-within-a-week-101627630149244.html

Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Vedanta in the case, mentioned the plea before the SC regarding the operation of the plant.However, the Tamil Nadu government, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, opposed the plea and said that the state currently has enough medical oxygen. “We oppose this. We already have enough oxygen,” legal news website Live Law cited Sibal as saying. Following this, the top court decided to take up the matter next week for a hearing.The issue came up in the court as the plant was previously allowed by the court to operate until July 31 only for the production of medical oxygen with no access to its copper and power plants within the premises. The Sterlite copper plant, which was shuttered in May 2018 following protests by local residents, was granted this permission to mitigate the ballooning need for medical oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19 infections in the country.Also read | Vedanta’s Sterlite plant dispatches first oxygen tankerDuring the previous hearing on April 27, 2021, Vedanta informed the court that the facility at Thoothukudi could produce 200 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen per day and would start production in the second week of May. The Supreme Court bench of justice L Nageswara Rao and justice S Ravindra Bhat allowed the company to operate the plant under the supervision of a committee that will also decide the number of people on the premises to run the oxygen production unit.Thoothukudi district collector, sub-collector, district environmental engineer, two government officials with technical knowledge of the subject, two experts nominated by people affected due to the pollution from Vedanta’s copper smelter, the superintendent of police and two experts from a list of three people suggested by the Union environment ministry would form the committee, the court had ordered.Also, the then AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu allowed the operations following an all-party meeting in which it was decided that it would be allowed only for the production of medical oxygen. It was also decided that the state would get priority in the oxygen produced from the plant.The first batch, 4.8 tonnes of liquid oxygen, was dispatched from the facility on May 13, the company then said in a statement.The copper smelter plant at Thoothukudi was shuttered in May 2018 following massive local protests against the pollution caused by the plant in which 13 people were killed in police firing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vedanta-moves-sc-seeks-permission-to-continue-oxygen-production-in-thoothukudi-plant-101627629694053.html

30-07-2021||India||Maiden flight of Isro’s new SSLV likely by end of 2021: Minister||The first developmental flight of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro)’s Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2021 from Sriharikota’s Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Union minister for state for the department of space Jitendra Singh said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The flight was initially scheduled for last year. But it has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Isro usually inducts a launch vehicle into its operational fleet after two successful development flights.Singh said SSLV is ideal for the on-demand, and quick-turnaround launch of small satellites. “The major technologies developed as part of realization of SSLV are flexible nozzle control with electro-mechanical actuators for all stages, miniaturized avionics and a velocity trimming module in the upper stage for precise satellite injection,” he said.Also Read | 391 complaints received via SHe-Box: Smriti IraniAjay Lele, a senior fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, said: “We have not been able to successfully create a bio-bubble like China and US that have been carrying out missions through the pandemic. As for the commercial launches like the maiden flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, many customers have already booked slots for their satellites but if the missions keep on getting delayed, they might move towards other launch providers.”Singh also said the earth observation satellite EOS-3 is likely to be launched in the current quarter. HT has reported that EOS-3, also known as GISAT-1 as per the previous nomenclature, is likely to be launched in mid-August, thereby restarting the country’s space activities after a break of four months.The satellite will provide near real-time imaging of the Indian subcontinent that can be used to monitor natural disasters, agriculture, forestry, mineralogy among others. It is one of the two paired satellites, the other being GISAT-2 or EOS-5, which will be able to provide an image of the Indian landmass every 30 minutes with a spatial resolution of 50 metres.Singh said the Space Activities Bill was also under consideration by the government. The bill seeks to ensure licensed entities carry out operations in a manner that prevents the contamination of outer space or damage to the earth’s environment. It provides for imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of over ₹1 crore if any activity is undertaken without prior licensing. The bill says any intellectual property right developed onboard a space object in outer space will be the property of the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maiden-flight-of-isro-s-new-sslv-likely-by-end-of-2021minister-101627626668411.html

30-07-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi expresses concern over rising Covid cases in Kerala||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday morning expressed concern over the rising cases of Covid-19 in Kerala.“Rising cases of Coronavirus infections in Kerala are worrying,” Gandhi said on Twitter. He appealed to people in the state to follow all safety measures and guidelines.The Wayanad MP’s tweet comes a day after the southern state reported 22,000 cases, accounting for 50% of India’s new cases. In the last four weeks, seven of Kerala’s 14 districts reported an increase in daily new infections, government data released earlier this week showed. The increasing trend in cases is triggering apprehensions that this spike might signal the early arrival of a third wave of the pandemic.Kerala declared complete lockdown on July 31 and August 1in an attempt to curb the surge, news agency ANI reported on Thursday, citing state officials familiar with the development.Also Read | Covid-19 R-value rising steadily in India; Kerala, N-E states tops listElaborating on the matter, Kerala authorities said that some of the districts worst hit by the recent surge in Covid-19 are -- Malappuram, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kannur, Thiruvananthapuram, and Kottayam.Meanwhile, union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that the Central government is sending a six-member team to Kerala, headed by the director of the National Centre for Disease Control. “As a large number of Covid cases are still being reported in Kerala, the team will aid the state’s ongoing efforts in Covid-19,” the minister wrote on Twitter.After the health minister’s announcement, MoS of Parliamentary Affairs V Murleedharan criticised the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government in the state and said the formula followed by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has failed. The union minister criticised the state government in Parliament for easing Covid-19 restrictions for Eid al-Adha, while several states cancelled other religious activities because of the pandemic.Kerala government has claimed that it has increased the number of tests so that every single positive case is identified. “We are conducting maximum tests these days. Yesterday [Thursday], we conducted over 196,000 tests. Today we did more than 163,000 tests,” the state health minister stated.Other southern states are also recording an increased number of cases. On Thursday, Karnataka’s Covid-19 case count crossed the 2,000 mark, after 19 days. Daily cases and positivity rates have also gone up in the districts neighbouring Kerala and in Bengaluru, Karnataka’s capital. Tamil Nadu recorded a spike in cases after 69 days. On Thursday, the state recorded 1,859 Covid-19 cases as compared to 1,756 cases on Wednesday.India reported 557 deaths from the virus on Thursday, with Maharashtra recording 190 fatalities, Kerala 128 and Odisha 65.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-expresses-concern-over-rising-covid-cases-in-kerala-101627623968130.html

30-07-2021||India||Bengal govt to set up mangrove resource centre in Sunderban||The West Bengal forest department is planning to set up a mangrove resource centre in the Sunderban. The Sunderban, which spreads over India and Bangladesh, is the world’s largest delta and is home to the only mangrove tiger in the world. There are around 96 tigers in the Indian Sunderban. “We have prepared a detailed project report on a new mangrove centre. This would focus on research on tigers and other wildlife found in the delta, such as estuarine crocodiles and spotted deer,” said a senior forest official. Forest officials said the tiger population in the Sunderban has remained stable in the past year. “In a recent camera trapping exercise, as mandated by the National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India, at least 96 tigers could be identified from the various islands of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve and in the forest of South 24 Parganas,” said the official. A similar exercise last year also pegged the number of big cats at 96. While 74 tigers were spotted in the tiger reserve, 22 individuals were spotted in the South 24 Parganas which comprises three forest ranges. Also Read | Maharashtra’s mangrove cover: Reports by state and Centre differThe forest department has also set up a control room at Sajnekhali, one of the 54 islands inhabited by tigers out of the 102 islands of the Sunderbans. “The control room has been established for monitoring movement of tigers and communication with remote forest camps for protection. We have also prepared a mangrove action plan for five years which would focus on conservation of the mangrove with participation of local communities,” said the official. After the devastation caused by Cyclone Yaas in May this year, the West Bengal government planned to plant 150 million saplings of mangroves in the state’s three coastal districts as a future protection against cyclones. “We would have to take the help of nature to minimise the effect of natural disasters like cyclones. The forest and environment department would plant 150 million mangrove saplings. We would plant 50 million mangrove saplings each in three districts – North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said. The state planted 50 million mangrove saplings in the Sunderbans after Cyclone Amphan ravaged at least six districts in May 2020, uprooting and damaging thousands of trees in its path. In Kolkata alone, 5,000 trees were uprooted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-to-set-up-mangrove-resource-centre-in-sunderban-101627619949342.html

30-07-2021||India||Covid-19 R-value rising steadily in India; Kerala, N-E states tops list||Kerala and northeastern states are among the regions in India where R-value is climbing rapidly, an analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai shows. Kerala has the highest number of Covid-19 active cases and continues to have an R-value around 1.11. The R-factor indicates the speed at which Covid-19 infection is spreading in the nation."Looks like it will remain in the top spot for the next couple of weeks. The Northeast continues to have a very bad situation with most states having R-value more than one," Sitabhra Sinha of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences said, reported news agency PTI.The Union health ministry on Thursday said it will depute a six-member team to Kerala for effective Covid-19 management as the state reports a surge in daily cases.In the northeast, only Tripura has an R-value substantially lower than one while Manipur has gone only marginally below one. Among other states in the country, Uttarakhand has an R-value very close to one at the moment, the analysis stated.The R-value of Delhi between June 21 and June 26 was 0.8. It declined to 0.66 between June 28 and July 6, but rose to 0.84 between July 4 and 20. Delhi on Thursday recorded 51 fresh Covid-19 cases with a positivity rate of 0.08 per cent. Active cases in Delhi stand at 554. Both the daily rise in cases and active infections have remained more or less the same.Sinha said if the number of Covid-19 active cases is constant then the R-value is one as he explained the situation in the national capital. "Even if R momentarily goes over one, there is a possibility that you can contain it. For example, if the active cases are in hundred, you still have the possibility that you contain it before it goes completely out of hand. Once it goes to a few thousand and R is greater than one then the situation is dangerous," he added.The R-value of Pune was 0.85 between July 11-13 and 0.89 between July 15-20. For Bengaluru, the R-value from July 7 to July 13 was 0.92. It increased marginally to 0.95 between July 13 and July 17. It dropped to 0.72 from July 17 to July 23.The R-value of Mumbai was 0.96 between July 2 and July 4. It dropped to 0.89 between July 6 and July 9. It further dropped to 0.74 between July 22 and July 24. For Chennai, the R-value between June 29 to July 7 was 0.63. It shot up to 1.05 between July 16 and July 19. It was 0.94 between July 21 and July 24, showing signs of decline. In the case of Kolkata, the R-value was 0.80 between July 1 and July 13, followed by 0.91 between July 12 and July 17. It dropped to 0.86 between July 17 and July 24.According to the analysis, when the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak, the overall R-value in the nation was estimated to be 1.37 between March 9 to April 21. It declined to 1.18 between April 24 and May 1 and then to 1.1 between April 29 and May 7. Between May 9 and 11, the R-value was estimated to be around 0.98. It dropped to 0.82 between May 14 and May 30 and further to 0.78 from May 15 to June 26. The R-value however rose to 0.88 from June 20 to July 7 and then to 0.95 from July 3-22, it added.Sinha said that when the number of Covid-19 active cases remains in the range of a few hundred and the R-value is near one, an outbreak can be controlled much easier. "India's overall active cases are fluctuating too much to get a reliable estimate, but data is pointing at a value close to one. It may tip over either way in the coming few days," he said.The analysis added that an R-value of 0.95 means that every 100 infected people on an average pass on the infection to 95 other individuals. If the R-value is lesser than one, it means the number of newly infected people is lower than the number of infected people in the preceding period which means the disease incidence is going down.The smaller the value of R, the faster the disease is on the decline. Conversely, if R is greater than one, then the number of infected people is increasing in each round. The bigger the number is than one, the faster the rate of spreading of Covid-19 in the nation, it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-r-value-rising-steadily-in-india-kerala-n-e-states-tops-list-101627611374420.html

US to conduct rare 2nd lottery for H-1B visa, details here||The United States has announced that it will conduct another lottery for the H-1B visa, providing a rare second chance to the hundreds of IndiaIT professionals who were not successful in the first random selection. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) decided to conduct the rare second lottery for H-1B visas after it was seen that the last computerised draw of lots, held earlier this year, did not raise enough Congressional mandated H-1B visas.“We recently determined that we needed to select additional registrations to reach the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 numerical allocations," the USCIS said in a statement. "On July 28, we selected previously submitted electronic registrations using a random selection process.”H-1B visa second lottery: Petitions begin next weekThe USCIS said that it has already started selecting the registrations submitted earlier; however, the petition filing period will begin on August 2 and close on November 3. Initially, the filing period for those with selected registrations for FY 2022 was from April 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021."Individuals with selected registrations will have their myUSCIS accounts updated to include a selection notice, which includes details of when and where to file," the USCIS explained, providing details of the random selection process.H-1B visa second lottery: Who will be eligible?H-1B cap-subject petitions can only be filed by those petitions whose registrations have been selected for FY 2022, the USCIS said.“Registration selection only indicates that petitioners are eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions; it does not indicate that the petition will be approved.

Petitioners must file their respective H-1B petitions on paper and include a printed copy of the applicable registration selection notice with the FY 2022 H-1B cap-subject petition.The H-1B visa is the most sought-after among Indian information technology (IT) professionals since it is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring theoretical or technical expertise. Several tech companies in the US depend on the H-1B visa to hire thousands of workers from nations like India and China each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attention-it-professionals-us-to-conduct-rare-2nd-lottery-for-h-1b-visa-details-here-101627608970080.html

On Monday, the high court adjourned the hearing on a petition filed by the Resident Doctors Association of All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) against Ramdev. The matter was adjourned as the single-judge bench of Justice C Harishankar, who was hearing the matter did not sit.Ramdev, the association alleged, was misleading and misrepresenting that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by Covid-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing the deaths of the patients. It submitted that Ramdev was sowing doubts in people's minds with respect to the safety and efficacy of not only allopathic treatments but also Covid-19 vaccines.The plea stated that it is apprehended that Ramdev's statements can influence lakhs of people and divert them from allopathic treatment which is prescribed as the standard form of care even by the government.The association also alleged in the plea that the misinformation campaign was nothing but an advertisement and marketing strategy to further the sales of the product sold by Ramdev, including Coronil which claims to be an alternative treatment for Covid-19. It pleaded that with the third wave of Covid-19 likely to set in August, it is imperative that Ramdev's sustained misinformation campaign be brought to a halt.The high court issued summons to Ramdev on June 3 on a plea by the Delhi Medical Association (DMA) in connection with his alleged statements against allopathic medicines and claims regarding Patanjali's Coronil kit. It asked Ramdev's counsel orally to tell him not to make any provocative statement till the next date of hearing on July 13 and respond to the suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-to-hear-plea-today-against-ramdev-s-remarks-on-allopathy-101627605010504.html

The Kishtwar relief operation is being led by teams deployed by the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). The Indian Army has also joined the civil administration and the state police in conducting the rescue and relief efforts. However, as of Thursday night, no survivors or bodies could be found, officials said.Although a rescue operation to look for the missing is on, police officials familiar with the matter told HT that chances of finding any survivors "look bleak".Also Read | Kishtwar cloudburst: Rescue teams search for survivorsThe Indian Air Force (IAF), which also joined the operation, conducted eight helicopter sorties on Thursday evening despite bad weather and distributed relief material to the cloudburst-hit Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir."Three IAF helicopters -- one each from Jammu, Udhampur, and Srinagar -- were utilised for airlifting joint teams of the NDRF and the SDRF to Kishtwar," Jammu-based army spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand told news agency PTI.The helicopters flew a total of eight sorties and transported from Sondar to Kishtwar a relief load of 2,250kg, 44 NDRF and SDRF personnel, four medical assistants, and two patients in critical conditions for specialised treatment.Disaster response personnel were rushed to Kishtwar as soon as news of the cloudburst broke out. On Wednesday evening, seven bodies were retrieved and 17 injured were rescued. Six of the injured were shifted to the Kishtwar district hospital in view of their critical condition.Officials say the relief operation is taking a hit as Honzar village neither has any road connectivity nor a mobile phone network. In fact, it takes five hours of trekking just to reach the village from the nearest road.The administration of Jammu and Kashmir has announced an ex-gratia of ₹5 lakh each for the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the tragic cloudburst in Kishtwar. Those grievously injured will be provided with ₹50,000 each, while the SDRF will also disburse ₹12,700 separately to each of the injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kishtwar-cloudburst-search-on-for-survivors-iaf-makes-8-sorties-101627604972670.html
30-07-2021||India||Hearing in Sri Krishna Janmabhumi suit to resume today||A court in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura will on Friday resume the hearing of Sri Krishna Janmabhumi suit seeking the shifting of a 17th-century mosque from a temple, which many believe is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The court on July 24 adjourned the hearing on the Thakur Keshav Dev Ji Mahraj vs Intazamia Committee case. "Both the parties so far have presented written statements in support of their submission," district government counsel (civil) Sanjai Gaur said that day, news agency PTI reported.Defence counsel Niraj Sharma said that since the maintenance of the status quo before 1947 is mandatory as per the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991, the suit deserved rejection. However, advocate Mahendra Pratap Singh claimed that the suit does not come under the purview of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991.Singh said that the act also says that it would not apply if the dispute predates 1947. He added that since the construction made on the part of the land of Keshav Deo temple are covered by Ancient Monument and Archeological Sites and Remains Act 1958, the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, would not apply, and hence the suit is maintainable.On June 23, petitioners in the case offered the opposing parties representing Muslims one-and-a-half times more land some distance away from the Braj area where the temple and mosque that are subject of the legal dispute are currently located and urged them to give up their claim on the land.The offer was made by the petitioners quoting the 2019 judgment by the Supreme Court in the Ram Janmabhoomi case, where the top court ruled in favour of the Hindu parties but asked the government to provide land to Muslims for a mosque. According to the petitioners, the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board and the management committee of Shahi Masjid, Eidgah should accept the offer to resolve the matter amicably.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hearing-in-sri-krishna-janmabhumi-suit-to-resume-today-101627601984914.html

According to the allegations, an amount of ₹4.7 crore, collected as "extortion" from the orchestra bars by dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Waze allegedly on Deshmukh's instructions, was later transferred to the former Maharashtra home minister's Nagpur-based educational trust by his son, Hrishikesh.

30-07-2021||India||‘Against SC order’: Delhi assembly wants new top cop removed||The Delhi assembly on Thursday passed a resolution directing the Delhi government to write to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) seeking immediate withdrawal of the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, and initiate a fresh selection process. The resolution also refers to a legal precedent on the appointment of police chiefs, and claims Asthana’s appointment flouted that.“This MHA order is in complete violation of the Supreme Court of India judgment dated March 13, 2019 in the case titled: Prakash Singh Vs Union of India. The judgment clearly lays down that no individual who has less than six months of service left, can be considered for appointment as head of a police force anywhere in the country. It is a widely known fact that Asthana was to retire from service on July 31 - meaning barely two days later,” read the resolution, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.In May, Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana alluded to the judgment when candidates, including Asthana, were being considered for the post of director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The Union home ministry announced the appointment of Asthana, an Indian Police Service officer from the 1984 batch as the new Delhi Police commissioner on Tuesday evening, three days before his retirement as the director general of the Border Security Force (BSF). He replaced Balaji Srivastava, who was given additional charge as commissioner on July 1.Spokespersons from the Union home ministry and Delhi Police did not respond to requests for comment.At least six Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators, including Delhi home minister Satyendar Jain, participated in the discussion and said the aim of Asthana’s appointment was to “create a reign of terror” in the city and slap false cases against AAP legislators. The MLAs added that the move will also demoralise IPS officers from the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union Territory) cadre, claiming that Asthana was “parachuted” for the Delhi top cop role despite being a Gujarat cadre officer.The resolution marks the latest chapter in an ongoing (and long-running) war of attrition between the Union government and the AAP government. Delhi Police reports to the Union home ministry, through the city-state’s Lieutenant Governor.Opposing the Centre’s decision, AAP MLA from Burari, Sanjeev Jha, tabled a resolution, on the first day of the monsoon session of the Delhi assembly on Thursday. Calling Asthana “the blue-eyed boy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, Jha said the senior IPS officer has been sent on a “special mission to Delhi”. Jain and other AAP MLAs called Asthana’s appointment “illegal”, “arbitrary” and “unconstitutional”. The resolution was adopted after a brief discussion. It stated that the House “expresses its strong disapproval” over Asthana’s appointment for a period of one year or till further orders.The Prakash Singh case refers to the appointment of Director Generals of Police or DGPs.AAP MLA Bhupinder Singh Joon said, “If the Centre does not consider the post of DGP as equivalent to Commissioner of Delhi Police, then it is a demotion for Asthana as he has already served as DG, BSF and if the post of CP is equal to that of a DGP, then it is a clear violation of the SC order.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators opposed the resolution saying that the AAP should rather focus on issues affecting the people of Delhi such as waterlogging and bus shortage. “The AAP government is trying to divert attention from its failure by raising such issues. Asthana’s appointment is within all the parameters of the government rules,” said leader of opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri.The resolution passed by the House stated that the post of commissioner of police, Delhi, belongs to the AGMUT IPS cadre. “This appointment of a controversial Gujarat cadre officer, who has faced multiple inquiries on serious charges in the past, will only bring Delhi Police into controversies. Further, it is beyond any reasonable understanding as to why a controversial officer who was removed by this central government from the post of special director CBI in October 2018 and was not considered fit for the post of CBI director only very recently, is being imposed on the Delhi Police,” it said.“Given the past track record of this officer, there is a reasonable apprehension that the Central Government will use him for foisting false cases on political rivals to create a reign of terror in the national capital,” the resolution stated.BJP’s Bidhuri said Asthana is a decorated officer who has worked during his different tenures with full vigour and determination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/against-sc-order-assembly-wants-new-top-cop-removed-101627601935824.html

Similarly, modern technology based Academic Bank of Credit system will bring revolutionary change. This will give confidence to the student in choosing stream and subjects,” Modi said at an event marking one year of the NEP .Prime Minister Modi also said 14 engineering colleges in eight states to start offering degrees in regional languages including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bengali. “A tool has been developed for translating engineering course in 11 languages. This emphasis on mother tongue as the medium of instruction will instil confidence in the students from poor, rural and tribal background,” said Modi.Engineering education in Indian regional languages has been a key agenda of the education ministry and initially the ministry was pushing to do so through National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) but the move could not go through in 2020 or in 2021.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the rolling out of several schemes will help achieve the goals set by the NEP and improve quality of education both in school and higher education.Other initiatives launched by the PM included Vidya Pravesh - a three month play based school preparation module for Grade 1 students, Indian Sign Language as a Subject at secondary level, and NISHTHA 2.0 - an integrated teacher training programme designed by NCERT. SAFAL (Structured Assessment For Analyzing Learning Levels) - a competency based assessment framework for Grades 3, 5 and 8 in CBSE schools, and a website dedicated to Artificial Intelligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-unveils-education-schemes-on-nep-s-anniversary-101627586761070.html
30-07-2021||India||CM Bommai visits flood-hit Uttara Kannada||Bengaluru: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday visited the flood-affected areas in Uttara Kannada district in coastal Karnataka and took stock of the situation. He also visited Yellapur and Karwar-Ankola assembly constituencies during the visit. “I have visited Yellapura, Sirsi, Ankola and other parts of the Uttara Kannada. Here, landslides have been reported in several places, homes have been destroyed and six people have died. The roads have been damaged and a major bridge, connecting Yellapura and Sirsi, has been destroyed completely,” said Bommai after his visit. He said that the government is looking for permanent solutions to the problem with the help of experts. “The Western Ghats is a sensitive zone. The soil here is prone to landslides. We had noticed this while developing the Konkan railway. So, we are getting opinions from geologists and other experts to find a solution to the problem,” he said. According to the chief minister, providing compensation to those who lost their homes is the priority for the government. “As of now, we will take all the major repairs such as building roads and bridges,” he added. The government has also asked concerned departments to conduct a survey on crop loss. “I have informed the DCs (Deputy Commissioners) to release the compensation at the earliest. The required funds are already available with the DCs,” said Bommai. So far, 10 people have lost their lives in rain-related incidents and two were reported missing in Karnataka. Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, Dharwad and Haveri bore the brunt of the heavy downpour among the 11 affected districts, officials said. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Authority Commissioner said 46,425 people have been evacuated to safety while over 31,000 people have been put up in 246 relief camps. “We are coordinating with SDRF, NDRF, fire department and dam authorities along with district administration,” Rajan (Full name/ designation) said. Over the week, the Opposition had lashed out on the BJP for ignoring the people affected by the floods amidst the change of the guard. Eshwar Khandre, working president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on Tuesday had said that the state doesn’t have a government when it is going through a severe calamity. “When people have lost their livelihoods, the legislators of the BJP are fighting within for power. The BJP has failed the people,” he had said. Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah, also lashed out at the BJP, alleging that the Centre has failed to come to the aid of the state during the floods. “The state government has also not released funds to aid the flood-affected people. It should cut down on other unwanted expenses and mobilise funds to manage the flood situation and provide relief to the affected. Managing the flood situation should be the first priority of the government,” he added. Bommai, however, defended the government saying the union government has released ₹629 crore for flood relief. In the press conference after taking, oath he said, “We have made arrangement to provide relief to those affected by the floods.” he said, adding that he will visit the flood-affected areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bommai-visits-flood-hit-uttara-kannada-101627585859898.html

Later in the day, his office confirmed that he will be leaving to Delhi and meeting Modi on Friday morning. “The cabinet may not be finalised in this meeting but in the next one,” Bommai said in Bengaluru on Thursday. Earlier in the day, speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, in response to a question about pressure on him from ministerial aspirants, he said, “It is common. Once someone becomes the CM and has to expand the cabinet, it is common.” Leaders aware of the development said that at least 10-13 incumbent ministers serving under former CM BS Yediyurappa are likely to be replaced to make room for new faces, mostly younger, as a way to mitigate the simmering tensions that continues to boil over the naming of Bommai as the chief minister.“At least 10-13 sitting ministers will be replaced and new faces, who are mostly younger, will be given a cabinet berth,” said one senior legislator of the BJP, requesting anonymity.The person cited above is one of the probables for a place in the Bommai’s cabinet.A sizable number of the new faces are likely to be youngsters and some from the core-BJP faction within the party who have long nursed the feeling of neglect under the erstwhile BS Yediyurappa-led government.Interestingly, a number of legislators have continued to throng Yediyurappa’s residence to sway some influence in their favour, indicating that the 78-year-old continues to wield his influence over the newly named chief minister who is known to be a close associate of the former.Another senior party functionary, requesting not to be named, on Wednesday said, “The new cabinet is likely to be on the lines of the one at the union government where seniors made way for new faces.” The forming of the cabinet is also likely to change the caste-equations in the state’s three deputy chief minister-model and there is also a possibility of including a maximum of two more deputy chief minister’s as a way to assuage rising disenchantment, the person cited above said .Meanwhile, a number of seers from the politically active Kuruba community on Thursday demanded KS Eshwarappa not only be retained in the cabinet but also be given a “befitting” position for all the sacrifices he has made to build the party and organisation in the state.One prominent seer said that Eshwarappa, a senior legislator from Yediyurappa’s home district of Shivamogga, said that the former has given just as much as Yediyurappa has given to the party and organization. He also threatened that the Kuruba community will come together to confront the “injustice” if he is denied a position.“We wish to tell the national and state leadership, the party and Sangha Parivara to give him (Eshwarappa) a befitting position for all his efforts,” said the seer. Another seer from the community added that though Eshwarappa should have been considered for the post of chief minister, the party should at least think of making him the deputy chief minister.Other seniors like Jagadish Shettar have already indicated that they would not like to be part of the new cabinet, which some people say, was a way to avoid the humiliation of being left out of the list, expected by next week.“When to expand the cabinet and who to induct as ministers is the prerogative of the chief minister. We will have to abide by his decision,” Murugesh Nirani, the former minister for mines and geology said on Thursday in a statement.Interestingly, Nirani had lobbied hard to get a seat at the cabinet which was possible only this January.The stepping down of Yediyurappa also threatens the earlier arrangement that placated most of the turncoats into the cabinet who were rewarded for helping dislodge the HD Kumaraswamy-led government and instate the BJP in Karnataka in 2019.This, people aware of the developments said, could give rise to more dissent within a group whose connections have been firmly with the positions they hold and not with the party, its ideology or the need to fall in line for the larger interests of setting the system right within the government.“I will talk to the chief minister. Those who have helped form this government and how we should give them their due respect and place, Bommai will think about this and I too will give my suggestions on this,” Yediyurappa said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-cm-change-buzz-grows-over-karnataka-cabinet-rejig-101627585500349.html
30-07-2021||India||No deaths of manual scavengers reported in last 5 yrs: Govt in Rajya Sabha||The government told Parliament that no deaths of manual scavengers were reported across the country in the last five years, adding that authorities had extended support under central schemes for rehabilitation of manual scavengers after the practice was banned in 2013.The statement by Union social justice minister of state Ramdas Athawale came in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday to a question by Congress MPs Mallikarjun Kharge and L Hanumanthaiah.“No such deaths have been reported due to manual scavenging,” said Athawale in a written statement, responding to a question about the number of manual scavengers who died in the last five years.The government distinguishes between manual scavenging – a caste-based practice of people cleaning human excreta by hand – and the practice of cleaning sewers and septic tanks though experts point out that the latter is a mere extension of the now-banned practice.While responding to a similar question in the Lok Sabha last year, Athawale had drawn a distinction between the two practices. He had said that no deaths were reported due to manual scavenging but added that 282 deaths of safai karmacharis were reported between 2016 and 2019.In February this year, Athawale told the Lok Sabha that 340 people had died while cleaning sewers or septic tanks in the last five years.In recent years, news reports have pointed to several such deaths of people while cleaning septic tanks and sewers. Most of them were Dalits.In his response on Wednesday, Athawale also mentioned that two government surveys had established that 66692 people were engaged in manual scavenging before 2013. He also mentioned that 14,692 manual scavengers or people dependent on them were assisted financially in 2020-21. “All identified and eligible manual scavengers have been provided one-time cash assistance @ ₹40,000,” Athawale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deaths-of-manual-scavengers-reported-in-last-5-yrs-govt-in-rs-101627585437443.html
30-07-2021||India||2015 Kerala assembly violence: Vijayan defends minister amid row||Thiruvananthapuram: The Opposition Congress -led UDF stormed out of the Kerala assembly on Thursday after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan rejected their demand seeking resignation of education minister V Sivankutty, an accused in the 2015 assembly violence case. An adjournment motion was introduced in the House by Congress member P T Thomas who said it was highly immoral and unjust to allow the minister to continue in the assembly. Though the minister was absent in the house raising speculations the CM later ruled out his resignation “What message you will be giving to students if you continue to allow him in the education ministry. It is a disgrace for a state like Kerala,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan asking the CM to drop him immediately. The chief minister, however, said the court did not get into the merit of the case and it has not taken any specific name. He said all accused legislators were punished by the Speaker after the incident and they were undergoing second punishment. “I feel what happened in the assembly should have been ended there,” he said amid protest from Opposition members who said he was casting aspersions on the judgment of the highest court. He also read out the list of earlier incidents in different Houses to buttress his point. He said in 1997 many ambulances were needed to rush the injured legislators to hospital after violence unfolded in the Uttar Pradesh assembly. But senior legislator Thomas, who introduced an adjournment motion, reminded the CM that a legislator enjoys certain privileges if he speaks and behaves as part of the House proceedings and destroying public property was not part of his privilege. After the CM’s explanation, Speaker M B Rajesh denied permission to the motion and Opposition members stormed out of the house. They later said they will continue to boycott the minister. Many youth outfits also took to the street seeking his exit while a rally of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) outside the assembly turned violent. The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the state government’s plea to withdraw the case and asked all six accused including the minister to face criminal proceedings for destroying the house property during a ruckus in 2015. “Privileges and immunities are not gateway to claim exemption from the general law of the land, particularly as in this case the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen,” a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah said while rejecting the government’s plea. The assembly witnessed violent incidents in March 2015 after the Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget alleging his role in the bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee, which also resulted in two legislators landing up in hospital. The session was live when the violence took place and property worth ₹2.20 lakh was destroyed in the melee. After coming to power in 2016, the government tried to withdraw the case, only for a local court to reject it. The Pinarayi Vijayan government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The government also invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it saying privilege was not a licence to unleash violence in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2015-kerala-assembly-violence-vijayan-defends-minister-amid-row-101627585257447.html
30-07-2021||India||TN IPS officer harassment case: Chargesheet filed against former special DGP, SP||Chennai: The Crime Branch Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) on Thursday filed a charge sheet against two accused in a sexual harassment case filed by a woman IPS officer in Tamil Nadu. “We have filed a charge sheet against the suspended special director general of police (DGP) and the Chengalpattu superintendent of police,” said a senior official in the CB-CID not wishing to be named. “We have also recommended departmental action to be initiated against four others.”The CB-CID has filed a 400-page charge sheet before the chief judicial magistrate court in Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram district by the agency’s investigating officer of the case, Gomathi (only single name available). The case created a furore in the state and the police academy as the IPS officer accused her superior of sexually harassing her while they were on duty together for former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s tour during the previous AIADMK regime. The alleged sexual harassment took place on February 21, when the complainant had travelled in the car of the special DGP. Chengalpattu SP, who was also subsequently suspended, is accused of colluding with the main accused and for using the police force to prevent the victim from entering Chennai to file the complaint.On February 27, the CBCID registered an FIR against the special DGP on several charges under the Indian Penal Code and the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, 2020. Later, an FIR was also registered against the Chengalpattu SP. Departmental action recommended against the four police officers are- the then DIG of Trichy zone, the then Inspector General of Police of the Central Zone, the then SP of Automation and the then Deputy Commissioner of police of the headquarters. The Madras high court took up the case suo moto to monitor the investigations led by the CB-CID, and on June 18, the court gave the agency an extension of six weeks to file its final report. The court had refrained the media from naming the complainant as well as the accused. The Internal Complaints Committee, which conducted an independent enquiry, has already submitted its preliminary report to the Secretary of the state’s Home Department. Another officer said that the CBCID completed e-filing on Tuesday and they would get a charge sheet number on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-ips-officer-harassment-case-chargesheet-filed-against-former-special-dgp-sp-101627585077264.html

30-07-2021||India||CBI suspects Pak hand in ISRO spy case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probing the conspiracy in the infamous ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) spy case on Thursday informed the Kerala High Court that it suspects the hand of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) in the case, HT has learnt.The premier investigation agency made this submission while opposing the anticipatory bail plea of the former joint director of Intelligence Bureau (IB) RB Sreekumar. This is the first time the CBI is taking the name of a foreign agency in the sensational case. Opposing his bail plea additional solicitor general SV Raju told the court it was a serious case and some foreign agencies, including the ISI, were involved in the conspiracy to sabotage the country’s cryogenic project. Later, the court granted him interim bail and directed the CBI not to arrest him till the next hearing.Sreekumar was accused of hatching a conspiracy to frame cryogenic division head, Nambi Narayanan, in the case by the CBI. Earlier, the court had granted interim bail to first accused S Vijayan and another accused S Dugadutt, both Kerala police officers. The court is expected to take the case again on Monday. The spy case surfaced in 1994 when two women from the Maldives were arrested in the state capital on charges of overstaying in the country. Later, police arrested ISRO scientists Nambi Narayanan and Sasikumaran Nair after their numbers figured in their dairies.Heading the cryogenic division of the ISRO, Narayanan and Nair were charged with espionage and other sections. But in 1995, both were acquitted after the CBI inquiry and the case was dismissed. Though the state government filed an appeal in the apex court it was also rejected in 1998.It was a long fight for justice for Narayanan since then. Later, the apex court ordered enough compensation to him and constituted a judicial commission which later recommended a central agency to probe the conspiracy angle. Former circle inspector of Pettah police station S Vijayan, former Kerala police chief Sibi Mathew and RB Sreekumar are among the accused in the case. They were charged with conspiracy, framing of false evidence and illegal custody.Sreekumar was a Gujarat cadre IPS officer and had an uneasy relationship with PM Modi when he was the chief minister. He was on deputation with the IB when the case surfaced and claimed that he had no role in the case and that he never met or interrogated Narayanan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-suspects-pak-hand-in-isro-spy-case-101627584539715.html
30-07-2021||India||Not a single instance of govt intervention since new IT rules: I&B secy||Information and broadcasting secretary Amit Khare on Thursday said that the government has not received a single serious complaint where it had to intervene regarding content on over the top (OTT) platforms, such as Netflix and Hotstar, and digital news media outlets since the new intermediary and digital media rules came into effect on February 25.“In the last five months, there has not been a single occasion when the oversight mechanism of the government was used to resolve any complaints,” Khare said. “This was the purpose of creating a self regulating mechanism; it was always an enabling provision.”The last major complaint received by the ministry was respect to Amazon Prime original show Tandav. Complainants said the show disrespected religious sentiments, said an official familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. The government also sought a response from the makers of the show. The cast and crew have since apologised.Khare added that the lack of complaints, however, did not obviate the need for the emergency powers possessed by the government to order a takedown of content. “The provision may be required at a later stage but only to enable the government to act in case of emergency. As you can see, the government has not had to intervene even once until now.”The new intermediary and digital media guidelines also institute a three-tier mechanism for grievance redressal with an inter-ministerial committee at its apex, require platforms to appoint grievance redressal officers in case of OTT and digital news media platforms, and give the I&B ministry takedown powers over the content circulated online.The takedown powers, which for the first time covered news media outlets, are provided for under section 69(A) of the information technology act. A designated officer of the IT minister, at present joint secretary Vikram Sahay, can order takedown of content under the section in the interest of the integrity and sovereignty of India or if it is seen as a threat to public order.The provision was a major cause of concern, with news media platforms raising their voice against the section stating that it will lead to censorship of content. The rules, which were notified in February, have been challenged in the court by some media companies.“There was a misapprehension that the government will use the oversight mechanism for day-to-day business,” Khare said. “But that is not the case.”While there is no requirement for the digital news media publishers to be registered with the ministry, information pertaining to their grievance redressal officer in India, self-regulating body of which the publisher is a member and the details of the editor were sought by the ministry on May 26. Nearly 1800 digital media outfits and 41 over the top platforms have already shared these.The self regulating bodies of the platforms have also created their own oversight mechanism, which form the second tier of the self regulation system. For the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation, the committee will be headed by Justice (retd) Vikramjit Sen, for IAMAI it will be Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri (retd) and for the News Broadcasters Federation it will be former CJI Jagdish Singh Khehar, the official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-single-instance-of-govt-intervention-since-new-it-rules-came-into-effect-i-b-secy-101627584297295.html
30-07-2021||India||Atanu lights spark, hope rises for India||Atanu Das’s heart was racing, but you could not tell that from his demeanour. He had one shot to beat a two-time Olympic gold medallist (the 2012 individual gold and the team gold here just a few days back), Oh Jin Hyek.Hyek had the luxury of going first in the single arrow tie-breaker. He shot a 9. Das had just one possibility for a win, a bullseye 10. Beads of sweat formed on his face as he pulled on the bowstring on a hot and humid day at the Yumenoshima Park Archery Field. To make matters trickier, there was a light breeze that swirled around the range. Das held on to the drawn bowstring for longer than he usually does. He wobbled, or so it seemed. Then the arrow flew and landed. It was a 10. The moment aptly summed up a turnaround in India’s performance at the Tokyo Olympics, with more athletes stepping into contention as the first week of competition started to wind down. There were no medals on offer for the Indians in competition on the sixth day of competition in Tokyo 2020, but it was a day to remember for the thrills it provided, for the fighting wins from many of the Indians in action, and for the hope it raised for the days to follow.PV Sindhu wrapped up her Round of 16 match against world No. 12 Mia Blichfeldt in straight games, dominating the match and pulling out an array of cross-court backhands, smashes and drop shots. India’s first superheavyweight boxer, Satish Kumar, put himself one win away from a medal with a powerful victory in his first match to move into the quarterfinal. And the Indian hockey team managed to script a remarkable turnaround by defeating the 2016 Olympic champions Argentina 3-1, and qualifying for the quarter-finals just four days after they had been hammered 7-1 by Australia. There was also loss, but it came with its own slice of history as the legendary Mary Kom, six-time world champion and London Olympic bronze medallist, bowed out in the Round of 16 in a closely contested match. This was her last Olympics and possibly the last fight of her career. The biggest spark came from Atanu, whose dramatic face-off with Oh Jin Hyek took him to the last-16.“There is pressure in every match in the Olympics,” Das said. “Obviously I was tense. I was banking on my mind, not my heart. I simply focused and tried to go through the situation,” he said. Das’s morning started brightly with a relatively comfortable 6-4 win against Chinese Taipei’s Deng Yu-Cheng. It was a change from the way the Games have gone so far for him. In the ranking round on July 23, he finished a lowly 35, which meant the higher ranked Pravin Jadhav was fielded instead of him with Deepika Kumari in the mixed team event. Against Jin Hyek, Das lost the first set, shooting two 8s and a 9 to the South Korean’s two 9s and a 8. World No. 1 Kumari, who is also his wife, shouted out encouragement and instructions from the stands. “I could hear her voice from behind me all the time,” Das said, flashing two rings, his wedding band and a gold ring in the shape of the Olympic symbol. “Pushing me all the while, telling me to be myself, that I could do it, to stay calm,” he said. In the next two sets, every arrow from Das fetched a 9. Jin Hyek kept pace. Then came the fourth set, where Das’s opponent slipped to a six. Das pounced on the rare error, producing a 10 in reply to take the set. In the fifth, a nerve-wracking set, the two archers scored in lock-step: 10, 9, 9. Das felt that his sight needed slight recalibration. After a quick chat with coach Mim Gurung, the sight was adjusted. It worked. “We saw that all three of his last shots were closer to 10s, one just touched the 10, but we wanted to be more accurate, so that the shoot-off arrow can hit the inner 10,” said Gurung.During the shoot-off, Das drew strength from the fact that he had been in this situation before, against the same opponent, at the 2019 Asian Archery Championship. There, in the bronze medal match, Das had managed an X (the inner circle of 10) to Jin Hyek’s 10 in the tie breaker. “The situation in a match changes rapidly and those who can handle that well, can move forward,” Das said. “I kept my nerves,” he said. Das will have another challenge on his hands against London Games silver medallist Takaharu Furukawa of Japan on July 31.Kumari goes up against Ksenia Perova of Russian Olympic Committeein the Round of 16 on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atanu-lights-spark-hope-rises-for-india-101627584119783.html
30-07-2021||India||Pegasus row: IT panel chief seeks action against officials||The head of the parliamentary committee on Information and Technology, Shashi Tharoor, has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking action against three government officials for contempt of parliament after they expressed their inability to attend a meeting to discuss the Pegasus spyware controversy, people aware of the matter said.The officials are the secretaries of the ministry of home affairs, the ministry of electronics and information technology, and the department of telecommunications; they were summoned by the panel for a meeting planned on July 28, to discuss the use of the malware to purportedly snoop on Indian citizens . The meeting was eventually called off after panel members from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) boycotted it, leaving it short of the quorum required to hold it.The fact that there was no quorum may come to the rescue of the officials though, an expert in parliamentary matters said.A person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named, said the secretary of MHA sent a letter seeking exemption as he had to attend an unavoidable meeting at the same time. The IT secretary said he was in a meeting with the joint parliamentary committee chairperson on the personal data protection bill. The DoT secretary too expressed an inability to attend the meeting, citing urgent parliamentary work, this person added.“This is a breach of privilege and contempt of Parliament to not attend a departmentally related standing committee meeting,” the person mentioned above quoted the IT panel chief as saying in his letter to the Speaker.A second person familiar with the proceedings said it was extremely rare for officials to skip a meeting like this at such short notice. “I think the last time something like this happened was in 1960s and even then the officials were held accountable,” the person said.Separately, two of the ministries — telecommunications and electronics and IT— sent in background notes to the panel elaborating the current rules through which the government protects citizen data and protocols that can exist for legal interception of communications, the first person quoted above said. The Union home ministry did not submit a background note and neither of the two ministries that did mentioned Pegasus or its use, this person added.A consortium of media organisations began reporting a series of stories since July 18 on a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers -- some belonging to politicians, journalists and activists -- around the world. The numbers are believed to have been selected for targeting for surveillance by clients of the NSO Group, which makes the military-grade mobile device spyware Pegasus. Of the 50,000 Amnesty International analysed 67 devices, and 37 of these confirmed a Pegasus infection.Dozens of numbers on the list were linked to Indian citizens, including opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, journalists, activists, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and the current electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. The panel summoned officials to hear from the three above mentioned ministries regarding this issue, which has snowballed into one of the main controversies over which protests have broken out in parliament.The government has called allegations regarding the use of Pegasus baseless and devoid of fact.Wednesday’s meeting was called off after the panel failed to achieve quorum, which requires the attendance of at least one-third of the members . The BJP panel members staged a walk out, alleging the panel head was using the committee for a political purpose.According to the first person quoted above, words were exchanged between BJP’s Nishikant Dubey and Congress’s Karti Chidambaram and Trinamool Congress’s Mahua Moitra. Dubey earlier in the day moved a breach of privilege motion against Tharoor, seeking his removal as the panel head.On Thursday, he tagged Trinamool leader and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in a tweet and said he was abused “ by TMC MP Mahua Moitra” and that it exposed the “party’s hatred towards north Indians, especially the Hindi-speaking people, in front of the country”. He had added that Moitra had called him a ‘Bihari Gunda’ thrice in the meeting.Moitra hit back saying that she was a “bit amused by charges of name-calling”. She added that the IT meeting “did not happen” and members did not attend any meeting. “How can I call someone a name who was not even present! Check attendancesheet!” she said in a tweet.The ministries’ responses filed with the panel remain consistent with the government’s stance on lawful interception of information as outlined by Union minister Vaishnaw on July 19.MeitY, in the note mentioned above, said that “privacy of personal data is a fundamental right with reasonable restrictions as enshrined in the Constitution”. It highlighted section 43(A) of the information technology act, which entitles the victim to compensation in case of unauthorised access to their data. It also highlighted the challenges to data privacy.“Anonymity of data stealers provides yet another challenge in finding the perpetrator. Awareness about the need to protect personal data is one of major challenge. Also security w.r.t. hacking and leakage of data is a challenge. New forms of cybercrime like ransomware, where user data and system is hacked and encrypted and ransom is demanded to decrypt the data has emerged as a big challenge,” the ministry said.It added that there is need a for a robust data protection law and that once the Personal Data Protection Bill becomes an Act, it will lay the “foundation of data privacy and cause a paradigm shift in how personal data is perceived, processed and protected in India”.DoT outlined provisions for lawful interception and safeguards for citizens’ data under the Indian telegraph Act. It outlined the grounds under which “the government can intercept and monitor the communication from any telephone number after obtaining authorization from the Union home secretary, who can authorise the interception in any part of the country and home secretary of the State, for that State”.According to former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary, in keeping with convention, the officials who are called have to appear and if they can’t, they have to take the permission of the chairperson. “The rule is that the committee meeting has to be given the highest priority. However, in they are called away for another urgent meeting, they will have to apologise to the chair,” he said. “Not attending is a breach of privilege. If the speaker approves the notice, then the privilege committee will examine the issue.”He said a wilful absence by an official is what becomes a matter of privilege. “But if the committee does not meet, if there is no quorum, then none of this counts. These are all well settled practices,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-row-it-panel-chief-seeks-action-against-officials-101627584119201.html
30-07-2021||India||2 held in Jharkhand judge’s death case, matter reaches SC||The Dhanbad police have recovered the auto rickshaw that hit the additional district and sessions judge Uttam Anand that led to his death on Wednesday morning and arrested two persons who were allegedly riding the vehicle at the time of the incident.The police on Thursday also formed a 14-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by additional director general of police Sanjay Anand Lathkar to investigate the matter after the Jharkhand High Court (HC) on Thursday took suo-motu cognizance of the incident. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana too spoke to the chief justice of the Jharkand HC Ravi Ranjan on the issue.Director General of Police Neeraj Sinha and Dhanbad senior superintendent of police Sanjeev Kumar attended the hearing in the HC in person and provided details of the investigation to the bench of the chief justice.“Prima facie it appears that the additional district judge has been killed deliberately. The police took immediate action and arrested the two persons who were riding the vehicle and recovered the auto rickshaw. Their interrogation is on. A 14-member SIT has also been constituted to investigate the incident. It is a very sensitive matter and we will ensure that the probe is completed and conduct a speedy trial and punish the guilty,” said Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan, who appeared on behalf of the government before the HC.Responding to the bench’s remark that it would transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation if the investigation was not done professionally, the AG said while it was the prerogative of the court to do this, the progress in investigation after the incident has been satisfactory.The police have filed a murder case in the incident after CCTV footage of the incident showed a vehicle deliberately swerving on an empty road to knock down the judge. Uttam Anand was killed on Wednesday morning after he was hit by an unidentified vehicle near the magistrate colony when he was out for his daily morning walk. The auto rickshaw used in the incident, which was allegedly stolen from Dhanbad, was later recovered from the neighbouring Giridih district on Wednesday night itself.“Based on facts that came up during the investigation and the CCTV footage, two people and the auto involved in the crime were identified. Two persons, identified as Lakhan Kumar Verma and Rahul Verma have been arrested and the auto was seized from their possession. They have confessed to the crime. Further investigation will be done carefully,” said Amol V Homkar, inspector general (operations).While the police are yet to reveal the motive of the alleged killers, the family of the judge, who was cremated in his hometown Hazaribag, demanded a CBI probe. “The CCTV footage makes it very clear that it has been done as part of a conspiracy. We demand an impartial probe headed by a judge or the CBI,” Subham Sambhu, younger brother of Anand, told reporters.Judge Anand was reportedly hearing some high profile criminal cases. He recently rejected the bail plea of a gangster from Uttar Pradesh who is in jail in connection with a high profile murder case of Dhanbad.In Delhi, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President and senior advocate Vikas Singh made a demand for an independent probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the death of Anand.Mentioning the matter before the Supreme Court, initially before a bench headed by Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and later before Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, Singh said: “This is an attack on judicial independence. If the judiciary has to remain independent, judges have to be safe. An ADJ cannot be killed in this manner. This matter should be probed by CBI as local police can be complicit.”CJI Ramana who specially took up the case told the SCBA President that he has spoken to Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan of Jharkhand High Court, who assured him that the matter will be taken up by the High Court on the judicial side. “The chief justice of the high court has spoken to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Dhanbad. Even the Secretary General (of the Supreme Court) spoke to the Registrar General of the high court this morning. If there is any need for us to be involved, we will take it up.”The CJI appreciated the concern shown by the Bar saying, “We are overwhelmed at the initiative shown by SCBA. We appreciate the steps taken but let us not jump into conclusions.”Suspecting it to be a murder, Singh said that the ADJ recently rejected the bail of a notorious gangster and the matter needed probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-in-jharkhand-judge-s-death-case-matter-reaches-sc-101627584118712.html
30-07-2021||India||Govt-Oppn meet to end logjam in the works||In a last-ditch attempt to salvage the remaining part of the monsoon session, the government’s floor managers have started reaching out to Opposition leaders to end the logjam arising out of the protests over the Pegasus snooping row and the three farm laws.A senior parliament functionary who asked not to be named said that the government may consider holding a meeting with Opposition leaders from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha in the next few days to address the issue. A senior Opposition leader maintained that while they will participate in any such meeting , they will continue to insist on their demand for a debate on the Pegasus snooping row in which the phones of Opposition leaders, ministers, journalists and government functionaries were potentially targeted with military-grade spyware.On Thursday, leader of the Rajya Sabha and Union minister Piyush Goyal, and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi met leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge to propose a meeting between the parties. According to a Congress leader, Kharge said that the dialogue should be initiated by someone senior -- such as defence minister Rajnath Singh.The monsoon session, the first full sitting of Parliament in 18 months, has faced disruption from its first day over Pegasus, farm laws and spiraling fuel prices. Opposition leaders have raised placards, snatched a statement from the new IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, blown a whistle and stormed the well of both Houses. A Trinamool Congress member, who snatched the minister’s paper, has been suspended for the remainder of the session. The raging Covid-19 pandemic forced Parliament to cut short three sessions and scrap an entire session before this one -- but now there are a mere 11 days left in it.The Opposition claimed that while the government is eager to end the logjam, it has virtually ruled out any debate on Pegasus snooping charges.“There has been no proposal from the government so far on ending this stalemate. Remember, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj had said in January 2011, it is the government’s job to run Parliament, not that of the opposition,” said Jairam Ramesh, the Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha. His reference is to a period when the BJP, in opposition, made it difficult for the Congress-led UPA government to conduct business.A top leader of the ruling dispensation, according to Parliament functionaries, has asked the BJP’s floor managers to try to reach out to Opposition parties to seek a resolution.According to an analysis by PRS Legislative Research, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have functioned only 23% and 13% of their alloted time this session. Only eight bills have been passed in their respective House -- and without any debate and amidst the din.The government has been able to clear just a fraction of its legislative agenda while the Opposition has been able to debate only the Covid-19 situation, one of the several issues it wanted to raise.The strategy groups of the Congress for the two Houses met together on Thursday and the party’s leaders decided to work with Opposition parties and continue the protests.At least three government functionaries added that there is no plan as of now to curtail the session in the wake of the protests. “The government wants to run the House and will seek cooperation from all Opposition parties,” said a senior government leader.A functionary even claimed that the government didn’t immediately seek suspension of the eight Congress MPs who tore placards and threw papers in the House on Thursday “possibly hoping that a situation can be created for amicable negotiations to run the monsoon session”.The session started on July 19 and is scheduled to end on August 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govtoppn-meet-to-end-logjam-in-the-works-101627584117315.html
30-07-2021||India||Plea filed in SC against validity of Sachar Panel formed by ex-pm||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court questioning the authority by which former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh constituted the Justice Rajender Sachar Committee in March 2005 to report on the social, educational and economic status of Muslim community in the country.The petition filed by five individuals led by Neeraj Shanker Saxena claiming to be followers of Sanatan Vedic Dharm said, “The notification dated March 9, 2005 issued from the office of Prime Minister nowhere mentions that same was being issued after any Cabinet decision. Thus, it is clear that the then Prime Minister on his own whims issued the direction appointing the Committee to enquire into the social, economic and educational status of Muslim community whereas by virtue of Articles 14 and 15 no religious community can be treated separately.”The committee headed by former Delhi High Court Chief Justice Rajender Sachar submitted its report to the Government of India on November 17, 2006 suggesting a host of recommendations to improve the education, employment and economic standards of Muslims keeping in mind their low representation in government jobs.“The appointment of Sachar Committee was made in violation of Article 77 of the Constitution of India and is unconstitutional and illegal,” said the petition filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain. It also sought an order to restrain the Government from acting upon the report. “The power to appoint a commission to investigate into the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes vests with the President of India under Article 340 of the Constitution of India,” it added.A separate petition filed by the same petitioners challenging the constitutional validity of National Commission for Minorities Act,1992 and special schemes launched by Centre is pending consideration before the top court. In that matter, the Centre filed an affidavit stating that special schemes were decided in pursuance of Sachar Committee report. The petitioners then decided to challenge the validity of the Sachar Committee report after a gap of almost 15 years.The plea argued that Muslims as a religious community cannot be treated as a special class for benefits available to backward classes as this violates fundamental rights of similarly placed Hindus whose conditions were not gone into by the Sachar Committee. The petitioners claiming to be small businessmen repeated some misconceptions about Muslims. “The Committee has shown undue favour to Muslim community. It is matter of fact that Muslim community does not believe in family planning, and they are not very interested to impart education to their children in schools whereas all these aspects go to the root of the matter but the same have not been considered .”Tracing the constitutional policy on this subject, the petition pointed out the Constituent Assembly in its meeting held on October 14, 1949 discussed a proposal on the status of religious communities but accepted the amendment moved by K.M Munshi for appointment of Special Officer by the President only for Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes to investigate all matters relating to safeguards provided to them in the Constitution.“A proposal which was considered and rejected by the Constituent Assembly cannot be enforced by indirect extra constitutional methods by issuing an order by the PMO,” the petition said. Again, in May 1949, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the President of the Advisory Committee on Minorities and Fundamental Rights informed that “recommendations relating to providing reservation to minorities would be inappropriate and lead to certain degree of separatism and against the concept of secular democratic State”.The petition also claimed that the economic conditions of Muslims had changed for the better -- and pointed to some of Bollywood’s top actors, and senior government officials and politicians as evidence of this. “Therefore, no special provision can be made in favour of Muslim community as the same being based on religion is clearly forbidden by Article 15 (1) of the Constitution of India.” Article 15 promises that no citizen shall be discriminated on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-filed-in-sc-against-validity-of-sachar-panel-formed-by-former-pm-manmohan-singh-101627583999635.html
30-07-2021||India||Photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was executed by Taliban: Report||Pulitzer Prize-winning Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was not simply killed in a crossfire in Afghanistan, nor was he simply collateral damage, but was "brutally murdered" by the Taliban after verifying his identity, according to a report published in a US-based magazine on Thursday.Siddiqui, 38, was on assignment in Afghanistan when he died. The award-winning journalist was killed while covering clashes between Afghan troops and the Taliban in Spin Boldak district of Kandahar city.According to the Washington Examiner report, Siddiqui travelled with an Afghan National Army team to the Spin Boldak region to cover fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban to control the lucrative border crossing with Pakistan.When they got to within one-third of a mile of the customs post, a Taliban attack split the team, with the commander and a few men separated from Siddiqui, who remained with three other Afghan troops.During this assault, shrapnel hit Siddiqui, and so he and his team went to a local mosque where he received first aid. As word spread, however, that a journalist was in the mosque, the Taliban attacked. The local investigation suggests the Taliban attacked the mosque only because of Siddiqui’s presence there, the report said.“Siddiqui was alive when the Taliban captured him. The Taliban verified Siddiqui’s identity and then executed him, as well as those with him. The commander and the remainder of his team died as they tried to rescue him,” it said.“While a widely circulated public photograph shows Siddiqui’s face recognizable, I reviewed other photographs and a video of Siddiqui’s body provided to me by a source in the Indian government that show the Taliban beat Siddiqui around the head and then riddled his body with bullets,” wrote the writer Micheal Rubin, who is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.The Taliban’s decision to hunt down, execute Siddiqui, and then mutilate his corpse shows that they do not respect the rules of war or conventions that govern the behaviour of the global community., the report said.Siddiqui won the Pulitzer Prize in 2018 as part of the Reuters team for their coverage of the Rohingya crisis. He had extensively covered the Afghanistan conflict, the Hong Kong protests and other major events in Asia, Middle East, and Europe.Siddiqui was laid to rest at the Jamia Millia Islamia graveyard where a sea of mourners gathered to pay their last respects.His body arrived at the Delhi airport in the evening of July 18 and was later brought to his residence in Jamia Nagar where a huge crowd, including his family and friends, had gathered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/photojournalist-danish-siddiqui-was-executed-by-taliban-report-101627583649814.html
30-07-2021||India||Din in House over snooping row, farm laws continues||Opposition parties’ protests against the Pegasus snooping row and the three farm laws,marred another day of the monsoon session of Parliament even as the government managed to clear key bills in the two houses.Amid the continuous shouting and sloganeering from Opposition members, the Rajya Sabha passed the Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which aims to help the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector in the availability of working capital, while agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar was able to introduce the Coconut Development Board (Amendment) Bill.In the Lok Sabha, members of the Bharatiya Janata Party led protests, demanding an apology from Opposition leaders for throwing papers on the Chair.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said on Thursday that he was “saddened” by the incident and warned of a strict action against “habitual offenders” of the Parliamentary rituals. “I am very hurt over the incident that occurred on July 28. Flinging papers towards the Chair, disregarding the Chair is not in line with the parliamentary practices.” “If this continues, I’ll have to take any action against those members in order to maintain the decorum of the House,” he added.While Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said the Opposition has not been able to put forth its point due to the adamant attitude of the government, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi hit back, saying that “they (Opposition) threw big bundles of papers towards us, the chair and the media… do they not want to even apologize to the chair?”Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also took a jibe at the Centre over the issues, saying that they “were not allowing” the Opposition to raise the issues of “national importance.”The Congress also accused the government of hiding from discussing Pegasus because they have “a lot to hide”.“I am making a proclamation here that today you discuss Pegasus, tomorrow we will discuss everything. Why are you avoiding discussing Pegasus? They are hiding, they have much to hide,” said Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi during a press conference.The lower house later passed two bills before the proceedings were adjourned for the day amid continuous protests by Opposition members. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill 2021 and The Inland Vessels Bill, 2021 were passed without debate.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/din-in-house-over-snooping-row-farm-laws-continues-101627583817881.html
30-07-2021||India||Bill to acquire medical college passed in C’garh||The Chhattisgarh assembly on Thursday cleared a controversial bill to acquire a private medical college 50 km from state capital Raipur amid loud protests by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which alleged the Congres government signed off on a sweet deal with the college management to bail out the loss-making institution.The Chandulal Chandrakar Memorial Medical College (Acquisition) Bill 2021 was passed by a voice vote after a debate in the assembly where the Congress’ 70 members vastly outnumber the BJP’s 14 lawmakers. BJP legislators later walked out of the assembly, demanding that the government roll back the bill cleared by the assembly moments earlier.Health minister TS Singhdeo, who piloted the bill in the assembly, said the acquisition of the college was a step towards providing health facilities to the poor and common people.“This is the best option to start a government medical college in the state with limited resources,” Singhdeo told the assembly that it will annually cost the exchequer only ₹140 crore to run the college. He also countered claims by the BJP that the medical education regulator, the Medical Council of India, has cancelled the college’s recognition, and said the MCI has sanctioned 150 seats.The medical college was set up in 2013 in memory of the veteran Congress leader Chandulal Chandrakar. The acquisition, however, turned controversial after it emerged that among those on the board of the medical college is a member of the joint family into which chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s daughter is married.During the two-hour-long debate on the bill, Congress leaders emphasised that the bill will not transfer the liabilities of the college but only provide for the acquisition of its assets.The BJP, however, questioned section 8 of the bill that specified that the government would get an assessment of the college’s movable and immovable assets and then pay the owners, twice the assessed value.The leader of the opposition in the assembly Dharamlal Kaushik said this did not stand to reason. “When the government is facing a financial crisis and has a debt of around ₹76,000 crores, an additional government expense of ₹140 crore is not logical. Secondly, why is the government is paying twice the amount of the valuation of the medical college through acquisition? This could lead to corruption which is also not logical,” Kaushik said.Former chief minister Raman Singh said the government should have upgraded an existing 600-bed government hospital in Durg rather than acquiring a loss-making private medical college if the government wanted to expand health facilities. Singh said there was an attempt to sell the college in the past and litigation was still on to recover ₹35 crore paid to the owners in advance.“The bill has been brought to ensure relief to directors from debts,” Singh.Senior BJP MLA Brijmohan Agrawal said the bill is aimed at benefitting only some people. It is even against the interest of people who lent crores of rupees to the college and its employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-acquire-medical-college-passed-in-cgarh-101627583698162.html
30-07-2021||India||Prashant Kishor’s I-PAC team gets anticipatory bail from Tripura court||AGARTALA: Twenty-three members of Prashant Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) ordered to appear before the Tripura police for alleged violation of Covid-19 restrictions were granted anticipatory bail by an Agartala court on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said.The team, which arrived in the state last week to assess the potential of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to expand its base ahead of the 2023 state elections, were ordered to stay in their hotel on Sunday evening till their Covid test results come in.The staffers of the political advisory firm tested negative on Tuesday. The same day, the Agartala police ordered them to appear before the police on August 1 in a case relating to violations of Covid guidelines. The group subsequently approached the court for the shield against arrest.“The public prosecutor raised objection for their bail. But the court granted them bail,” said Pijush Kanti Biswas, who appeared for them. Biswas is also president of Tripura Congress unit.Saroj Bhattacharjee, the officer-in-charge of East Agartala police station, suggested the group overreacted.“We got to know that they got bail from the court. But it is absurd to take bail in a (case filed under a) bailable section,” said the officer-in-charge of East Agartala Police Station Saroj Bhattacharjee.Bhattacharjee also insisted that the police didn’t detain them as was alleged by the I-PAC team. “They were served a notice under Section 41A (of the Criminal Procedure Code) on July 27,” the officer said. This section empowers the police to summon a person suspected to have committed a cognizable offence.An I-PAC member said they opted for the arrest shield from the court given how the state administration had acted over the last few days.“The way administration was dealing with us, it was safe to take bail… We had an indication that we might be stopped from leaving the state when we want to go,” the person said.Chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who has been criticised by opposition parties for the restrictions imposed on the team over the last several days, said the government welcomed all guests. “We believe in the culture of Atithi Devo Bhava. But as Independence Day is close, Covid restrictions have been imposed. In this time, movement of any unidentified persons are seen, the police hold an inquiry,” he said, adding that the government did not intend to interfere in the action taken by the police.Meanwhile, seven activists from Congress including Subal Bhowmik, who is also a former BJP vice president, joined Trinamool Congress in the presence of West Bengal education minister Bratya Basu, law minister Malay Ghatak and TMC leaders Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, Derek O’Brien and Ritabrata Banerjee. Subal Bhowmik, who had been with the Congress for decades, joined the BJP in 2014 before returning again to the Congress in 2019.“We took the decision to join the Trinamool Congress due to need of the time and people. Tripura has jungle raj for the past four years. Mamata Banerjee is the only leader who can show direction to the country. The Trinamool Congress will form its government here in 2023 Assembly polls,” Bhowmik told the reporters after joining. BJP spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said everyone was free to exercise their choice, and the party has no comments to make on this. “But I think that he himself has joined jungle raj party. We can see the reflection of jungle raj in West Bengal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-s-i-pac-team-gets-anticipatory-bail-from-tripura-court-101627583577891.html
30-07-2021||India||ED arrests Ambience Group chairman in money laundering case||Raj Singh Gehlot, chairman of Delhi-based realty firm Ambience Group, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case associated with a bank fraud of ₹902 crore, officials familiar with the developments said. He was remanded to the central agency’s custody for seven days by a Delhi court on Thursday.Gehlot, the owner of Ambience malls in the National Capital Region and the five-star Leela Ambience Convention hotel in east Delhi, has been accused of money laundering worth ₹469 crore. He was arrested under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by the central agency late on Wednesday, an ED official said on condition of anonymity.There is clear evidence of diversion of the loan amount through a web of companies, the official added.The central agency is probing the case against Ambience Group on the basis of a 2019 First Information Report registered by the Jammu Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) against M/s Aman Hospitality Pvt Ltd (AHPL), a group company, and its directors for purported money laundering in the construction and development of the five-star ‘Leela Ambience Convention Hotel’ situated at 1, CBD, Maharaj Surajmal Road, Near Yamuna Sports Complex, Delhi.A loan of ₹810 crore was sanctioned to the company by a consortium of banks led by Jammu and Kashmir Bank for developing the hotel. The loan amount along with the interest totaling ₹902 crore has already been declared as non performing asset (NPA).“The investigation conducted so far revealed that Raj Singh Gehlot entered into a criminal conspiracy to fraudulently divert the loan amount by diverting the funds for other purposes such as to settle the loan of other group companies and making fixed deposits as well as diversion of materials to other projects of the Ambience Group,” the officer cited above said.The officer added that an amount of ₹469 crore was found to be diverted to entities and individuals who are controlled by Gehlot and for which he is an authorized signatory.Last year, the anti-money laundering probe agency also raided seven premises, including the office of AHPL, other companies of the Ambience Group, and the residences of Gehlot, directors Dayanand Singh and Mohan Singh Gehlot and their associates in this regard.Gehlot’s communication team was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-ambience-group-chairman-in-money-laundering-case-101627583517756.html
30-07-2021||India||HC stays Nagaland govt’s order on compulsory vaccination||The Kohima bench of the Gauhati high court stayed Nagaland’s order asking government employees to get fully vaccinated or produce Covid-19 negative reports every 15 days, adding to a growing debate on the legality of compulsory vaccination and its potential impact on fundamental rights.The decision, which was made public on Thursday, came on a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the government’s July 17 order issued by the chief secretary. The verdict comes days after a similar judgment by the Manipur high court.In the order, Nagaland told the staff of the civil secretariat and directorates to get vaccinated or produce Covid-19 negative test reports every 15 days to attend office, failing which the government would stop paying their salaries beyond July 31 and they will be sent on unpaid forced leave.During Wednesday’s hearing, the government advocates objected on maintainability of the PIL and submitted that no interim order be passed. However, the court ordered a stay on the government order and directed to list the matter on August 18 along with similar other PILs on the same issue.“Till the returnable date, fees should not be charged for testing from government employees and their salaries should not be stopped for reason of not having being vaccinated,” the court stated. The court also kept the question on maintainability of the PIL open “for the sake of clarity”.This is the most recent in a raft of similar orders and observations by high courts.In Meghalaya, the government had made it mandatory for shopkeepers, vendors, local taxi drivers and others to get themselves vaccinated before resuming businesses. On June 23, the Meghalaya high court ruled against any policy that makes vaccination mandatory to exercise other fundamental rights.The court said mandatory vaccination affects an individual’s right, choice and liberty significantly more than affecting the general public, and impinges upon the autonomous decision of an individual human being of choosing not to be vaccinated.On July 5, the the Aizwal bench of the Gauhati high court observed that restrictions imposed by the Mizoram government on movement and work of persons who are yet to get vaccinated for Covid-19 were arbitrary and violated the provisions of the Constitution.The decision came in response to standard operating procedures issued on June 29 by Mizoram, which included a provision that stated, “Only vaccinated individuals of the family members may be detailed for errands within and around localities having significant Covid19 active cases.”The SOPs also said that only vaccinated persons should be engaged in manning stores, shops or undertaking any works. Store attendants and other employees should be able to produce proof of vaccination. Only those drivers and conductors of commercial passenger vehicles who have been vaccinated should be allowed to operate public transport, according to the SOPs.On July 13, the Manipur high court ruled that “denying people their livelihood by linking their employment to their getting vaccinated would be illegal on the part of the state”.The ruling came after a state government notification proposed to prioritise opening of institutions, organisations, factories, shops, markets, private offices etc where its employees and workers are Covid vaccinated. The government order on June 30 also said that it would also apply to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MNREGA) job card holders and workers of government/private projects.But the court observed that such measures trample upon the freedom of the individual to get vaccinated or choose not to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-stays-nagaland-govt-s-order-on-compulsory-vaccination-101627583517168.html
30-07-2021||India||China targets Antony Blinken for meeting Dalai Lama aide||The Chinese government on Thursday lashed out at the US secretary of state Antony Blinken for meeting Tibetan leader Dalai Lama’s representative in New Delhi, terming it “a violation of the US commitment to acknowledge Tibet being a part of China”.The statement came a day after Blinken began his formal engagements in New Delhi on Wednesday by meeting Ngodup Dongchung of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA). Dongchung presented Blinken with a scarf from the Dalai Lama and conveyed the CTA’s gratitude for the US administration’s backing of the Tibetan cause.“The 14th Dalai Lama is not a mere religious figure, but a political exile who has long engaged in anti-China separatist activities and is trying to separate Tibet from China,” said spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, at a press briefing.Shortly after the meeting, Blinken also met Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of Tibet House in New Delhi, for a civil society roundtable.Asserting that Tibet affairs were purely China’s own affairs and should not be interfered with by any outside forces, Zhao said: “Any formal contact between the US and the Dalai clique is a violation of the US commitment to acknowledge Tibet being a part of China; do not support Tibetan independence, do not support attempts to separate China.”“We urge the US to honour its commitment to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibetan affairs, and offer no support to Tibet independence forces to engage in anti-China separatist activities,” he added.The engagement with Dongchung was seen as the most significant contact between American and Tibetan officials since former president Barack Obama met the Dalai Lama in Washington in 2016 and former CTA head Lobsang Sangay was invited to the White House last November.The meeting also came days after US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and raised American concerns about human rights, including abuses in Tibet, the anti-democracy crackdown in Hong Kong, and the genocide in Xinjiang.People familiar with the development, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the meetings are being seen as a strong signal of support for the Dalai Lama and was also significant as it was held in India at a time when New Delhi and Beijing are locked in standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).On July 6, in a rare public message from an Indian leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished the Dalai Lama on his 86th birthday.Weeks later, on July 21, China’s President Xi Jinping visited the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) for the first time, beginning his visit from a border village close to the border with Arunachal Pradesh.In May, China said it would choose the successor to the Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party China (CPC)-ruled central government.Citing historical precedence, a government policy paper on Tibet, said that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).“The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of ‘drawing lots from the golden urn’, and the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China,” the White Paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-targets-antony-blinken-for-meeting-dalai-lama-aide-101627583400613.html
30-07-2021||India||Centre approves 27% OBC, 10% EWS quota in medical courses||The Union government on Thursday announced 27% reservation for other backward class (OBC) students and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS) in the all India quota of seats for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses, accepting a longstanding demand months before crucial elections in five states.The decision is seen as an effort by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to consolidate its support among the OBCs and the poor ahead of upcoming state elections early next year, including in Uttar Pradesh, where OBC communities have significant electoral heft.The reservation will be implemented from this academic session and benefit 5,500 students, said the Union health ministry. This includes 1,500 undergraduate OBC students and 550 EWS students, and 2,500 postgraduate OBC and 1,000 EWS candidates.“Our government has taken a landmark decision for providing 27% reservation for OBCs and 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Section in the All India Quota Scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate medical/dental courses from the current academic year,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“This will immensely help thousands of our youth every year get better opportunities and create a new paradigm of social justice in our country,” he added.Government medical seats in India are assigned under two streams: all-India quota (15% of undergraduate seats and 50% of postgraduate seats) and state quota. The all India quota, set up under the Supreme Court’s orders in 1986, is for candidates from across the country and the state quota largely caters to domiciled students.The government implemented 27% OBC reservation in higher-educational institutions in 2006-07 but didn’t include medical and dental course seats under the all-India quota.In recent years, OBC groups have claimed that the communities lost around 11,000 seats due to this lack of reservation and their mounting protests have pushed some state governments, such as Tamil Nadu, to approach the courts in this matter. Last year, the Madras high court ruled that there was no legal or constitutional impediment in extending OBC reservation to all-India quota seats in state-run institutions.On Monday,the PM held a review meeting where he instructed the health ministry to expedite the process of clearing the decks for the decision.On Wednesday, a group of OBC ministers and lawmakers representing the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) met PM Modi to push for allowing admissions from the all India quota.The decision can significantly influence the electoral prospects of the BJP that is seeking re-election in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat next year. In Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, OBCs make up around 40% of the population.Since coming to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP has made a concerted effort to woo OBCs, giving them more politics space and positions in authority. This helped the BJP pitch itself as an alternate to parties such as the Samajwadi Party or Rashtriya Janata Dal that counted OBCs as core supporters.In recent months, the BJP renewed its outreach to make up for the alienation within the communities over lack of employment and economic development avenues. The most recent example is the Union cabinet expansion, where the party included three senior OBC leaders in the council of ministers. There are 27 other backward classes (OBC), 12 scheduled castes (SC) and eight scheduled tribes (ST) in the council of ministers, according to the data shared by the government.In 2019, the UP government extended reservation to 17 important castes by including them in the OBC list.“The BJP has shed its image as a party of the so-called upper castes. It is for this reason that OBC leaders were given prominence in states such as UP and Bihar and to some extent in Gujarat. A concerted attempt was also made to give the non-dominant OBC communities such as Kurmi, Kushwaha, Chaurasia and the Lodh more political space. The results of 2014 [general election] as well as the 2017 UP election showed that the outreach has worked and these communities have found an alternate in the BJP,” said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity.Thursday’s decision is also expected to placate dominant castes who are concerned by the possible impact of sub-categorisation of OBC reservation on quotas for them in government jobs and educational institutions. Though the committee on sub-categorisation of OBC reservation has not yet submitted its final report, it has put forth that one-fourth of the total 27% reservation for OBCs has been cornered by about 10 caste groups.“Overall there has been an increase in the party’s vote share from a large constituency among the OBCs and the Dalit voters because after the Mandal agitation the parties that spoke of championing social justice became family-oriented parties. With this decision the Modi government has met the long-pending aspirations of the OBCs, the EWSs and it will definitely stand to benefit,” said a second leader.The 10% reservation for EWS category announced in 2019 was seen as an effort by the party to retain support from the upper castes who were miffed with the outreach towards the OBCs, Dalits and the extremely backward castes.“The economically weaker sections in the general category, especially upper castes have been a core voter the party. When the government talks of sabka saath… it was imperative to ensure their welfare as well,” said a lawmaker from UP.Political analyst Manisha Priyam said the decision will “undoubtedly help the BJP” and aid in placating the “anger or concerns that emerged among the communities post the covid pandemic”.“The OBCs have not moved away from the BJP; but this will address whatever concerns they have had,” she said.Sandeep Shastry, also a political analyst, however, said that the benefits of the decision will depend on how it pans out on the ground and if it withstands legal scrutiny.Some Opposition leaders called the decision a token effort.“Mere tokenism in the name of social justice can’t dupe aware OBCs! How the anti-OBC NDA govt is going to compensate the OBC students for the loss of seats they have suffered for all these years due to denial of their rightful reservation in the NEET exams?” asked RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, whose party counts the dominant OBC group of Yadavs as a key support base.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-approves-27-obc-10-ews-quota-in-medical-courses-101627583399407.html
30-07-2021||India||Centre rushes team to Kerala amid rise in Covid infections||The Union health ministry has sent a six-member multi-disciplinary team to Kerala on Thursday to monitor the on-ground Covid-19 situation there and suggest measures to control the spread of infection, as the state remains the country’s biggest hotspot region accounting for nearly half of India’s new cases.The central team, headed by director of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Dr Sujeet Singh, will reach Kerala on Friday, according to a statement by the health ministry.Nearly one in every two new Covid-19 infections recorded in India over the past week have come from Kerala, that is defying the national trend of falling infections since the decline of the country’s brutal second wave of infections. As of Wednesday night, the state has 150,040 active cases, accounting for 37% of all such cases of the country.According to data from the health ministry, seven districts in Kerala have been reporting an increase in new infections over the previous month.The average weekly positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested, generally indicative of the spread of the infection within the community – currently stands at 12.1% in Kerala, nearly five times that of the national average of 2.4% in the same period. The World Health Organization recommends that a 5% threshold for positivity rate be taken at which the Covid-19 infections in an area can be said to be testing adequately according to the caseload at hand. A number higher than 5% signifies that the region needs to test more to identify cases and isolate them as soon as possible.“Central government is sending six-member team to Kerala headed by NCDC director. As [a] large number of Covid cases are still being reported in Kerala, the team will aid state’s ongoing efforts in #COVID19 management,” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday.To be sure, there are indications that the state has been able to detect true infections better than any other region. Data released by the health ministry on Wednesday from the fourth round of national sero-surveillance by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed that the prevalence of antibodies – a measure for whether someone has been exposed to Sars-CoV-2 virus – was 44.4% in Kerala, the lowest among the states surveyed. The state also has a Covid-19 mortality rate of 0.5%, the best of any major state in the country, and significantly better than the national average of 1.3%.The results appear to explain Kerala’s current high numbers, experts said.“This is not surprising at all; Kerala implemented good Covid appropriate behaviour and strict lockdown since the first wave. The cases went down in places such as Bihar, UP, and Delhi not because people started following Covid appropriate behaviour but because a significant proportion was already exposed to the infection. What this means is that the second wave will continue in Kerala for a while and high number of new cases will be reported,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, head of the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rushes-team-to-kerala-amid-rise-in-covid-infections-101627583398043.html
30-07-2021||India||Assam urges its residents to avoid travel to Mizoram||Assam issued an advisory on travelling to Mizoram on Thursday as tensions between the northeastern neighbours continued to simmer three days after a fierce gunbattle at a disputed border killed seven people and injured 41 others.Assam asked its residents not to travel to Mizoram due to safety concerns and asked those already in the state to exercise caution. The unprecedented advisory came on a day a state minister upped the pitch against Mizoram, which alleged that the larger state had imposed an informal economic blockade by refusing to let goods pass through.“Given the critical prevailing situation, the people of Assam are advised not to travel to Mizoram as any threat to personal safety of people of Assam cannot be accepted,” said the advisory issued by MS Manivannan, commissioner and secretary in the home and political department.The advisory, which was brought into force with immediate effect, urged the people of Assam staying in Mizoram “due to work-related compulsion” to exercise “utmost caution”.“Certain Mizo civil society, students and youth organizations are constantly issuing provocative statements against the state of Assam and its people,” the advisory read. “In view of the above and with the purpose of ensuring safety and security, a travel advisory is hereby issued to all people of Assam,” it added.The police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle at a disputed border in southern Assam on July 26, in which six Assam policemen died. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on its forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claimed the land belongs to it.The clashes led some residents on the Assam side to block some sections of National Highway 306, disrupting transportation to the neighbouring state.On Wednesday at a meeting called by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the two sides agreed to withdraw their police forces in the four-km disputed stretch which runs between Vairengte in Mizoram and Lailapur in Assam along NH-306. They also agreed to the deployment of central paramilitary troops in the area till a permanent solution is found.But tensions refused to die down.Assam urban development minister Ashok Singhal, forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya, Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy and local MLA Kaushik Rai visited the Lailapur border area on Thursday afternoon.“We have always supported the peace and wanted to solve the matter by dialogues. But at this moment peaceful discussion is not possible. We cannot talk about peace over six dead bodies of our police officials,” said Singhal.Rai raised the pitch even further.“Mizoram has forgotten that their lifeline moves through Assam’s land. If we block the supply of their essential commodities, they will starve to death...It is time for us to take revenge against them. We are supporting a complete economic blockade at all the roads connecting Mizoram with Assam,” he said.In another order, Assam said all vehicles coming to the state from Mizoram will be thoroughly checked for drugs. A separate circular asked deputy commissioners and police chiefs in Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Cachar districts to ensure the safety of persons from Mizoram staying in Mizoram House in Guwahati and Silchar.In Mizoram, too, anger mounted.Talking to a Hindi news channel on Wednesday, Rajya Sabha MP K Vanlalvena said, “Next time Assam Police tries to enter our territory, we will kill them all.”Mizoram’s home secretary Lalbiaksangi also wrote to the Centre complaining about the economic blockade.“Assam has blocked National Highway-306 since July 26 which has persisted till date. NH-306 is the main highway for the flow of essential commodities and supplies into Mizoram. The blockade is affecting the livelihood of the people of Mizoram adversely,” wrote Lalbiaksangi on Wednesday. He appealed to the central government to intervene.Drivers of several Mizoram-bound trucks said they were stuck near Lailapur. Ram Pravesh, a 35-year-old driver was carrying material for an oxygen generation plant at Aizawl Civil Hospital. He said, “When I started from Delhi, I didn’t know that is happening here. For almost three days, I am stuck here and I cannot go back also. I am not the only one here; we have so many people like me spending nights in fear.”In an open letter to Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday, J Lalmuanzuala, president of Mizo Students Union, had suggested that Mizos would not shy away from resorting to arms if they are “taken for granted”.Assam Police have registered a case of murder against unknown persons and is probing the role of Mizoram MP K Vanlalvena in the clashes.(With inputs from Biswa Kalyan Purkayastha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-urges-its-residents-to-avoid-travel-to-mizoram-101627583037815.html
