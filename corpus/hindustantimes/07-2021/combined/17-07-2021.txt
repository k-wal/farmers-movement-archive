17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana records 911 sex ratio at birth in first six months of 2021||When Haryana had recorded 922 female births per 1,000 males in 2020, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had set 935:1,000 as the sex ratio at birth (SRB) target for 2021.The ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ flagship programme that Khattar monitors, appears to have suffered some setbacks in the last six months with the cumulative SRB till June dipping to 911, show the official data that HT has accessed.Karnal district is among six worse performing districts with 888 SRB in six months - 23 points lower than the total SRB of Haryana.Data showed that the cumulative SRB, a critical indicator of gender equality, has dropped by nine points this year. During the corresponding period (till June 2020), the SRB of Haryana was 920.Haryana had managed to meet its SRB targets in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic posing challenges to the flagship programme that in the last six years has significantly bridged the gender imbalance in state.“The SRB so far this year is not on the expected trajectory. The fall is sharp and reasons are plenty - from Covid to touts involved in pre-birth gender determination tests,” said an official involved in the programme, refusing to be identified.“We have been observing every year that after dip in May-June, the SRB jumps during the second half of the year. Nonetheless, the birth registration data of first six months is being re-checked,” the official said.Dr Veena Singh, director general health services, Haryana, didn’t respond to the phone calls and text messages.Though per month SRB fluctuates, the total SRB this year so far has been lower than the corresponding months in 2020. For example, the SRB of the state this year in January was 918, February 922, March 921, April 918, May 912 and June 911.In 2020, between January and June the cumulative SRB fluctuated in the range of 937 in January and 920 in June.The annual SRB numbers have steadily improved in state, from 832 in 2012 to 868 in 2013, 876 in 2015, 900 in 2016, 914 in 2017-2018, 923 in 2019, and 922 in 2020.“If the current trend continues this year, we may have to console ourselves with 920 annual SRB in 2021,” an official said.The primary reason behind this pessimism about dip in the annual SRB among those monitoring the programmes stems from past experiences.For instance, in 2017, the SRB till June was 910 and the annual SRB that year was 914.ROHTAK LEADS WHILE KARNAL LAGSRohtak led the state with an SRB of 962 in six months, followed by Charkhi Dadri 945, Panipat 937, Mahendergarh 931, Rewari 927, Panchkula 926, and Jind 925.Palwal and Sirsa were tied at the eighth spot with an SRB of 923, Nuh recorded 922, Gurugram 914, Kurukshetra 911, Ambala 909, Hisar 908, Kaithal 902, and Yamunanagar 900.The worst-performing six districts with the SRB hovering between 858 and 895 in the first six months of 2021 are Faridabad (895), Sonipat (888), Karnal (888), Bhiwani (887), Fatehabd (862), and Jhajjar (858).Total 2,20,841 births (1,05,255 females and 1,15,586 males) were registered in 2021 till June with 911 SRB.Nuh recorded the highest 23,176 births (12,057 males and 11,119 females) during the first six months, followed by Faridabad (18,116), Gurugram (17,130), and Hisar (14,852).85 RAIDS, FIRs IN SIX MONTHSOfficials said this dip in the SRB this year has been despite tightening of noose around those involved in sex-determination tests.This year so far, 85 first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged under the PNDT (Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act and the MTP (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) Act.These 85 FIRs were registered after successful raids were conducted within and outside state.Sources said in January, 20 raids and FIRs were registered, 14 in February, 15 in March, 12 in April, no FIR in May, 10 in June, and 14 in July so far.Last year, 100 FIRs were registered. Among the raids conducted last year, 40 were inter-state raids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-records-911-sex-ratio-at-birth-in-first-six-months-of-2021-101626546439096.html

We believe that conferring Bharat Ratna on Sunderlal Bahuguna ji will be an honour for the Bharat Ratna award itself. I hope that you will consider this request of the Delhi government and take an appropriate decision in this direction at the earliest.”Uttarakhand native Bahuguna, aged 94, died of Covid-19 at a hospital in Rishikesh on May 21. A recipient of India’s second-highest civilian award, Padma Vibhushan, Bahuguna’s work revolved around people’s rights over forests in the Himalayas.The Aam Aadmi Party had earlier announced that it plans to contest all 70 seats in the Assembly elections in Uttarakhand next year.“Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Bahuguna ji spent his childhood fighting for the freedom of the country during the Independence struggle. After Independence, inspired by Sant Vinoba Bhave, he committed himself towards the goal of Bhoodan and Gram Swaraj Yojana. When the world was blindly engaged in the environment’s exploitation and the sense of environmental protection was not even a part of the international discourse, sensing the threat upon the nation and the entire world, Bahuguna dedicated himself to the cause of protecting the environment,” read the Delhi CM’s letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/confer-bharat-ratna-on-late-sunderlal-bahuguna-kejriwal-writes-to-pm-101626544997024.html

Boys and girls both tend to get provoked. There can be curious and compelling demand to get in such kind of relationship. There is sexual maturation,” said special judge Priti Kumar Ghule, after noticing that the case was borne out of an affair.The accused was allegedly in a relationship with the minor since two years before they eloped. On April 13 this year, the minor left the house on the pretext of going to meet her friend. She and the accused then went to Bihar and allegedly engaged in physical relation more than once. The parents of the girl had lodged a case of kidnapping. Later, the girl was traced and the accused was arrested.Advocate Shabnam Shaikh, for the accused, argued that the girl was well above 15 years of age and had intelligence and maturity to understand the significance and morality associated with the acts. Photographs of them were referred to by the defence to show that they were in a relationship.Considering this, the court granted him bail and observed, “The applicant is a 21-year-old young boy with no criminal antecedents. There was love relation for two years. There is no violent act. The girl has abandoned the house on her own on false pretext.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pocso-court-grants-bail-to-man-booked-for-kidnap-101626544696968.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai under orange alert for weekend||A day after a sudden thunderstorm deposited 253mm of rain over the city in just a few hours, Mumbai woke up to a drier, sunnier morning on Saturday. In contrast to the heavy rain on Friday that left several parts of the western and some parts of the northern and central suburbs waterlogged, India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) monitoring station in Santacruz recorded just 31mm rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am Saturday followed 9mm through the day.IMD had placed Mumbai under a yellow category storm warning for Saturday, indicating moderate rain in the city and suburbs with a possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places. Mumbai has again been placed under orange category on Sunday and Monday, indicating “heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places”, along with chances of extremely heavy rainfall (over 204.5mm in 24 hours) in some parts. Independent forecasters agreed that the monsoon will continue to remain active between July 17 and 22. “But I’d be surprised if there are daily heavy rainfall events of a magnitude similar to Friday morning. Models show a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal around next mid-week which is stimulating offshore trough and strengthening westerlies, but these conditions may not necessarily trigger torrential downpours daily since there are biases associated with forecasts of low-pressure systems,” explained Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD candidate at the University of Reading.With seasonal rainfall of the city standing at 1,585mm, Mumbai has recorded around 63% of the seasonal long-period average (up to September-end). In the past week alone, the city has recorded about 475mm of rainfall. Daily maximum is expected to remain at 31 degrees Celsius over the next two days, up slightly from 29.7 degrees Celsius on Saturday, while minimum temperature is expected to be around 25 degrees Celsius, same as Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-under-orange-alert-for-weekend-101626544637469.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||No safe place for children of working parents: Pocso court||A special Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) court on Thursday expressed concern about safety of children who have to stay alone at home while both parents go for work. The observation came while the court was sentencing a 40-year-old electrician for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl who was alone at home while her parents were out for work.While convicting the electrician, special judge Bharti Kale said, “In many cases such incidents are noticed when the children are required to stay alone at home as parents need to work, and there is no safe place for the children to stay in their absence.”“In the present case, the survivor was also subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the accused, who was known to her, when she was alone,” the judge observed and sentenced the electrician to 10 years of imprisonment.As per the case registered with RCF police station, in March 2018, the school teacher of the Class 4 student called her parents to school and told them about the sexual abuse faced by the minor. The girl had narrated the ordeal to her friends, which eventually reached the teacher.In her deposition before the court, the minor referred the accused as “mama” and claimed that he would visit to their house often, even in the presence of her mother. The accused would tell her that her mother has asked him to look after her in their absence. The girl claimed that in early 2018, the accused came to her house in the absence of her parents and molested her.The parents, in March 2018, registered a complaint against the accused with RCF police station. The girl was taken for medical examination where she claimed that accused had committed sexual assault on her. The accused was subsequently arrested on March 25, 2018 and has been in prison since.Public prosecutor Geeta Sharma examined four witnesses including the minor and her mother as key witnesses. The court heavily relied on the statement given by minor before the court. The court held that “the prosecution has been able to bring cogent evidence on record that the accused has committed penetrative sexual assault upon the victim”.The defence, however, had claimed that he was falsely implicated by the minor’s family as there were strained relations between him and the girl’s mother. The court did not accept the same and convicted the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-safe-place-for-children-of-working-parents-pocso-court-101626544636990.html

The green court has also directed that municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal be present in person at the next date of hearing on August 28.The development comes on the heels of a recent execution application filed before the tribunal by Vanashakti, a city-based NGO. In October last year, in response to a petition by Vanashakti, NGT had rapped the civic body over continued pollution of city’s creeks and water bodies, and had imposed an environmental compensation of ₹34 crore, which BMC is yet to pay to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).HT had reported on the matter in detail on July 4 and 5 explaining that BMC requires at least another four to five years to free city water bodies of pollution. At the time, BMC officials said they have appealed against the NGT’s order before the Supreme Court (SC), which will decide on the legitimacy of the imposed penalty which now stands at ₹36 crore.“BMC did not file any special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the NGT order. Instead they only filed a civil appeal after Vanashakti filed an execution application (contempt) in NGT. The SC subsequently issued notice to all parties but did not grant any stay of the NGT judgement. NGT has now taken serious view of continuing violations, which also includes discharge of cement slurry into creeks, which we have pointed out in our execution application,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.Environmentalists have responded favourably to NGT’s latest directions, commending the court for upholding that direct accountability in the matter rests with the municipal commissioner. “We direct the municipal commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to appear in person along with his response... on the next date. The municipal commissioner may explain why coercive measures under section 25 of the NGT Act, 2010 read with section 51 CPC (Code of Civil Procedure) may not be taken to ensure compliance of the order of this tribunal,” the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ngt-fines-bmc-2-1-crore-for-polluting-drains-instructs-civic-chief-to-be-present-for-next-hearing-101626544577810.html

Even as state school education department minister Varsha Gaikwad called for a thorough inquiry into this fiasco on Friday, officials at the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) refused to divulge any details about the inquiry or the cause behind the official website crashing and remaining unavailable to scores of students for over 10 hours on July 16.“Every year, students struggle to access results online but this year the situation went out of control. Several schools and experts have time and again pointed to the board the need for separate links to results for each of the nine divisions. This can avoid the rush of students accessing results through the same link, but the board refuses to change their ways,” said the principal of a suburban school in Mumbai.Board exams for Class 10 and 12 students this year were scrapped in view of the pandemic, and students were marked based on their performance in the current and previous years. SSC was the first of the results to be announced this year with the state recording a 99.75% pass percentage —the highest ever.State board schools had sent marks of over 1.575 million students to the state board this year, of which over 1.574 million passed the exam. While overall state results were announced by MSBSHSE early on Friday, students struggled to access individual results through the day. After receiving series of complaints from students across the state, board officials called for an impromptu meeting of officials on Friday evening; the details of the meeting however have not been made public yet.“Several of our students kept trying to check their results till nearly midnight but to no avail. The official results website was up and running smoothly on Saturday morning, which is when most of our students managed to check their individual scores,” said the principal of state board school in Byculla. He added that the school also tried to reach out to the divisional board office in Vashi on Friday but got no clarity or help.Class 10 students can now start registering for the common entrance test (CET) for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions from Monday (July 19). Details about the same are yet to be released by the state board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/server-trouble-solved-ssc-students-manage-to-access-results-on-saturday-101626544577051.html

The producers have been told to ensure that the crew members were fully vaccinated and coordinate with the police while shooting in Mumbai and surrounding areas.Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray held a virtual meeting with representatives of the Producers Guild of India (PGI) on Saturday to discuss various issues and press for the need to follow the Covid-19 guidelines. CM said that any negligence or failure in following the Covid-related norms cannot be permitted as the second wave has not yet been subsided and the threat of the third wave is looming large.“Even state government does not like to impose restrictions on the shooting, but the infection rate in Maharashtra and Kerala is still high. Event the bio-bubbles used during sports and entertainment events have failed to protect participants from the infection. While the country has not come out of the second wave of Covid-19 many countries in the world are witnessing the third wave. The producers in Mumbai and Maharashtra should do the Covid-19 test periodically. The crew members with symptoms should be treated properly. The producers must ensure that the participants are fully vaccinated,” he said.Ritesh Sidhwani, Stuti Ramchandra, Madhu Bhojwani, Rakesh Mehra, Nitin Ahuja represented PGI, while Subodh Bhave, Nagraj Manjule, Ravi Jadhav represented the Marathi film and TV industry. They demanded an extended time for shooting, which is currently permitted till 4pm. The representatives also assured the state government to follow the restrictions rigorously. “We are happy with the government’s positive response as the CM has ensured us with the solution by talking to the task force members soon. We have asked for permission to shoot after 4pm as for certain scenes the shooting during the night is a must. Few films have been stuck incomplete because of the requirement of night shooting. We have assured the government to take all precautions and follow the norms we have been following during day shifts of shooting,” said Ritesh Sidhawani, a producer and member of the PGI. CM said that the state government is taking cautious steps while unlocking the activities and appealed to the producers to cooperate with the state. CM directed the police department to monitor the schedule, venue of the shooting. “The police should monitor the timing, venue of the shooting by taking the information from the producers by assigning a dedicated officer. The officers should ensure that the producers are following all norms appropriately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/coordinate-with-police-ensure-crew-is-vaccinated-maharashtra-cm-tells-producers-101626543196885.html

Police said they suspect they are involved in the disappearance of at least a dozen more women.Police said the accused -- identified as Devender alias Bablu, Nasir and Rinku alias Rishabh from Tauru and Manjeet Kumar from Palwal -- were also involved in cases of snatching, robbery and loot for the last six years. They were produced before a court on Thursday and sent to two-day police remand for further questioning. Police expect to solve multiple cases with the arrest of the suspects.Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police (SP), Nuh, said the suspects, all in their early twenties, were business partners in a transport-cum-DJ business. “They had bought a pick-up van for their business that they used to offer lifts as well as transport bodies and dump them in canals,” he said.Bijarnia said the crime unit led by sub-inspector Satya Prakash arrested the suspects, who were allegedly on the lookout for potential targets, from Rangla village in Nuh after they received a tip-off. Detailing one of their alleged crimes, police said on April 24, 2018, the four were on their way to Bhiwadi in the pick-up van when they allegedly saw a woman, who was waiting for public transport to go home after her shift at an industrial area in Bhiwadi. Police said they allegedly abducted her on the pretext of offering her a lift and took her to Nuh. “They gang-raped her and killed her in the fields of Uthon village in Nuh and dumped her body in a water canal near Biwipur village in Gurugram, after tying stones to her hands and legs,” said Bijarnia. The body was found after several days and remained unidentified for months. In May 2019, a case was registered at Sadar police station of Nuh under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destroying evidence) of the IPC. Police said during questioning, they confessed to the crime and shared details of more heinous acts. Police said they suspect the gang is involved in over 20 cases of rape and murder. In another instance, Devender, the alleged kingpin of the gang, offered a lift to a woman who was returning from her in-laws’ place in Gadi Hodal on July 20 last year.“At first, the woman refused but as it was getting dark, she boarded the van. He held her captive and threatened her. He took her home, raped her and later murdered her. The next day he took her body in the van and dumped it in a water body near Jaurasi. He tied stones to her hands and legs to ensure the body doesn’t surface,” said Bijarnia. The decomposed body was found after months and a case was registered in August last year under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC at Tauru police station. Police said the cases had spread panic among working women in the industrial areas of Bhiwadi and Palwal.Nuh police will write to Faridabad, Palwal, Bhiwadi and Rewari police to check their records pertaining to working women from their areas. “They have shared more details but we are yet to establish the facts,” said Bijarnia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gang-involved-in-abduction-rape-murder-of-working-women-busted-101626543076917.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||4 districts in Maharashtra still show rainfall deficits, below average kharif sowing||With nearly 40% of the ongoing southwest monsoon season over - and with the July 15 deadline for sowing of kharif crops having lapsed - four districts in the state continue to show significant rainfall deficits, shows India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. These include Nandurbar, Dhule, Akola and Nashik, which are concentrated along the same belt from Khandesh to western Vidarbha. Officials, however, said it is too early to speculate on how these deficits will impact agricultural productivity.On July 14, Maharashtra’s agriculture minister Dada Bhuse had said that 74% of kharif sowing for the season have been completed across the state, with soybean seeds being sown across 38 lakh hectares and cotton across 39 lakh hectares. However, he also added that Nashik, Dhule and Nandurbar have so far shown below average sowing figures. An official with the IMD’s agricultural meteorology division, seeking anonymity, also said this was the case with Akola district, but declined to provide specific figures.“We are confident that the situation in these districts will also improve. If you look at Jalgaon and Buldhana districts, they were also showing fairly large rainfall deficits a week ago, but are now showing good rainfall and crop sowing has also picked up. There are contingency crop plans for each of these districts which will be put into action as soon as the rainfall situation improves,” the official said.Hindustan Times had reported, on July 12, that Nandurbar and Akola were showing the highest seasonal deficit at -57% and -50% respectively. Updated rainfall data shows that there has been some improvement in Akola, where the gap now stands at -33%. The district has so far received 169.6mm of rain against the long period average of 252.1mm. Some improvement was also seen in Dhule district, where the rainfall deficit a week ago stood at -46%, improving to -22% on July 17.The situation in Nandurbar has not shown similar improvements, however, with the deficit still standing at -56% on July 17. The district has seen only 142.9mm of rain (against the normal 322.7mm). The same goes for Nashik, where the deficit reduced from -37% a week ago to just -32% on July 17. Jalgaon and Buldhana districts, however, have shown the most rainfall in the past week, currently showing nearly normal levels of rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/4-districts-in-maharashtra-still-show-rainfall-deficits-below-average-kharif-sowing-101626543018345.html

17-07-2021||Noida||Now, trains on Aqua Line to run from 6am-10pm||With the Uttar Pradesh government revising the night curfew timings, the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) has decided to run trains on its Aqua Line between 6am and 10pm from Monday onwards. The train service, at present, is available from 7am to 8pm. Currently, the night curfew in Gautam Budh Nagar is in place from 10pm to 6am, as against 8pm to 7am earlier. Ritu Maheshwari, managing director of NMRC said the metro services will be available from 6am to 10 pm. “The trains will be available in intervals of 10 minutes during rush hours and in gaps of 15 minutes during non-peak hours. The peak hours usually starts from 8am to 11am and between 5am and 8pm,” she said. Maheshwari said as the weekend curfew is still in effect in Gautam Buddha Nagar, the train services will not operate on weekends.Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha 1 in Greater Noida, said the revised timing will surely help computers. “A number of people work in Delhi and Noida and they commute by metro. This will help a scores of people and office goers, who return home late,” he said. Nisha Wadhawan, company secretary and NMRC’s public relations officer, said the Aqua Line recorded the highest ridership of 9,489 passengers on July 12 after the metro services were resumed on June 9. On July 16, the Aqua Line recorded 8,895 passengers. NMRC has been taking proactive measures to spread awareness regarding the virus and ensure that its premises and trains are clean and sanitized. The Metro body does regular announcements at every station regarding maintaining adequate social distancing and washing hands. The NMRC also urges passengers to follow the guidelines issued by the Union health ministry and cooperate with authorities to curtail the spread of Covid-19.The NMRC also runs fast trains during peak hours. There are 21 stations on the Aqua Line. The fast trains skip 10 stations which have low ridership during peak hours. Wadhawan said that the fast trains will continue as of now. In order to augment the non-farebox revenues, the NMRC on Wednesday came up with the idea of offering the vacant parking space at various stations in the Metro body’s network to food truck vendors. This initiative will help the NMRC to boost its ridership by enhancing aesthetics and public amenities in the vicinity of metro stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/now-trains-on-aqua-line-to-run-from-6am10pm-101626541456841.html

17-07-2021||Noida||Noida witnesses hot and humid conditions as rain stays away||No rainfall for three days in a row has shot up mercury levels, with the maximum temperature standing at 39.4 degrees Celsius in the city, three notches above normal, on Saturday. The high humidity, clubbed with higher temperatures, compounded the discomfort of residents though the weather department has predicted some relief from the sweltering heat on Sunday. On Saturday, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) office in Noida recorded a maximum temperature of 39.4°C, three degrees more than the 36.6°C recorded a day earlier, and a minimum of 28.8°C against Thursday’s 28.2°C. At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered to be representative of the National Capital Region, the maximum temperature recorded was 38.8°C, four degrees higher than the season’s average, and the minimum was 28.2°C, a degree higher than the season’s average.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall on Sunday, which will help bring down the mercury levels substantially. According to weather scientists, the moisture laden easterly winds and shifting monsoon trough in the Delhi-NCR area will revive rainfall. “Noida is likely to receive rainfall from July 18 to 21. The highest intensity is likely on Sunday as the monsoon trough line is shifting towards the Indo-Gangetic plains and is likely to show its effect till July 21. The mercury may thus drop substantially. Several regions, including parts of UP, east and west Rajashtan and Haryana, have already started to receiving showers. The mercury has been soaring for the past three days because there was no rainfall or clouds. The region is now receiving moisture laden easterly winds, which are favourable for rains,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. “The maximum and minimum temperature are likely to hover around 34°C on Sunday. There are high chances of heavy to moderate rainfall,” said an IMD official. So far, the city has received 1.5mm rain on Tuesday, the day monsoon finally marked its onset in Noida. IMD officials said that the monsoon arrived after running a 16-day delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-witnesses-hot-and-humid-conditions-as-rain-stays-away-101626541036773.html
17-07-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad to dispose of 600k metric tonnes of legacy waste by March 2022||Ghaziabad: The city will be able to get rid of about 600,000 metric tonnes of legacy waste at two landfill sites -- one in Indirapuram and the other in Pratap Vihar -- by the end of March next year, officials said on Saturday. The officials said that the Pratap Vihar landfill site has about 450,000 metric tonnes of waste. In January 2019, the UP solid waste monitoring committee, set up on directions of the National Green Tribunal, directed for stoppage of dumping of solid waste at the Pratap Vihar site. “Accordingly, we selected an agency that has recently started work for removal of the legacy waste dumped at the Pratap Vihar site. The work that was supposed to start in March 2021 got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is expected that the waste will be converted into manure by March 2022, and thereafter the land will be handed over to UP Avas Vikas. ,” said MS Tanwar, commissioner of Ghaziabad municipal corporation. In the Swachh Survekshan 2020, the Ghaziabad city slipped by six spots to the 19th rank. The officials of the corporation said that they lost vital points as they could not get a permanent landfill site after the Pratap Vihar site was shut. The officials said that at the Indirapuram landfill, about 150,000 metric tonnes of legacy waste will be cleared. “The work is already in progress at the Indirapuram site. It’s being done by the same agency that has been awarded work at the Pratap Vihar site. The processing of one metric tonne of waste will cost ₹308. The work at the Indirapuram site is expected to get complete by October this year,” said Tanwar.The municipal commissioner said that the corporation has proposed setting up several small garbage factories in different areas for disposal of daily solid waste.The Pratap Vihar landfill in the past faced a lot of opposition from residents of nearby Siddharth Vihar. Besides, the waste monitoring committee also said that the site, which is close to the river Hindon, would contaminate groundwater over a period of time.  Similarly, the open dumping of solid waste and frequent incidents of fire also faced opposition by residents in Indirapuram. In 2018, the Confederation of trans-Hindon RWAs moved NGT and contended non-compliance of Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016 at the dumping site. Following the directions of the tribunal, the authorities started the bioremediation process at the site in October 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-dispose-of-600k-metric-tonnes-of-legacy-waste-by-march-2022-101626540976827.html

The health department started keeping a record of black fungus cases from May. Currently, there are 10 active cases of the disease in the district while total 117 cases of black fungus have been recorded by the district health department so far. While four deaths were reported in May, seven fatalities from the infection were reported in June. No deaths have been reported in July so far, said officials.  Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer of Gautam Budh Nagar said, “The district health department has not recorded a single new case of mucormycosis in July so far, which is an indication that the disease is not affecting new patients any more. Out of the total cases recorded so far, 96 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospitals.” According to doctors, mucormycosis is a post-Covid complication where patients who have recovered from Covid-19 suffer from a fungal infection. Most of the early symptoms of this disease include headache, facial swelling, swelling around the eye, pain in the nasal area, black particles found in nose or upper area of the mouth and sinus congestion, said officials.Dr D K Gupta, chairman of Felix Hospital in Sector 137, said black fungus is found among those whose immune systems have been compromised or are weak, especially patients who have uncontrolled diabetes, those who have been on a long course of antibiotics, long term steroids, intravenous fluids, oxygen therapy or some immunosuppressant treatment.“The minimum diagnosis time for mucormycosis is 1-2 weeks after recovery from Covid-19 and maximum is 4-6 weeks. The infection has also been detected in many patients who were under home isolation and were using oxygen cylinders at home without professional guidance,” said Gupta.Meanwhile Dr Sunil Dohare, district surveillance officer of GB Nagar, said the official data includes patients from other cities and districts who were being treated here.“GB Nagar is one of the referral centres for the whole of western Uttar Pradesh, which is why patients from nearby districts also get treated here. The official record of mucormycosis cases does not differentiate between whether the patient is from GB Nagar or outside. Rather, it only tells us about the mucormycosis patients who were admitted in private and government hospitals in the district for treatment and whether they recovered or died,” said Dr Dohare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-records-11-black-fungus-deaths-in-last-two-months-101626540916893.html

The vice-president is the ex-officio chancellor of universities in the country. “Please ensure that the territorial jurisdiction of Panjab University is not curtailed in any manner,” his letter to Kovind says, adding that the Punjab governor’s status as ex-officio chancellor of Panjab University be restored. He also called for the ouster for current vice-chancellor Raj Kumar. “You must assuage the sentiment of Punjabis worldwide, which has been wounded by the attempted brazen cultural and administrative invasion and takeover of Panjab University. Punjabis are deeply disturbed by conspiracies to submerge their culture into a nameless set of ideas, values and cultural ethos quite alien to this region and its proud people in the garb of governance reforms,” the letter adds.  Briefing the president on what he claimed was the latest blow to the university, Sukhbir said in November 2020, the University Grants Commission had sought suggestions on governance reforms in line with the New Education Policy of that year. He added that vice-president Venkaiah Naidu formed an 11-member committee in February 2020, without nominating a single member from its senate or syndicate. He said the committee recommended drastic reduction in the territorial jurisdiction of the university, disaffiliating over 200 colleges in Punjab, besides calling for the abolition of the Registered Graduates elected Constituency and its replacement with four members to be nominated by the V-C.“This constituency originally sent eight people from Punjab alone of mandated 15. This symbolises total elimination of Punjabis from the running of the university,” Sukhbir claimed, adding that the recommendations constituted a painful distrust of the people of Punjab through their elected members. “It also amounts to humiliating their voice and pushing them out of the national mainstream,” his letter claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/withdraw-report-on-governance-reforms-in-pu-sukhbir-to-prez-101626539537554.html

We will show them how we used to run the economy,” said Khurshid.Comparing the current price of petrol and diesel with those during the UPA regime, Khurshid said while Petrol prices used to be ₹65 per litre when international crude price was 125 US dollars, the petrol prices in Mumbai and Delhi and other cities have crossed ₹100 when the crude is currently at 75 US dollars.On the BJP’s allegation that the oil prices are high due to the bonds issued by the UPA government, Khurshid said they would corner the government over the issue in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament.“Let the BJP say it on record in Parliament, we will answer it. The oil bonds were brought to provide a cushion when the fuel prices go up. And if they think it is so bad, why don’t they discontinue it,” said Khurshid.While the Congress leader hit out at the Centre for the fuel prices, he was on the backfoot when asked about his government providing relief to people in the state by reducing VAT on petroleum products.“Do you want us to provide petrol diesel for free? The state government has its expenses to meet. Everything is now under the GST but the Centre does not share the revenue with the state on time,” he said.Khurshid was flanked by Jharkhand Congress chief and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, rural development minister Alamgir Alam, agriculture minister Badal Patralekh, former union minister Subodh Kant Sahay, Jharkhand Congress working president Rajesh Thakur among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/centre-only-interested-in-filling-its-coffers-says-ex-minister-salman-khurshid-101626538936707.html

With 5,693 inmates on March 31, 2020, the Pune-based prison now holds over 5,900 inmates. The prison, which is the largest jail in Maharashtra, has maintained the highest rate of overpopulation among central prisons in Maharashtra before and after the decongestion efforts made during the Covid19 pandemic. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil visited the Yerawada prison, met with Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of prisons, Maharashtra, and released the Maharashtra prisons data for 2019-2020 in form of a book. In 2019-2020, Mumbai central jail recorded the highest overpopulation with 427 per cent overpopulation, the Kalyan district prison touched 354 per cent overpopulation, followed by Thane central jail with 327 and then Yerawada central with 235 per cent overpopulation. The overpopulation is prevalent for almost all the prisons - central and district - in Maharashtra besides Nashik road central. However, the congestion is particularly severe in Yerawada, Mumbai, Thane central jails and Kalyan district jail, according to the data. This is true even though the prison department has not recalled the prisoners released in the decongestion process. The floating population and the under-trial prisoners who have been in the prisons for multiple years make up for the maximum share, both in central prisons. Therefore, among the four major types of prisons, central jails have the highest rate of overpopulation compared to its capacity. The total capacity of the nine central prisons is 14,841 but they held a total of 25,397 inmates in the year 2019-2020. In Yerawada central jail particularly, in 2019-2020, the capacity was 2,449 while the population was above 5,000. Decongestion happened and Yerawada central prison released close to 1000 prisoners and brought the population down. However, in June 2021, the population had crossed 5,000 and that is excluding the population in the temporary jail established in a student hostel. In yet another case of gross overpopulation, the Mumbai central jail with a capacity of around 800 and held over 3,000 prisoners in 2019-2020. In June 2021, the population was over 2,800. In Thane central prison, the population in 2019-2020 was 3,716 in a facility that was built to hold 1,105 inmates. In June 2021, the population was 3,501. The Kalyan district prison, with a capacity of 540, used to hold 1,864 in 2019-2020 and in June 2021, it still held 1,759 inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/yerawada-central-jail-housing-more-inmates-than-pre-covid-period-101626536596684.html

Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli inaugurated the market shed named ‘Mamoni Bazar’ at Dinnathpur Bagicha under Katigorah assembly constituency on Friday afternoon.In this market shed, only women sellers will be allowed to sell products. An all-women market is nothing new in Assam but this is the first one in the Barak Valley part of the state. Assam’s first all-women market was opened two years back in Namrup district. It was inspired by Manipur’s first all-women market named ‘Ima Keithel’. Talking about the naming of the market shed after Mamoni Raisom Goswami, deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli said that while she was in Hyderabad and came to know about her posting in Assam, she started reading about the state. “A friend suggested me to read Moth eaten Howdah of the Tusker written by Mamoni Raisom Goswami. The book helped me get introduced to the taste, sweetness and strength of Assam. When we were planning to name the market, the first name that came to my mind was Mamoni Raisom Goswami.”“Women empowerment is an idea we should discuss more because it helps the women to be independent. Women are the backbone of a family - she cooks, takes care of the children, teaches them and even tries to save money in her own little way for the future of her family. Building an all-women market was undoubtedly an enthusiastic step towards women empowerment and we are making such kinds of markets in other parts of the district as well. The development of a woman can aid the development of the entire family, which in turn will help develop our district,” she added. Chairman of Cachar Zilla Parishad, Amitabh Rai, informed that a sum of rupees 10 lakhs was spent for the construction of the market shed under the District Mineral Foundation Trust (DMFT). The scheme was taken up under a sustainable convergence project that will be carried out in the long run and regular monitoring by the concerned district heads, such as agriculture, zilla parishad, fishery, handloom, textile and NRLM etc. The progress of the markets will be monthly reviewed by the officials of the administration. He said, “We are training women under SHGs to grow valuable agricultural products. They are also making other products using local crafts which can be sold in these markets. There will be only women vendors in the market which will look unique. With this, we are trying to give a message to society that women can be leaders. We are happy that the market has been named after legendary writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami. This will encourage women and also give a message to society.”In past also Cachar district administration took steps towards women empowerment. In this year assembly election, there were 200 all-women polling centres in Cachar - the highest in Assam. It was praised widely by many including the Election Commission of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-district-opens-all-women-market-named-after-writer-mamoni-raisom-goswami-101626535818976.html

Fuel prices skyrocket, denizens glad to be in office virtually||With both petrol and diesel prices crossing ₹100 per litre, in all metro cities, residents of Delhi-NCR are thanking their stars that they still have the option to work from home (WFH), even if it’s pandemic induced. In fact, those who don’t have this choice, are now hoping that their offices, too, roll out a work from home facility since that’s the best way to ditch the skyrocketing fuel prices that are burning a hole in everyone’s pocket.“Since the fuel prices have gone up so high, driving my car has suddenly become like a luxury,” says Surbhi Dua, who works in the airlines sector and is required to commute from her home in Vaishali to Gurugram, every day. She adds, “It’s damn expensive! And I’m surprised how still there are so many vehicles on the road. Since the pandemic is still on, with fuel available at such high prices, companies should themselves allow employees to work from home; it’s safer, supereffective and much more economical. At least employees who want to, should be allowed to work from the safety of the homes. Otherwise socho, pehle you spend on the fuel, and then on Covid treatment... phew!”Since many aren’t comfortable taking the public transport, Delhi Metro and buses seem to be out of question! “I’m so happy that my office has given us the option of working from him,” says IT professional Abhay Pratap Singh, who stays in north Delhi and has his workplace in Noida. “My office is a little far and imagine how much would I have had to pay for fuel, if I was asked to report at work every day? I’ve a small kid at home, and my wife isn’t comfortable if I take the metro, toh mujhe toh car se hi jana hota. But this way, I’m saving money, and now I feel that after all this pandemic induced WFH isn’t that bad an idea as opposed to how I felt it was earlier,” says Singh, and Sakshi Khurana, a data analyst living in Model Town, says, “My child has just turned one, and I recently resumed office. Earlier, I used to take the office cab to travel to my office in Noida. But now, they have increased the price of that facility, which I need to pay out of my pocket, and also I don’t feel that comfortable to travel with 3-4 other employees. So I guess I’ll continue working till work from home is allowed, and then may be I’ll have to quit.” The increased fuel prices have also led to some denizens wondering on whether they should buy that planned car or wait and weigh out the pros and cons first. Take for instance Gurugram-based Akshay Tandon, who travels to Noida for work, who was thinking of investing in his second car. “My wife and I were thinking of buying a second car, which I thought I would take to work while she can drive our older car for household chores rather than having to wait and hire a cab or auto via cab aggregators. But now that the fuel price has gone up, the rental price of cabs or autos are also showing higher, and it’s certainly beyond our monthly budget. So now we are thinking, shall we look at buying an electric car? Petrol, diesel ka kharcha toh na ho pagega!” says TandonAuthor tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wfh-fuel-prices-skyrocket-denizens-glad-to-be-in-office-virtually-101626532711023.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||Provide details about manner of allocating vaccines to states: HC to Centre||The Bombay High Court on Saturday directed the Central government to file an affidavit detailing the manner and methods of allocating Covid-19 vaccines to states. A division bench of Chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni passed this direction while hearing a public interest litigation filed by Yogeeta Vanzara, a city resident, who raised concerns over issues faced by the public in obtaining Covid-19 vaccination appointments through the CoWin portal. Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Jamsheed Master informed the court that at present only 14 lakh people in Mumbai have been fully vaccinated, while 50 lakh have received the first dose of the vaccine. "Merely 6 per cent of the city's population is fully vaccinated," Master said, adding at this rate, it would take three to four years for each citizen to be fully vaccinated. The bench noted that it cannot direct the Union government on the issue of allocation of vaccines, as it was a pan-India policy. However, the court directed the Centre to explain the manner in which vaccine orders are placed with the manufacturers and the timeline of vaccine delivery. The Union government also has to explain the manner in which it makes the vaccine doses available to various states. The state, through an affidavit, informed the court that it collects vaccines three times a week after being intimated by the manufacturer, following which the doses are then distributed to vaccination centres across the state. However, the affidavit did not specify the quantity of vaccines the state collects. The bench directed the Maharashtra State Family Welfare Bureau – which is responsible for allocating doses across the state – to file an affidavit stating when it receives a communication from the Centre and why it cannot inform the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in advance about the exact number of doses allocated. The petitioner's advocate sought that the Serum Institute of India that manufactures Covishield vaccine and Bharat Biotech that manufactures Covaxin vaccine to be added as respondents since they are the vaccine makers in India. To this, the Chief Justice said, “Let the Union government file an affidavit, then we will consider adding them as respondents.” The court has posted the matter for further hearing on August 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/provide-details-about-manner-of-allocating-vaccines-to-states-hc-to-centre-101626530199483.html

But situations changed since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. At present, while Umacharan is earning his bread by working as a carpenter, making wooden furniture, and sometimes doors and windows for houses, his eldest son Bibek has taken up a job at a toothbrush factory in Goa. The younger son Sachin is managing a living by making idols in the village. “Father knew some carpentry work and he is doing that. My brother left for Goa around one and half months ago along with two other men in the village. I have started making idols of Gods and Goddesses for the pujas. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll. We were not being able to make both ends meet with just mask making,” said Sachin Sutradhar. Back in 2019, the traditional Chhau mask-making industry at Baghmundi in Purulia, around 300 km west of Kolkata, was well known among tourists with around 150 families involved in the mask-making in the entire village. The masks were not only used for Chhau dancers, who used to perform both in India and internationally but were also a hit among the tourists as they used to flock to the village to purchase the masks and wall hanging and decorative purposes. “Since the pandemic struck, there is hardly any business. Chhau performance has totally stopped because of the pandemic and lockdown and tourists are coming anymore. Earlier we used to get at least 20–30 vehicles full of tourists every day. Now we hardly get 2–3 once or twice a week,” said Ballab Pal, another artisan who works as a mason painting temples and sometimes as an idol and statue maker. The masks are of all kinds, from Hindu Gods to mythical beasts. Rates begin from ₹700 and can go up to a few thousand rupees depending on the craftsmanship. There are three forms of Chhau named after the district or village where they are performed - the Purulia Chhau of Bengal, the Seraikella Chhau of Jharkhand and the Mayurbhanj Chhau of Odisha. While the Seraikelaa and Purulia styles of Chhau use masks, Mayurbhanj Chhau uses none. Again, masks used in Seraikelaa Chhau have a totally different function and stylization to those of Purulia Chhau. Before the pandemic broke out, Kolkata-based documentary filmmaker Malay Dasgupta had made at least two documentaries named ‘Dancing with Nature’ and ‘Where the mask speaks the mind’ on the Chhau mask-making of Seraikela. Both have been screened at a few international festivals. “At that time I could find only three mask makers. Kanhaiyalal Maharana, was the senior-most among them and was almost 90 years of age then. He had won the President Award and Kalidas Samman. But when I contacted them recently to shoot an additional segment on the impact of Covid-19 on the folk artists, I found that Maharana had died. The other two have shifted professions. The workshops which the artisans used to hold with local children and youths have almost stopped as the latter have got engaged in other things to earn a living,” said Dasgupta. Now, only two families remain in Seraikela who are into the mask-making, even though they are depending mostly on other avenues to earn a living. “We have been making masks for three generations now. But now situations are in very bad shape. Now only two families remain. But even they are not into full-fledged mask-making anymore. I have an MCA degree and work in a private company. Dilip Acharya’s family was also into mask-making but now they mainly make idols,” said Sumit Mahapatra, 35, grandson of Prasanna Kumar Mahapatra who was a noted mask maker. The last time Sumit made a mask for a Chhau dance performance was in 2019. Every year, more than a dozen Chhau festivals are organised at Seraikela. But due to the pandemic, all these have been suspended. In January 2020, he last made a mask on an order from South Africa and Japan. It cost around ₹2500. Even though the second wave of Covid-19 is on the decline and there are apprehensions of a third surge, the artisans have not lost their hope. Apart from idol making and other works, artisans at Chorida in Purulia are still occasionally making some of the smaller masks which are usually purchased by tourists. “We hope that the situation would normalize and tourists would return. Our shops are still open. Earlier I, along with four other artisans working under me, used to make 14–15 masks per day. Now I make 2–3 masks in a week or so. Once the Covid is over, tourists would come and I can sell them. Chhau dance would also start then,” said Manoranjan Mahapatra, another traditional mask maker of Purulia, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengals-chhau-masks-makers-struggle-as-pandemic-takes-its-toll-101626531437119.html

A student said their three-year academic tenure for MD/MS courses ended in May, but the university had not even declared a date sheet for their exams. “The delay means that our chance to study further for super-specialty courses from this year could be wasted,” she added. President of the Malwa chapter of the Association of Physicians of India, Dr Vitull K Gupta, said, “Other medical colleges in the state have started the process to hold exams. In a letter to medical institutions on June 22, even the NCM had advised these to start conducting exams.” Institute principal Rajiv Mahajan said, “The pandemic has led to the delay in conduct of exams across the country.

17-07-2021||Other||15-year-old girl rescued in Assam by BSF from forced marriage||The Border Security Force’s Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) has rescued a 15-year-old girl from a forced marriage in Karimganj district of Assam, officials said.The incident took place at Nilambazar area near Indo-Bangladesh International Border on July 14. Based on secret information, the Anti Human Trafficking Unit secretly went to the village and managed to catch the parents of both the girl and the boy, along with the priest. They handed over the boy and other family members to the police. The girl has been sent to a children protection home in Karimganj.Officials of the BSF inform that after getting the information about the child marriage, a joint operation was launched by BOP Bilbari Intelligence staff and troops of 134 Bn BSF, Nilambazar at a village named Kaboi. They also informed the local police about this but asked them to come a bit later, only once they catch the culprits red-handed.“Our anti-trafficking unit received information that a 15-year-old girl is being forcibly married to a 20-year-old boy in a village near the border. In these cases, if we don’t catch them red-handed, we cannot save the girl. We made a plan to enter the village secretly and we informed the police as well. At around 4:00 pm we went to the house where the ritual was taking place and caught them. Later, we handed over the culprits to the police. In past also we received so much of information but the culprits managed to escape. Child marriage is a sensitive issue which needs to be addressed more carefully, especially in border areas,” the officials said.Officer in charge of Nilambazar police station, Kamlesh Singh, informed that both the girl and the boy are underaged for marriage. A case under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) 2006 and some other charges have been registered against their parents and the priest.He said, “BSF’s Anti Human Trafficking Unit informed the police about rescuing a girl from child marriage. They conducted the initial operation and handed over the people involved in the marriage to the police. We have found that the girl’s mother is a widow and she is financially weak. We allowed her to go home under a bond on humanitarian ground. The priest and some other people involved in the marriage have been detained. Further investigation and interrogations are going on in this case.”Child marriage and trafficking is a common issue in Barak Valley area which shares a large International Border with Bangladesh. Two years back, a 12-year-old Rohingya refugee girl was kidnapped from Bangladesh and taken to Cachar district by some unknown miscreants. She was rescued by locals and sent to a children’s protection home later. According to police sources, there are several child marriages happening in rural areas. In the past, several people were arrested but it still exists among the financially weaker class.Social activist and lawyer by profession, Tuhina Biswas said, “Child Marriage is common in some groups like tea garden labourers and the Muslim community. The financial condition of the girl’s family and also some religious beliefs play vital roles behind these cases in our area. Sometimes, the girl’s parents are being forced as well. Trafficking and child marriage are very close concepts. We have a red light area in the middle of Silchar town where sex workers of various ages live. Most of them are victims of trafficking, some of them are victims of child marriage as well. They are leading a pathetic life and there is no way out for them to go back to normal life. We need strong awareness among the society against child marriage and human trafficking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15yearold-girl-rescued-in-assam-by-bsf-from-forced-marriage-101626528437802.html

17-07-2021||Bangalore||Woman seeks rape case revival that was quashed after accused agreed to marry her||The Supreme Court has sought the response of Karnataka government and an MBBS student after taking note of a plea of a woman seeking revival of a rape case filed by her against him that was quashed following a settlement under which he had agreed to marry her.A bench comprising justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta issued notices to the state government and the accused and directed them to file their replies to the petition within a month. The petition, filed by the alleged victim, claimed that the accused tricked her into believing that he would marry her, while simultaneously practicing deceit in the form of creating circumstances, including a demand for dowry, which would force her to decline the marriage. The petition was filed by advocate Siddhartha Jha against an order passed by Karnataka High Court, which had in September last year quashed the proceedings in an FIR lodged into the matter related to the alleged rape of the MBBS student between 2017-2018, after a compromise was reached between the complainant and the accused.The petition before the top court claimed that the settlement between the parties was based on the forcible consent of the woman extracted by the accused.The petition claimed that the high court ignored an order passed by the apex court that had emphasised that in a case of rape, there can be no quashing on the basis of settlement or compromise as the said crime is against the body and dignity of a woman.The victim claimed in her petition before the top court that the accused, being her senior at Rajarajeshwari Medical College, Bengaluru, took advantage of the dominant position over her.According to the petition, the accused made sexual relations with the victim on the promise of marriage. However, later, he refused to marry her and she filed a rape case against him, it said.The case was later quashed as both the parties agreed to a settlement where the accused promised to marry the woman as soon as their course was completed.Immediately after the case was quashed, however, the accused started antagonising and ill-treating the woman and her family, it is alleged. “In fact, the accused has now demanded a dowry of ₹1 crore for marrying the petitioner. The accused has refused to bestow any sanctity to the relationship with the petitioner and has made every possible attempt to scuttle the relationship with her. “The circumstances after the quashing have made it clear that the act of marriage offered by the petitioner was a ruse to get the case quashed when, in fact, he harboured no intent to marry her or bestow any sanctity to the same,” the petition alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/woman-seeks-rape-case-revival-that-was-quashed-after-accused-agreed-to-marry-her-101626522074386.html

The deceased was identified as Ram Prasad Singh, 70, a farmer. According to the police, over half a dozen criminals broke into the house around 2 am and started looting properties at pistol point. Singh’s wife raised an alarm when she saw the accused committing the robbery. The accused tied up the woman and confined her in the bathroom. As Singh heard the screams, he rushed towards his wife and clashed with the dacoits. He caught one of them and raised an alarm. Subsequently, another miscreant fired at Singh who received a bullet injury on his chest. The victim was rushed to hospital and but was declared brought dead. “There were eight men in total, all masked and carrying weapons. Two were standing guard outside the house while six came inside. They held me at gunpoint. My husband had kept some money at home for agriculture work, he had withdrawn the money from the bank only a couple of days ago,” said the victim’s wife, adding that that the robbers took away cash and jewellery amounting to about ₹5 lakh. Locals said the dacoits ransacked the house and looted valuables and cash. They revealed that the dacoits also tried to commit a crime in the house of one Bindeshwari Prasad Singh but his daughter, Durga Kumari, woke up and raised alarm. Following the incident, irate villagers put the body on road, staged a protest and blocked the Bihta-Maner NH demanding arrest of the miscreants, job to the kin of the deceased and pressed dog squad. Due to the protest, vehicular traffic came to a standstill on the road for five hours. Meanwhile, after the incident, senior police officials including city SP (West) Ashok Mishra visited the spot and inquired about the incident. The police have recovered empty bags and a steel container from outside the locality. Mishra said an FIR has been filed and teams have been formed to nab the accused. Cops are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the locality and expect a breakthrough soon. A scientific team, along with a sniffer dog, was rushed to the crime spot for investigation. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/dacoits-loot-house-in-bihar-elderly-shot-dead-101626521597244.html

17-07-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Green marriage of farming and tech fertilised by innovative marketplace||PUNE Ecozen Solutions, a Pune-based agri-tech startup founded by three IIT Kharagpur graduates is developing a perishables-friendly marketplace, by empowering farmers through solar-power, accessible and affordable cold storage facilities and pump-motor controllers for irrigation. Enabled by clean and innovative technology, this company is also reducing carbon footprints and farm-produce wastage.Halls of residences The story goes back to 2006, says Devendra Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Ecozen Solutions. “When I joined IIT Kharagpur, my batchmate Prateek Singhal was not known to me, nor was Vivek Pandey. We met Vivek through one of our friends. He was a year junior and he had graduated in 2012. Our journey and friendship really began when we got ‘sorted’ together at the Hall of Residences (hostel) on campus. Over the course of one year, we were part of the various projects and sports teams and that is how the bonding really started,” he recalls.Energy-driven startSays Gupta: “We built a power harnessing device together. We did various internships as well at IISc Bengaluru, Siemens, and Burj Khalifa. We felt whatever we did in the project and internships was interesting. It got us thinking about what we would like to do after we finish our studies. So, during college itself, in 2009 we started working together. The focus was more ‘energy driven’ when we started. We wanted to create affordable, accessible and efficient energy harvesting solutions.”“The institute also asked us to take a similar drive. So, while in the college, Ecozen was like an initiative which was helping students gain real experience, apply engineering and actually create value using that. Every weekend, we would go to Kolkata to work in a foundry. The cost was covered by the foundry. Students would contribute during the day and go and party in Kolkata during the night,” he said.Early challengesSharing his experiences during the initial days, Gupta said, “The institution gave us recognition. After we graduated, we had good offers from reputed foreign institutes for further studies, as well as job offers from big Indian and multinational companies. During this period, we also met a bunch of farmers who were facing various challenges. They had resources like water and fertile land, but the challenge was agriculture dependent on rainfed irrigation. They were not able to take as many harvests as they could have, if they had access to better irrigation. It got us thinking and we thought of building a solar-based pump controller for irrigation.”“It was a very challenging period for us. We had many job-offers on one hand, while we all were facing personal and health problems. We all come from middle-class family backgrounds. It was a very stressful time wherein the health is not good, medical expenses were mounting, and there were job offers which were lucrative and which we could possibly take. We discussed it and said if we do not give this a shot now it is less likely that we have the guts to return. So, we all independently decided to give it a try. We wrote to all people who had given us a job offer, thanked them and told them about our decision to walk on the path of entrepreneurship.”Steep curveWorking in the agriculture sector is not easy. Says Gupta, “When we launched our pump controller product we increased our production, but the farmers’ income did not increase proportionally. It again got us thinking and we started working on the supply-chain side. Then we went on to build the Ecofrost product which enables the farmer to store his produce and also to figure out where to sell.”Ecotron is an intelligent solar-powered pump motor controller set with built-in troubleshooting and service detection abilities. It is a device that can operate in remote areas with no grid power availability and has a remote on/off operation.Ecofrost is a portable solar powered cold room based on thermal energy storage, which can maintain low temperatures without any backup power. Both the products are strongly integrated with the internet and give data about their usage and performance. Ecofrost can be deployed at farms, wholesale markets or packhousesUsing this data, Ecozen is building a perishables- friendly marketplace and algorithms to improve performance, serviceability and reliability.“We believe that technology itself doesn’t create value. We saw real-life problems being solved and thereby creating value. It was very satisfying for us and we felt that this may go on to become something big. Today we have 50,000 customers with a good national market share,” says Gupta. Ecozen has also developed a mobile and web-based platform Eco-Connect that facilitates the transaction of produce, enabling farmers to connect with organised buyers and re-sellers to sell commodities. This platform has served the interest of buyers and farmers equally. “Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic period, we saw that farmers were finding it difficult to push their commodities, because the markets were intermittently open or closed. With Eco-connect, we helped farmers take their commodities to big and organised retail players, and in turn the buyers. We helped them reach markets. We were able to add significant value to the supply chain,” explains Gupta.What the farmers say“Using Ecozen’s cold room, we have managed to maintain the freshness of our flowers thereby helping greatly in our supply chain and transits. Our clients have returned with positive feedback. The unit being solar powered saves power costs and the service by the company is appreciable,” says N Yogesh, Red Blossoms, Chikkaballapur, Karnataka.“Ecofrost cold storage facility has benefitted our FPO income immensely. We pre-cool vegetables, fruits, and flowers in cold storage which helps us to remove the field heat from the farm produce. This increases the product’s shelf-life up to 1.5 times and 30 per cent more profit,” says Manish More, Shatayushi FPO, Pune, Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-green-marriage-of-farming-and-tech-fertilised-by-innovative-marketplace-101626520398432.html
17-07-2021||Pune||Maharashtra board to issue guidelines for internal assessments for next year’s exams||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will soon introduce guidelines for internal assessments for the ongoing academic year, 2021-22. Dinkar Patil, chairman, MSBSHSE, said that this year the exam was cancelled due to a surge in Covid cases.“We will be formulating a detailed internal assessment strategy for this academic year very soon. The evaluation process was explained in detail to every teacher and principal which helped quick tabulation of the results. After this result, we are also planning to form an internal assessment committee to send directives to every school, so that if such a situation arises next year, we are ready with evaluation for students,” said Patil. As Covid cases saw an increase in Maharashtra, the state board was forced to cancel offline examination for both Class 10 (SSC) and Class 12 (HSC). This year, for the first time, Class 10 results have been declared before the Class 12 results. As per the board, the Class 12 results are likely to be announced by end of July.Patil also added that the the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) tabulation has begun. “As per the order issued by the Apex court, we will be declaring the result by July end. There was some software updating required for uploading marks with the board. That has been cleared now. The uploading of marks by schools has started. Principals have been given a deadline of July 21 to update the marks on the online portal of the board,” said Patil.He added that after the uploading of marks, the board will further tabulate the result and data before declaring the results.“The HSC scores will be as per the directives of the board. As declared earlier, principals will follow the 30:30:40 formula. This includes the subject marks of Class 10, which will be a best of three. Also, Class 11 final exam marks and 40 per cent Class 12 internal assessments,” said Patil. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-board-to-issue-guidelines-for-internal-assessments-for-next-year-s-exams-101626520396835.html
17-07-2021||Pune||SSC results see 99.95 pass percentage in Maharashtra state||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), on Friday, reported a pass percent of 99.95 across the state for Class 10 Secondary School Certificate (SSC) 2020-21 exam. This is a record pass percentage, as per the board officials. As compared to 2020, the result this year was higher by 4.65 per cent. A total of 1.574 million students from Maharashtra had registered for the Class 10 exam for 2020-21. However, due to a surge in Covid cases, the board was forced to cancel the offline examination scheduled in April and evaluate students based on an internal assessment. The evaluation criterion for tabulating results was based on marks achieved in Class 9, and internal assessment of the student in Class 10. Of the 1,575,806 fresh candidates who had registered for exams, schools sent assessment reports for 1,575,752, of which 1,574,994 students passed.A total of 82,802 repeater candidates registered for the exams, of which 82,674 results were tabulated by schools and 74,618 candidates passed, making it a 90.25 per cent pass percentage for this section.Girls and boys at same levelUnlike every year, where girl students outperform the boys, this year the two student groups had more or less the same pass percentage - 99.96 for girls, versus 99.94 for boys. Overall, 104,633 students received 90 per cent marks or higher, and 957 students got 100 per cent marks. Overall, in the state, 0.202 million students received additional marks for participation and merit in sports, dance, arts, and NCC among others.Among the nine divisions, Konkan has the highest pass percentage, as it declared 100 percent results, while the least pass percentage is from Nagpur division, 99.94 per cent. In all, 27 of the 72 subjects have 100 percent results. Of the 22,767 schools in the state, 22,384 have also reported 100 percent results.A total of 368 students qualified for ATKT (allowed to keep term) exams, as they failed to clear two or fewer subjects, and 916 students have to appear for a re-exam, since they failed in three subjects or more.Dinkar Patil, chairman of MSBSHSE, said, “There are 916 students who have failed in three or more subjects and will have to reappear for the exam. Whereas, there are 4922 students whose result is reserved with the board as most of them are repeaters and their records are not with the board. We will be tabulating their records and updating their results next week. This may increase the pass percentage further,” said Patil. Board officials also noted that nine schools in the state had zero pass percentage with not a single student clearing SSC. Of these, two are from Pune division while four are from Nagpur, two from Mumbai and one from Nashik division. “Some students may not have submitted any work at all during the entire year or failed to take internal assessments despite repeated attempts from schools. If it happened in two subjects, they are passed with ATKT, or they have to appear for re-exam. As far as the nine schools are concerned, we are in the process of analysing why their results are nil,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ssc-results-see-99-95-pass-percentage-in-maharashtra-state-101626519677033.html

The decision has been taken as a significant rise in passenger traffic has been noticed with the gradual receding of the second wave of the pandemic. "The T2 terminal will resume operations with IndiGo's 2000-2999 series flights and entire operations of GoAir, and is expecting to witness around 25,000 passenger footfall in the initial phase," the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) told PTI on Saturday.A Delhi airport official told reporters that the airport was handling the highest number of passenger footfalls of around 120,000 a day, as both domestic and international flights were in operation in February this year, the highest since the Covid-19 outbreak in March ended last year. This number went down to 30,000 during the second wave of the pandemic. The number is up again as currently, 60,000 passengers are being handled daily. T2 had resumed operations in October last year after the first wave had settled down.Operations at T2 will resume with approximately 200 air traffic movements, divided evenly between departures and arrivals. Around 27 counters run by commercial airlines GoAir and Indigo will be allowed to open to cater to passengers. The former will be operating 11 counters and the latter 17. Currently, flights are operating out of Terminal 3. “Passengers are requested to note that all flight operations at Delhi airport have been shifted to T3 starting today. All passengers are required to complete their web check-in at home for a contactless journey,” DIAL had tweeted on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-s-terminal-2-to-resume-operation-from-july-22-as-footfall-rises-101626519082177.html
17-07-2021||Dehradun||Free 300 power units promise: AAP launches ‘Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card’ in Uttarakhand||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday launched the “Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card” ahead of next year’s assembly elections in Uttarakhand days after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised free electricity up to 300 units to all households if his party is voted to power in the state.It announced 10,000 workers would visit households in all the 70 assembly constituencies in the state to distribute the card as a guarantee that if AAP comes to power, it will keep the promise.Kejriwal has also promised a 24-hour power supply, free electricity to the farmers, and waiving all the pending bills if the party comes to power in 2022. The AAP has made similar promises to voters in other poll-bound states Goa and Punjab.AAP’s Uttarakhand in-charge, Dinesh Mohaniya, who launched the card, said theirs is the only party that works to provide the best possible basic services to the public--water, electricity, and education. “...we believe if the politicians can get these for free, then why cannot the public... Hence, this card is to assure the public of Uttarakhand that if we win the 2022 assembly elections, we would definitely be working to fulfil the promises...”The party flagged off 350 vehicles carrying AAP workers from Dehradun to all the 70 constituencies to publicise the card. “Five vehicles would be assigned for each seat. Our party members in these vehicles would visit households and urge them to register themselves with the party’s platform and get the card. Apart from this, we have also launched a website kejriwalbijliguarantee.in on which anyone can register for the free power supply promise. The party has also launched a number (7669007669) through which the people can also register by giving a miss call,” said Mohaniya.He attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Opposition Congress for criticising AAP over the free power promise.“It is very unfortunate that since our leader Kejriwal made the promise to the people of Uttarakhand, which produces its own power, both these parties have been opposing it. We just want to ask them that if their leaders can get free electricity, why cannot the people,” said Mohaniya.“We know that the fight is not easy for us, but we will win it with the support of people.”AAP leader Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd), who was present at the launch, said they are fighting “political disaster” in the form of BJP and Congress in Uttarakhand. “During the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, my team and I fought the natural disaster while figuring out a new trek route for the Kedarnath shrine. But this time, I, being a leader of AAP, is not fighting natural disaster but political disaster.”He said the way BJP and Congress are attacking them over the free power supply promise has made them believe that they are doing the right thing.BJP leader Manveer Singh Chauhan said it is “the modus operandi” of AAP to make false promises which it cannot fulfil. “They are doing the same in Uttarakhand, but they would not succeed as people are aware of their despicable tactics.”Congress leader Garima Dasauni said AAP knows it has no political base in Uttarakhand. “Hence it is making such promises months before the elections to garner some votes. But the people of Uttarakhand are smart enough to not fall in their trap.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/free-300-power-units-promise-aap-launches-kejriwal-muft-bijli-guarantee-card-in-uttarakhand-101626519496465.html
17-07-2021||Delhi||JNU students’ virtual aid: Help peers get laptops for online classes||Since the pandemic, most educational institutions have switched to the online mode of teaching. And this has left many youngsters, especially those from the underprivileged backgrounds, bereft of the right to education due to the difficulty in attending virtual classes in absence of access to resources such as a stable internet connection and computer or laptop. Come to think of those pursuing higher education, whose coursework has been affected due to the lack of access to such resources, and most feel sorry about the situation. But that’s not the case with a bunch of kind hearted first year students. Pursuing Master of Arts at Centre for Historical Studies (CHS) at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), they didn’t sit back feeling helpless and instead joined hands to help the marginalised overcome their challenge. Privy to the hardships faced by their classmates, this group of JNU students have set-up an online fundraiser to procure laptops for them. “Apart from accessing online lectures, laptops are also required to cover voluminous readings. Most critically, they are required to submit the 2,000 word typed essays at intervals of roughly 10 days. This is tough for those who don’t have proper access to digital resources,” says Siddharth Jha, from CHS, adding, “Those without laptops had to either type these out on smartphones (with proper citations), or spend hours at cyber cafes at personal expense. And in the absence of exams, these tutorials were the sole means of our assessment in the previous semester!” Since the current semester is also being conducted online, these students realised the need to raise funds to be able to provide for the educational needs of their peers. “A few of us compiled a list of those who were in need of laptops and data packs. Then we spoke to some students in Delhi University, who had experience in raising funds for such initiatives, and they recommended us to reach out to our alumni for help... In CHS alone there are 15 students who need a laptop each, for college work,” says Isha P, one of the students involved in this initiative.  Informing about the progress of their initiative, Isha adds, “We have raised more than ₹3 lakh so far, including donations via platforms and by our alumni. We have handed ₹25,000 to each student, asking them to send the purchase receipt to us once they have bought the laptop, to maintain the transparency in fund distribution.” Until now, 12 students have been able to acquire laptops from the money raised by their fellow classmates. And those who have received a helping hand feel that this will go a long way in strengthening their coursework. “I can’t believe they did this for us,” exclaims Vivek Sahu, a first year student of MA (Ancient History). He adds that being from an economically weaker background, he had never attended online lectures before getting enrolled in JNU. “I had to use my mobile for the virtual classes, and reading a small article of 20 pages felt like reading a book of 300 pages, that much strain on the eyes! But thanks to my classmates, now I’ve a new laptop, and am able to attend my classes in second semester with much more ease!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-students-virtual-aid-help-peers-get-laptops-for-online-classes-101626517517935.html

The case, Amboli police said, is registered against one Mallikarjun Pujari following a complaint by Bhushan Kumar’s uncle and producer and director Krishan Kumar Dua, who alleged that Pujari had been making extortion calls threatening to get the woman complainant to file a rape case against the bollywood producer if he didn’t pay. The alleged rape survivor, who has accused the T-Series managing director of sexual assaults under the guise of offering her work in films, said Mallikarjun Pujari, the man accused of extortion was actually her supporter who had helped her muster courage to file the rape case against Bhushan Kumar.Kumar was booked for rape, cheating and criminal intimidation on Friday on the complaint of the 30-year-old woman, who alleged that the film producer called her to discuss work but instead sexually assaulted her at his bungalow in September 2017. She added that he threatened to make her video and photographs viral and raped her multiple times at different places in Mumbai.Bhushan Kumar’s uncle, however, said in his complaint that Pujari called Kumar several times between July 3 and July 10 telling him that if he didn’t pay, the model will lodge a rape complaint against him and he could even be killed by Pujari.The police have booked Pujari under sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 500 (defamation) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“We have registered the complaint and will question the named accused to find how he is related to the victim and who directed him to demand money,” said a police official from the Amboli police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhushan-kumar-rape-case-survivor-s-friend-booked-for-kumar-s-extortion-101626512896367.html

17-07-2021||Patna||Bihar’s Darbhanga airport crosses 300k passengers’ mark||Passengers’ traffic at Bihar’s Darbhanga airport crossed 300,000-mark in the first fortnight of July since flight operations started here on November 8 last year, as per Airport Authority of India figures.As per AAI data, a total of 301,513 flyers travelled to and from Darbhanga airport in 2,168 flights till July 15, 2021 since commencement of flight operations in November last.“This is a unique feat for any airport in the country launched under Centre’s UDAN scheme (Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik), a flagship project to propel regional connectivity,” said an AAI official on the condition of anonymity.Airport officials said that the daily average passengers’ footfall has now crossed 2,000-mark after the recent launch of daily flight operations on Hyderabad and Kolkata routes by IndiGo airline. Earlier, SpiceJet was servicing Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmadabad and Kolkata routes.The lowest number of flights and passengers’ footfall were recorded in January, possibly due to inclement weather and foggy conditions due to lack of instrument landing navigational support system. So far, 24,917 arrivals in March-- just before the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic struck-- and 27,023 departures recorded in June, have been the highest. In the first 15 days of the current month, the airport handled movement of 248 flights and 32,293 passengers.Darbhanga Parliamentarian Gopal Jee Thakur said on Friday that the airport was continuously reaching new heights of success since the launch of UDAN scheme.The sharp increase in passengers’ movement has also led to chaos as various agencies working at the airport have limited resources. Recently, the Indian Air Force (IAF), which owns this airport, granted a No Objection Certificate (NoC) for acquisition of 78 acres of land for the construction of a permanent terminal building along with a navigation facility. However, AAI has requested IAF to hand over 2.43 acres of land adjoining the interim civil enclave to facilitate movement of more flights for the time being. “We are yet to get a response in this regard”, said an official preferring anonymity.“Lack of parking facility as well as absence of passenger’s shade from main gate to terminal building is a key issue as far as basic amenities are concerned,” said Manitosh Kumar, a flyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-darbhanga-airport-crosses-300k-passengers-mark-101626501315832.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||Day after thunderstorm, dry and sunny morning in Mumbai||Moderate rain was expected in Mumbai and its suburbs with possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said. The city on Friday experienced a thunderstorm and recorded 253 mm of rain in just a few hours. The heavy rain on Friday morning left parts the city and suburbs waterlogged. The weather on Saturday morning was drier and sunnier. IMD’s monitoring station in Mumbai’s Santacruz recorded just 31 mm of rain in the 24 hours that ended on 8:30 am Saturday. Of this, 16 mm was recorded after Friday evening. Mumbai has been put on the orange category alert on Sunday and Monday, indicating “heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places”, along with chances of extremely heavy rainfall (over 204.5mm in 24 hours) in some parts. The monsoon in the city is expected to remain active between July 17 and 22.The city has so far received 1,576 mm rain, or about 70% of the seasonal long period average (up to September end). In the last week, the city recorded 466 mm of rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-after-thunderstorm-dry-and-sunny-morning-in-mumbai-101626500775974.html
17-07-2021||Bhopal||Rescuers arrived late, say residents of MP village where 40 fell in well||The residents of Lalpathar in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha district, where a group of people fell into a well when its boundary wall caved in under their weight while they gathered to watch the rescue of a 10-year-old boy on Thursday evening, have alleged rescuers arrived three hours late.Eleven bodies, including that of the boy, were recovered. A tractor being used to pump out water during the rescue operation also skidded into the well and four police personnel sustained injuries. Nine people came out of the well immediately with the help of other villagers while rescuers pulled out 14 others.“My son Ravi and his brother Sanjay had gone to fetch water from the well. I asked them not to go in the evening, but they did not listen to me. They were fetching water when Ravi fell into the well around 6 pm. Sanjay cried for help and two villagers jumped into the well to save Ravi,” said Omkar Ahirwar, the father of the 10-year-old.He added they called on the emergency number, but no one responded. “I called on 181, the Chief Minister’s Helpline, and the attendant assured of help. For half an hour, no one came. I asked the two villagers to come out of the well and it was impossible for them to search the body of my son in 20 feet deep water,” said Ahirwar. He added he kept calling and soon the people gathered near the well fell into it as its boundary wall caved in. “Two police personnel came to the spot and said they will return after dinner... they said only the rescue team could help. I again called 181 and asked them why hungry police personnel were sent. At around 9 pm, the rescue team and police force reached the spot.”Another resident Lalaram Chandel said he called the town police inspector at least 10 times but she did not take his calls. “Later, I informed the former Congress assembly member Nishank Jain about the incident.” Jain said he too made several phone calls, but no one responded. “Around 8.30 pm, the sub-divisional officer of police responded to my call and sent the team. If they had responded on time, many lives could have been saved.”Additional director general of police (Bhopal division) A Sai Manohar said, “...we will inquire into the matter.” Vishwas Sarang, the minister in charge of the Vidisha district, said the rescue team reached the spot just after receiving the information. “I also reached the spot at 10 pm from Bhopal to report about the rescue operation to the chief minister.”He added the chief minister has announced a high-level inquiry in the matter. “No one will be spared if anyone caused a delay in responding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/rescuers-arrived-late-say-residents-of-mp-village-where-40-fell-in-well-101626496815869.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||Experts stumped as record setting thunderstorm hits Mumbai, contrary to forecasts||The city recorded a total of 253mm of rainfall in about 4.5 hours on Friday morning, according to data from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) monitoring station in Santacruz -- representative of the city and suburbs. This marks the heaviest rainfall event of the season so far, and the second largest quantum of daily rainfall (in July) recorded over the past 10 years. The city had earlier witnessed 375.2mm of rain on July 2, 2019, as per the IMD data.Friday morning’s rain was concentrated largely over the western suburbs and parts of central Mumbai. Rainfall data for the day shows large discrepancies in spatial distribution, which experts attributed to easterly winds that pushed the cloud cover away from south Mumbai. As a result, IMD’s observatory in Colaba recorded only 13mm of rain as of 8:30am on Friday.“We’re still not entirely sure why this happened. Radar images from late on Thursday did not show any indication of thunderstorm formation. In the absence of typical large-scale features such as a deep layer of winds from the west over Mumbai, a monsoon low-pressure system over east or central India, or a vigorous offshore trough, even weather models would not have been able to predict this,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD student at University of Reading.It is, however, clear from available satellite and radar images that there was a rapid formation of cloud cover over Mumbai early on Friday, around 5am, due to intense convection over the region. As winds in the lower atmosphere quickly converged and moved to higher levels forming clouds, easterly winds in upper levels steered clouds towards the Arabian Sea, saving south Mumbai and Colaba from a torrential downpour. The storm system later blew past to the south of Gujarat.Friday’s showers are likely to be the “first event of this magnitude in this century to have been triggered in the absence of any Bay of Bengal monsoon low-pressure system in the month of July,” Deoras added.There are a total of five instances between 2000 and 2020 when Santacruz received rain in excess of 250mm, all of which were attributed to low-pressure systems that formed over the Bay of Bengal.Deoras also explained that the mountainous terrain in Mumbai’s suburbs -- specifically in Sanjay Gandhi National Park and nearby green areas -- may have driven the formation of this intense thunderstorm earlier in the day. Such thunderstorms are typically common in Mumbai during the pre-monsoon season in early June, but not so much during July, when heavy rains are driven by features such as low-pressure systems and strong offshore troughWith a total seasonal rainfall of 1545mm, the city has now surpassed the normal rainfall amount expected till end July, which is 1332.5mm. The normal rainfall between June 1 and July 16, as per IMD, is 935.8mm. In other words, Mumbai has received rainfall that is 65% in excess of the normal, up to July 16.For the month of July alone, the city has so far received 583mm of rain, which is 70% of the cumulative average rainfall for the month, i.e. 827mm. Mumbai has also received 70% of its seasonal normal up to September-end. In the past week alone, the city recorded at least 435mm of rain, which had been originally predicted by meteorologists but later dismissed due to the formation of a low-pressure zone in the Arabian Sea, which interfered with wind movements and kept rain bands away from the city.Experts, like IIT-Bombay’s Sridhar Balasubramian, said it is the recent weakening of this system (about which HT had reported on July 15) that may have facilitated a “westerly burst of moisture” over Mumbai on Friday. Balasubramanian had earlier this week predicted heavy rain in the city on July 15 and 16.It is at this point unclear how rains will play out over the next week, and in fact for the remainder of the month. The broader scenario is not conducive for a high frequency of such intense rainfall events, which are typically seen in July.Meanwhile, prevailing wind patterns -- i.e. opposing easterly and westerly winds -- which kept rains away from Mumbai city also continue, independent meteorologists have pointed out. Mumbai has been placed under a yellow category storm warning alert on Saturday, indicating only heavy rain at isolated places (between 64.5mm to 115.5mm in 24 hours).IMD, however, has placed Mumbai under an orange category storm warning alert from July 18 to 20, indicating “heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places”, along with chances of extremely heavy rainfall (over 204.5mm in 24 hours) in some parts.Jayanta Sarkar, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, said there will be widespread rainfall over the Konkan coast during the next five days, indicating more than 75% of all monitoring stations will receive some measure of rain.Asked why IMD had not been able to forecast Friday’s heavy rains, Sarkar responded, “There are two components in forecasting. Intensity and distribution. We predicted the distribution correctly, but the intensity, which was confined to the western suburbs, could not be predicted since the cloud cover formed extremely quickly in the morning.”Though forecasters were in agreement that Friday’s thunderstorm was near impossible to predict, they also criticised IMD for poor functioning of its doppler radar in Colaba. The radar had become defunct during heavy showers on Wednesday, and has been scanning images at intervals of every 45 minutes. A higher scan frequency would provide more actionable data for stakeholders during unexpected extreme weather events.Independent forecasters agreed that the monsoon will continue to remain active between July 17 and 22. “But I'd be surprised if there are daily heavy rainfall events of this magnitude. Models show a low-pressure system over the Bay around next mid-week, which is stimulating the offshore trough and strengthening the westerlies, but these conditions may not necessarily trigger torrential downpours daily since there are biases associated with forecasts of low-pressure systems,” Deoras explained.The IMD had initially placed Mumbai under a yellow category alert for Friday, but later upgraded it to an orange category alert after the thunderstorm. Despite this, the city saw only 14.1mm of rain in the eight hours ending at 5:30pm."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/experts-stumped-as-record-setting-thunderstorm-hits-mumbai-contrary-to-forecasts-101626489566996.html
17-07-2021||Kolkata||Mukul Roy as PAC chairman: Suvendu fumes, says TMC ruined Bengal's 'democratic fabric'||Taking a dig at the TMC-led government in West Bengal, leader of opposition in the state assembly Suvendu Adhikari on Friday alleged that Mamata Banerjee's regime has destroyed the "democratic fabric" in the state. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader had earlier raised issues regarding the appointment of turncoat leader Mukul Roy as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) 2021-22 in the West Bengal assembly.Days after TMC leader Mukul Roy was elected as chairman, Suvendu Adhikari said that the BJP would submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in this regard."Our campaign is going on against the appointment of the PAC Chairman. Our team will submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind, and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. The West Bengal Assembly is not following the rules of democracy. People should know this. TMC is not keeping up with the dignity of the assembly. Someone from the opposition should be the chairman of PAC but TMC doing everything on its own accord," he said.The BJP leader also informed that he has submitted a petition in the Supreme Court seeking the transfer of the Nandigram poll matters case pending in Calcutta high court to any other high court."The ruling TMC has destroyed the democratic atmosphere in West Bengal. The democratic fabric of the state is destroyed, this is why I have submitted a petition in the SC regarding the Nandigram matter," Suvendu told ANI."I have submitted a petition in the SC regarding the Nandigram matter (petition filed by CM Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta HC challenging Adhikari's election from Nandigram constituency in 2021 assembly elections) seeking the case to be moved out of Bengal," the BJP leader said.He further mentioned that the NHRC panel probing alleged post-poll violence in the state has recommended CBI investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mukul-roy-as-pac-chairman-suvendu-fumes-says-tmc-ruined-bengal-s-democratic-fabric-101626484933293.html
17-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The market innards||Chimneys painted in funky yellow and red. Long AC ducts of varying lengths, spreading out like the pipes of a plumbing system. Black water tanks perched like giant insects. The whole thing looks like the post-modern panorama of some industrial landscape. It is beautiful and ugly at the same time.This is Khan Market, Delhi’s opulent shopping district. But from this vantage point you won’t see that familiar bazaar of bookstores and boutiques, cafes and restaurants, the rich and the rich VIPs. The aerial equivalent of the market’s gutters, this is the world of Khan Market rooftops, as seen from a showroom’s second floor roof—its door lying accidentally open on this cloudy afternoon. The scene is curiously picturesque. From such height, you feel metaphorically uplifted too, far from the distractions of the shops and consumers. This zigzagging world of colourful chimneys and AC ducts stands like an artists’s representation of a secretive high-tech back area, that keeps the enterprise running smoothly. Some of the long metallic AC ducts seem to meander along a building’s entire wall, very evocative of the famous red stairs of the Pompidou Centre in Paris.To be sure, a lot many cafes in the market have second floor spaces, but from there the views are of the front lane or of the back lane, and don’t reveal the whole perspective of the market’s backstage. This view of interest is accessible only from the roofs looking over the Middle Lane, and these are usually barred to shoppers.Among these rooftops, one looks less flashy, less consumerist. It’s one of the few surviving homes here. Khan Market started in 1951 with 154 shops and 75 flats. The shops were on the ground floor, the flats on the first. Until the 1980s, all the flats served as homes. Then commerce crept up the stairs. Most families moved out after selling or renting out their homes. The drawing rooms, the bedrooms, the kitchens and the courtyards turned into cafés and showrooms. The market is left with half a dozen homes—the one visible from this rooftop belongs to the Bamhi family that runs a legacy bookstore on the market’s front lane. (The others are of the Chhabras, the Sabharwals, the Dudhanis, the Durgadas, and a Talwars, respectively.)At this moment, the absence of any humans fills up this entire panorama with a kind of brutalist architecture—all bare and structural. On coming down and returning to the dressy crowd of the lanes, the market appears more complicated, and more strange in the light of what you just saw.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-market-innards-101626478668575.html
17-07-2021||Delhi||Man behind international phone smuggling racket arrested||A 33-year-old man, who sourced stolen cell phones from the National Capital Region and smuggled them to Bangladesh, Thailand and Sudan, has been arrested from Mumbai, Delhi Police said.Police identified the man as Hasam Rahis Qureshi, 33, a resident of Mumbai, and claimed that he had smuggled over 5,000 phones over the last several months. Police said Qureshi purchased the stolen phones from his contacts in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh -- the contacts bought the cell phones from thieves in NCR region -- and smuggled it to Bangladesh, Thailand and Sudan.Narrating the sequence of events that led to Qureshi’s arrest, police on Friday said that, on July 9, they arrested four men – Jiyauddin Imam, Mohammed Aleem, Ajay and Shiv Kumar -- who received stolen phones from a person arrested for a theft at a mobile showroom in Delhi.Police said the four men were connected to burglaries at cell phone shops in the NCR region, such as the May 17 burglary of a mobile showroom in Delhi Cantonment area, where at least 51 mobile phones were reported stolen. One of the people arrested for the burglary pointed the investigators to the four accused after which they were picked up.A subsequent inspection of Aleem’s bank account showed deposits from people in Mumbai and Kolkata, including ₹30 lakh from Qureshi. Aleem allegedly bought the cell phones at about 40% of the MRP, and then sold them to Qureshi at higher prices.“During questioning, the four men disclosed that they purchased the stolen phones from snatchers, robbers and from criminal gangs of Mewat. The phones were then sold to Qureshi. We had been working to trace Qureshi,” said deputy commissioner of police (south west) Ingit Pratap Singh.DCP Singh said that a police team was camping in Mumbai to trace Qureshi for several days.“Our team arrested him from Mumbai on July 13. During interrogation, we found that Qureshi regularly has been receiving stolen mobile phones from various dealers across India over the past five years. He came in contact with Aleem, a resident of Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh, about a year ago and started receiving stolen mobile phones through courier,” he said, adding that police have also recovered courier receipts.Police said Qureshi sent the stolen phones to a yet-to-be-arrested contact who sent them to Agartala, after which they were smuggled to Bangladesh through carriers.“He used to receive money through hawala in lieu of those stolen mobile phones and further transfer the money after deducting his commission by cash deposit in the account of various stolen mobile phone dealers such as Aleem. In the last six months, he has deposited around ₹35 lakh to the account of Alia Traders, one of Aleem’s firms,” DCP Singh said.Police said Qureshi is originally from Hapur in Uttar Pradesh but was settled in Mumbai for the last 19 years.“Qureshi used to help out in a shop selling stolen laptops and car stereo in Mumbai’s Chor Bazar. After some time, he came in contact with local mobile thieves and robbers in Mumbai and started supplying the stolen mobiles to a man in Gujarat’s Surat, who also introduced him to a contact in Bangladesh. Later on, he developed more contacts in Bangladesh who also had networks in Bangkok and Sudan,” Singh added.Police said they are probing the role of many others, who are part of this international smuggling racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-behind-international-phone-smuggling-racket-arrested-101626477127709.html
17-07-2021||Delhi||Women at risk, from streets to cyberspace||On July 15, 2015, a 19-year-old woman living in central Delhi’s Anand Parbat was attacked by two men from her neighbourhood after they stalked her for nearly two years. The woman was dragged by her hair, and stabbed 32 times barely a street away from her house as revenge for filing a police complaint against the men.The incident, less than three years after the 2012 Delhi gang rape that sparked nationwide protests and forced a change in rape and assault laws, highlighted how women continue to be unsafe in the Capital. At the time, several city politicians visited Anand Parbat, and CCTV security cameras were installed.Six years later, women in the locality report little improvement in their safety. In Delhi Police’s 2020 annual report, Anand Parbat is still among the 17 most unsafe localities for women in the city.“These louts stand in large groups, and when a woman passes by, they deliberately do not leave space for her to walk. After 6pm, you can see drunk, jobless men standing around, and it is impossible for women to be outside,” a relative of the 19-year-old victim told HT this week.Though Delhi was badly hit by the pandemic over four waves in the past 15 months, cases of crimes against women -- rape, sexual harassment, kidnapping, and dowry deaths -- rose in 2021.A comparison of police data between January 1 and June 15 in 2020 and 2021 showed that crimes targeting women increased nearly 63% this year -- from 3,407 to 5,566. This translates into 34 (33.53) every day in 2021, as opposed to 21 (20.52) a day in 2020. Registered rape cases rose about 43% till June 15 this year, as compared to the corresponding period last year.The numbers further hurt Delhi’s already poor national image as a city unsafe for women.The Capital reported a crime against woman every hour in 2019, the last year for which national data is available from the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). The Capital registered 12,902 cases of crimes against women that year, more than Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad put together.The grim numbers pointed out the need for more vigilant policing but experts said social changes were required as well. They also don’t capture how the Internet has become increasingly unsafe for women in the past decade with frequent complaints of cyber bullying, harassment, morphed photos, fake identifies and blackmail.“After the barbaric gang rape of 2012, the authorities have acted and done some work to ensure that the roads are lit and that there are security cameras installed in areas that are prone to such crimes, but the actual change will only come when we as a society change the way we look at and treat women,” said Renuka Reddy, a women’s rights activist and a gender studies scholar.CRIME HOT SPOTSAn analysis of last year’s cases showed that the maximum cases of rape, sexual assault and harassment were reported from cramped, low-income neighbourhoods of Bindapur, Dwarka, Laxmi Nagar, Mayur Vihar, and Bharat Nagar.A police officer, who earlier served in outer Delhi’s Prem Nagar police station, among the 17 police stations which recorded maximum crimes against women, said, “A lack of parental supervision was also a major reason behind such crimes. Prem Nagar mostly has kacchi colonies, where daily wagers and people working in factories or private companies live. Parents go out for work, leaving their children behind. Many boys fall into bad company and commit crimes against women in their neighbourhood.”.Former Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar said certain areas of the city need “immediate police attention” because of local thugs.“The local police of those problematic (unsafe) areas should take immediate steps to identify hot spots, and increase their presence by setting up police pickets. There should be a zero-tolerance policy against drinking in public spaces. If there are certain spots or lanes within the residential colonies, where people sit in groups and drink, the police needs to act strictly. Safety and security of women should not be compromised at any cost,” the retired IPS officer said.Kumar was the police commissioner during the 2012 Delhi gang rape case.But incidents of harassment, stalking and molestation have penetrated even colonies considered safer and better equipped with surveillance.On July 12, a 15-year-old girl in Moti Bagh was hacked to death by her stalker, a day before her 16th birthday, for ignoring his advances. The family of the girl said that 21-year-old Pradeep was stalking her for nearly eight months. “The locality is a mix of government colonies, private bungalows and embassies. In our colony itself, there are CCTV cameras installed in every building. Despite all this, my sister was killed by her stalker in front of everyone,” said the girl’s 12-year-old sister.Dwarka sub-city is another locality where the number of crimes against women are higher than the rest of the city.Sudhir Pandey, president of the residents welfare association of Dwarka Sector 14, said, “The roads here are secluded. After sundown, you will only see vehicles moving on roads. Even the roads outside Metro stations are not well lit and do not have any security. This area is overall unsafe for everyone, but more so for women. Despite being a largely upper-middle-class neighbourhood, if women cannot walk freely, what development have we achieved?”UNSAFE IN CYBERSPACE TOOIn recent years, even the Internet is being used to harass women. Complaints by women of harassment online have also increased in the past few years, and more so after the pandemic. Delhi police officers said the cyber cell receives around 40 complaints of online harassment. Until five years ago, they received only about 5-10 complaints a week, said the officers.Earlier this month, the photographs of more than 80 Muslim women, including social activists, journalists and students, were uploaded on an app that used a derogatory term used for Muslims. The website even held a “virtual auction”, advertising these women as “deals of the day”. “I learnt that my photograph along with a link to my Twitter handle was also being circulated on the website. I felt absolutely powerless and had sleepless nights. After posting about the creation of this website, I have received messages containing sexually explicit language, gestures, threats of sexual attacks and even physical violence,” said a woman whose photograph was also uploaded on the website.According to NCRB’s data, a total of 56 cases of cyber crimes against women were reported in 2019. Of them, four cases were of cyber blackmailing and threatening, five cases of cyber pornography, hosting or publishing obscene sexual materials, 17 cases of cyber stalking or bullying of women, two cases of fake profile, and 28 cases of cyber crimes of other nature.“Several of the cyber crimes against women are committed by people who are known to the victims, and have animosity against them. Incidents of strangers targeting women on cyber space are very less. These strangers mostly target randomly and many women in one go,” said an officer who works on cyber crimes.In simple terms, cyberspace appears to mimic the real world --- according to Delhi Police data of 2020, nearly 98% crimes against women are perpetrated by family members, or people who know them from their localities or workplaces.DEEPER MALAISEDelhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said that the Covid-19 lockdown last year was responsible for the relatively low numbers in the first six months of 2020.He added that city police was maintaining its “free and fearless” FIR registration policy and constantly taking measures to make the city safer, especially women.“Women safety is our top priority. We have launched our street domination drive by having maximum patrolling of police staff on roads. Now, our women personnel are also conducting bike and scooter patrolling. Women officers have been deployed in beats. They interact with women on streets to understand the issues they face and accordingly take actions. Delhi Police is committed towards the safety of all citizens,” he added.But Reddy said while penalties for sexual crimes have been strengthened, there was no corresponding change in mentality among people. “Woman of all ages are seen as sexual objects, and no matter how much we try to put all the blame on the police and the governments, unless we start changing the attitudes towards girl children, help them get an education and change the way we talk about women, these crimes will keep happening. The administration and the society has to work together to make the city safer for women,” said Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/women-at-risk-from-streets-to-cyberspace-101626469888428.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Recruitment racket: Gang duped 50 govt job seekers of ₹1 crore||Members of a gang running a recruitment racket unearthed by the Punjab vigilance bureau (Amritsar range) allegedly duped as many as 50 government job seekers of more than ₹1 crore, officials said on Friday. This came to the fore during the interrogation of the four accused who were arrested in the case on Thursday. The arrested suspects are Pritpal Singh, who is posted as a multipurpose heath worker at the primary health centre (PHC), Dhotian, in Tarn Taran district; Harpal Singh, sarpanch of Kadgill village in Tarn Taran; Malkiat Singh of Varpal village in Amritsar and Sukhwant Singh of Jhite Kalan village in Amritsar. SSP (vigilance) Parampal Singh said, “The gang is likely to make more disclosures in the coming days. Sukhwant, the gang kingpin, was also booked in November 2020 along with two persons for allegedly duping 30 job aspirants of ₹75 lakh for getting them recruited in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the railways.” He added, “Dominic Sahota, who is presently lodged in the Ropar jail in connection with a robbery and kidnapping case, is also a key accused in the fresh case. He was running private firms and gave fake identity cards to people like Malkiat Singh.” A scrutiny of the mobile phones of the suspects has revealed that they had drafted advertisements for jobs on WhatsApp to lure innocent job aspirants, the SSP said.. “Kadgill village sarpanch Harpal Singh has confessed to have duped at least seven job seekers. The questioning of Pritpal Singh, Malkiat, Sukhwant and Harpal is going on and more disclosures are expected soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/recruitment-racket-gang-duped-50-govt-job-seekers-of-1-crore-101626465855364.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||SAD didn’t withdraw blasphemy case against dera chief: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal claimed on Friday that they didn’t withdraw the blasphemy case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh during the party’s tenure in Punjab. The case was registered in 2007. Sukhbir was in Jalandhar to welcome the Democratic Party of India’s (DPI) move to extend support to the Akali Dal-Bahujana Samaj Party alliance for the 2022 assembly polls. Addressing a press conference, the ex-deputy chief minister said he wanted to make it clear that no single case of the dera chief was withdrawn during their term in power. He said, “Despite multiple probes launched by the Congress government in over four years, not even single Akali worker’s name figured in the Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing cases. Some pro-Congress religious preachers and Congress leaders forced the Akali Dal government for CBI probe in the sacrilege case. We transferred the cases to the CBI on their demand.”“Now, the Congress is busy in infighting, leaving the people of Punjab to their fate. This was proved by Navjot Sidhu who has all along been working to topple chief minister Amarinder Singh and did nothing for the welfare of Punjabis. One cannot count even as single achievement of Sidhu as a minister,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-didn-t-withdraw-blasphemy-case-against-dera-chief-sukhbir-101626465854267.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||SGPC draws flak for ‘trying to dismantle’ tunnel-like structures excavated at Golden Temple||The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) along with voluntary organisation Kar Sewa has drawn a flak for allegedly not taking the tunnel-like old structures found during excavation in the Golden Temple complex seriously and trying to raze them. This despite SGPC president Jagir Kaur’s assurance in the wake of protests that the structures will be preserved, if found historical. Former SGPC member Jaswinder Singh demanded a thorough investigation into the matter. US-based Sikh activist Sameep Singh, who hails from Amritsar, said, “No one got serious until some people staged protests. Surprisingly, the gurdwara body and the Kar Sewa were ready to destroy the structures as some of them with old bricks have been found broken. Why they do not understand the significance of heritage?”He added, “These tunnels can be a great tourist attraction. I have read about a tunnel that reaches the Gobindgarh fort from one of Ramgarhia Bungas but it was closed after Operation Bluestar. Some efforts can be made to reopen them”.In a video shared on Facebook, gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidha said, “They have already destroyed precious heritage of the community. Now, they were about to damage another historic structure. Sikh activists were manhandled when they opposed it.” In a letter to the SGPC, Amritsar Vikas Manch, an NGO, said, “The structures found at the excavated site seem to be centuries-old. Though experts are better placed to say anything conclusive, these remind us of the turmoil of the period. Sikhs might have constructed the underground dwellings and tunnel-like structures when they had to protect Sri Harmandir Sahib from the invaders.” “If experts say these buildings are basement of ‘bungas’, even then they are of great historical and religious importance. Being unique, they can be instrumental in boosting the tourism industry in the city,” said Amritsar Vikas Manch patron Kulwant Singh Ankhi.Harjap Singh Aujla, an eminent engineer, said these are not tunnels, but rooms of some of the 84 bungas or serais that existed at these places for more than 250 years. “The arches are of the roofs. During those days, flat timber beam and cross purlins were not used as part of flat roofs. These are remains of the underground parts of the bungas. These are precious archaeological sites and should be protected,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-draws-flak-for-trying-to-dismantle-tunnel-like-structures-excavated-at-golden-temple-101626465319190.html

The order came weeks after a fake billing scam came to the fore in the varsity after which two of its employees were suspended and a contractual staffer was dismissed. In a circular issued on Thursday, university registrar Varinder Kaushik said, “In case any suspicious financial dealing is detected, the department heads or officials must report it immediately to senior functionaries for immediate action. The circular have been issued on the orders of vice-chancellor Prof Arvind who took a serious note of scams in the varsity so that such incidents don’t occur in the future.” “You are also directed to keep a close watch on all future finance-related transactions. If any irregularity is found in a department or branch, the head or the official concerned will be personally held liable,” he added. The varsity recently approached the police for registration of an FIR in fake billing scam. Last week, V-C Prof Arvind suspended two administrative wing employees — senior assistant Nishu Chaudhary and superintendent Raminder Kaur— and terminated the services of a contractual peon after a three-member fact-finding committee found substantial evidence of embezzlement. In May, the cash-strapped university’s internal audit department and finance wing flagged five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh. The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised were bogus. The embezzlement went unchecked for six years, it is learnt. The funds included those provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for development schemes, non-UGC grant for research projects and scholarships given by the Union ministry of education besides those received under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan.In yet another case of financial irregularity, an employee of the examination department was accused of siphoning fee amount to the tune of ₹92,760.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fake-billing-scam-punjabi-university-orders-audit-of-financial-transactions-in-last-5-years-101626465314306.html

The hoardings read “Many many thanks to the Congress high command for appointing Navjot Singh Sidhu”. The legislator’s supporters, including Congress councillors, had made all arrangements for celebrations anticipating that the MLA will be declared Punjab Congress chief soon. A high drama was witnessed at Sidhu’s residence on the outskirts of the city, where his supporters gathered and started celebrating on the beats of ‘dhol’. They even offered ‘ladoos’ to each other. A photo clicked on the house premises also surfaced in which people were seen offering sweets to Sidhu’s personal assistant (PA) Jasmeet Singh Sodhi.The celebrations, however, were stopped after some time. Sidhu’s controversial aide Sourabh Madan Mithu sent the media an invitation to cover the celebrations but later he clarified that the plan had been cancelled. Also, messages were sent to the supporters to gather at Golden Gate, entrance to the holy city on National highway (NH)-1, at 1pm on Saturday to welcome the former minister.Shalinderjit Singh Shelly, Congress councillor from ward number 46, said, “We are waiting for official announcement from the party high command, which would be made anytime. We will plan the celebrations and welcome of Mr Sidhu accordingly”.MLA’s posters found torn in LudhianaHoardings and posters of former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu put up by one of his supporters in the Dugri area of Ludhiana were found torn on Friday morning.Posters with “Punjab di hungar, Sidhu is var” written on them were installed on Thursday by Jasraj Grewal, owner of a public relations (PR) company.Earlier, posters of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh were installed in different locations of the city.Claiming that he doesn’t support any party, Grewal said the posters were torn on the directions of the rival group. “I have no political affiliation, but I support Sidhu and want to see him as the next CM of the state,” he said.Dugri station house officer Surinder Chopra said: “It seems the outdoor advertising contractor of the MC has damaged illegal posters installed in different parts of the city. A complaint has been received and we are inquiring.”(With inputs from Ludhiana)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hoardings-greeting-navjot-sidhu-as-ppcc-chief-spring-up-in-amritsar-101626465258113.html

Shirodkar is the son of MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s long-time associate and former business partner Rajan. In the past few years, relations had soured between Thackeray and Rajan that finally culminated in his exit from the MNS.Shirodkar met chief minister (CM) and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray at the latter’s official residence Varsha and joined the saffron party.“I found both Uddhavsaheb and [CM’s son and state minister] Aaditya Thackeray doing a great job and hence decided to join the Sena. Even my father is with me in the Shiv Sena. My father is no longer associated with Rajsaheb,” said Shirodkar. Shirodkar declined to comment about his exit from MNS.He had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha seat from South Central Mumbai constituency on MNS’s ticket.Shirodkar was associated with Raj Thackeray in winning the bid for Kohinoor Mills No 3 at Dadar for ₹421 crore in 2005. The deal took place through Kohinoor CTNL which was set up by Unmesh Joshi – son of former Maharashtra CM Manohar Joshi – Thackeray and Shirodkar in 2005. In 2008, both Raj and Rajan sold their stake and exited the project. It came under scanner when Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) scam came to light in 2018. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) started the probe of Kohinoor CTNL after it came to light that it received loan and equity investments adding up to ₹860 crore from IL&FS.Both Raj and Rajan were questioned by the ED over this deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mns-student-wing-chief-joins-shiv-sena-101626465073846.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||2.25 lakh people skipped due date for 2nd dose in Punjab||At a time when campaigns are going on to motivate the masses to get the first dose of the Covid vaccine, Punjab health department is finding it as hard to bring out the people to get their second jab. According to senior health officials involved in the vaccination drive, more than 1.5 lakh people were due for the second dose a week ago, which now has increased to around 2.25 lakh. “In around 2 lakh cases, we have sent more than three reminders through SMS on the registered mobile numbers but people are not taking the second dose as per schedule,” said state’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. State government’s media bulletin reveals that 66,691 people took second dose on Friday which is the highest number in any given day. While second dose of Covishield is administered after the gap of 84 days, the Covaxin’s second dose is due after 28 days. “Out of more than one-lakh people whose second Covaxin shot was due, only around 25,000 turned up in the past four days,” said the nodal officer. A senior doctor posted in Patiala said the biggest reason behind people skipping the the second dose is the (non)availability of the vaccine at the prescribed time and suitable place. “Hesitancy for the second dose is more among those jabbed with Covaxin because of its irregular supply. People took the first dose with hesitancy when it was available. Now, when their second dose is due, vaccine supply is not regular,” the doctor opined. He said in many cases, people, till few days back, had to wait for one month over and above the prescribed 28-day gap for the second jab. People are also having the misconception that the government has deliberately increased the gap of Covishield to 84 days due to non-availability of vaccine. “A lot of unconfirmed studies on social media about the increase in the gap have diverted the minds of the people,” another doctor from Jalandhar said. A senior state health functionary said the strategy of the health department to consume most of the doses provided by the Centre in a single day was wrong. “For example, the state is left with around 20,000 doses even as the state got over 1.5 lakh doses on Thursday. If a person due for the second dose is busy on a particular day, he will get the chance to get second dose when the next supply of vaccine arrives. Now, the next arrival of vaccine in Punjab is due on July 22,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/225-lakh-people-skipped-due-date-for-2nd-dose-in-punjab-101626465017872.html

Eighty-six persons (75 from P305 and 11 from tug boat) are missing in the incident on May 17 after Cyclone Tauktae hit the city. An officer from Yellow Gate police station said, “The bodies of 67 crew members of P305 and one crew member of Varaprada have been identified so far.”Of the 13 on board Varaprada, 11 had died, while two were rescued by the Indian Navy.Accommodation barge P305, with 261 people on board, had capsized in the evening near Bombay High oil field. After an SOS was sent, the Indian Navy and Coast Guard conducted a massive search and rescue operation and rescued 186 people on board P305 in eight days. They also recovered 71 bodies of the 75 missing people from P305. Of the 68 identified, one body happens to be a crew member of Varaprada. The police said 17 more bodies (seven from Valsad; one each from Daman and Arnala beach and eight from Alibag, Murud, Nagaon and Sasawne in Raigad district) have also been recovered. Inspector Suhas Hemade of Yellow Gate police station said, “Till date, all the eight bodies recovered from Raigad and three of the 71 bodies recovered by the Indian Navy are still lying unidentified at Sir JJ Hospital’s morgue. Of the eight bodies found at Daman and Valsad, seven turned out to be crew members of Varaprada and they were identified by their family members.”He said the bodies that arrived late were decomposed, making them very difficult to be identified.In a bid to identify all the bodies, the police are in the process of collecting DNA samples of the families so that they can be matched with the bodies in the morgue.The police have also contacted their counterparts in Goa, Daman and Gujarat and requested them to conduct DNA profiling of the bodies lying in their respective morgues since the past two months to bring an end to the agony of the families, said a police officer.Yellow gate police had called four families of missing crew members on Monday and Tuesday from Bihar and Punjab, respectively, and their tissue samples were collected for DNA profiling. “We have also got permission to send teams to Bhopal, Uttarakhand, Kolkata and Valsad for collecting tissue samples of family members of those whose bodies are yet to be identified,” Hemade added.The 10 family members of the crew members, whose bodies are yet to be identified, are eagerly awaiting some news on their loved ones.The family of Pankajkumar Das, who worked as a cook on P305, has no clue on what to expect. His father Khokan said there are many questions which remain unanswered.“Pankaj’s mother just returned after giving blood samples. We are asked to wait for at least 10-15 days for the reports. We just want to know what happened and need a closure,” said Khokan, a farmer from Mirzapur in West Bengal.The authorities had taken blood samples of Das’s elder brother and father too, but they did not match with any of the bodies. Hence, his mother’s blood samples were taken for further DNA sampling, Khokan said. Vibhadevi, wife of Pramod Kumar, another crew, is equally clueless. Kumar had boarded Barge 305 on October 18, 2020, and had last called the family during the cyclone, Vibhadevi said. “He spoke to my son and gave him blessings. But when I took over, the call got disconnected. We tried a lot to call him back, but couldn’t get through. We hoped that he would call once he gets free. But the call never came,” said Vibhadevi, a resident of Madhepura in Bihar.The mother of two daughters and a son, Vibhadevi is now worried about the future of her children, as Pramod Kumar was the only earning member of the family.His younger brother Lallan said they are all desperately waiting for some news about his brother. “My parents and I have given blood samples for DNA tests. My father and my tissue samples did not match and therefore, I had to take my mother for tests. We are now asked to wait for reports,” Lallan said.InvestigationYellow Gate police have registered a first information report (FIR) in the incident on May 21 against Rakesh Ballav, the master of barge P305 and some others, based on the statement of Mistafizur Rahman Hussain Shaikh, who was part of the maintenance crew of the vessel. Shaikh had accused Ballav and others of overlooking the weather alerts and for failing to take appropriate care, despite knowing that the lapse could result in the loss of lives.During the course of investigation, police found the involvement of some officials of Papaa Shipping Company and arrested three key management persons – Prasad Ganpat Rane, Nitin Dinanath Singh and Akhilesh Tiwari on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, endangering life or personal safety of others and common intention of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). They are in judicial custody. Rane is the manager of Papaa Shipping Company, while Singh and Tiwari are the director and technical superintendent, respectively.The police said Rane, Singh and Tiwari were well aware of the weather warnings issued by the authorities in the connection with Cyclone Tauktae and were appointed to get daily progress reports of the employees.Yellow Gate police on June 24 registered a second case against Rajesh Shahi, the managing director of Glory Ship Management, which owns Varaprada. He’s booked under culpable homicide not amounting to murder and common intention, based on a complaint of Francis K Simon, the chief engineer of the tugboat and one of the survivors. A police team had been to Kerala and recorded the statement of Simon, who alleged that the company did not carry out the required maintenance and repair works, and their irresponsible act resulted in a tragic incident in which 11 people of the tug boat died. Simon also alleged that the boat was not seaworthy and the owner was well aware of the boat’s defective conditions, said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/p305-tragedy-11-recovered-bodies-yet-to-be-identified-say-mumbai-police-101626465018302.html

While local train services on the fast line were suspended, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (Best) had to divert its buses at major locations in the city.As rainfall continued from Thursday late night to Friday, waterlogging was reported at Sion, Kurla and Chunabhatti railway stations, following which train services were suspended on the fast railway line corridor between Matunga and Mulund railway stations and services on the slow train were operating on restricted speed that led to delays.On the Central Railway mainline, local train services on the slow railway corridor were operating with delays over 25 minutes because of bunching of trains due to speed restrictions. Passengers were seen walking on the railway tracks towards stations.“My train stopped near Mulund for half-an-hour. I had to walk on the tracks to reach the station. After waiting at the station for 40 minutes, I finally got a train towards Parel,” said Thane resident Kriti Singh.Local train services were impacted on the Harbour railway as well. Due to waterlogging at Chunabhatti railway station, train services between Wadala and Mankhurd railway stations were suspended. By 1.00pm, trains resumed services completely. Local train services were operational on the Western Railway.Meanwhile, BEST diverted its buses on 27 routes, including LBS Road (Kurla), Gandhi Market, Wadala Bridge, SV Road (Bandra), Kurar and Dahisar subways, Hindmata Cinema, Milan Subway and RCF Colony. Sixty-seven BEST buses also broke down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/public-transport-services-in-mumbai-hit-after-heavy-rainfall-101626464893712.html
17-07-2021||Other||Early morning rainfall puts Mumbai under water||As heavy rain lashed the city on Friday since around 4am, waterlogging was reported in at least 26 spots (eight each in Island city and eastern suburbs and 10 in western suburbs). These include Dadar TT, Hindmata, Gandhi Market, Sion, Kurla subway, LBS Road, RCF Colony, Chembur and Anushakti Nagar. In the westerns suburbs, waterlogging was reported at Andheri, Milan and Dahisar subways, Khar station, Link Road (Bandra and Khar), Hub Mall on Western Express Highway and Oberoi Mall in Goregaon.On Friday early morning, over 250 citizens residing on the banks of Mithi River were taken to safe locations, as it crossed the danger mark. By afternoon, however, they were allowed to go back home, as the water level receded. Areas such as Dadar, Kurla, Wadala, Bandra, Andheri and Chembur received over 120mm of rainfall resulting in waterlogging in the areas. According to BMC officials, between 4am and 9am on Friday, most areas in the city received over 100mm of rainfall. According to the data provided by BMC, the Island city reported 55mm of rainfall during these five hours, while the western suburbs reported 143 mm of rainfall. The eastern suburbs reported over 135 mm of rainfall. BMC data further revealed that the highest rainfall (186 mm) was reported in H-East ward (Bandra East, Santacruz East, Bandra-Kurla Complex), while the second highest rainfall was recorded in Chembur at 175mm. In the western suburbs, Andheri, Goregaon and Jogeshwari also reported over 120 mm of rainfall. In the city, the lowest rainfall (28mm) was reported in Churchgate, Colaba and Cuffe Parade, followed by Peddar Road and Malabar Hill that received 36mm of rainfall.Local train services were also affected on Friday morning as tracks were waterlogged at Sion, Kurla and Chunabhatti railway stations. The three stations fall in L and F North wards, where more than 110mm of rainfall was reported between 4 am and 9 am. Hindmata and Gandhi Market, the two areas that witness waterlogging every year, also went under water despite the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) setting up huge dewatering pumps and underground silos. The water receded faster at Hindmata but at Gandhi Market, it took around three hours after the rainfall to stop to drain out the water. Due to this, traffic movement in the area was also affected. Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from the area, said, “On Friday morning, there was waterlogging despite BMC setting up pumps. They had said they would use in the pumps during heavy rainfall, but on Friday it took around three hours for in the water to be drained out of Gandhi Market. After spending so much, this should not happen.”BMC said waterlogging was reported because these are low lying areas and owing to the intensity of rainfall in the five-hour span. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “Both the projects at Hindmata and Gandhi Market are very much successful. At Hindmata, water was drained out by 9am, but at Gandhi Market it took us around three hours as the work has not been completed. The situation will get better in the coming days as we complete the work at both sites. We need to first collect the water: it has to get accumulated post and then we drain it out. The roads have to be motor-able, for which we are working hard.”BMC started operating two of the six newly installed underground dewatering pumps at Hindmata, and all four pumps at Gandhi Market on Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Road during the heavy downpour this week, bringing relief in the chronic waterlogging spots to some extent. The entire project consists of constructing underground water-holding silos to do away with logged water in a lesser amount of time compared to five or six hours.Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar visited several areas that were waterlogged, including the area around on Western Express Highway in Santacruz East. She directed BMC officials and Metro authorities to fix the drainage system that got disturbed due to Metro works. The mayor also directed public works department officials to look into the issue as the service road is under their jurisdiction.Santacruz resident Gautam Rao said, “There was heavy rainfall for around three hours, leading to waterlogging on Link Road in Santacruz and Bandra. The Gazdhar Bandh area was also flooded. This has never happened in past three years. BMC needs to figure out what is wrong with the drains and why is an area like Link Road also getting waterlogged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/early-morning-rainfall-puts-mumbai-under-water-101626464773806.html

The HC bench said, “We are not satisfied with the progress made so far. We are not saying anything more right now. We want an appropriate guideline. It is high time that you [state] should have formulated a policy. Advertisements should be published in newspapers to inform people as to how the facility will be made available. Also have helplines. We want it to be published and informed by tomorrow [Saturday] and guidelines by Monday.” The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by city-based lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state that the state would require two more weeks to finalise the guidelines for initiating door-to-door vaccination. The state informed the court that after HC’s directions in the previous hearing, it had started a survey across all the districts and cities to ascertain the number of people needing vaccination at home. But as the survey was incomplete, it required time to start the pilot drive to vaccinate the severely ill, bed-ridden and elderly patients who cannot go to vaccination centres to get jabs, the state said. Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed HC that it had initiated a survey of bed-ridden patients across all the 24 wards in the city and till Wednesday had found 2,780 such persons. The civic authority informed the bench that while the survey was completed in seven wards, the numbers of other wards would be available soon. The PIL had sought home vaccination for those who could not go to centres and had also cited instances of such drives in other states. While the centre was not willing to permit home vaccination based on various grounds and the recommendations of the NEGVAC – the expert committee set up by it – the court had asked the state to overcome its hesitance and start the drive to save lives. In the last hearing, the state had informed the bench that based on recommendations of the state Covid-19 task force it had decided to start the home vaccination initiative in Pune on pilot basis and would prepare the guidelines for it within two weeks. On Friday, Kumbhakoni informed that the state had initiated a survey across all districts to identify the beneficiaries and provide their details to their respective ward or corporation offices. He added that the initiative was publicised through advertisements in the print and electronic media as well as on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc and the process was ongoing. He added that they had received emails from interested persons on the dedicated email id. When asked about the number of beneficiaries in Pune, Kumbhakoni said there were 50 in the main city, while Pune-Chinchwad had around 2,000 such beneficiaries. BMC through senior counsel Anil Sakhare informed the bench that the door-to-door survey in 17 wards would be completed soon. Data provided by BMC showed that R-Central ward had the highest number of bed-ridden and elderly persons who required home vaccination at 297, followed by N-ward (290) and S ward (268). No citizen in H-West, F-North and E wards needed vaccines at home. Kapadia submitted that the survey could be more effective if there was a helpline number for people to call in and inform the authorities concerned of their requirement for home vaccination and the authorities could also use radios to publicise the initiative and reach out to all the beneficiaries. The PIL is posted for further hearing to July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-unhappy-with-maharashtra-govt-s-steps-for-door-to-door-vax-drive-asks-for-guidelines-by-monday-101626464173680.html

BMC said the victims were administered saline water, and 1,636 of them who had approached the civic body for check-ups, have shown no health issues. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Police informed the court that the probe on the fake vaccination complaint in Kandivli has reached the final stage and the charge sheet would be filed within a fortnight. The court then asked the police to endeavour for an expeditious progress in probes on other cases filed and sought the investigation report in sealed cover. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by city-based lawyer Siddharth Chandrashekhar, was informed by advocate Anita Shekhar-Castellino, that apart from the prayers sought in the petition for priority slots for the elderly and redressal of problems faced by people while booking slots on CoWin, the issue of fake vaccination also needed to be addressed. In a previous hearing, HC was informed by BMC and police that the number of victims of the fake vaccines had been identified. The court had then sought a progress report from BMC and police. On Friday, chief public prosecutor Aruna S Pai, representing Mumbai Police, informed the bench that 10 FIRs have been lodged in fake vaccination cases and 14 persons have been arrested, and an SIT (special investigation team) has been formed to probe the issue. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for BMC submitted that the civic body had issued fresh guidelines to housing societies, educational institutions and commercial establishments for conducting vaccination drives in their premises. He said BMC had requested the Centre to deregister the victims from CoWin for their revaccination. After hearing the submissions, the bench asked additional solicitor general Anil Singh to ensure that the deregistration was done expeditiously and also asked the BMC to keep a vigil on such issues and ensure that the victims are vaccinated without any delay. The court then posted further hearing of the PIL after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/revaccinate-fake-jab-scam-victims-at-the-earliest-hc-to-mumbai-civic-body-101626464113680.html

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Three govt schools to be upgraded to Class 12||The UT education department is upgrading three Model High Schools (up to Class 10) to Model Senior Secondary (up to Class 12) from this academic session itself. Schools in Sector 45C, Raipur Kalan and Maloya will be upgraded, taking the total number of Government Model Senior Secondary Schools (GMSSS) to 43. Director school education (DSE), UT, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, “Schools have been prepared to include Classes 11 and 12 from this session.” Senior officials of the UT education department confirmed that by upgrading these schools, 600-700 seats will be added in Class 11. The department also plans to increase the number of seats in humanities stream; another 500-odd more seats will be added due to the upgrade. Figures show that demand for Class 11 seats has exceeded availability in the UT. Last year, before the first counselling, 12,815 seats had been announced for Class 11, but 14,723 students had applied. Students of private schools also tend to opt for government schools for Classes 11 and 12 to help prepare for board exam and other entrance tests.With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) not declaring Class-10 results yet, Class-11 admission in government schools cannot begin. Brar, however, said, “Necessary arrangements are in the process of being completed. Once, results are announced we will prepare a merit list and start the admission process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhthree-govt-schools-to-be-upgraded-to-class-12-101626463935836.html

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University: Senate elections from August 3||Pending for a year, elections to the Panjab University’s senate — its apex governing body — will be held in August.According to the revised schedule submitted in the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Friday, polling will start on August 3 with the constituencies of principals and staff of technical and professional colleges. Voting for the constituency of faculties will be held last, on August 23. In the previous election schedules, the faculties was the first constituency to go to the polls.The senate comprises 91 members, 47 of whom are elected from eight constituencies. While 36 members are nominated by the university chancellor, two are nominated from the Punjab assembly and six are ex-officio members. The four-year term of the previous senate had ended on October 31, 2020.The elections were first scheduled in August last year, but were postponed by vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar due to the pandemic. After the HC in April this year pulled up the V-C for the delay, the polls were scheduled from April 26, but had to be postponed again in view of the Covid-19 second wave.On July 8, the HC had directed the varsity to place on record the senate election schedule by July 16. The revised polling dates were proposed by the varsity and have been approved by Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, who is its chancellor.According to the election schedule, polling for the registered graduate constituency, which is the largest with 3,61,869 eligible voters, will be held on August 18. The polling for the constituencies of heads and associate/assistant professors of affiliated arts colleges will also be held the same day. Voting for the constituencies of professors and associate/assistant professors of the university teaching departments will take place on August 10.Earlier this week, some candidates had alleged that the varsity was trying to tinker with the sequence of the poll schedule of various constituencies.

17-07-2021||Mumbai||Parties promote new Maharashtra OBC leadership||The gradual marginalisation of the Munde sisters — Pankaja and Pritam — in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the resultant churn in the party indicate that mainstream political parties in the state, the BJP included, are nurturing a fresh crop of other backward classes (OBC) leaders who can challenge the first-rung OBC faces in their ranks. There is a perception that these established leaders are being cut to size by challengers from their communities, although the reasons could be different in each party. In 2019, Pankaja suffered a shock defeat from Parli in Beed, the pocket-borough of her father—BJP stalwart and OBC leader Gopinath Munde. Pankaja lost to estranged cousin Dhananjay, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and social justice minister in the Uddhav Thackeray government. It was believed that she would be accommodated in the legislative council with OBC leaders like former ministers Eknath Khadse, who has joined the NCP, and Chandrashekhar Bavankule, who belongs to the Teli community, which has strong pockets in Vidarbha. However, the BJP nominated newer OBC leaders like Ramesh Karad, Gopichand Padalkar and Pravin Datke. Like Pankaja, Karad, too, is a Vanjari. Another Vanjari leader Bhagwat Karad was appointed as a union minister of state over Pankaja’s sister Pritam, a Lok Sabha MP from Beed. The Vanjaris have significant numbers in Marathwada and parts of North Maharashtra and Vidarbha. They are counted among the most powerful OBC groups. The NCP is similarly seen as having gradually sidelined its seasoned OBC face Chhagan Bhujbal in favour of two young Vanjari leaders — Jitendra Awhad and Dhananjay Munde. The duo came to the forefront at a time when Bhujbal was entangled in corruption allegations and was lodged in prison for over two years. Ironically, this churn is taking place at a time when the OBCs, who form around 53% of the population (according to community outfits) are at odds with the dominant Marathas over the latter’s demands for quotas. The state government’s ring-fenced reservations for Marathas have been struck down by the Supreme Court (SC). This has led to them reiterating their demand to be classified as OBCs. However, this is opposed by the other backwards, who compete with Marathas for control of local power centres, and fear that they will lose out on affirmative action benefits. The OBCs are also upset at the SC squashing their quota in local body elections. “The masses are upset at Pankaja tai being marginalised. There were similar attempts in the BJP to undercut Munde saheb,” charged Munde supporter Balasaheb Sanap of the Vanjari Samaj Arakshan Kruti Samiti, adding that the BJP would feel the heat. However, a senior BJP leader said this shake-up mirrored a trend at the national level. “There is a perception that the BJP gets votes largely due to the persona of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In this new scheme of things, other leaders are seen as irrelevant. After all, it is the engine that pulls the train and not the bogies,” he explained. In the BJP, Pankaja, a former minister, was seen as a challenger to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Her supporters allege that the 2019 defeat was an “inside job.” “All parties are wary of the resentment among OBCs over the demand by the Marathas. The otherwise diverse OBCs are closing ranks. Hence, parties are trying to nurture a fresh OBC leadership to get these votes,” said an OBC leader, who is with the Shiv Sena. “Leaders like Ramesh Karad and Bhagwat Karad may lack popular support today, but they can build their base ground-up,” he added. While their party leaderships are looking at shaking-up the entrenched order, the old guard of OBC leaders is not taking things lying down and are working to cement their base. An activist close to Bhujbal noted that while a new bunch of leaders were being propped up to counter the old guard of OBC leaders, ironically, it was the veterans who were standing up for the interests of the backwards. “Leaders like Bhujbal, Pankaja and Bavankule are more vocal on the issues concerning OBCs like them losing out on around 56,000 seats in local bodies, while those seen as their challengers within the ranks largely chose to keep mum,” he said. Incidentally, while the caste cauldron in Maharashtra is boiling, the Shiv Sena, which has significant support base among the OBCs, is largely silent. This is attributed to its caste-neutral approach with a base in Mumbai and surrounding areas, where politics is polarised around language and religion. Partymen admit that the cosmopolitan nature of its leadership makes it tough for the Sena to grasp grassroot realities in rural areas unlike the NCP. The BJP, which too has a significant base in the OBCs, is trying to create a fresh constituency by co-opting leaders like Padalkar, who belongs to the Dhangar (shepherd) community, which is a prominent OBC group. The BJP is reaching out to smaller OBCs to create a rainbow social coalition. For instance, Bhiwandi MP Kapil Patil, another inductee to the union cabinet is an Agri. The Agri community has a strong presence in Mumbai’s eastern suburbs, Thane and Raigad. On the other hand, the Congress has chosen an OBC, Nana Patole, a Kunbi from Vidarbha, as the state unit chief. Significantly, Kunbis have strong presence in Vidarbha region that BJP dominated in 2014 and 2019 assembly elections. “Consolidation of OBCs will disrupt the established order. Hence, parties shuffle their pack frequently. All political parties want OBC votes, but don’t want to devolve leadership to them,” said Hari Narke, a former backward classes commission member. However, Vishwanath Patil of the Kunbi Sena, said among the OBCs, most of the benefits had been corned by established sections like Malis (gardeners), Vanjaris and Dhangars. Writer-activist Sanjay Sonawani said some entrenched OBC groups had benefitted from affirmative action measures at the cost of numerically smaller backward groups. “There is a need to re-cast politics and the quota system to ensure that those who have benefited from the reservation system are either excluded from it or their benefits are reduced,” he said, while supporting the G. Rohini Commission, which is looking into the equitable distribution of the OBC quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parties-promote-new-maharashtra-obc-leadership-101626463813765.html

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: HC asks admn to file affidavit on sale of floor-wise houses||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Chandigarh administration to file an affidavit after it was alleged that floor-wise building plans are being sanctioned “blatantly” in the city’s northern sectors even after assuring the court in February last year that the practice is not being followed.The division bench of Punjab and Haryana high court, comprising justices Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Vivek Puri, was hearing a civil writ petition moved by the Residents’ Welfare Association, Sector 10, Chandigarh, against the conversion of single residential units into three-storeyed apartment buildings in Sectors 1-10 . The HC is expected to hear the matter on day-to-day basis after the Supreme Court recently ordered it to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously. Appearing on behalf of the petitioners during the resumed hearing on Friday, senior advocate Puneet Bali pointed out that during the hearing on February 18 last year, the UT administration had told the HC that when there is no provision for apartments in the northern sectors in the Master Plan of the city, the question of any permission being granted could not arise. Sharing a a few specific cases where the approval for floor-wise plans of bunglows has been allegedly granted, Bali said the administration is continuing with the practice. The HC has now asked UT senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain to file an affidavit on July 22 to put it on record that floor-wise sanctioning of plans is not going on in the city. The affidavit will even deal with the documents placed on record by the petitioners.‘Builders have found loophole in Master Plan’The petition states that according to the Master Plan, northern sectors of the city do not have the provision of apartments, and selling a single unit floor-wise would be disastrous. Allowing apartments to come up would burden the city’s infrastructure, as flats on different floors would be sold to different families, which will lead to increase in population density apart from increasing the volume of vehicles, leading to parking problem.“Turning a single residential unit into a three-storeyed apartment will tinker with the heritage of the city. There are heritage cities globally where nothing can be changed. In Lutyens’ Delhi, nothing can be changed,” said Bali. The petitioners contended that even if the registry of separate apartments is not being done, the “builder mafia” has already found a way to circumvent the condition. The builders are allegedly purchasing the bunglows and selling the shares of individual floors. In view of this, the HC has raised a query that if a person wants to sell a share of his property, how can they be stopped. Senior counsel Chetan Mittal, who is the amicus curiae in this matter, will be filing a detailed synopsis and suggestions for assistance of the court before the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhhc-asks-admn-to-file-affidavit-on-sale-of-floor-wise-houses-101626463515252.html

A copy of the complaint has also been forwarded to the chief secretary, Punjab director general of police (DGP), and Ludhiana commissioner of police. Valmiki was on a private visit to the city on Friday when he spotted the sewermen cleaning a manhole in Jugiana. Alarmed, he questioned the sewermen, who said MC officials had forced them to enter the manhole. “I immediately called up MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and apprised the chief secretary’s office about the incident. MC executive engineer Purshotam Singh reached the spot and denied having any information,” he said.“I have sought an FIR against the MC officials concerned as manual scavenging is banned. Several sewermen have died in the past after inhaling poisonous gases inside manholes and the civic body is still putting their lives in danger, which is not acceptable,” Valmiki said.Meanwhile, Purshotam Singh said they had not received any complaint from the area regarding choked sewer lines and the sewermen might have entered the manhole on a private request.Sabharwal said he had directed the officials to submit a report. Action will be taken as per the norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manual-scavenging-in-ludhiana-fir-sought-against-mc-officials-101626463514226.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Six years on, VB books Punjab Police inspector for corruption||After an investigation lasting for six years, the Vigilance Bureau (VB) has booked a controversial Punjab Police inspector under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.A first information report (FIR) was lodged against Harinder Singh Chameli, now abstaining from duty at Tarn Taran district, at the Ferozepur vigilance police station on July 12.The VB probe stated that the accused cop amassed assets beyond his known sources of income from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014.As per the calculations of the bureau, Chameli invested ₹1.09 crore, or 98% more than his earnings from various known sources, in the five-year window.Chameli was a sub-inspector and was posted as the SHO at Arniwala in Fazilka district when a man had submitted a complaint in 2015 to the police with details of Chameli’s properties, vehicles etc. A probe was recommended against the cop on July 30, 2015.As the investigation was delayed for six years, Chameli was promoted to the rank of inspector and stayed posted at various places.VB’s deputy superintendent of police Gurinderjit Singh, who probed the case, said the investigation was first initiated by the Fazilka district police and it was later referred to the economic offenses wing (EOW) before the bureau was finally tasked with the investigation.“We found that from 2009 to 20014, Chameli had an identified income of ₹1.11 crore, whereas he spent ₹2.2 crore on his own or in names of his family members. It was a clear case of corruption,” said the DSP.VB sleuth said a team raided the accused’s residence at Green Avenue in Faridkot and his posting place in Tarn Taran district, but Chameli has gone underground. Tarn Taran district police authorities have been alerted and the accused will soon be arrested for further investigation, said the DSP.Shady past Chameli is alleged to have political clout and he is facing several departmental inquiries. He was suspended in December 2015 for dereliction of duty in connection with the gruesome murder of Bheem Sain Tank in Abohar.In that sensational murder case, 24 persons, including the influential liquor trader and Akali leader Shiv Lal Doda, were awarded life imprisonment. Chameli, as then Bahavwala SHO, was charged for an alleged deliberate delay in registering the murder case against Tank’s attackers and ordering a rape case against him on the day of his murder.Tarn Taran SSP Dhruman H Nimbale said Chameli was posted at police lines but he is missing since July 12.“Chameli is facing three complaints of indiscipline and dereliction of duty in the district. His professional conduct remained questionable,” said the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-years-on-vb-books-punjab-police-inspector-for-corruption-101626463454445.html

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Resume dialogue with farmers: Capt to PM||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately resume dialogue with the agitating farmers and make efforts to resolve their issues citing the heightened cross-border threat and increased drone and other terrorist activities by ISI-backed groups, including plans by Khalistani outfits to target certain farmer leaders.The CM has proposed to lead an all-party delegation from Punjab for discussion with the Prime Minister to find a durable and amicable solution to the vexed problem of the prolonged farmer agitation, which is threatening the social fabric of the state and impacting the economic activities as well.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Amarinder warned that the powers across the border “may try to play upon the charged emotions of our proud, sincere, and hard-working farmers” of Punjab, which has a long and live international border.“The situation is presently under control but I fear that provocative statements and conduct of some political parties and the emotional backlash might create law and order problems and also lead to irreversible damage to the hard-earned peace in the state,” said the CM.he CM’s letter comes amid rising resentment in Punjab against farm laws, which he said he had asked to be reviewed even in his earlier DO letters of June and December 2020.It comes in the backdrop of increase in drone activity along the villages falling with 5-6 kms of Indo-Pak border in Punjab, with consignments of weapons and heroin being delivered into India by Pakistan. Intelligence reports also suggest that with the Assembly elections in Punjab just a few months away, ISI-led Khalistani and Kashmiri terror outfits are planning terrorist actions in the state in the near future.Besides the threat to the state’s socio-economic fabric due to the unrest caused by the Farm Laws, the day-to-day political activities in line with people’s democratic rights are also adversely affected due to the agitation, though the state government has tried its best to maintain law and order, said the CM.Highlighting some other issues and concerns of farmers which warranted immediate attention, Amarinder referred to his demi-official letter written to Modi on September 28, 2020 through which he sought to compensate the farmers for the additional cost of managing crop residues at the rate of Rs.100 per quintal of paddy, apart from Minimum Support Price as residue burning always remains a no-cost option for them.Noting that this is extremely important to prevent stubble burning in view of anticipated third wave of COVID-19, and its adverse impact on the health of people especially in this region of the country, the Chief Minister said these farmers also needed to be categorically reassured about their concerns regarding the provisioning of MSP and continued public procurement of wheat and paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/resume-dialogue-with-farmers-capt-to-pm-101626463214283.html

The driver of the truck, Mangal Singh of Tajpur Road, tried to escape, but was nabbed by onlookers and handed over to the police.The victim, Ajay Sharma, a resident of Phullanwal, was a construction worker.His son Sonu Sharma, who lives in Barewal, told the police that his father had been living with him for some days. On Friday, his father left the house on his cycle around 8.30am to reach a construction site where he had picked up a job. But when he reached near the octroi post on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road, a speeding truck hit him. The impact of the collision killed the victim on the spot.According to onlookers, even though the traffic movement was restricted on the road due to ongoing construction of flyovers, the truck driver was driving recklessly.Inspector Paramdeep Singh, station house officer (SHO), Sarabha Nagar police station, said the truck driver had been booked under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. He has been arrested and will be presented in court.

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana CM orders suspended medical officer’s reinstatement||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has ordered that suspended Haryana civil medical services (HCMS) officer and former Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur be reinstated pending an inquiry.However, orders for Dr Kaur’s formal reinstatement are yet to be issued by the health department, as the file containing the CM’s orders is “stuck” with health minister Anil Vij, said highly placed sources in the department.Dr Kaur’s suspension orders, signed by the superintendent health–1, additional chief secretary, health department, Haryana, were issued on the evening of July 6. “During the suspension period, her headquarters is fixed in the office of director general health services, Sector 6, Panchkula (sic),” the order stated. While an ex post facto (done after an action has been taken) approval was accorded on file by the CM, questions were raised about the tearing hurry shown by the health minister in ordering Dr Kaur’s suspension without sending the file to the competent authority — the CM. The CM, as per the Rules of Business of the state government, is the competent authority to place a Class-1 officer under suspension and also revoke such orders. Haryana speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta had confirmed the suspension was fallout of personal reasons, as the civil surgeon had apparently “not followed” some directions given by the health minister. Two days later, Dr Kaur had written a letter to the additional chief secretary, health, requesting reinstatement. According to highly placed sources, it was on this application moved by the civil surgeon that the CM issued the directions for reinstatement, pending an inquiry. The final orders will be issued by the additional chief secretary after getting the health minister’s nod. If reinstated, Dr Kaur will be back as a medical administrative officer, but not necessarily as the Panchkula civil surgeon. Despite repeated attempts, Vij did not revert for a comment. Dr Kaur had taken charge as the Panchkula’s civil surgeon in February 2020, a month before the pandemic, and led the fight against it from the front. Upon the suspension, support poured for her from both the medical fraternity and local citizens.The Citizens’ Welfare Association, an apex body of resident welfare associations in Panchkula, wrote to Khattar, Vij and Gupta, demanding that Dr Kaur be reinstated. Even Indian Medical Association’s Panchkula chapter questioned the way she was suspended without giving an opportunity to explain herself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cm-orders-suspended-medical-officer-s-reinstatement-101626463095545.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||PSPCL slips from A+ to A in all-India ranking||Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has slipped from A+ grade to A in the annual ranking report for the financial year 2020 released by the Union ministry of power recently.High cost of power purchase and non-payment of subsidy are the main reasons for the lower rating. Union minister of power RK Singh released the 9th annual report in the online meeting of Power Finance Corporation, comprising assessment of 41 electricity distribution companies (discoms), of the country. Gujarat discoms retained its top performance in the integrated ratings. In 2018-19 fiscal, the PSPCL got A+ rating due to the sale of surplus power of ₹1,183 crore to other states, earning a profit of ₹453 crore. The report then highlighted low transmission and distribution losses, timely tariff orders and audited reports as key strengths of the PSPCL.However, it raised concern over absolute subsidy dependence, high cost of power purchase and high employee costs.“Though the PSPCL has slipped in the rating, it is among the top 10 entities. The higher cost of power purchase is a concern and it’s because of fixed cost. In 2019-20 fiscal, for which the report has been issued, the PSPCL paid ₹1,510 crore as fixed charges to independent power plants without getting power. This is almost 43% of ₹3,521 crore fixed cost paid to independent power plants. When the PSPCL is paying almost 43% without getting power, the cost is set to rise,” said VK Gupta, spokesman of the All India Power Engineers Federation. He said that the PSPCL should work out a plan to avoid fixed cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-slips-from-a-to-a-in-all-india-ranking-101626463094522.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ban deals a blow to drone-driven enterprises in J&K||The ban on drones in Jammu and Kashmir, which was imposed after twin attacks on an Indian Air Force station on June 27, has dealt a severe blow to young entrepreneurs involved in drone photography and videography in the Union Territory. A number of educated youngsters in the region have made drone photography and videography their profession. Photographs and footage of a bird’s-eye view of the picturesque Kashmir valley are commissioned by film directors and advertisers. They are also used in tourism campaigns and marriage photography. Rumaan Hamdani, a 29-year-old entrepreneur, who runs a high-end studio for film production in Srinagar, says the ban had set them back at least six years. “Drone footage or a bird’s-eye view has become very popular in film making and promotions. Whenever people from the film industry came to the Valley to shoot, they would avail our services. We provided them with a drone as well as an operator.” Officials say decentralised airspace access has to be regulated in view of “recent episodes of misuse of drones posing threat to security infrastructure”.The drone ban is in force in Srinagar, Baramulla, Ganderbal and Bandipora districts in Kashmir division and Ramban, Samba, and Rajouri in Jammu division.Though the ban is already in place, the civil aviation ministry on July 16 issued Draft Drone Rules, 2021, seeking public consultation before notifying them to replace the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules issued in March. According to the draft rules, approvals for the unique authorisation number, unique prototype identification number, certificate of conformance, certificate of maintenance, import clearance, acceptance of existing drones, operator permits, authorisation of R&D organisation, student remote pilot licence, remote pilot instructor authorisation, drone port authorisation, etc have been abolished. ‘Only drones can do justice to the Valley’s beauty’For the past five years, drones have been increasingly used in aerial photography and videography by filmmakers, tourism stakeholders, professional landscape photographers and photojournalists. “Short films, documentaries, wedding events, tourism promotion, landscape photography and even line production in films, all need drones,” Hamdani said.“Only a drone can do justice to Kashmir’s beauty. The wide and vast landscapes can only be captured using these aerial cameras,” he said.This technologically advanced field had allowed youngsters to look beyond government-jobs, which are a major source of employment in the conflict-torn state.After years of applying for government job postings, Tufail Shah, a 30-year-old commerce graduate, decided to buy a camera, lenses and a drone in 2016 to produce videos and landscape photography for the ourism department.Earnings take a major hit“I made a respectable earning shooting in remote places, high-altitude lakes and meadows, which were visited by few people,” he said, adding that he and three other colleagues had been sitting idle since the ban was imposed.  “Most of my earnings would come from drones. We would earn ₹15,000 per person per day. For a short video of 3 minutes we would be paid around ₹50,000,” he said, adding that all of a sudden their source of income had dried up. He says the administration’s concerns over drone use are misplaced. “We use drones very responsibly, take permission and inform local police stations,” he said.Isam Wani, 32, a gymnasium owner and restaurateur, is a self-taught drone pilot who wants to showcase Kashmir’s beauty to the world. “People hardly see the beautiful side of Kashmir and drones help capture the unexplored parts of the Valley,” he said. ‘Govt should regulate usage, not ban it entirely’ He suggests that the government regulate drone operations by providing licenses to professionals and firms. Hamdani agrees. “We should be allowed to fly drones at places that are not sensitive. They can also make a list of professionals and allow restricted use,” he said.Drones are governed by the 1934 Aircraft Act and the 2021 Civil Aviation Rules already restrict flying UAVs in prohibited areas that are 3km from the perimeter of any civil, private, defence airports, military installations and facilities and state secretariat complex or within 2km from the perimeter of any strategic or vital installation, besides national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ban-deals-a-blow-to-drone-driven-enterprises-in-jk-101626462974306.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Money laundering case: HC grants interim bail to Goraya bizman Gaba||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday granted interim bail to Goraya-based businessman Chunni Lal Gaba in a money laundering case.The HC said Gaba will have to surrender his passport in a trial court within a week and will have to visit the local police station at least once in a fortnight. The HC order said the trail court will be at liberty to impose any other condition as it deems fit considering facts and circumstances of the case. The case has been listed in the high court on August 20. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had charge-sheeted nine members of the Gaba’s family associated with his 11 firms in connection with the 2013 Jagdish Bhola drug racket for alleged violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED’s chargesheet had listed 11 firms, jointly owned by the Gaba family, and their properties at Phillaur, Goraya and Una (Himachal Pradesh). The ED had registered the case after former Punjab Police DSP and drug lord Jagdish Singh Bhola had in January 2014 accused Gaba of trading in synthetic drug pseudoephedrine in association with Delhi-based smuggler Varinder Raja. Gaba’s counsel had sought the bail saying that his 74-year-old client has been in judicial custody for more than 14 months and there is no chance of the him absconding during the proceedings. The counsel for ED opposed the bail saying that some of the co-accused, including Gaba’s his brother Mahesh Gaba, are absconding and his son Gurjit Kumar Gaba has been sentenced to 10-year imprisonment. The high court, while granting him interim bail, took into consideration that the trial of the case has not made much headway, as some of the accused are still absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-case-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-goraya-bizman-gaba-101626462914584.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu meets Sonia ahead of state Congress revamp||Amid growing tension in the Punjab Congress, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who is trying to resolve factionalism in the state unit ahead of the assembly elections due early next year. Sidhu’s meeting with Sonia at her residence, where former party president Rahul Gandhi was also present, came as the central leadership is on the verge of finalising the revamp of the state unit. The former minister’s early morning departure for Delhi heightened the expectations of his supporters who seemed confident of an announcement of his elevation to the state chief’s post in the afternoon and even put up hoardings in Amritsar, thanking the party leadership, but they will have to wait. There has been no word from the Congress or Sidhu on what transpired at the meeting or when the announcement of the new state body would be made. “I had come to submit my report on Punjab to the Congress chief. As soon as any decision is taken by the party president, I will share the details,” All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat, who also attended the meeting, told journalists after the hour-long meeting. He refused to give any direct answer to a query about Sidhu’s likely appointment as the state Congress president. Clamour for Hindu state chief As party circles remained abuzz with speculation about the appointment of Sidhu, a Jat Sikh, as the new head of the state unit and its probable timing, a section of the party leaders pushed for a Hindu face. Senior party leader and Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari was the first to put out a tweet on Friday on the issue. He gave the demographic details of the state, mentioning that Sikhs form 57.75% of the population, while Hindus and Dalits (Sikh and Hindus) constitute 38.49% and 31.94%, respectively. “Punjab is both progressive and secular, but balancing social interest groups is the key. Equality is the foundation of social justice!” he tweeted, tagging the Congress, Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs. His party colleagues, Anish Sidana and Pawan Dewan, were more direct about the neglect of leaders from the community. Sidana, a former member of the Kandi Area Development Board, said there was a feeling that they were not needed, asking the party leadership why they are giving the post of CM and PPCC chiefs to Jat Sikhs and fielding them from urban seats. “What Manish Tewari put demography of Punjab wider picture Jat Sikh 22% 78% others including Hindus, Arora khatri Sikh, Dalit, OBC,” he tweeted. Similarly, Dewan, chairman of the Punjab Large Industrial Development Board, also asked the Congress leadership about the representation of the Hindu community on key posts in the state unit. “Punjab Congress president – Jat Sikh (if Sidhu gets the post). CM-Jat Sikh. Punjab Youth Congress president-Jat Sikh. Campaign Committee chairman- Jat Sikh (Name of a Jat Sikh is being considered) Hindu kaha hai (where is representation from Hindu community),” he tweeted. If the party chooses to name Sidhu as the new state chief as is being speculated, there will be Jat Sikhs on both top posts. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is also a Jat Sikh. On July 1, the chief minister had held a meeting with leaders from urban areas, mostly Hindus, who demanded that the post of PPCC chief should go to a Hindu and better representation be given in the state unit and the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-meets-sonia-ahead-of-state-congress-revamp-101626462737477.html
17-07-2021||Mumbai||In meet with PM Modi, CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks national policy to contain crowd||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, during the virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and five other state CMs on Friday, insisted on a comprehensive national policy by the Central government to prevent crowding for political events, protests and religious programmes amid the threat of a potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.He also sought additional stock of vaccine and pressed for adequate arrangement of oxygen upto 2000 metric tonnes in case the third wave hits Maharashtra. He also said that the Centre should take steps to reduce the prices of the monoclonal antibodies’ drugs.Thackeray said controlling crowding at public places owing to political-religious programmes has become a challenge and a national policy to regulate crowding is the need of the hour. He said people are venturing out of their homes in large numbers not only in Maharashtra, but across the country. “Revenge tourism and revenge shopping are gaining momentum, as people are venturing out in large numbers. The crowding at the public places to attend political and religious functions has been alarming. The state governments should take steps to control the crowd, but a national policy on crowd management is necessary,” Thackeray said.Thackeray’s demand is seen as his response to the Centre frequently flagging Maharashtra as one of the worst-affected states. Leaders of the ruling MVA coalition allege the BJP-ruled states are not transparent in revealing Covid case data, but they are not asked about it. The Assembly elections in five states and religious events like Kumbh Mela are being blamed for spike in Covid cases in some states.Thackeray also pressed for the supply of 2000 metric tonnes of oxygen to Maharashtra from the neighbouring states if the third wave hit the state. “As per the projection, Maharashtra could need at least 4000 MT of oxygen during the third wave. We are augmenting our production capacity to 2000MT, the supply of the remaining stock from the steel plants in Bhilai, Jamnagar, Bellary would help in meeting the requirement. Centre should ensure that the additional requirement is met from the central pool of oxygen. Maharashtra has planned for the installation of the 530 PSA oxygen plant covering each of the districts and a plan is in place for the district wise management of the oxygen,” he said.The Maharashtra government has been continuously batting for the additional supply of the vaccine doses to meet the target of vaccination of the 70% population or around 90 million people at the earliest. The state recently passed a resolution in the legislature demanding the supply of 30 million doses per month as the state has planned to vaccinate more than 1 million people a day. In this backdrop, Thackeray said that 8 to 10 worst affected districts in western Maharashtra and Konkan need 20.6 million doses to the population above 18 years. “8.79 million doses have been administered in these districts. To inoculate the entire eligible population above 18 years to reduce the infection rate, we will need an additional stock of 30 million doses,” he said.Maharashtra has administered 38,862,466 doses with 30,033,080 people given at least one dose until Friday evening.Thackeray also said that the number of cases in the state is dipping, although the virus curve has not touched its baseline. He also pressed for the need to set up centres of excellence by the central government for the management of the post Covid complications. He also requested Modi to regulate the prices of the key medicines which are utilised to treat coronavirus. Maharashtra CM has also requested the PM to take steps to reduce the prices of monoclonal antibodies drugs, which are effective in Covid-19 treatment, but their prices are the cause for concern. Thackeray said if projected the need of such drugs for 50,000 patients in the third wave, the burden could be ₹300 crore as the drugs cost around ₹60,000 a dose. The Centre should intervene to ensure that the prices are reduced and the drugs are easily available,” he said.Thackeray also apprised the PM about the steps taken by Maharashtra government for the management of the second wave. The CM said that besides setting up task force the industrial sector, the state is taking steps for awareness among the people over the use of masks and following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-modi-meet-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-national-policy-to-contain-crowd-101626462737990.html

He said that the party members tried to trace these beneficiaries, but their address and mobile number were not available on the government portal.He said that he will be accompanying the BJP delegation to bring the issue to the notice of Union Minister Piyush Goyal.Despite repeated attempts, district food and supply controller Harveen Kaur was not available for comments.

17-07-2021||Mumbai||SSC results in Maharashtra: More than 50% students hit by server crash||For more than 50% Class 10 students of the state board, chaos, panic and anxiety were prolonged for hours on Friday, as the results server crashed, leaving them clueless about their scores till late evening. The results were announced on the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education’s (MSBSHSE) website – http://result.mh-ssc.ac.in – at 1pm. The server, however, crashed within a few hours and remained out of service till late night on Friday. Board officials told HT that several lakhs of students tried accessing their results at the same time, causing the server to crash. The schools had sent marks of over 15.75 lakh secondary school certificate (SSC) students to the board this year, of which over 15.74 lakh passed the exam. After receiving series of complaints from students across the state, the board officials called for a meeting of officials on Friday evening. Details of the meeting, however, were not made public. “Several of our students had gathered at the school around 1pm and several waited around on campus till 6pm, without any results. By 10pm on Friday, over 50% of our batch still had no results,” said the principal of a state board school in the suburbs. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday evening called for an inquiry into the issue. “Every year there is a delay in accessing results, but this year it has gone too far. Students were unable to access their individual results till 6pm in some cases. The board needs to look into this issue,” said Gaikwad in a statement released to the press. Gaikwad tweeted an apology to all SSC students later in the day and assured a permanent solution so that such an incident doesn’t recur in the future. “Most had managed to check their results by evening and no other major complaints were received by the board otherwise,” said a spokesperson for the Maharashtra state board. However, post 5pm, none of the board officials were available for a comment. Fifteen-year-old Anusha Lad had come to her school in Dadar to inquire about her result through the institute and ended up leaving the school to head back home by 5:30pm without knowing her result. “It was only around 6pm when our school principal called me to inform that I have topped the school that I came to know my score—99.40%. It was an unexpected year, we were the first online school batch, and it took great efforts from the school as well for us to be able to complete the academics in time with the new teaching pattern. I want to take up Arts and aspire to get admission in a good college, but with the uncertainty regarding the upcoming common entrance test (CET) and admissions, we are just keeping our fingers crossed now,” said Lad, a student of Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar. Parents too were struggling through the day. “This has anyway been a difficult year for students who were already very anxious about results. The problem is the state board did not account for the fact that all 15 lakh anxious students will be accessing results at the same time, and therefore it led for the server to crash. Someone has to take responsibility for adding to the stress of students,” said Regina Fernandes, mother of an SSC student from Andheri. Her daughter could finally access her result at 6pm and has scored 89% in the exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sscresults-in-maharashtra-more-than-50-students-hit-by-server-crash-101626462677535.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Now, free NTSE coaching at block level as well||With online coaching classes for the National Talent Search Exam becoming popular among students at the district-level, the district education department has now decided to provide free coaching for Class-10 students at the block level as well.Over 3,000 students are currently being trained at the school level and a screening test for them will be held next week.Those who perform well at the block level will then be shifted to district level.Over 415 Class-10 students are attending online coaching classes everyday at district-level to crack the exam.

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Locals nab snatchers, police squabble over jurisdiction||A chase by an alert resident ended three snatchers’ spree, but what followed was police quarrelling over the jurisdiction to lodge an FIR and arrest them as confused residents watched.On Thursday, the accused had tried to snatch a woman’s purse near Vishwakarma Chowk, which falls under the ambit of Miller Ganj police station. A scooterist chased them as they drove into Sukhram Nagar in their attempt to flee. Onlookers spotted his pursuit and helped the man nab the trio.The Police Control Room was informed and cops arrived after 45 minutes, only to start a debate on who takes the snatchers’ custody as they were nabbed in Sukhram Nagar, which falls under the Division Number 2 police station, said Vishal Joshi, a resident.It was only after senior police officials were informed that the Miller Ganj police apprehended the accused and lodged an FIR.Residents said if police sought people’s cooperation to deter crime, they should be quick in their response, as criminals could even hurt them with concealed weapons.ASI Balbir Singh, in-charge at Miller Ganj police post, said they had arrested the accused. “The motorcycle recovered from the accused is also suspected to be stolen.

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||BJP, Cong tug at Himachal’s apple heartland ahead of bypoll||Up until the mid-80s Himachal Pradesh’s apple heartland, Jubbal-Kotkhai, was the epicentre of the hill state’s politics with two former heavyweight chief ministers – Thakur Ram Lal and Virbhadra Singh – representing the high-profile constituency. With bypolls round the corner, the constituency is buzzing with political activity as the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party try to capture the seat, which fell vacant when Narinder Bragta, the incumbent horticulture minister, passed away due to post-Covid complications. The political tussle has brought orchardists’ issues to the centre stage. Even though Himachal’s farming community laid low when the farmers’ protests rocked the country, they have increasingly been plagued with challenges, particularly inflation caused due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hot button issues: Cost of packaging, state of roads  Orchardists say, of late, the price of packaging material has increased by 25%. Now, growers have to shell out ₹67 for the premium carton, which used to cost ₹53. They say the price of cartons is yet to come down despite horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur’s assurances. “The rate of trays used inside the cartons has also increased by around ₹50- ₹70. This massive hike is burdening orchardists,” says Progressive Growers’ Association president Lokinder Singh Bisht. Growers rue that there has been more politics on the state of the road than work to improve connectivity. The poor state of roads has been the hot button issue in almost all elections but little has been done to improve the state of the Theog-Hatkoti Road, which leads to Rohru and also passes through Jubbal-Kotkhai, thereby connecting the apple belt. The government had signed a memorandum of understanding with the World Bank in 2007 to improve the road. The foundation stone had been laid by the then chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal in 2008. However, only 18% of the road was completed during Dhumal’s regime, around 74% of the work was completed during the regime of the Virbhadra Singh-led government, and the remaining 8% work remains pending during chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s regime. Upgrading Tikkar in Jubbal-Kotkhai to a tehsil ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 failed to bear fruit as the staff is yet to be appointed. The Public Work Division in Kotkhai is in the same boat. Fruit, Vegetables and Flower Growers’ Association of Himachal Pradesh president Harish Chauhan says, “The state government should ensure good road connectivity during the apple season. Many roads, especially link roads, are in poor shape.”Weather gives the cold shoulder Untimely snowfall in April this year had cost the orchardists dear as around 60% of the crop had been damaged due to snow, hailstorms and rainfall. The state government had promised relief to orchardists in the aftermath, but none seems forthcoming . Orchardists have also demanded that the government increase apples’ rates under the market intervention scheme. The kingmaker constituency The Congress, BJP and the CPI(M) are keen on winning the constituency, which has the reputation of being a kingmaker. Veteran politician Thakur Ram Lal had became the second chief minister of Himachal Pradesh in 1977 and then 1980, while six-time chief minister Virbhadra Singh, who had breathed his last on July 8, had contested three elections from his home turf, but lost in 1990. He was elected to the Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha from the Jubbal Kotkhai constituency in 1957. Later, he was re-elected to the Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha from the same constituency in 1962, 1967, 1977, 1980, and 1982. While the BJP is planning on pitching Bragta’s son Chetan, Congress is backing former CM Thakur Ram Lal’s grandson, Rohit Thakur. The CPI(M) is also carefully weighing its options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-cong-tug-at-himachal-s-apple-heartland-ahead-of-bypoll-101626462194225.html
17-07-2021||Chandigarh||CM Jai Ram doles out sops for Jubbal-Kotkhai ahead of bypoll||With an on the Jubbal-Kotkhai byelection, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday doled out sops for the assembly segment in Shimla district on Friday.  The CM said sub-divisional magistrate offices will be opened in Jubbal as well as Kotkhai and the procurement price for apple will be enhanced by ₹1 per kilogram under the market intervention scheme.He also announced opening of a block development office at Kotkhai, a fire sub-station at Tikkar sub-tehsil at Kalbog and shifting of the sub-tehsil office and police station, Sawara (Saraswati Nagar) to the new building of the HP Power Corporation Ltd.He said ₹ 20 lakh each will be provided to the nine newly created panchayats in the Rohru and Jubbal-Kotkhai Vidhan Sabha area for construction of panchayat bhawans.The CM paid tribute to former minister Narinder Bragta and remembered his contribution to the apple belt of the state. Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said apple growers used to be fleeced by the commission agents at different markets across the country, but now several markets had come up in the state due to the efforts of the BJP governments. He said that ₹ 20 crore each had been sanctioned for the construction of fruit and vegetable markets at Mehandli (Rohru) and Bhattakuffar (Shimla). Segment meted out step motherly treatment: Rohit Thakur Meanwhile, slamming the BJP government, former Congress MLA from the Jubbal-Kotkhai segment Rohit Thakur, who is the son of former chief minister Ram Lal Thakur, said the constituency had been overlooked over the last three-and-a-half years. “Now, that elections are around the corner the BJP is making tall claims about development, which never actually took place,” Thakur said, adding that the highest Covid cases had been reported in the region, while the BJP leaders remained oblivious. He accused the ministers of being “political tourists” who only visited the area when elections are in the offing. He said the BJP was started making empty promises to the people of Jubbal-Kotkhai. “The Prem Kumar Dhumal-led BJP government (2007-2012) had set aside ₹1,600 crores for Jubbal-Kotkhai but nothing materialised on ground. Similarly, the BJP government has not filled the posts it had created over the last two years.

The panchayati raj department has sent the list of all such employees to the state election commission, asking it to provide ₹30 lakh each to their dependents as per the government policy. “A total of 3078 applications were received through district magistrates for compensation after the government issued revised guidelines in this regard on June 1 and 2020 claims were found to be genuine,” additional chief secretary, panchayati raj, Manoj Kumar Singh said. He said the government had already made ₹300 crore available to the commission. Earlier in May, the state cabinet cleared a proposal seeking amendments to the rules to change the definition of poll duty to cover more and more claimants. The previous rules covered the election poll period of only one day—the day when the staff did the election duty. The government increased the election duty period from one day to 30 days which meant if any staff died of Covid within 30 days of the election duty, his family would be entitled to ₹30 lakh ex-gratia payment as compensation. Under the guidelines existing then, only 74 personnel were found to have died during poll duty, 40 of them due to pandemic. Kumar said 50% of the personnel who died of Covid-19 in poll duty were teachers. “Of the 11 lakh employees deployed for poll duty, around 6 lakh were teachers,” he said, giving the reason for higher of number of deaths of teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/death-during-rural-poll-duty-decks-cleared-for-ex-gratia-to-kin-of-covid-victims-101626461953626.html

They must take steps to see that the third wave does not take place and even if it does, then steps should be taken to ensure that economic cycle is not disrupted and livelihoods of the citizens are protected,” said Thackeray.CM instructed the officials to prevent crowding of people, ramping up of testing facilities and also coming down on people gathering at tourist spots. He also cautioned that the second wave in still not over and this period should be utilised to take steps to prevent the third wave. He said that though the new Covid-19 cases have reduced across the state, some districts continue to record surge in the infections.In the backdrop of the shortage of vaccines, the Delta Plus mutant and the impending third wave, Thackeray said officials should take steps like declaring areas with high cases as containment zones, isolating patients and insisting on Covid-appropriate behaviour.According to Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, the third wave in inevitable. “The history of any pandemic – measles, plague, influenza and cholera – show that they witnessed multiple waves and abated with the passage of time. The focus now should be micro containment where if higher number of cases is found in a locality, then it should be strictly locked up and patients must be treated,” said Dr Shaikh.Meanwhile on Friday, Mumbai reported 443 new cases and 11 deaths.

When she did so, he asked her to download an app and contact him through it.She alleged that on October 14, 2017, Kumar had called her at his bungalow at Andheri (West) for discussing work-related issues and raped her. He told her she would have to “compromise” if she wanted to enter the film industry. He also told her that he had video-recorded the act and threatened to make the video viral, if she revealed the incident to anyone.The woman has claimed that Kumar continued to exploit her even after the incident on the pretext of providing her with work in T-Series projects, and her ordeal continued till last August.She added that she did not lodge a complaint so far against the film producer as she was frightened, and also thought that no action would be taken against him as he is an influential Bollywood producer.It was only after one of her colleagues encouraged her that she mustered the courage to lodge a police complaint against Bhushan, she claimed.“We have registered a case under sections 376 (rape), 420 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said senior inspector Milind Kurde of DN Nagar police station.Kumar’s team has issued a statement denying the allegations.“The complaint filed against Mr Bhushan Kumar is completely false and malicious and the contents of the same are denied,” read the statement. “It has been falsely alleged that the lady in question was sexually exploited between 2017 and 2020 on the pretext of giving her work,” it added, and claimed that the complainant “has already worked for T-Series banner in film and music videos.”The statement added that around March, the complainant had approached Kumar seeking help to fund one of the web-series which she wanted to produce, which was “politely” refused to. “Thereafter in June, after the lifting of lockdown in Maharashtra, she started approaching the T-Series banner in collusion with her accomplice demanding a huge sum of money as extortion amount. Consequently, a complaint was filed by T-Series against the attempted extortion with Amboli police station on July 1. We also have evidence in the form of audio-recording for the extortion attempt and the same shall be provided to the investigating agency. The present complaint filed by her is nothing but a counter blast to the complaint filed against her and her accomplice for the offence of extortion (sic),” read the statement from Kumar’s team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-police-book-bollywood-producer-bhushan-kumar-for-rape-101626461833647.html

Justice Rahul Chaturvedi dismissed the anticipatory bail application filed by Khan.According to the petitioner, she was framed by her co-workers because of personal rivalry. Additional advocate general Manish Goyal and additional government advocate AK Sand appearing for the state government opposed the plea on the ground that the incident wasn’t just a mistake or negligence on the part of accused. Rather wasted dosages linked to Aadhaar cards of public showed that as per the record, the vaccines were administered to the public but actually they were thrown in the dustbin, they argued.The court after hearing the concerned parties dismissed the anticipatory bail application of Niha Khan. To recall, on May 30, an FIR was registered after district health officials came to know about the alleged incident and a two-member inquiry committee was set up to look into the matter.The committee found that Niha Khan was guilty of vaccine wastage and “malpractice and indiscipline”.

A senior police official privy to the investigation said the trio was arrested for assisting two other terror suspects Minhaz Ahmad and Maseerudeen, who were arrested on Sunday, in arranging a pistol and were aware about their planning to carry out serial blasts in the state.He said the trio will be brought face-to-face with two previously arrested terror suspects Minhaz Ahmad and Maseerudeen, who are already in ATS custody for 14 days since Tuesday. All five suspects will be cross-questioned before one another as Minhaz and Maseerudeen are not answering the questions properly and giving misleading facts to the investigators, he added. Sharing further details, UP additional director general (ADG) of police Prashant Kumar said the trio will be quizzed about the gang through which they arranged a pistol for Minhaz Ahmad. He said the ATS took their custody from Lucknow jail authorities at around 6 pm.

17-07-2021||Delhi||Strong showers on weekend may help cut rain deficit: IMD||Despite a slow start to the monsoon in the Capital, a probable spell of heavy showers over the weekend is likely to help the city cover its rainfall deficiency for July significantly, the weather office said on Friday.The city received strong showers for two days, as the monsoon arrived on July 13, 16 days behind schedule. However, since Thursday, the showers have mostly halted, and Delhi has seen only traces of rain. The India Meteorological Department, which got a series of predictions wrong over the arrival of the monsoon in the last month, has now forecast heavy rainfall over the weekend and issued an “orange” alert.According to IMD, the monsoon season officially lasts from June 1 to September 30. “While the usual monsoon onset date in Delhi and NCR is June 27, the season’s maximum rainfall activity is observed between July 10 and end-August. Though rains continue in September as well, their intensity and continuity reduce. Like the first two days of monsoon [in the city, between July 13 and 14], if we get a few more such spells, the deficit for July will be covered,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. The Safdarjung observatory, the official marker for the city’s weather, received only traces (up to 2.4mm) of rainfall on Thursday and Friday. Additionally, the lack of rain has led to hot and humid days.On Friday, the maximum temperature was 37.8 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season’s normal, and up from 36.6°C on Thursday.Independent weather forecasters said that the withdrawal of monsoon may be late. Delhi received only 33% of its usual rainfall on July 13, the day monsoon arrived. This has now gone up to around 50%, and the shortfall may get covered with a good spell of rain expected between July 18 and July 21.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private forecaster, said that while Delhi is likely to cover a large part of its rainfall deficit in the next four days, July is still likely to record only “near normal” monsoon showers.“Delhi might still record a deficit by July-end. We are, however, likely to see good rains in August, and there is a possibility that monsoon withdraws late this year,” he said.IMD officials, however, said it is “too early” to predict the withdrawal of the monsoon, since long-range forecasts are generally inaccurate.Early or late withdrawal of the monsoon doesn’t necessarily depend on the date of the onset. Last year, the monsoon arrived two days ahead of schedule (on June 25) but withdrew on September 25, even as most of that month saw little rain. “Similarly in 2019, monsoon arrived slightly behind schedule (July 5) but withdrew on October 8,” said a senior IMD official.According to IMD officials, for the monsoon to be considered normal, cumulative rainfall received for the monsoon season must be 650 mm (or 65 cm). “If the total rainfall received is 20% less than normal, it is considered ‘below normal’,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/strong-showers-on-weekend-may-help-cut-delhi-s-rain-deficit-imd-101626460694087.html

While social media posts claimed there were “three blasts”, officials dismissed it as common occurrence of panto flashing — when foreign materials come in contact with the pantograph and overhead wires.“...Five passengers mistakenly boarded this train and they had to be de-boarded and brought to the platform to board the designated last train,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC.A five-second video of the incident uploaded on social media by a resident also showed sparks in the overhead wires.“There was a blast over the Mayur Vihar Phase-I Metro line. There were three blasts on the overhead electrical wires. The Metro has been halted for over 30 minutes and there are a few passengers inside the train,” tweeted one Preeti Nahar late Thursday night.DMRC said “no such incident has taken place which compromises the safety of any of its passengers”.“The blast being referred to in the tweet video is a common phenomenon known as panto flashing, which happens due to several external factors such as rain, foreign material etc coming in contact with the pantograph of the train and OHE (overhead electrification) during movement and in no way causes any safety concern or disruption to services,” Dayal said. Pantograph flashes occur with a transit system that operates with overhead power. It often erupts in flashes during rains, thunderstorms or when a foreign object comes in contact with the overhead wires, but this does no harm to the system because of the multiple safety insulation layers around the electric wiring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/blasts-on-delhi-metro-pink-line-coach-were-common-tech-snag-clarifies-dmrc-after-video-goes-viral-101626460693517.html

This means that the stolen phones may have become useless for the thieves or the people who illegally purchased them, as handsets of blocked IMEI numbers cannot access any network anywhere in India, said senior police officers privy to the development. “In case the thief or the new user of the stolen phone tries to activate any new SIM card in the blacklisted phone, the CEIR portal will share data with the police to help them trace the stolen phone. It will also destabilize the gray market of stolen phones. As of now, the portal is open for Delhi and Mumbai but because of its effectiveness, the facility is being extended across India,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.According to the officer, a total of 94,204 cellphones have been blacklisted through the CEIR portal between May 20 and July 14 this year. The Delhi Police shared the data of these stolen phones with the portal through their zonal integrated police network (ZIPNET) system. Owners file FIRs about their stolen phones either at the police station or through the various e-FIR filing schemes launched by the city police.“The ZIPNET collects the IMEIs of the stolen phones from the FIRs and passes them to the CEIR that blocks them after proper verification,” the officer said adding that the CEIR project was launched with a view to check the resale of lost or stolen phones and discouraging snatching and thefts of mobile phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-94-000-phones-reported-stolen-to-delhi-police-blacklisted-101626460576215.html

In November 2010, an FIR was registered by the police.However, the case was handed over to CBI following the August 23, 2011 order of the high court’s order in August 2011.Deceased Bhuvan’s name had appeared in a murder case of a photographer in July 2007. He had sustained burn injuries on September 1, 2007 and died on September 3, 2007 at PGIMS, Rohtak.CBI mentioned that Dutt had disclosed in his dying declaration that he was implicated in a 2007 murder case and was in the police station for the past three days where police physically tortured him.“To extract a confession from him, inspector Pawan had parked a motor cycle beside Bhuvan Dutt and after taking out petrol from the said motorcycle and pouring it on Dutt, he enquired from Dutt about his involvement in the said murder case. Pawan further set him on fire with a matchstick to extract a confession from him,” Dutt’s dying declaration mentioned.CBI special judge Dr Sushil Kumar Garg observed Dutt was “set on fire by the police officials” and it is a case of “custodial death” and no other hypothesis could be made out.“It is crystal clear that it was accused Pawan, who had set Dutt ablaze while he was in police custody, in his endeavour to extract favourable statement/disclosure in the murder case of Rajinder photographer.”While the two pleaded for lenient view, the public prosecutor for the CBI, KP Singh, argued that convicts have misused the power given to them by the statute being police officials, hence maximum punishment be given.Dr Garg observed, “Law enforcers are protectors of life and property and not death dealers. Illegal acts of the accused have severely eroded public trust in law enforcement and caused social harm. The case touched a raw nerve among people because of determined legal battle to bring to justice the killer of Dutt.”Observing that convicts do not deserve any sympathy, the court added, “Death due to custodial violence is abhorrent and not acceptable in a civilized society. The offence committed by the accused is a crime not against the deceased alone but against humanity as well.”He said, “It is a matter of public concern, when the protector of people and society instead of protecting people adopts brutality and inhumanly beat the person who come to the police station for their grievances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/custodial-death-is-abhorrent-unacceptable-101626460574095.html

I am referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges of the Vidhan Sabha. Formal orders will be issued on Saturday,” the Speaker said.The July 6 report submitted by the director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava has also absolved IPS officer and the then SP (security) Pankaj Nain.Nain was responsible for managing the security apparatus in the assembly parking where the alleged attempt to attack Khattar took place.The report said Nain performed his duties satisfactorily on the day of the incident. The Speaker, however, disagreed with the clean chit given to Nain.“When the first inquiry report was submitted, show-cause notices were issued to eight police personnel. It was also assured that disciplinary action will be initiated against them after getting their response and analysing the episode,” Gupta said.However, the Speaker said, departmental inquiries have been ordered against three cops while the other five have been let off.“If the five are being let off on pretext of following the orders of their in-charge, then action should be taken against the officer in-charge. His action has also not been justified,” the speaker said.The DGP has asked his Chandigarh counterpart to take appropriate action against the erring Chandigarh traffic police personnel deployed at Vidhan Sabha complex for failing to stop the vehicle used by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs from entering the Haryana side parking of the assembly complex.The Speaker said by asking the Chandigarh DGP to take action against the traffic cops, the state police is trying to pass the buck.Nine Punjab MLAs of SAD, including former Punjab ministers Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and Bikram Singh Majithia, were booked by the Chandigarh Police in March for their alleged attempt to attack Khattar in the Vidhan Sabha complex.The Punjab MLAs were demanding that the Haryana government should pass a resolution against the Centre’s three farm laws.Acting on complaint of a marshal of the assembly secretariat on March 13, the Chandigarh Police had registered a case against Dhillon, Majithia, Baldev Singh Khaira, Sukhwinder Kumar, Harinder Pal Singh Chandumajra, Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi, Manpreet Singh Ayali, Gurpartap Singh Wadala and Narinder Kumar Sharma.According to the complaint, Khattar was giving a press briefing on the day’s session when the nine SAD MLAs, accompanied by six-seven people with black stripes protested and allegedly tried to attack him.The security staff of the Vidhan Sabha and the Haryana Police intervened and prevented the situation from worsening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/attempted-attack-on-khattar-police-report-absolves-ips-officer-five-others-101626460514902.html

In Uttar Pradesh, as many 25 districts, including state capital Lucknow, have recorded less than normal rainfall during this period.“The monsoon has resumed in the state since last week but has not gain strength which has resulted in less than normal rain fall in many districts. It is expected that the monsoon will gain strength over the weekend with above average rainfall across Uttar Pradesh,” said state MeT director JP Gupta.The lack of rainfall and high relative humidity (RH) have made the weather sultry in Uttar Pradesh. Though the mercury hovers around the 40 degree mark, the high RH makes it feel hotter. Even the minimum temperature across UP has been around 28 degree which is four degree above normal.As per the state MeT data, 47 districts in Uttar Pradesh have recorded less than average rainfall in this monsoon. The state has recorded only 181mm rainfall which is 21% less than the normal 228.9mm rainfall this monsoon season, turning the state into rain deficient. The situation in western UP districts is worse as the region recorded 104 mm rainfall which is 49% less than normal 195.2 mm rainfall.The scanty rainfall has made farmers in the state worried about their Kharif crop. Paddy, sugarcane and maize are major Kharif crops in the state. These crops have a higher water requirement which is fulfilled by the monsoon. In the absence of sufficient rainfall, the farmers are forced to use pumps for irrigation which increases their cost and cuts into their profit.“Uttar Pradesh requires at least six to eight days of good rainfall in July to cover the lack of rain this monsoon season. We are hopeful that the state will have at least five days of rain this month which will reduce the deficiency,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heavy-rain-strong-wind-across-up-in-next-48-hrs-says-imd-101626460393541.html
17-07-2021||Delhi||Yamuna water back to normal levels, says DJB||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice- chairperson Raghav Chadha on Friday inspected the Wazirabad Barrage to review the water levels and said the situation is returning to “normal” now with the Haryana government releasing Delhi’s rightful share.“It took three days for the 16,000 cusecs of water released by Haryana to reach Delhi. The river bed, which was all dried up few days back, is back to its normal levels of 674.5 feet,” said Chadha.Delhi is dependent on its neighbours -- to fulfil its water needs. As per a 1995 Supreme Court order, Haryana government has to release 120 million gallons per day (MGD) of water to Delhi routinely.After inspecting the barrage, Chadha said that the water level in the Yamuna is back to its previous water levels. “Water level has increased to 674.5 feet from 667 feet after Haryana released Delhi’s share of water,” he said.Later, Chadha also tweeted: “During my last visit to Wazirabad Barrage (on Monday), Haryana government’s apathy/inaction was writ large when we noticed that Yamuna river bed was visibly parched and dry. However, now the Wazirabad pond is full... Things are normalising.”On Monday, Chadha claimed that the water level in the Yamuna has slipped to its lowest mark since 1965, and blamed Haryana for the shortages that squeezed supply in the national capital with several areas in the central, south, west and New Delhi districts going without regular supply.The Haryana government strongly denied charges of withholding water then. “First, they (AAP government) presented false figures during Covid second wave to procure oxygen, much above the requirement, and now Kejriwal is doing the same on the water issue to hide his own failures. They are levelling baseless allegations,” Haryana home minister Anil Vij said on Monday. He further accused the AAP government of trying to “mislead the people of Delhi to cover up their own mistakes”.The DJB had last week filed a petition in the apex court seeking directions to the Haryana government to release “Delhi’s rightful share of water”.On Friday, Chadha said that the water treatment plants of the DJB can now operate at optimum capacity. “Now that the water level has revived, the DJB will be able to function at an optimum capacity to deliver clean drinking water to all the households in Delhi. The situation is now completely normal at the water treatment plants and an increase in the water levels of this riverbed is clearly visible,” said Chadha.The water treatment plants in the Capital were operating at a reduced capacity after the water level dropped in the Yamuna earlier, which led to an acute shortage of water supply in several parts across the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yamuna-water-level-back-to-normal-says-delhi-jal-board-101626459794215.html

I am a party to such (an) act as a part of the showcase of Judges who are adorning this court, including the Chief Justice,” the single judge bench said in its order, underscoring that he had repeatedly flagged the problems to the project coordinator.The judge rued that “connectivity issues and electronic interference in the audio and visual systems’’ had become a daily feature of the court. “Despite the tall talks about achievements of virtual hearing facilities and restricting hearing of litigations entirely to virtual hearings, it is unfortunate that this court is unable to provide the minimum virtual services and connectivity in order to ensure that justice is rendered appropriately,” the order said.The Central Project Coordinator is directed to show cause in writing as to why proceedings should not be drawn up against the high court administration, including the registrar general and the central project coordinator, in particular, for criminal contempt of court due to continuous interference in virtual hearings in court in each and every matter, the order said.“Fie on the system which cannot deliver justice to its citizens. Hence, this court is unable to sit any longer till the connectivity issues are resolved entirely. Sitting in court and playing dumb charades during virtual hearings with the advocates, due to major disruptions in virtual services, has become a joke by now and does not tantamount to adjudication of matters but is a mere circus on show before the public,” the order said. Justice Bhattacharyya also asked that a copy of his order be communicated to the acting chief justice and the high court’s registrar general.“I stop short of issuing a Rule of Contempt to give a last chance to the high court administration to rectify the faults in connectivity so that proper justice can be rendered to the litigants at large, particularly when we are restricting learned advocates and the litigants to appear in court in person and confining hearing merely to the virtual mode,” ordered the judge and listed the hearing, which was disrupted, for Saturday on a priority basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/not-part-of-such-circus-judge-rebukes-officials-after-glitches-in-virtual-hearing-101626459614569.html
17-07-2021||Pune||Ajit Pawar blames Centre for intermittent vaccine supply||At the Friday’s Covid-19 Review meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that despite promises made by the centre, that after June, production of Covid-19 vaccines would increase and supply would be uninterrupted in July, supply continues to remain interrupted. This even as the state government is contemplating opening up more services, including factories and malls, for those fully vaccinated. Pawar said, “We were assured that the production of vaccines would become 100% by the end of June and so by July, supply would be uninterrupted. However, that has not happened. Even in July we have had to shut down some centres for vaccination because there were no vaccines.” Pune district has seen over 5.52 million people get the Covid-19 vaccine, of which 4.25 million have got their first shot, while 1.26 million got their second shot. Pawar also said that the state government is contemplating opening up more services, including starting public places like malls, for those who fully vaccinated and with a certificate for the same. He said, “Even though people have the option to get vaccines from government or private hospitals, we have asked companies and factories, and employers to vaccinate their staff with both the vaccines; then they can r-open the companies. Also in the case of malls, although we have started retail shops, the situation is that the people do not just shop in malls, they tend to spend more time and roam around. This is the reason why malls and shops inside the malls are shut. However, if people have got both the vaccine shots and are fully vaccinated, then we can think about allowing the malls to open. Malls can allow those with certificates of being fully vaccinated to enter their premises.” However, Pawar also added that despite being fully vaccinated, people must ensure that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is followed, including wearing of masks and social distancing at all times. He said, “It is important that we start the economic cycle. Unlike the first wave, we do not want to shut down everything if there is another wave, and so vaccination is important.” Ongoing restrictions to continue in Pune Ajit Pawar said that the ongoing restrictions, including the weekend restrictions and the curfew post 5 pm would continue in Pune. He said, “Pune is still at level 3 as of now. We also have a few districts in Maharashtra which have reported 0 positivity in the past few days, however, to avoid a third wave, we will continue with the ongoing restrictions.” He also warned of stricter action against people crowding popular tourist spots during the weekends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ajit-pawar-blames-centre-for-intermittent-vaccine-supply-101626451993264.html

They provided me with every facility I needed to study. I accepted the fact that this pandemic would continue and made most of the situation and am satisfied with my marks,” said the student, planning for a Master’s in robotics.While DES Secondary School got a 100% result, Chinmay Nitin Bhave secured the first rank in his school with 98.40%.

Her mother, a housemaid is thrilled.“I am a student of Dr Nanasaheb Parulekar School in Yerawada. It has been a tough year, starting with the fact that with lockdown, I had no means of studying online, until the school gave us a mobile phone to attend classes through an NGO. It was difficult to study because of network issues, calls getting cut in between and understanding the teachers. I would revise every day after the lecture was over. I want to be a lawyer when I grow up,” said this Maths-loving girl. Aksharnandan Secondary School student Trunaya Parineeta Unmesh scored 83.20%. “We faced a lot of technical issues at the beginning of this academic year, but teachers and parents helped us. We could reach our teachers whenever we needed them, so there wasn’t a problem. I just had to push myself to study.

17-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police lodge case against Bhushan Kumar for alleged rape||Mumbai Police have registered a case against T-series managing director and film producer Bhushan Kumar after a 30-year-old woman accused him of raping her on the pretext of giving her a job, officials said on Friday.Kumar, son of music baron, the late Gulshan Kumar, however, has denied the allegations and accused the woman of extortion.The offence was registered on Thursday at DN Nagar police station in Andheri (West) on the basis of the complaint filed by the 30-year-old woman, who is an aspiring actor, the officials said.According to the complaint, the woman has known Kumar, 43, since 2017 and has accused him of raping her several times between 2017 and 2020. HT has seen a copy of the complaint.In her complaint, the woman has alleged that she met Kumar at a hotel in Mumbai in September 2017, when he gave her his contact details. She has further alleged that Kumar called her to his bungalow on October 14, 2017, where he raped her. Kumar allegedly recorded the act and threatened to make the video public if she approached the police, the woman said.She did not file a complaint earlier as she was frightened, the woman has said.“We have registered a case under sections 376 (rape) , 420 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code,” said Milind Kurde, senior police inspector of DN Nagar police station. Kumar’s team, however, has issued a statement calling the allegations “completely false”, saying that the woman “has already worked for T-Series banner in Film and music videos”.“The complaint filed against Mr. Bhushan Kumar is completely false and malicious and the contents of the same are denied,” said the statement. “It has been falsely alleged that the lady in question was sexually exploited between 2017 to 2020 on the pretext of giving her work.”According to the statement, the woman allegedly approached Kumar in March 2021, seeking help to produce a web-series. “Thereafter, in June 2021 after the lifting of lockdown in Maharashtra, she started approaching T-Series banner in collusion with her accomplice demanding huge sum of money as extortion amount,” the statement said.“Consequently, a complaint was filed by T-Series banner against the attempted extortion with the Amboli police station on 1st July 2021. We also have evidence in the form of audio recording for the extortion attempt and the same shall be provided to investigating agency. The present complaint filed by her is nothing but a counter blast to the complaint filed against her and her accomplice for the offence of extortion,” the statement added. Earlier, an unidentified woman had accused Kumar of seeking sexual favors in exchange of a three-movie contract. The woman alleged on Twitter during the #MeeToo movement that the film producer invited her to his bungalow and threatened to destroy her career when she resisted his sexual advances. Kumar refuted the allegations. She, however, did not file a complaint then.T-Series is a music record label and a film production company founded by Gulshan Kumar.

Belgium’s national crisis centre said the country’s confirmed death toll rose to 27.By Saturday, authorities still feared finding more people dead as the receding floodwaters eased access across much of the affected regions and revealed the extent of the damage.“A lot of people have lost everything they spent their lives building up - their possessions, their home, the roof over their heads,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on a visit to the town of Erftstadt. “It may only be possible to clear up in weeks how much damage needs to be compensated.”Across the border in eastern Belgium, train lines and roads remained blocked in many areas. Southern parts of the Netherlands also have been hit by heavy flooding.In Switzerland, heavy rain has caused several rivers and lakes to burst their banks, with authorities in the city of Lucerne closing several pedestrian bridges over the Reuss river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-flood-death-toll-tops-160-101626545422650.html

17-07-2021||World||'We are overjoyed': Pilgrims arrive in Mecca for second pandemic hajj||Pilgrims began arriving in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca Saturday for the second downsized hajj staged during the coronavirus pandemic, circling Islam's holiest site in masks and on distanced paths.The kingdom is allowing only 60,000 fully vaccinated residents to take part, seeking to repeat last year's success that saw no virus outbreak during the five-day ritual.This year's hajj, with participants chosen through a lottery, is larger than the pared-down version staged in 2020 but drastically smaller than in normal times, stoking resentment among Muslims abroad who are barred once again.After boarding buses to Mecca's Grand Mosque, pilgrims began performing the "tawaf", the circumambulation of the Kaaba, a large cubic structure draped in golden-embroidered black cloth, towards which Muslims around the world pray.Many carried umbrellas to protect themselves from the scorching summer heat."Every three hours, 6,000 people enter to perform the tawaf of arrival," hajj ministry spokesman Hisham al-Saeed told AFP. "After each group leaves, a sterilisation process is carried out at the sanctuary."- Golden ticket -The hajj, usually one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings with some 2.5 million people taking part in 2019, is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be undertaken by all Muslims with the means at least once in their lives.It consists of a series of religious rites, formally starting on Sunday, which are completed over five days in Islam's holiest city and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia.Among the chosen ones this year was Ameen, a 58-year-old Indian oil contractor based in the eastern city of Dammam, who was picked for the ritual along with his wife and three adult children."We are overjoyed," said Ameen. "So many of our friends and relatives were rejected."Like the other countries of the Gulf, Saudi Arabia is home to significant expatriate populations from South Asia, the Far East, Africa and the Middle East."I feel like I won a lottery," Egyptian pharmacist Mohammed El Eter said after being selected."This is a special, unforgettable moment in one's life. I thank God for granting me this chance, to be accepted among a lot of people who applied," the 31-year-old said.On Sunday the pilgrims will move on to Mina, around five kilometres (three miles) away from the Grand Mosque, ahead of the main rite at Mount Arafat, where it is believed that the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon.- 'Restrict exposure' -Chosen from more than 558,000 applicants through an online vetting system, the event is confined to those who have been fully vaccinated and are aged 18-65 with no chronic illnesses, according to the hajj ministry.The experience for some women in attendance has been boosted by them no longer being required to be under male supervision -- a stipulation dropped over 18 months ago."So many women are also going with me, so I am very proud that we are now independent (and) we don't need any mahram (male guardian)," said pilgrim Bushra Ali Shah, a Pakistani resident of Jeddah.The hajj ministry has said it is working on the "highest levels of health precautions" in light of the pandemic and the emergence of new variants.Pilgrims are being divided into groups of just 20 "to restrict any exposure to only those 20, limiting the spread of infection", ministry undersecretary Mohammad al-Bijawi told official media.Saudi Arabia has so far recorded more than 507,000 coronavirus infections, including over 8,000 deaths.Some 20 million vaccine doses have been administered in the country of over 34 million people.The hajj went ahead last year on the smallest scale in modern history. Authorities initially said only 1,000 pilgrims would be allowed, although local media said up to 10,000 eventually took part.No infections were reported as authorities set up multiple health facilities, mobile clinics and ambulances to cater for the pilgrims, who were taken to the religious sites in small batches.- 'Biggest challenge' -In normal years, the pilgrimage packs large crowds into congested religious sites, but even this year's downscaled events are seen as a potential mechanism for contagion.Worshippers were last year given amenity kits including sterilised pebbles for the "stoning of Satan" ritual, disinfectants, masks, a prayer rug and the ihram, a traditional seamless white hajj garment, made from a bacteria-resistant material.Hosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam's holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.But barring overseas pilgrims has caused deep disappointment among Muslims worldwide, who typically save for years to take part.The hajj ministry received anguished queries on Twitter from rejected applicants about the tightly-controlled government lottery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-overjoyed-pilgrims-arrive-in-mecca-for-second-pandemic-hajj-101626542994262.html
17-07-2021||World||People with learning disabilities more vulnerable to effects of Covid-19: Report||A study conducted by a team of researchers in the United Kingdom has suggested that people with disabilities, who contract the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), are five times more likely to be hospitalised and eight times more likely to succumb due to Covid-19 than the general population of England. Published in the journal "The BMJ," the study also found that risks were particularly high for people with severe to profound disabilities, Down's syndrome, and cerebral palsy.Also Read | NHS doctor asks not to follow UK health secretary advice on lateral flow tests. Here's whyTo study the effect of Covid-19 on people with disabilities, the team of researchers analysed the data for 14,312,023 adults and 2,627,018 children across both wave of the coronavirus pandemic. While the first wave was registered from March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020, the second wave was registered from September 1, 2020, till February 8, 2021.The results of the study for the 90,307 adults on the disability register were as follows: 538 (or 0.6%) had a Covid-19 related hospitalisation, there were 222 deaths (0.25%) due to the viral disease and 602 fatalities (0.66%) were not related to the infection.Also Read | Fully vaccinated UK health secretary Sajid Javid tests positive for Covid-19On the other hand, the corresponding numbers for more than 14 million adults not on the disability register were as follows: 29,781 (or 0.20%) had a Covid-19 related hospitalisation, there were 13,737 deaths (0.1%) due to the viral disease and 69,837 fatalities (0.5%) fatalities were not related to it.Next, potentially influencing factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, geographical location were accounted for and it was found that adults who contract coronavirus had a five-fold higher risk of hospitalisation, as well as eight-fold higher risk of deaths than adults not on the disability register.Similar patterns were recorded among children as well though the researchers mentioned that absolute risk of hospitalisation and death were "small."However, the researchers clarified that these were observational findings and, as such, have some limitations, including focusing only on severe Covid-19 outcomes and the inability to identify everyone with a learning disability from medical records alone.Finally, the study concluded that besides vaccination, efforts to protect people with learning disabilities from severe Covid-19 outcomes should continue. It also called for further research on the excess Covid-19 risks on people with Down's Syndrome and cerebral palsy.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-with-learning-disabilities-more-vulnerable-to-effects-of-covid-19-report-101626537945360.html
17-07-2021||World||Austria, US probe reports of 'Havana syndrome' among diplomats, intelligence officials||Austria and the US said Saturday they were investigating reports of US diplomats and other officials in Vienna falling sick with health problems similar to the so-called "Havana syndrome".US senators in May said that the government was investigating an apparent increase in mysterious directed-energy attacks, amid new reports of potentially brain-damaging incidents inside the US.The still unexplained attacks have caused sickness and even brain damage in US diplomats and intelligence officials in Cuba, China, Russia and other countries.Moscow is suspected to be behind them, even if the mechanism for them has yet to be explained. Scientists have theorised that the attacks arise from pulsed microwaves.Since the first attacks were reported in Cuba in 2016, and after that in China, scientists and doctors have debated the causes and effects, without a uniform conclusion.The New Yorker reported on Friday that since Joe Biden took office this year, about two dozen US intelligence officers, diplomats and other government officials in Vienna have reported problems similar to the "Havana syndrome".Austria's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was "working with the US authorities on a joint investigation in accordance with our role as the host state"."We take these reports very seriously.... The safety of the diplomats sent to Austria and their families is our top priority," it said without giving further details.A US State Department spokesperson said they were "vigorously investigating reports of possible unexplained health incidents (UHI) among the US Embassy Vienna community or wherever they are reported".The official added that "any employees who reported a possible UHI received immediate and appropriate attention and care".Among other steps, the US has already set up a team of medical experts that can address these problems globally and is working to "better protect against these events in the future", the official added.Austria hosts a large corps of foreign diplomats working at several Vienna-based UN and other international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-us-probe-reports-of-havana-syndrome-among-diplomats-intelligence-officials-101626542366480.html

Javid posted a video message on Twitter, saying he took a lateral flow test as he was feeling “groggy” and was tested positive for the virus.“If like me you might feel a bit groggy or you think you might have come into contact with someone who is positive, please also take a lateral flow test too,” he added.Rachel Clark, an NHS doctor, said that LFTs are for those without symptoms, urging people to not follow Javid’s advice. She also posted a link of NHS guidance on asymptomatic testing and asked the health secretary to delete the video.“Here’s the NHS guidance on LFTs. They’re for asymptomatic testing. If you have symptoms, you need to book a PCR test.@sajidjavid please will you consider deleting this video?

But the newly-appointed health secretary has backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to remove almost all restrictions from Monday even as scientists and experts have warned against it.After Javid tested positive for Covid-19, Liberal Democrats renewed their call to drop the “reckless” plan of ending lockdown restrictions on Monday. Munira Wilson, health & social care spokesperson for Liberal Democrats, said no one is safe from this deadly virus since Javid was fully vaccinated against Covid-19.“By easing all restrictions with cases surging, they are experimenting with people’s lives. Right now, they are pursuing a strategy of survival of the fittest, where the young and clinically vulnerable will be left defenceless,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nhs-doctor-asks-not-to-follow-uk-health-secretary-advice-on-lateral-flow-tests-101626541219636.html
17-07-2021||World||UN appeals to assist Afghanistan's war crisis with $850 million||The UN humanitarian chief in Afghanistan appealed for USD 850 million Thursday to help the war-torn country cope with the impact of the Taliban offensive, protracted malnutrition for a third of the country, a severe drought, and the return of 627,000 Afghans this year, most of them deported from neighbouring Iran.Ramiz Alakbarov told reporters at UN headquarters after a virtual briefing from the capital of Kabul that at least 18 million Afghans are in need of assistance and the UN plan is to provide help for at least 15.7 million of them.But he said the UN's USD 1.3 billion appeal is only 37 per cent funded -- USD 450 million — with the United States the largest donor. He said the remaining the USD 850 million being sought is desperately needed.As American and NATO troops complete their pullout from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years, the Taliban in recent weeks have gained control of many districts and key border posts with neighbours Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In many instances, Afghan security forces and military have put up little or no resistance after often being left without supplies or reinforcements.Alakbarov said the second drought in three years and the Taliban's offensive have led 270,000 people to flee their homes in rural areas toward urban areas and regional centers, where they need food, water, shelter and sanitation.The UN is also seeing “very intensive movements of population in the areas when the Iranian and Pakistan borders are now largely closed,” with Afghans trying to use paths away from the official crossings to try to leave the country, he said.Alakbarov expressed hope that Afghanistan's neighbours will look at the situation in terms of human rights and their responsibility to protect people from suffering and allow Afghan refugees into their countries.The United Nations registered 627,000 Afghans who have returned from neighboring countries so far this year, he said, and “most of them are from Iran.”Alakbarov reported a significant increase in attacks on humanitarian workers this year. He said 35 humanitarian workers have been killed and 63 injured, which “represents a 30 per cent increase compared to last year.”He also reported threats and interference involving aid staffers, citing 1,095 incidents in the first six months of 2021, compared to 1,100 in all of 2020.He said most difficulties faced by aid workers arise from military activity, including having to deal with mines on roads, being caught in cross-fire, and coming under attack from groups that target female health workers, women who do vaccinations and mine-clearing teams.Alakbarov said that in the current situation, “everything is a challenge" and “Covid-19 hasn't made it easier,” with deaths from the coronavirus doubling in the last 2½ months.While the UN has humanitarian supplies in Afghanistan for needs through August, he said, the closure of border crossings could pose future problems. He added the insuring security at Kabul airport is absolutely imperative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-appeals-to-assist-afghanistan-s-war-crisis-with-850-million-101626540155528.html

Many of the recipients, commonly known as “Dreamers,” have now been in the US for a decade or longer.But Texas and eight other states sued to halt DACA, arguing that President Barack Obama lacked the power to create the program because it circumvented Congress.US District Judge Andrew Hanen in Houston agreed, and while his ruling left the program intact for existing recipients, it barred the government from approving any new applications.In his statement, Biden urged Congress to move forward with legislation to permanently protect those covered by the program."Only Congress can ensure a permanent solution by granting a path to citizenship for Dreamers that will provide the certainty and stability that these young people need and deserve,” the president said.“I have repeatedly called on Congress to pass the American Dream and Promise Act, and I now renew that call with the greatest urgency," he said."It is my fervent hope that through reconciliation or other means, Congress will finally provide security to all Dreamers, who have lived too long in fear.”The House approved legislation in March creating a pathway toward citizenship for those impacted, but the measure has stalled in the Senate.Immigration advocates hope to include a provision in sweeping budget legislation Democrats want to pass this year, but it's unclear whether that language will survive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-disappointing-biden-pledges-to-appeal-against-daca-ruling-101626536610594.html

Nasa’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard the Aqua satellite captured the progression of the heat dome during an unprecedented heat wave across the southwestern US from July 1 to July 12.In the seven-second clip shared by Nasa, the animation shows surface air temperature anomalies. The hottest areas, which experienced surface air temperatures of more than 5.6 degrees Celsius above average, are shown in pink. Another Nasa instrument, ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), captured ground surface temperature data over California.The image captured by ECOSTRESS shows areas in red that surpassed 30 degrees Celsius on July 8, well above average ground surface temperatures for the area. The next day, Death Valley, a desert valley in Eastern California, recorded a high air temperature of 54.44 degrees Celsius, falling just a few degrees short of the official all-time surface air temperature record of 56.67 degrees Celsius in 1913.Scientists have warned that the unprecedented heat wave is not possible without the impact of climate change. The recent heat wave claimed hundreds of lives in Pacific Northwest and British Columbia.Meanwhile, reports have emerged that another heat wave is building up during the weekend and will reach its peak on Monday. The heat wave will not be as extreme as the earlier one, but it will be unusually hot, according to The Washington Post.The US national weather service has predicted high temperatures throughout the Northern Plains and into parts of northern and central Minnesota.“This heat wave will exacerbate the severe to exceptional drought currently found across the region, which in combination can make for an environment ripe for wildfires to spread uncontrollably,” the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-tracks-soaring-temperatures-amid-reports-of-another-heat-wave-in-us-canada-101626533435943.html

The newly-appointed health secretary has backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to remove almost all restrictions on July 19 amid a raging third Covid wave.Britain is witnessing a massive surge in Covid-19 cases, mainly driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. On Friday, Britain recorded the highest single-day Covid-19 cases in six months, taking the total caseload to more than 5.35 million.Experts have warned that the variant of concern could threaten Britain's pandemic response as nearly half of the country's population is either partly vaccinated or unvaccinated.A recent study suggested that a single shot of Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccines “barely” induce neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant in individuals previously not infected with the coronavirus, causing concern for countries that have opted to maximise the vaccination coverage by extending the gap between the two recommended shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-uk-health-secretary-sajid-javid-tests-positive-for-covid19-101626527983924.html
17-07-2021||World||'Hadn’t seen anything like that': Scientists stunned by rare Arctic lightning||Meteorologists were stunned this week when three successive thunderstorms swept across the icy Arctic from Siberia to north of Alaska, unleashing lightning bolts in an unusual phenomenon that scientists say will become less rare with global warming.“Forecasters hadn’t seen anything like that before,” said Ed Plumb, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Fairbanks, speaking about the storms that started on Saturday.Typically, the air over the Arctic Ocean, especially when the water is covered with ice, lacks the convective heat needed to generate lightning storms.But as climate change warms the Arctic faster than the rest of the world, that's changing, scientists say.Episodes of summer lightning within the Arctic Circle have tripled since 2010, a trend directly tied to climate change and increasing loss of sea ice in the far north, scientists reported in a March study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. As sea ice vanishes, more water is able to evaporate, adding moisture to the warming atmosphere.“It’s going to go with the temperatures,” said co-author Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle.These electrical storms threaten boreal forests fringing the Arctic, as they spark fires in remote regions already baking under the round-the-clock summer sun. Boreal Siberia in Russia gets more lightning than any other Arctic region, Holzworth said.The paper also documented more frequent lightning over the Arctic’s treeless tundra regions, as well as above the Arctic Ocean and pack ice. In August 2019, lightning even struck within 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the North Pole, the researchers found.In Alaska alone, thunderstorm activity is on track to increase three-fold by the end of the century if current climate trends continue, according to two studies by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, published over the last year in the journal Climate Dynamics.“What used to be very rare is now just rare,” said Rick Thoman, a climate scientist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As the parade of Arctic storms this week demonstrated, lightning is already appearing in unexpected places, he said. “I have no memory of three consecutive days of this kind of thing” in the Arctic.With the sharp uptick in lightning, Siberia has seen increasingly ferocious forest fires in recent years. This week, the Russian army deployed water-dropping aircraft to douse flames burning some nearly 2 million acres (800,000 hectares) of forest, while the hardest-hit region of Yakutia has been in a state of emergency for weeks.Meanwhile, mid-June lightning sparked one of the biggest fires this summer in Alaska, scorching more than 18,000 acres of tundra about 125 miles (200 km) north of the Arctic Circle in the Noatak National Preserve in the northwestern corner of the state.Warming in the Arctic is also encouraging the growth of vegetation on northern Alaska's tundra, adding further fuel for fires, scientists said.By the end of the century, twice as much Alaska tundra could burn on a regular basis than was the norm in the past, with fires occurring four times more frequently, according to researchers at the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks.On the water, the lightning is an increasing hazard to mariners, and vessel traffic is increasing as sea ice retreats, Holzworth said.People can become lightning rods and usually try to get low for safety. That's tough to do on flat tundra or ocean expanse.“What you really need is to pay better attention to the lightning forecasts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hadnt-seen-anything-like-that-scientists-stunned-by-rare-arctic-lightning-101626524660365.html
17-07-2021||World||Afghanistan says envoy’s daughter kidnapped, tortured in Pakistan||Afghanistan on Saturday demanded full security for its diplomats in Pakistan following the abduction and torture of the daughter of the Afghan ambassador by unidentified persons in Islamabad.The development came against the backdrop of strained ties between the two countries and Afghanistan’s accusation that the Pakistan government isn’t doing enough to nudge the Taliban to join peace talks to find a political settlement.The Afghan foreign ministry summoned Pakistani ambassador Mansoor Ahmad Khan in Kabul to lodge a strong protest over what it described as a “grave incident”. The ministry called on the Pakistan government to take “immediate action to identify and punish the perpetrators of this crime” and ensure the full security of Afghan diplomats and their families in line with international conventions.Pakistan’s Foreign Office described the incident as an act of “man-handling” that occurred while the envoy’s daughter was riding in a rented vehicle on Friday. Islamabad Police have launched an investigation and the security of the Afghan envoy and his family has been beefed up. “Such incidents can and will not be tolerated,” the Foreign Office said.The Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement that Silsila Alikhil, the daughter of Afghan envoy Najibullah Alikhel, was held for several hours by the unidentified persons who kidnapped her.“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan states with deep regret that on July 16, 2021, the daughter of the Afghan ambassador to Islamabad Ms Silsila Alikhil, was abducted for several hours and severely tortured by unknown individuals on her way home,” the statement said.“After being released from the kidnappers’ captivity, Ms Alikhil is under medical care at the hospital,” it said.Reports said the Afghan envoy’s daughter was kidnapped from Blue Area, a commercial district in the heart of Islamabad, at around 1.45 pm Pakistan time. She was freed by her abductors at about 7 pm with her hands and feet tied. Her wrists and ankles were swollen and there were other marks of injuries, the reports said.The Afghan foreign ministry said it “strongly condemns this heinous act and expresses its deep concern over the safety and security of diplomats, their families, and staff members of the Afghan political and consular missions in Pakistan”.Afghanistan called on the Pakistan government to “take immediate necessary actions to ensure full security of the Afghan Embassy and Consulates as well as the immunity of the country’s diplomats and their families in accordance with international treaties and conventions”.The Afghan side also urged the Pakistan government to “identify and prosecute the perpetrators at the soonest possible time”.The development came a day after a terse exchange between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at a regional conference in Uzbekistan over Pakistan’s support to jihadi fighters in Afghanistan and Islamabad’s failure to deliver on its commitment to get the Taliban to join negotiations aimed at finding a political settlement.Addressing a gathering that included external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and deputy national security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, Ghani said intelligence estimates indicated the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month as well as support from their affiliates and the trans-national organisations” for the Taliban.Ghani also said that contrary to the “repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force, will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously”, organisations supporting the Taliban were celebrating the destruction of assets and capabilities of Afghanistan.He called on Pakistan to “use its influence and leverage for peace and cessation of hostilities”.Khan said he was “disappointed” that Pakistan is being blamed for what is going on in Afghanistan. “We have made every effort short of taking military action against Taliban in Pakistan...to get them on the dialogue table and to have a peaceful settlement there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-says-envoy-s-daughter-kidnapped-tortured-in-pakistan-101626525016893.html

Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to visit the show's opening.Russian media reports said that the new jet has been built by the Sukhoi aircraft maker in a programme of development of a light tactical fighter.Unlike Russia's latest Su-57 two-engine stealth fighter, the new aircraft is smaller and has one engine.The new warplane's name is unknown, and there is no information about its capability and deployment prospects.Rostec, the state corporation that includes Russian aircraft makers, said the "fundamentally new military aircraft” will be unveiled Tuesday at the show. In an apparent bid to raise public interest before the presentation, Rostec published a picture of the new plane covered by tarpaulin with “wanna see me naked?” written under it. It also posted a brief video featuring excited foreign customers and the jet's vague shadow over the water.Following the Rostec announcement, Russian plane spotters rushed to Zhukovsky to take pictures of the new plane — an eerie parallel with Cold War times when Western spies tried to get a glimpse of the latest Soviet warplanes at the tightly-guarded airfield that served as the country's top military aircraft test facility.“Russia is one of the few countries in the world with full-cycle capacities for producing advanced aircraft systems, as well as a recognized trendsetter in the creation of combat aircraft," Rostec said.The Kremlin has made modernization of the country's armed forces a top priority amid a bitter strain in relations with the West, which have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, accusations of Russian interference in elections, hacking attacks and other irritants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-unveil-new-fighter-jet-at-moscow-s-air-show-101626520551695.html

17-07-2021||World||France to allow travellers vaccinated with Covishield after 'Green Pass' row||France has joined several other European countries to allow international travellers who have been administered Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Many EU member states have started accepting visitors vaccinated with Covishield after global outcry over the fact that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has not recognised the India-made vaccine for the ‘Green Pass’."Because the vaccines are effective against the virus, and in particular its variant Delta, the constraints weighing on travellers benefiting from a complete vaccination schedule with a vaccine recognised by the European Medicines Agency (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Janssen) will be raised from this Saturday, July 17, regardless of the country of origin," French Prime Minister Jean Castex said in a statement.The technical specifications of the ‘Green Pass’ suggests that obligation on the EU member states would be limited to “vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorization.” The EMA has approved Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson). But the member states have the option to allow travellers with vaccination certificates other than those approved by the EMA.After the controversy over the EU digital Covid certificate erupted in late June, SII chief Adar Poonawalla said that the company is expecting to receive approval from the EMA within a month. Taking to Twitter, Poonawalla said that he has taken up the issue at the “highest levels” and “hope to resolve this matter soon, both with regulators and at a diplomatic level with countries."Poonawalla had then said that the EMA was “absolutely correct” in asking the SII to apply for approval, adding that the company has already applied for it through AstraZeneca. "We are quite confident that in a month EMA will approve Covishield. There is no reason why not to because it is based on AstraZeneca data and our product is identical to AstraZeneca more or less and it has been approved by WHO, UK MHRA," Poonawalla added.The EMA, however, on Thursday said that it has not received a formal marketing authorisation application from the developer to date. It stressed that the manufacturer needs to submit the application for Covidshield to be evaluated for use in the European Union. The EU health regulator also said that it evaluates vaccines and medicines for their use in the EU and it has no responsibility regarding vaccinations accepted for travel purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-allow-travellers-vaccinated-with-covishield-after-green-pass-row-101626518168431.html
17-07-2021||World||Syrian President Assad takes oath for 4th term after controversial re-election||Syrian President Bashar Assad was sworn in Saturday for a fourth seven-year term in the war-torn country.The May elections were described by the West and Assad's opposition as illegitimate and a sham.The swearing-in ceremony was held at the presidential palace and attended by clergymen, members of parliament, political figures and army officers.In power since 2000, Assad's re-election in a landslide was never in doubt. His new term starts with the country still devastated by 10 years of war and sliding deeper into a worsening economic crisis.The U.N. estimates that more than 80% of Syrians live under the poverty line. The Syrian currency is in a free fall and basic services and resources have become scarce or are offered at exorbitant parallel market prices. Fighting has largely subsided, but parts of Syria remain out of government-control and foreign troops and militias are deployed in different parts of the country.Nearly half of Syria's pre-war population is either displaced or living in neighbouring countries or Europe as refugees. The war has left nearly half a million killed, tens of thousands missing and devastated the infrastructure.The conflict that began in 2011 started after the government cracked down on peaceful protests, turning the opposition against the decades-long rule of the Assad family into an armed rebellion.Assad, targeted by widening sanctions and isolated by the West, is supported by Iran and Russia, who sent in troops and assistance that have propped him up throughout the war.European and U.S. governments blame Assad and his aides for most of the war's atrocities. Assad calls his armed opposition terrorists while U.N.-led talks to end the conflict have lacked any progress.Assad took over in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez, who seized power in 1970 in a bloodless military coup.U.S. and European officials have questioned the legitimacy of the election, saying it violated U.N. resolutions in place to resolve the conflict, lacks any international monitoring and is unrepresentative of all Syrians.Assad garnered 95.1% of the vote in the election, in which officials said turnout was 78.6% of some 18 million registered voters. There were no independent monitors of the one-day vote. Competition was symbolic, with two candidates running against Assad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-president-assad-takes-oath-for-4th-term-after-controversial-reelection-101626516297291.html
17-07-2021||World||‘It’s flashing red’: Former UK health secretary warns govt may have to reimpose lockdown||As Britain prepares to remove virtually all restrictions from Monday, a former UK health secretary has warned that the government may have to reimpose lockdown if the current trend of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases continues. Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that hospitalisations related to coronavirus are doubling every two weeks and about 10,000 Covid-19 patients could end up in hospital by the end of August, twice the number than last year.“The warning light on the NHS dashboard is not flashing amber, it is flashing red,” he said. “It is a very serious situation.”On Friday, the UK reported more than 51,000 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in six months. The worrying third Covid wave, mainly driven by the Delta variant, has prompted scientists and experts around the world to warn the government against removing all restrictions. More than 1,200 scientists have backed a letter published in The Lancet earlier this month, calling the decision “dangerous and unethical.”Meanwhile, the UK government has shown no sign of backtracking from its decision, even though it has toned down on branding July 19 as the “Freedom Day.” Hunt predicted that the country is “almost certainly” going to witness a record daily peak by September. The current daily record of new Covid cases was reported in early January with nearly 68,000 cases.“If they are still going up as the schools are coming back I think we are going to have to reconsider some very difficult decisions. How we behave over the next few weeks will have a material difference,” he added.Britain has pinned its hopes on high vaccination rates, with more than 52% of the population fully vaccinated and 16% partly vaccinated. But a large population is still vulnerable to the virus, given the reduced efficacy of vaccines, as per various studies, against variants of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-flashing-red-former-uk-health-secretary-warns-govt-may-have-to-reimpose-lockdown-101626513217551.html
17-07-2021||World||Church attacks: Head of civil liberties group resigns after controversial tweet||The Indo-Canadian head of British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) has resigned after an inflammatory social media post related to church burnings in Canada after the discovery of unmarked graves of indigenous children caused fury against the Catholic Church in the country.Earlier this month, Harsha Walia, who was the executive director of the BCCLA, retweeted an article about the acts of arson targeting the churches, adding, “Burn it all down.”After the tweet sparked a furore, Walia’s posts were no longer public as she placed her account in private mode.Attacks on churches across Canada began after the discovery of the graves at or near the sites of residential schools that were run by the Catholic Church. It all started when the buried remains of 215 children were found in Kamloops, British Columbia, on May 28. On June 23, 751 more such unmarked graves were found in Marieval in the province of Saskatchewan, and a week later, 182 were located in Cranbrook, also in British Columbia. The latest discovery was on July 12, as 160 were found at the site of the former Kuper Island Indian Industrial School.The chilling discoveries sparked a rash of incidents of churches across the country being burned down, with Christian groups estimating the number at close to 50. BCCLA board president David Fai said, “Words matter. Context matters… A tweet by our executive director on her personal account failed in that regard… We regret the misunderstanding that was caused by the tweet and apologise for the harm the words caused.”He added that the BCCLA acknowledged the “anger, frustration, and sadness many people feel after the confirmation of over 1,000 unmarked graves of indigenous children at various residential school sites”. He also pointed out that following the controversial tweet, the BCCLA “encountered a wave of hateful commentary, fuelled by the fact that our executive director is a racialised woman leader” and Walia and the staff at the organisation were “exposed to inexcusable racism and misogyny”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/church-attacks-head-of-civil-liberties-group-resigns-after-controversial-tweet-101626500955755.html

The death toll in the incident has now risen to more than 150, news agencies reported, adding that hundreds are still missing and homeless while communications remain cut off in major areas still.Floods swept through the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate as well as parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. After days of heavy rain, 103 people have died in Germany alone, the largest number killed in a natural disaster in the country in almost 60 years. They included 12 residents of a home for disabled people surprised by the floods during the night.Streets and houses were submerged by water in some areas, while cars were left overturned on soaked streets after flood waters passed. Some districts were completely cut off.In Belgium, which has declared a day of mourning on Tuesday, officials said there were at least 20 dead and another 20 missing, with more than 21,000 people left without electricity in one region.Thousands of residents in the north of Limburg province in neighbouring Netherlands were ordered to leave their homes early Friday as floodwaters peaked. Emergency services were on high alert, and authorities were also reinforcing dikes along vulnerable stretches where floodwaters continue to rise.Waters were receding in the southern city of Maastricht, where there was no flooding and in the town of Valkenburg, where damage was widespread, but no one was hurt. In the town of Maaseik, on the Dutch border, the Meuse had risen beyond a retaining wall and was spilling past sandbags placed on top.Floods at the Elbe river in 2002, which at the time were billed by media as "once-in-a-century floods", killed 21 people in eastern Germany and more than 100 across the wider central European region.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-in-western-europe-death-toll-nears-130-hundreds-missing-still-101626498717539.html

Doug Ducey issued an emergency declaration earlier Friday for Coconino County, making up to $200,000 available for response to flash flooding in the Flagstaff area. Residents reported streams of water flowing through their yards and on the busiest city streets.The city of Flagstaff and Coconino County opened a joint emergency operations center. Some of the flooding occurred in neighborhoods that sit in the shadow of a mountain that burned in 2019.“Severe post-wildfire flooding is creating dangerous challenges for communities in northern Arizona,” Ducey said Friday. “The flooding is causing road closures, damaging property and putting Arizonans’ safety at risk.”The National Weather Service issued a barrage of weather statements on Friday, warning of flood potential across the state. Many places have received more rain in the past month than in the entire 2020 monsoon season, which ran from mid-June through September, the weather service said.“Torrential rainfall” sent flood waters flowing across State Highway 87 about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Flagstaff at one point Friday evening between Payson and Pine, the service said. The city of Flagstaff said many sections of its urban trail system were damaged and impassable due to recent flooding.The service also issued a dust warning Friday night on the southwest edge of Phoenix where winds in excess of 40 mph (64 kph) created a wall of dust that reduced visibility to less than a quarter-mile across an area that included parts of U.S. Interstates 10 and 8.At least one death has been attributed to flooding. Grand Canyon National Park on Friday identified a woman who was found in the frigid Colorado River after a flash flood swept through her rafting group's trip.Rebecca Copeland, 29, of Ann Arbor, Michigan was found Thursday near the camp where the group of 30 had set up the night before, park officials said. Much of the group's belongings were washed away after a torrent of water rushed through a slot canyon above them.Park spokeswoman Kaitlyn Thomas said a handful of people were “very seriously bludgeoned by the debris.” A handful of them had to be evacuated by air from the canyon, the park said.A different commercial rafting group found Copeland and another woman who initially was reported missing. Thomas said she didn't know whether that group actively was searching for the missing people at the time.“I am confident that the river community did know something was up but I imagine they were on the lookout," she said.The National Park Service and the Coconino County examiner are investigating the incident, the park said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arizona-hit-by-floods-thrice-governor-declares-emergency-as-flagstaff-inundated-101626497140208.html
17-07-2021||World||World Day for International Justice 2021: Theme, history and significance||World Day for International Justice is observed across the globe on July 17 every year to mark an emerging modern system of justice against international criminal acts. The reason behind observing such an occasion on this date is that the International Criminal Court (ICC) was formally established on July 17, following the adoption of the Rome Statute.The Day of International Criminal Justice is celebrated by honouring individuals working to advocate the fundamental human rights of victims affected by criminal acts. People also come together around the world to host events promoting international criminal justice and support for the ICC.World Day for International Justice: History and backgroundWorld Day for International Justice is marked around the globe on July 17. The date has a special significance. According to the International Criminal Court, it was decided by the Assembly of State Parties to observe July 17 as the Day of International Criminal Justice. The decision was taken at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute held in Uganda's Kampala town back on June 1, 2010.World Day for International Justice: ThemeThis year's theme for the Day of International Criminal Justice is "social justice in the digital economy", a timely topic for a modern age where criminals are increasingly relying on advanced internet-based means instead of traditional criminal tactics.World Day for International Justice: ImportanceTechnological developments over the last decade have helped human beings navigate the Covid-19 landscape. Employees are being able to work from home because of what the UN refers to as “digital labour platforms," providing "income-generating possibilities and advantages from flexible work arrangements."However, there is also the added risk of criminal acts resorting to digital means, even more so when the streets continue to be under strict vigil over pandemic-appropriate behaviour. The real threat may be remote, experts say, exacerbating the need to spread awareness over criminal justice on a digital platform.What is the International Criminal Court?The International Criminal Court, or ICC, investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. As a court of last resort, it seeks to complement, not replace, national courts.The International Criminal Court is governed by the international treaty called the Rome Statute. It is also the world's first permanent international criminal court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-day-for-international-justice-2021-theme-history-and-significance-101626493252467.html

We will take proper care of that particular individual," Mujahid was quoted as saying by CNN-News18. “We are sorry for Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui’s death. We regret that journalists are entering war zone without intimation to us," he added.Danish Siddiqui, a Reuters journalist, was killed on Friday while covering a clash between Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters near a border crossing with Pakistan, the news agency cited an Afghan commander as saying.

The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people," Biden told reporters at the White House, as he left for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David.The White House is turning up the pressure on social media companies to weed out what officials say is widely spread misinformation on coronavirus vaccinations.According to US health officials, a current spike in Covid-19 deaths and illnesses around the country is almost exclusively hitting people who remain unvaccinated."There is a clear message that is coming through: this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on Friday.Many of those refusing vaccinations, despite the ease of availability throughout the United States, have said they do not trust the shots.Skepticism is being fueled both by false posts spread by anti-vaccine activists online and by Republican politicians claiming the vaccinations are part of attempts at government control.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Facebook and others are not doing enough to push back."Everybody has a role to play in making sure there's accurate information," she said.Psaki said the White House was taking a more active approach in calling out what it sees as misinformation but insisted that Facebook in particular should react more quickly in taking down problematic posts.Prolific fake news posters"There's about 12 people who are producing 65 percent of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. All of them remain active on Facebook, despite some even being banned on other platforms," Psaki said, without identifying those dozen posters.The White House has "proposed that they create a robust enforcement strategy that bridges their properties and provides transparency about the rules," she said.The turning up of the volume against fake news immediately drew accusations from right-wing media that Biden was installing a "Big Brother" type surveillance over citizens' opinions.Facebook, which has contracted an army of independent outside fact checkers, including from AFP, to try and clean up its content, pushed back at the White House claims."We will not be distracted by accusations which aren't supported by the facts," a Facebook spokesperson told AFP."The fact is that more than two billion people have viewed authoritative information about Covid-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet. More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine. The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period."Earlier, Facebook said it was taking "aggressive action against misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines to protect public health," and that it had removed "more than 18 million pieces of Covid misinformation," and disabled accounts spreading false information.The CDC reported more than 33,000 new cases in the United States on Thursday, bringing the seven-day average up to 26,306, a 70 percent rise on the week before.The seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 2,790 per day, an increase of 36 percent. And after weeks of declines, the seven-day average of deaths was 211, an increase of 26 percent.The spikes are focused in communities with low vaccination rates and "unvaccinated Americans account for virtually all recent Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths," said Jeff Zients, White House coronavirus response coordinator.The new wave is driven by the Delta variant, which now accounts for more than 80 percent of new cases, according to the covSpectrum tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-covid-misinformation-on-social-media-killing-people-facebook-denies-101626484503172.html
17-07-2021||World||Texas records first case of monkeypox||A rare case of human monkeypox was detected in Texas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday, making it the first case of the virus seen in the state.The viral illness was found in a US resident, who recently traveled from Nigeria to the United States and is currently hospitalized in Dallas."While rare, this case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threat to the general public," Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. Other than Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in central and western African countries since 1970, with a large outbreak in people in the United States in 2003, according to the CDC.CDC said it was working with the airline, state and local health officials to contact passengers and others who may have been in contact with the patient. Monkeypox, which belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox, is a rare but potentially serious viral illness that typically begins with flu-like symptoms and swelling of the lymph nodes, gradually progressing to a widespread rash on the face and body.It can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The CDC said since travelers were wearing masks due to COVID-19, the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on the planes and in the airports was low.The patient was infected with the strain most commonly found in parts of West Africa, including Nigeria, CDC added.There have been at least six reported monkeypox cases in travelers returning from Nigeria, prior to the current case, including in the United Kingdom, Israel and Singapore, according to the CDC. The latest case was not related to the previous cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-records-first-case-of-monkeypox-101626479845553.html
17-07-2021||World||Europe sinks deeper into crisis||More than 1,000 people were missing in flood-hit regions of Germany and Belgium on Friday, where waters were still rising with the death toll already well over 100 and communications in some areas cut.Entire communities lay in ruins after swollen rivers swept through towns and villages in the western German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, Belgium as well as the Netherlands.In Germany alone, at least 103 people have died in what is the country’s worst mass loss of life in years. Twelve of the dead were residents of a home for disabled people in Sinzig to the south of Cologne who were surprised by the flashfloods at night.The death toll is expected to rise further as more houses collapsed, while in Belgium, media said at least 14 had died.Some 114,000 households in Germany were without power on Friday and mobile phone networks had collapsed in some flooded regions, which meant that family and friends were unable to track down their loved ones.In Rhineland-Palatinate, around 1,300 people were reported missing in the Ahrweiler district south of Cologne, the district government said. Further north, in Erftstadt, several houses collapsed on Friday, and authorities feared casualties.Roads around the town were impassable after being washed away by the floods. Rescue crews tried to reach residents by boat and had to communicate via walkie-talkie.The German military has deployed over 700 soldiers to support rescue efforts. Authorities worried that further dams could overflow, spilling uncontrolled floods.The devastation of the floods in western Europe, attributed by meteorologists to a climate crisis driven shift in the atmosphere’s jet stream that has brought in land water that once stayed at sea, could shake up an election that has until now seen little discussion of climate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-sinks-deeper-into-crisis-101626462139964.html
17-07-2021||India||Raje loyalist, ex-MLA Rohitash Sharma expelled for 6 years for indiscipline||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former minister Rohitash Sharma was expelled from the party for six years on charges of breach of discipline. BJP state president Satish Poonia issued the letter to expel Sharma from the primary membership of the party, HT has learnt.Sharma, who is considered close to former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, was issued a show-cause notice last month for making anti-party statements. The former minister had said that the party’s state leaders were running the party sitting in the offices and not going to villages. He had held the party’s state leaders responsible for the results in bypolls held on three seats, in which the ruling Congress comfortably retained two seats while the BJP retained the third seat in May. BJP spokesperson and MLA Ram Lal Sharma said Sharma has been expelled for six years by state party chief Satish Poonia as he was constantly, for the last many days, making statements against the party in public. Sharma was first given notice on June 24, and after his reply, was constantly giving statements against the party. The party’s disciplinary committee took it seriously and on its recommendation, Poonia expelled him. Commenting on the expulsion, Sharma told media persons, “I just want to say that those who have expelled me have misused the post out of animosity. There was no reason to expel and I had done no indiscipline activity or made any statement against the party.” “I just stated that 22-years back, the state party chief used insulting words against the party and its leaders, resigned and left the party…what disciplinary action can be taken by such a person? BJP is my mother and will never cheat the party. I will fight for my rights. I have been expelled due to personal animosity. I will fight for justice and approach the Prime Minister, Amit Shah and national party chief,” said Sharma. “I have been a student of experienced leaders and trained under them. I never use insulting or derogatory language,” he said. Political analyst Manish Godha said, “Sharma is known to be close to former CM Vasundhara Raje, his expulsion is also a message to others who were making statements in support of Raje. He was not the only leader making a statement in support of Raje and questioning the party but among them probably was the one who could cause less damage as the rest were sitting MLAs and others”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raje-loyalist-ex-mla-rohitash-sharma-expelled-for-6-years-for-indiscipline-101626545598370.html

He ran an underground banking/banking without permit/hawala business in the Netherlands under the garb of trading in garments. The proceeds of crime were laundered through Pakistani individuals based in Dubai, who transferred the money to Pabbi and his brother’s NRE (non-resident external) accounts in Phagwara,” the ED said in a statement.“The proceeds of crime were invested in the development and construction of Mayfair Resorts and Cabbana Resort & Spa in Phagwara on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway,” the ED added.Cabbana, spread over several acres, is a renowned venue known mainly for hosting luxurious weddings, corporate events, among other events.The resort was raided by the ED in February.Pabbi was produced before a special court and has been sent to ED custody till July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-punjab-born-dutch-national-for-money-laundering-101626544999518.html
17-07-2021||India||Padma Shri awardee Rabindra Narain Singh elected as VHP president||The Vishva Hindu Parishad has elected Rabindra Narain Singh, an orthopaedic surgeon and a Padma Shri awardee, as its new president on Saturday. Singh replaced 82-year-old Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje, who has been in the post since April 2018."Kokje ji is now 82 years old. He wanted to be relieved of his responsibilities as the VHP president. The election has been conducted as per his wishes and our constitution," VHP's joint general secretary Surendra Jain said at a press conference.Rabindra Narain Singh was the vice president of VHP. In 2010, he received Padma Shri for his contribution to the field of medical sciences. Elections were also held for the post of the general secretary and Milind Parande, the outfit's current general secretary, was unanimously re-elected, news agency PTI reported.During the meeting, the outfit discussed the "condition of Hindus" in Haryana's Mewat and issued a statement demanding that the state government must ensure "protection of Hindus" in the Muslim-dominated region.Jain said Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, after visiting Mewat last year, had announced that his government would bring a law against forced religious conversion, effectively implement the law against cow slaughter, constitute a Dharmada Board to look after the religious estate of Hindu-minority areas and set up a camp of paramilitary forces in Mewat district."It has been a year since his announcement, but nothing has yet been done so far," the VHP leader said while appealing to the Haryana chief minister to act on his promises "to establish rule of law" in Mewat.The VHP said the Hindu society has started standing up for "self-defence" in Mewat with support from the neighbouring areas."As a result, several maha panchayats have been organised there to warn Jihadis. The VHP welcomes this awakening of Hindu society,” the saffron outfit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/padma-shri-awardee-rabindra-narain-singh-elected-as-vhp-president-101626543528945.html
17-07-2021||India||Assam Cong MP urges PM to enquire into nationality of MoS home affairs||Assam Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to enquire into the nationality of newly appointed Union minister of state for home affairs Nisith Pramanik. Bora tweeted that a section of media has alleged that Pramanik was a Bangladeshi national. The Congress MP wrote a letter to PM Modi on July 16 urging the prime minister to conduct an enquiry. He uploaded the letter on Twitter on Saturday.“Therefore I urge upon you to conduct an enquiry about the actual birthplace and nationality of Nisith Pramanik in a most transparent way and clarify the whole issue as it creates confusion across the country,” Bora wrote in his letter to the PM. Pramanik, a first-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Cooch Behar in West Bengal, was inducted into the Union Cabinet earlier this month. He was earlier with the Trinamool Congress (TMC). In 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, he sided with the BJP. Even though Pramanik could not be reached, the BJP’s Bengal unit hit back saying that these are mere allegations and need to be backed by proof.“Anyone can raise any allegation. This doesn’t prove anything. Steps can’t be taken just on the basis of mere allegations. If he has some specific proof, he should make it public. It is not a healthy idea if one tries to become relevant just by raising some allegations,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson. This is, however, not the first time that controversy has been triggered around the MP. Earlier, TMC Cooch Behar district president Partha Pratim Roy alleged that there were discrepancies in Pramanik’s educational qualifications. “Multiple portals in Bangladesh have recently claimed that Pramanik was born at Palasbari in Bangladesh. The portals quoted his relatives saying that they were proud of him as he has become an MoS. We were shocked and protested on social media. The air needs to be cleared,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cong-mp-urges-pm-to-enquire-into-nationality-of-mos-home-affairs-101626543557527.html

Priyanka Gandhi on being CM face in UP polls||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Saturday dodged questions on contesting election from Uttar Pradesh or on being the CM face in the state. On the question of contesting the election, she said, "We will see", PTI reported. On whether she would be the party's CM face for the UP polls, Priyanka said, "Should I tell you everything now?"The Congress leader is on a two-day visit in the poll-bound state. On Saturday, she went to Lakhimpuri Kheri to meet two Samajwadi Party women workers who were allegedly attacked by BJP leaders during the recent block panchayat chief elections."They were beaten up while they had gone to file nominations and disrobed. You can imagine what was going on in their mind. Along with Anita, his 19-year-old son was also there," Priyanka said."I want to tell (them) that each and every woman of India stands with them. I told them not to feel afraid, and have confidence," she said.On the party's strategy for the upcoming elections, Priyanka said, "In the past a year and a half, our party has raised the strongest voice. We have hit the roads, our party workers have courted arrests. Rest of the parties have not spoken so much nor they came out (on streets) as compared to us, and we will continue with this."(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-i-tell-you-everything-now-priyanka-gandhi-on-being-cm-face-in-up-polls-101626541238085.html
17-07-2021||India||No end to Kerala’s Covid-19 woes, state reports over 16k new cases||Kerala on Saturday logged 16,148 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in a month, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The high volume of cases is a big concern and it emphasised the need for more vigil and surveillance,” Vijayan said during a press meeting. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 38,079 cases of Covid-19 and the state’s contribution was around 40 per cent of the total national caseload. The state’s test positivity remained 10.76 per cent while the national average is below 3 per cent. The state’s weekly average was above 14,000 cases with 10 per cent TPR. Since June 15, Kerala, the country’s first state to report a virus case in January 2020, topped in new cases and active caseload. Two districts, Malappuram and Kozhikode, reported more than 2,000 cases on Saturday but the CM reiterated that there is no need for panic.“High caseload is due to increased tests. We have set a high testing target and moving towards this. Even at the peak of the second wave, the state did not use 70 per cent of its hospital infrastructure. No oxygen shortage is reported here,” he said, adding that it was due to proper planning and execution of pandemic prevention activities. The CM said unlike other states, the second wave started in the state very late, by April end-May first week, and the situation will subside by the month-end. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the high volume of cases in Kerala and Maharashtra during the CMs’ conference on Friday. “It is true the state is reporting a lion’s share these days. We hope the situation stabilises by the month-end. It is a fact that the state is taking enough time to flatten the curve and it has to be studied scientifically,” said public health expert Dr N M Arun, adding there is no pressure on hospitals despite a high number of cases. “Though super spreaders are not around, a large number of the community and households are succumbing to the virus due to lax micro-management strategy,” he said.Minister of State for External Affairs, V Muraleedharan, also said the state is yet to approach a scientific approach to contain the pandemic. “It seems the government finds refuge in its old records. Instead of reaping political benefits out of pandemic control measures, it has to go by the guidelines of the Union government and the Indian Council of Medical Research,” he said. Meanwhile, the government announced a new set of norms to ease restrictions during Bakrid. At least 40 persons will be allowed in places of worship and there will be special relaxation from June 18-20. Shops and business establishments can be opened till 8 pm. It has also permitted to shoot movies as many Malayalam movie units threatened to shift their base to other states if Kerela remained in lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-end-to-kerala-s-covid-19-woes-state-reports-over-16k-new-cases-101626539177323.html
17-07-2021||India||‘Judiciary stands with people when things go wrong’: CJI Ramana||When things go wrong, the judiciary stands with its people, said Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Saturday, explaining the trust judiciary enjoys in India. He was addressing an international audience at the India-Singapore Mediation Summit 2021.“People are confident that they will get relief and justice from the judiciary. It gives them the strength to pursue a dispute. They know that when things go wrong, the judiciary will stand by them,” the CJI said in his speech at the event. He stated that this trust explains why so many cases flood Indian courts.At a separate event later in the day, launching an event held by Gujarat High Court for live-streaming the court proceedings, the CJI said, “It is high time for de-mystifying the justice delivery system in the country and furthering access through open courts.”Although courts in the country are open to litigants and lawyers, access to justice will become a true reality when litigants and interested parties get to witness, understand and comprehend justice dispensation first-hand through the live-streaming, the CJI said.The CJI hinted that at the Supreme Court, efforts are underway to open some courts for live-streaming as it is cost-effective. “People may want to follow the arguments of the lawyers and observations of the bench only in certain cases, such as those that involve Constitutional interpretation or attract public attention.” Currently, this information is available through the media. In the process, there can be some transmission loss leading to misinterpretation of questions asked and observations made by the bench, which often gets amplified by vested interests.“The formalisation of the live streaming of court proceedings is the best cure for the aforesaid malady,” the CJI said. However, he warned that live streaming of proceedings may become a double-edged sword as judges might feel the pressure of public scrutiny which can result in a stressful environment.At the same time, the privacy of the parties involved and the safety and security of the victims and witnesses should also be ensured during live streaming, the CJI told Justice Vikram Nath, Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court and other judges of the High Court at the virtual event.The CJI also sought to address the perception about pendency in Indian courts and said, “The often-quoted statistic that “pendency” in Indian Courts has reached 45 million cases, which is perceived as the inability of the Indian judiciary to cope with the caseload is an overstatement and an uncharitable analysis.”Pendency cannot be a useful indicator of how well or poorly a system is doing, said Justice Ramana at the Indo-Singapore Mediation event which was also attended by Justice Sundaresh Menon, Chief Justice of Singapore.The problem ailing the Indian judiciary is of delay, the CJI said and was of the strong view that the development of alternate dispute resolution (ADR) techniques, such as arbitration, conciliation and mediation, can have reduced delays by settling disputes outside courts. The current state of mediation in the country shows that since 2005, nearly 3.22 million cases have been referred and nearly 1 million cases have been settled till March 2021 by nearly 43,000 mediation centres.To ensure mediation is successful, the CJI suggested that mediation should be prescribed as a “mandatory first step” for the resolution of every allowable dispute. “Perhaps, an omnibus law in this regard is needed to fill the vacuum,” as mediation is not governed by any law unlike the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. Some recent laws, such as Commercial Courts Act 2015 and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016, provide a clause for compulsory pre-litigation mediation.Since mediation is cheap and simple, it can benefit a vast majority of litigants in India who belong to middle and poorer sections of society, he said, giving the example of Lok Adalats which has helped reduce a lot of cases from coming to courts.Over 7.84 million cases were settled by the Lok Adalats in 2019 and 2020 of which nearly 3.94 million cases were settled at the prelitigation stage.At the start of his speech, the CJI highlighted that mediation, as a concept, is deeply embedded into the Indian ethos. He shared an event from the great Indian epic Mahabharata where Lord Krishna made a futile attempt to mediate the dispute between the Pandavas and Kauravas. “Failure of mediation led to disastrous consequences,” the CJI said.Taking a leaf out of aviation, Justice Ramana said that just as commercial pilots have a simulator component in their training where they are equipped to respond to multiple scenarios, the training programmes of mediators should contain such a component.

17-07-2021||India||‘Smells of a scam’: Cong slams govt for ‘siphoning off thousands of crores’||Congress on Saturday hit out at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for “siphoning off money worth thousands of crores” from Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which is pooled by the private telecom operators of the country for enabling rural Indians to be effectively connected through a reliable telecommunications network.Invoking a Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, “From July 2019 to December 2020, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has given crores of rupees towards Common Services Centres (CSC) for maintenance and operation of optical fibre cables in the country. CAG says that this money came from Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) is a pool of funds generated from the levy that is charged upon all the telecom operators”.Khera added that there has been no clause in the agreement with these companies offering the services to the government through which the USOF could impose a penalty on them if their work was unsatisfactory.He added that there is also no “service level agreement” which means that these companies are not responsible for timebound redressal of complaints.Quoting the CAG report, Khera said that in absence of a prescribed timeline for restoration of faults and non-inclusion of the penal clause, “there was no deterrent for CSCs to ensure that there is no delay in rectification of faults.”Khera added that the Department of Telecommunication has been draining the USOF by allotting projects to various private partners worth crores of rupees and this has been happening for over a year without issuing any tenders.“Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been awarding projects to private parties indirectly through… CSC Wi-Fi Choupal Services India Private Limited,” he said.CSC Choupal is an e-governance initiative for the development of digital infrastructure in the villages.What Khera called a “modus operandi of the government,” he said that the USOF would propose newer projects to the Digital Communication Commission of the telecommunication department and their approval was sought and later these projects were awarded to CSC Choupal.“CSC Choupal would then pass these projects to CSC-SPV (special purpose vehicle or a subsidiary company formed to undertake a specific business purpose). This CSC-SPV would actually be a private company branded as a CSC and this happened without issuing any tenders,” he said, adding that this has been one of the reasons for a reshuffle of the Minister of Electronics and IT.Khera added that as per the website of the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), as of January 2021, the USOF had collected Rs. 1,12,650 Crores, out of which, ₹57,433 crores have been disbursed.“Case in point is what happened in Bihar where the CSC-SPV submitted a proposal on September 13, 2020, to the Ministry of Electronics and IT offering to provide Fibre To The Home (FTTH) and Wi-Fi connections to all villages in Bihar. The estimated cost of this project was 630 crores. But, USOF calls this mega project a pilot project. On 19 September 2020, the Digital Communication Commission (DCC) approved the above proposal for Bihar and on 15 October, USOF issued a letter to CSC-SPV on nomination basis without a tender to start work,” he said.Khera added that no agreement was signed yet and an RTI filed with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology revealed that it is a private company.“On 23 November 2020, the CSC-SPV requested USOF by email to release mobilization advance (30%) of the total cost of the project. And, surprisingly, the USOF under the DoT moved a proposal on that day itself to release 189 crores as advance. Additional administrator for USOF made a noting on the file saying, as no agreement is available, the payment cannot be released,” Khera said.He added that following this, the administrator of USOF, Ms Anshuli Arya, on the 23rd November 2020, wrote, “Honourable PM has inaugurated this project on 21 September 2020. The agreement has not been finalized and is likely to take time. The project is running on a very tight schedule. Therefore, the advance as approved by the DCC is approved. However, the second payment will be made only after the signing of the agreement and reaching the milestone, if any.”As per Khera, Rs. 189 crores were then released to CSC-SPV without any formal agreement.He also said that Mr Vara Prasad, consultant, USOF, had moved a proposal to amend the Indian Telegraph Rules (ITR) for “facilitating the award of contracts on nomination basis to CSC-SPV.”“On 2nd November 2020, Ms Anshuli Arya, administrator of USOF has approved it. The file then went to the Secretary, Telecom through the Member (Finance) of Digital Communication Commission. We do not know the status of this,” Khera said, adding that the whole award of the USOF contracts “smells of a scam”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smells-of-a-scam-cong-slams-govt-for-siphoning-off-thousands-of-crores-101626537317258.html
17-07-2021||India||'Good news for travellers,' says Adar Poonawalla as 16 European countries recognise Covishield||As France accepts Covishield, the Indian version of Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla on Saturday said this is indeed good news for travellers. Tweeting a news report, Poonawalla said 16 European countries have now recognised Covishield for entry of international travellers. "However despite being vaccinated, entry guidelines might vary from country to country, so do read up before your travel," Poonawalla said.The Indian government has been pushing European Union member countries to recognise both Covishield and Covaxin. Otherwise, travellers from those countries, vaccinated with EU-recognised vaccines, will not be exempt from quarantine in India, the government is believed to have conveyed to EU countries.16 countries that accept CovishieldAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and France are the 16 countries that now recognise Covishield. Out of these, 13 are EU members.What does this recognition mean?This recognition means Indians vaccinated with two doses of Covishield vaccine will be allowed to travel to these European countries, once they gradually lift their travel restrictions. Some countries may also require negative RT/PCR test reports as the entry requirement will vary from country to country.Why Covishield's approval became a controversial issueFrom July 1, the European Union introduced a green pass for travelling across EU countries. For this green pass, it only recognised four vaccines -- Comirnaty of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Vaxzervria by AstraZeneca-Oxford and, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. But it clarified that these are for travelling from one EU country to another, not for outside travellers. It also said that the member nations can individually recognise other vaccines. The four vaccines that the EU enlisted are the ones approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Since Serum Institute did not apply for EMA approval, it was not listed.What about other EU countries?The European Medicines Agency has recently confirmed that it has not received any application from Serum Institute of India. "For the COVID-19 vaccine Covishield to be evaluated for use in the EU, the developer needs to submit a formal marketing authorisation application to EMA, which to date has not been received," the EMA said.Reacting to this, Adar Poonawalla reportedly said it can not apply for a marketing authorisation application as it does not intend to sell Covishield in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-news-for-travellers-says-adar-poonawalla-as-16-european-countries-recognise-covishield-101626535657990.html

17-07-2021||India||Shashi Tharoor says population move 'communal', Jairam Ramesh posts Twitter thread||Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, two senior Congress leaders, on Saturday questioned the push for population control in some BJP-ruled states. Jairam Ramesh said according to the Economic Survey of 2018-19 under the PM Modi government, a growing population is not India's problem. In an interview to news agency PTI, Shashi Tharoor echoed the same thought and said the motive behind the population move is "purely political and communal.Hinting at the large Muslim population in Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Lakshadweep, Tharoor said, "It is no accident that the three states where the government is talking about reducing population are UP (Uttar Pradesh), Assam and Lakshadweep, where everyone knows who their intended audience is."Uttar Pradesh has unveiled a draft two-child policy in which people with more than two children will be deprived of government benefits. Assam too has mulled a similar population control move while several other states have this criterion for contesting local elections."The Hindutva elements in our polity have not really studied the demographic issues. Their motive is purely political and communal," Tharoor told PTI.By Modi Sarkar's own estimate in the Economic Survey 2018-19, some states in India will have to prepare for an ageing population by 2031, not growing population. This will be driven by existing policies to empower women, family planning programmes and socio-economic changes. 4/n pic.twitter.com/raGg7W0W0ZJairam Ramesh posted a Twitter thread on the BJP government's population move and quoting from this government's Economic Survey, the Congress leader wrote, "By Modi Sarkar's own estimate in the Economic Survey 2018-19, some states in India will have to prepare for an ageing population by 2031, not growing population. This will be driven by existing policies to empower women, family planning programmes and socio-economic changes.""I wonder how many in the BJP are aware of the basic facts that Modi Sarkar's own 2018-19 Economic Survey had presented in Parliament in July 2019," Jairam Ramesh tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-says-population-move-communal-jairam-ramesh-posts-twitter-thread-101626530723033.html
17-07-2021||India||Kerala to relax lockdown curbs for Bakrid. Union minister offers a suggestion||As Kerala will be easing its ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown restrictions in the state for a few days owing to the Bakrid festival, Union minister V Muraleedharan said on Saturday the state government is not following a scientific approach to contain the spread of the viral disease.Kerala, which is continuing to report a high number of cases, will see lesser restrictions on July 18, 19 and 20 due to Bakrid, which will be celebrated either on July 20 or 21. The government had earlier said that apart from shops selling essential items, those selling textile, footwear, jewellery and electronics will be allowed to remain open till 8pm and this will be applicable to A, B and C category local self-government bodies.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, said on Saturday that a maximum of 40 people will be allowed in places of worship during the festival and they should be inoculated with at least the first dose of the vaccine.Also Read| Kerala observes 2-day complete lockdown before restrictions are eased for BakridSpeaking to news agency ANI, Union minister Muraleedharan said on Saturday despite Kerala accounting for a ‘lion share’ of infections across India, the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan-led government is yet to adopt a scientific approach to contain the pandemic.“Now that Bakrid has come, the government has announced a three-day exception for the lockdown. My suggestion is to follow the scientific approach and follow the guidelines of Government of India, ICMR guidelines and WHO. Do not utilise the pandemic as means of having political benefit out of it,” Muraleedharan added.The Union minister also suggested the Kerala government should handle the pandemic and the lockdown on a scientific basis and provide exemptions on scientific methodology. “Instead of knee-jerk reactions, scientific analysis of the issues is the need of the hour,” he told ANI.Kerala has so far 3,130,833 cases and 15,155 deaths due to Covid-19. The state on Saturday recorded another high of 13,750 cases while 130 more people succumbed to the viral disease. The active cases, which have been increasing for the past three weeks, stand at 121,944 while recoveries are nearing 3 million.

17-07-2021||India||Lawyer files PIL in Supreme Court seeking 'One Nation One Penal Code' in place of 'colonial' IPC||Lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Upadhyay has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court, seeking directions to the Union government to set up a committee of experts to draft a "comprehensive" and "stringent" penal code after examining the existing statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC) of 1860, related to matters of crime and corruption."Direct the Centre to constitute an expert committee to examine all domestic and internal laws relating to corruption-crime, and draft a comprehensive and stringent 'one nation one penal code' in order to secure the rule of law, equality before laws and equal protection of laws," the PIL, filed through advocate Ashwini Dubey, stated. It further urged the top court to direct the central government to ascertain the feasibility of implementing a stringent and comprehensive IPC (One Nation One Penal Code), instead of the current "outdated" laws on crime and corruption.The petition, which is likely to be taken up for hearing next week, described the IPC, which is more than 160 years old, as "colonial." It also called for specific chapters on bribery, money laundering, black money, profiteering, adulteration, hoarding, black marketing, drug smuggling, gold smuggling and human trafficking to be included in the proposed "One Nation One Penal Code."The PIL also pointed that despite witch-hunting, honour killing, mob lynching, Goonda Act, etc. being pan-India offences, laws related to these are not included in the existing IPC. Due to this, it said, there are multiple sentences for the same offence in various states. "Hence, a new IPC is essential to standardise the punishment and make them uniform," the petition stated.The development comes at a time when the Supreme Court has questioned the Centre over the misuse of the "colonial" sedition law. Section 124(A) of the IPC has laws related to sedition.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyer-files-pil-in-supreme-court-seeking-one-nation-one-penal-code-in-place-of-colonial-ipc-101626527756620.html
17-07-2021||India||After Covid lockdown, mobility increased maximum in last 2 months: Govt data||With restrictions being eased across the country, mobility has seen a sharp rise, which may impact the spread of the Covid-19 infection in the country, the health ministry has said. Based on Google community mobility data, the ministry recently presented a comparison of community mobility between May 20 and July 10, which showed that the overall movement of people has become manifold in these two months."Most of the districts have reached pre-covid level mobility. Some have registered more mobility than previous times," Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the ministry of health said reiterating the need of adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour.Also Read: Mask usage will go down in August-September, Centre warns citing projectionAccording to the map showing data as of July 10, a few places in Kerala and the northeast have negative mobility. Some districts of western, central and northeastern India too have lower mobility. But the rest of India, shown in red on the map, have normal mobility. And the transformation took place between May and July. Mobility data for districts marked in white were not available.The comparison also reveals that while the sudden crowding at tourist places has become a cause of concern, high mobility is recorded in the majority of districts, which may not be tourist spots. The overall Covid-19 situation in the country in July has marked significant improvement. But crowding, violation of Covid-19 norms have thrown fresh challenges in front of India's Covid-19 management. The crowding of people in hill stations without masks has been referred to as "alarming" by the ministry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too raised the issue and alerted his ministers, officials against the third wave of the pandemic, the threat of which is real for India.Only a handful of districts in India are still under lockdown or lockdown-like restrictions as Kerala, Maharashtra and the northeast have been identified as pockets where the Covid-19 situation has either plateaued or is becoming worse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-covid-lockdown-mobility-increased-maximum-in-last-2-months-govt-data-101626528116024.html

The aircraft, which was to go on a solo flight, belonged to Chimes Aviation Academy, a private aviation institute.The accident took place around 3pm, police said. Rahul Sharma, the local administrator of Chimes Aviation, said that the 22-year-old female trainee pilot was safe. According to eye witnesses, the aircraft skidded off the runway and ended up in a patch of land full of shrubs.“Just got the news of a crash of a Cessna aircraft (solo flight) that belonged to the Chimes Aviation Academy, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh.

In January 2020, a flight instructor and a trainee pilot lost their lives when a training aircraft they were flying crashed in an agricultural field near the airstrip. Two months later, the Madhya Pradesh government banned the institute from using the airstrip after the academy was found allegedly flouting various norms. The ban, however, was lifted later.On Friday, a flight instructor lost his life while a trainee pilot was injured when their training aircraft crashed in Maharashtra's Jalgaon.

17-07-2021||India||NCP rubbishes speculation over Pawar’s meeting with Modi||Former Union minister Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Saturday rubbished speculation about his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and clarified the two met to discuss amendments to the banking regulations, their impact on the cooperative sector, and the Covid-19 vaccination drive.NCP spokesman Nawab Malik insisted there was nothing to be speculated about and that the two other constituents of ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA)--Shiv Sena and Congress--were apprised about the meeting. He added chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Congress’s Maharashtra in-charge H K Patil knew about the scheduled meeting.“A few people are linking the meeting between Pawar and Modi to that of earlier few meetings between leaders from NCP and BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). Pawar’s was a scheduled meeting that took place as per the pre-determined appointment. BJP’s leader in Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal called on Pawar as a courtesy to seek cooperation from opposition parties. Defence minister Rajnath Singh convened a meeting at his office with two former defence ministers Sharad Pawar and AK Antony yesterday (Friday). ...people are linking these two meetings and a meeting between Modi and the leader of opposition in Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis with speculation about the MVA government in Maharashtra. But the speculation has no substance,” said Malik, who is a minister in the MVA government.Malik said the NCP is with other opposition parties in both the Houses of Parliament and will join hands with them to raise voice against rising prices of petrol, diesel, inflation, vaccination, the tension on borders and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Thackeray was told about the meeting by Pawar during their meeting two days ago. Similarly, Patil was informed about the scheduled meeting early this week. The meeting was scheduled to take place much earlier, but the time constraint delayed it. Pawar had already spoken with the prime minister over the phone on the issues in the banking and cooperative sector, but the latter insisted upon a personal meet.”He said Pawar raised the issue of the shortage of the Covid-19 vaccines with Modi. “He has requested the prime minister to have a policy for a smooth supply of the vaccines to all states.”Malik said the new amendments to the Banking Regulation Act are expected to hit the cooperative banking sector badly. He added Pawar requested Modi to intervene.Pawar is believed to have taken up the issue of action by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against sugar factories, political leaders in Maharashtra. He requested Modi to avoid “unwarranted” action against the cooperative sector and also leaders from the ruling political parties in Maharashtra, people aware of the matter said. On Friday, ED attached property worth ₹4.2 crore of the former home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh. Several leaders from the ruling parties in Maharashtra are facing the ED probes....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-rubbishes-speculation-over-pawar-s-meeting-with-modi-101626522858209.html

17-07-2021||India||Not enough evidence to link Covid with increase in TB, says health ministry||Refuting reports that there has been a sudden uptick in the number of tuberculosis cases among patients recovering from Covid-19 infection, the Union health ministry on Sunday said there is not enough scientific evidence to link the two. Both the diseases are contagious and primarily attack the lungs, but it will not be right to ink the two as yet, the government said. A few reports claimed that Madhya Pradesh doctors have found the number of TB patients suddenly increasing and what links all of them is Covid.Then why are TB cases increasing? Or, are TB cases in India actually on the rise? The government has said that TB case notifications in India decreased by about 25 per cent owing to "the impact of Covid-19-related restrictions" in 2020. "But special efforts are being made to mitigate this impact through intensified case finding in OPD settings as well as through active case finding campaigns in the community by all states," the ministry said.Next 100 days crucial, says Union health ministry amid Covid 3rd wave fearsLike other post-covid infections, which are not new but are preying on the weakened immunity, TB can infect a person recovering from Covid as his or her immunity is weak at that time. "TB bacilli can be present in humans in a dormant state and has the potential to start multiplying when the individual’s immunity is compromised for any reason. The same is applicable in post-Covid scenario, when an individual may develop decreased immunity due to the virus itself or due to the treatment, especially immune-suppressants like steroids," the ministry said. The ministry also said that in 2020 only, it had recommended TB screening among Covid-19 patients as early as August 2020 and multiple such advisories have been issued."The dual morbidity of TB and Covid-19 can be further highlighted through the facts that both the diseases are known to be infectious and primarily attack the lungs, presenting similar symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing, although TB has a longer incubation period and a slower onset of disease," the ministry said.Covid and TBBoth the diseases primarily attack the lungs and have similar symptoms like cough, fever, breathing difficulty etc. However, TB has a longer incubation period than Covid.Earlier, the health ministry had said all Covid-19 cases should be screened for TB symptoms using the 4-symptom complex (Cough for > 2 weeks, persistent fever for > 2 weeks, significant weight loss, night sweats), history of contact with TB case, history of TB and those symptomatic should be offered Chest X-ray and upfront Nuclear Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) – CBNAAT/TrueNat) for diagnosis of Tuberculosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-enough-evidence-to-link-covid-with-increase-in-tb-says-health-ministry-101626521329776.html

Last month, the state had set a record of administering over 1.37 million doses in a single day on June 20.Reddy, who was a part of Covid-19 review meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, said that out of the total 1,771,580 vaccine doses given to private hospitals, only 420,209 were used in June.“In reality, the private hospitals are not vaccinating fully to their capacity.Whatever these people are earmarked and whatever they are not able to proceed with, if that quota (of vaccines) is re-allotted to the state government, it would help us in doing a better job,” Reddy told PM Modi, according to news agency PTI.Earlier, Reddy wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on June 29, requesting that the Centre procure vaccine doses, originally provided to private hospitals and not lifted, and supply them to the state government.In May too, the Andra Pradesh CM requested the Centre to halt supply of doses to private hospitals due to two reasons- limited availability of stocks and private hospitals charging exorbitant amounts for vaccinating beneficiaries, PTI further reported.The chief minister pointed out that charging exorbitant prices for inoculations was not only a disadvantage for the unfortunate sections, but also created a situation of black marketing of vaccine doses.Andhra Pradesh on Friday recorded 2,345 new Covid-19 disease cases and 16 more deaths, taking the caseload and death toll to 1,934,450 and 13,097 respectively, according to the health department’s bulletin.During the Covid-19 review meet with PM Modi, which was attended by chief ministers of five other states, Andhra CM pointed out that the state has managed the pandemic situation reasonably well, adding fever surveys have been carried out 12 times and the state government has also focused on testing people with Covid-19 symptoms.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allot-unused-covid-vaccines-from-private-hospitals-to-state-andhra-pradesh-cm-101626517991047.html
17-07-2021||India||'Sentiment of whole country': Sanjay Raut slams Imran Khan's RSS comment on J&K||A day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan blamed RSS ideology for the ongoing suspension of a formal dialogue between India and Pakistan, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the enrire country believed in that ideology that Jammu and Kashmir is a part of India. "What is the ideology of RSS? That Jammu and Kashmir is a part of India, it is true. This is the sentiment of the people of the whole country as well," Sanjay Raut said.Imran Khan, who was in Tashkent to attend the Central-South Asian conference, was asked about India, Pakistan talks. "I want to tell India that we are waiting for a long time to live in a civilised manner. But what will we do as the ideology of RSS has created an obstruction," the Pakistan Prime Minister said in reply when he evaded a question on the Taliban.This is not the first time that Imran Khan alluded to RSS ideology. "Today in India we are seeing the Nazi-inspired RSS ideology take over a nuclear-armed state of over a billion people. Whenever a racist ideology based on hatred takes over, it leads to bloodshed," Imran Khan had tweeted in February 2020, after the Delhi riot.This time, his comment at a time when an Indian photojournalist has been killed by the Taliban has drawn sharp reactions. "Who are the creators of Taliban? It is Pakistan. The whole world has to bear the brunt of the terrorism that Pakistan has spread with the help of the Taliban, so don't trust Imran Khan," Sanjay Raut said.Congress leader Digvijaya Singh too slammed the comment and said the talks are stalled because the Imran Khan government is protecting terrorists. "As long as Pakistan government led by Imran Khan continues to give protection to those who sent terrorists to Mumbai, talks will continue to be stalled and there will be distrust between the countries," the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sentiment-of-whole-country-sanjay-raut-slams-imran-khan-s-rss-comment-on-jk-101626517994509.html

It may happen in a day or may take even ten days,” the people quoted above said.The reshuffle, if it happens, will address the coalition objectives of 2023 assembly elections. Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb inducted eight ministers in 2018, while keeping home, general administration, PWD, labour, information and cultural affairs, industry and commerce portfolios with him.Later, in 2019, Sudip Roy Barman, who was the health minister, was dropped from the cabinet following alleged anti-party activities and Deb, himself, took over the charge. Four cabinet berths are still vacant.Prime Minister Narendra Modi too recently carried out an expansion of his cabinet, with nearly three years left for the next Lok Sabha polls.Biplab Kumar Deb recently visited New Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss his government’s initiative for economic development through Agar cultivation and requested a larger quota for its export.The state is expecting to export 75,000 kilograms of Agar chips and 1,500 kilograms of Agar oil in 2021-22 fiscal year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-cabinet-expansion-likely-with-less-than-2yrs-to-go-before-polls-101626516256429.html

17-07-2021||India||India's monsoon crop area shrinks by 12% this year as rain play hide-n-seek||The farmers in India have planted monsoon crops such as rice, cotton and soybeans on 61.19 million hectares (151 million acres) of land as of July 16, a decline of 12% from a year earlier, according to a report.Quoting the Union agriculture ministry, a Bloomberg report said that the crop-sown for monsoon has witnessed a decline as area under sugarcane has risen almost 1.7% to 5.37 million hectares so far this year. For cotton, the crop has been planted in 9.84 million hectares, down 13% from a year earlier, the ministry said late Friday.The decline in sowing crops comes after the country's rain pattern for the monsoon season has dipped, impacting the farm and agriculture sector directly.India is the world's biggest exporter of rice and top importer of edible oils. A drop in production could not only limit rice exports, but also boost imports of edible oils such as palm oil, sunflower oil and soyoil.Here is the crop-wise distribution on sowing of crops:In June-September this year, the monsoon rains were 7% below average in the week ended July 14, the India Meteorological Department said.Sowing of monsoon-sown crops normally begins in late May and peaks in July while harvesting starts in late September.Additionally, the planting of kharif or summer-sown crops has been hit by patchy rains in many parts of the country as the southwest monsoon showed a seasonal deficit of more than 5% for the first time this year on July 10.Forecasters said the rain-bearing system should reactivate soon. But the total acreage of kharif crops stood at 49 million hectares, nearly 11% less than 55 million hectares sown during the corresponding period last year, data from the agriculture ministry showed.The country relies heavily on monsoon which backs its agriculture sector for nearly all crops. Almost 60% of India's net-sown area does not have access to irrigation facilities. More than 100 nationally important reservoirs are replenished by rains, especially the monsoon rains. The rains also aid drinking water needs, power supply and irrigation in the country.In the absence of reliable irrigation facilities, millions of farmers across the country depend on the rains to sow summer crops.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-monsoon-crop-area-shrinks-by-12-this-year-as-rain-play-hidenseek-101626508642661.html
17-07-2021||India||Bikru ambush: HC refuses bail to wife of an aid of gangster Vikas dubey||The Allahabad high court rejected the bail plea of wife of an aid of slain Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey, who was involved in the killing of eight Uttar Pradesh policemen including a superintendent of police (SP) and three sub-inspectors SI, in Bhikru village in Kanpur dehat on July 3, two years ago.The high court bench led by justice JJ Munir rejected the woman’s revision petition which argued that she had no role in the ambush and was present at the site of the killing of policemen by chance since she and her husband were that day visiting gangster Vikas Dubey as he was their relative. She also sought bail on the ground that she was declared a juvenile by the concerned Juvenile Board on September 1, 2020.The court while rejecting the plea observed, “Prima facie, if not at the center stage of this diabolical act, certainly as an important player, the revisionists seem to have actively participated. In the circumstances, permitting the revisionist to walk out free on bail would shake the law-abiding citizens’ faith in the rule of law and the State’s authority. If that were to be done, it would certainly defeat the ends of justice.”The court added that these remarks should, in no way, be understood or construed as comments on the merits of the case, which is to be judged at the trial.The woman said she was about sixteen years and ten months’ old on the date of the incident and had only been married for a few days to Vikas Dubey’s relative. In her defence, she added that she was not a member of Dubey’s gang.However, the state government cited testimonies of cops who survived the deadly ambush late that night to claim that the girl was an active participant throughout the assault, aiding, and egging and instigating Vikas Dubey’s gang not to spare any policeman.On July 3, 2020, when a police team went to arrest Vikas Dubey from his house in Bikru village of Kanpur Nagar, Vikas and his associates opened indiscriminate fire on the police force, killing eight and injuring six others grievously.While opposing her bail plea, the state government counsel cited the fact that the juvenile board had also held that she should be put on trial as an adult despite being a minor as she had the “requisite mental and physical capacity to commit the offence, as also the ability to understand the consequences” of committing the heinous crime.After hearing the concerned parties, the high court observed, “An overall look on the circumstances of the case brings to mind the fact that the occurrence, in which the revisionist was involved, was not of an ordinary kind. Not only the spontaneous elimination of eight policemen in action and six others left injured, is a horrendous crime that shocks the conscience of the society, but also an act that strikes at the roots of the state’s authority in its territory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bikru-ambush-hc-refuses-bail-to-wife-of-an-aid-of-gangster-vikas-dubey-101626509176860.html

According to the person quoted above, the chief minister discussed various development projects related to the state with the senior leadership.“He told reporters on record that he will be back in the capital in the first week of August with a longer wish list for the state,” the person said.There has been speculation that the chief minister is in the capital to discuss the names for a possible cabinet expansion in the state.Following his meeting with the PM on Friday, he tweeted, “Called on Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji in New Delhi today. Had a fruitful discussion on various development projects of the state.”Talking to reporters after his meeting with home minister Amit Shah, the CM said he was asked to work hard to return to power in Karnataka and win more seats in Lok Sabha elections.“Home Minister Amit Shah said that we will win 100% in UP and in Karnataka we have a bright future. He said to take the responsibility of strengthening the party in Karnataka. I assure you I will not step back and will take complete responsibility,” ANI quoted the CM as having said.Speculations of Yediyurappa’s possible removal have been making the rounds amid reports of resentment among BJP MLAs in Karnataka against the 78-year-old Lingayat leader.Last month, several party MLAs and ministers demanded that Yediyurappa step down as chief minister. State tourism minister CP Yogeeshwara had said that Yediyurappa’s son has been running a parallel government in Karnataka.Yediyurappa, however, has been rejecting the allegations as rumours and had said that he would resign the day party high command asks him to quit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-chief-minister-bs-yediyurappa-says-he-is-not-stepping-down-101626505696061.html

BS Yediyurappa scotched speculations surrounding his chief ministership amid talks of leadership change in the state as he visited Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the national capital on Friday.On being asked if he has tendered his resignation, Yediyurappa said, "Not at all. Not at all." "There is no truth in the rumour," the CM said at the Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi.On Saturday, Yediyurappa met the party chief JP Nadda in Delhi and said he will work to ensure BJP retains power in Karnataka.Also read: Yediyurappa meets PM, fuels speculation amid looming political uncertainty"We discussed in detail the development of the party in Karnataka. He has a very good opinion of me.

"Called on @BJP4India National President Shri @JPNadda ji in New Delhi today. Discussed on various matters including further strengthening the party's prospects in Karnataka ahead of 2023 general elections," he tweeted.Yediyurappa is likely to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh. He will return to Bengaluru on Saturday after meeting the BJP chief and the Union ministers.On Friday, Yediyurappa had met PM Modi and discussed pending state works, including the Mekedatu project across river Cauvery.The chief minister’s visit comes at a time amid swirling rumours of the BJP looking at the possibility of a leadership change.

Yediyurappa has made it clear that he would like to remain in power till 2023 and, people aware of the developments said that the 78-year-old is hoping to place his two sons in prominent roles in the government and the party.In his meet with PM Modi, Yediyurappa was flanked by his two sons, BY Vijayendra, BY Raghavendra; grandson Shashidhar Maradi; BJP MLC Leher Singh and two others. People aware of the developments asked why the chief minister chose not to take any officials with him if the agenda was indeed to seek support for developmental works.In the run-up to the 2023 elections, it will be seen how the BJP high command intends to handle the rebels and Yediyurappa, who is credited with building the party in Karnataka over the last four decades. His unceremonious exit in 2012 removed the BJP from power in the only state in the south of the country where the party has been able to gain a firm foothold in recent decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-at-all-true-yediyurappa-on-resignation-rumours-a-day-after-meeting-pm-modi-101626501534728.html

17-07-2021||India||PM Modi gave India a defence policy, no one can challenge our borders now: Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday no one can challenge India's borders and its sovereignty after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's crafted a separate defence policy for India. "There was no separate defence policy before Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Either it was the foreign policy that dictated the defence policy or the foreign policy overlapped with the defence policy. Today, due to this initiative no one can challenge Indian borders and sovereignty," Amit Shah said.In the context of the recent drone attack at Jammu airbase, Amit Shah said that the DRDO and other agencies are coming up with countermeasures. "We have to prepare for use of artificial intelligence and robotics by Pakistan based terror groups. This goes beyond the use of drones for attacks from across the borders," Shah added.Also read | Another Pak drone intrudes Indian space on LoC, fired upon by soldiersHe was speaking during the Border Security Force's (BSF's) investiture ceremony.

17-07-2021||India||'Stain on India's human rights record': UN expert on Stan Swamy's death||A UN human rights expert has said that she is devastated to hear about the demise of Jesuit priest Stan Swamy in custody, saying there is “no reason” for a human rights defender to be denied his rights and that his death will forever “remain a stain” on India's human rights record.Swamy, 84, who was arrested last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, died at a Mumbai hospital on July 5.In a statement issued on Thursday, UN Special Rapporteur Mary Lawlor said Father Swamy’s case should remind all states that human rights defenders and all those detained without sufficient legal basis, should be released.Lawlor said the death in custody of Catholic priest Swamy, “a renowned human rights and social justice advocate for over four decades, will forever remain a stain on India's human rights record.”"There is no excuse, ever, for a human rights defender to be smeared as a terrorist, and no reason they should ever die the way Father Swamy died, accused and detained, and denied his rights,” she said.India has rejected international criticism over the handling of Swamy's case.The Ministry of External Affairs has said the concerned authorities act against violations of law and do not restrain the legitimate exercise of rights.It said India remains committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all its citizens and that the country's democratic polity is complemented by an independent judiciary and a range of national and state-level human rights commissions."Swamy was arrested and detained by the National Investigation Agency following due process under the law. Because of the specific nature of charges against him, his bail applications were rejected by the courts. Authorities in India act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights. All such actions are strictly in accordance with the law,” the MEA said in a statement in New Delhi soon after Swamy's death.It said Swamy was receiving all possible medical attention at a private hospital where he was admitted since May 28. His health and medical treatment were being closely monitored by the courts. He passed away on July 5 following medical complications.Lawlor said Swamy was jailed last October “on fabricated terrorism charges” and had been subjected to harassment and repeated interrogations.“I was devastated to hear that Father Stan, a Jesuit priest who had dedicated much of his life to defending the rights of indigenous peoples and the Adivasi minority, died in custody on July 5, despite many requests for his release as his health deteriorated in prison,” she said.She added that in early November 2020, UN experts joined her in raising his case with the Indian authorities, reminding them of their international human rights obligations. “I now ask again why he wasn’t released, and why he had to die in custody?” she said.Lawlor added that Swamy had been working for decades to protect the rights of Adivasi minority indigenous peoples and the Dalit minority, in particular violations involving forced displacement and illegal land acquisitions.“We know that defenders working on environmental, land or indigenous people's rights are among the most vulnerable to being targeted,” said Lawlor.Lawlor's call has been endorsed by Special Rapporteur on minority issues Fernand de Varennes, Special Rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health Tlaleng Mofokeng.Lawlor of Ireland is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. She is currently an Adjunct Professor of Business and Human Rights in Trinity College Dublin. She was previously Director of the Irish Office of Amnesty International from 1988 to 2000.Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.

She made her debut in Bollywood with Amrit Nahta’s Kissa Kursi Ka in 1978, which was banned during the Emergency in India.“I was pretty green regarding film work. I recall when I saw the film eventually that they hadn’t kept track of continuity – scenes would start in one place and end in another,” Surekha Ji told Scroll adding that she was still with NSD’s repertory company when she was offered the role and that most of the film was shot in New Delhi.She continued working in theatre and films and created a strong mark with her performance in Tamas in 1986. This won her very first National Award for Best Supporting Role. She played the role of Rajjo in the mini-series that was set against the backdrop of India’s partition. This was followed by her 1994 Shyam Benegal movie Mammo in which starred alongside Farida Jalal and Rajit Kapoor, bagging a second National Award.We are deeply saddened by the demise of #NationalAward-winning actress #SurekhaSikri.

Very excited about the win,” she told Zoom TV.The actress refrained to retire despite her failing health in recent years. She even made her OTT debut with her last appearance in Netflix Ghost Stories in 2020.“Retirement is an outdated word left to us by the British… There’s no limit to your work. Do anything you enjoy!

17-07-2021||India||Petrol price jumps 30 paise/litre on Saturday, diesel price remains unchanged||Petrol prices rose by 30 paise per litre on Saturday, the 41st hike in 75 days that made the transport fuel costlier by ₹11.44 a litre since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared.The diesel price remains unchanged as it was spared a hike for the third time since July 2 apart from the 16 paise/litre reduction seen on July 12, the first since May 4. However, several hikes in about two-and-a-half months have made Diesel costlier by ₹9.14 per litre since May.After the latest hike, petrol in Delhi is priced at ₹101.84 per litre, and diesel at ₹89.87. While fuel rates of state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.Petrol prices have already crossed ₹100 per litre in five metros – Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore.The cost of one litre petrol in Mumbai is now ₹107.83 and diesel, ₹97.45. The highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar where pumps are selling petrol at ₹113.21 per litre and diesel at ₹103.15 a litre.Surging international oil rates and the high domestic tax structure are two key reasons for steep rates of petrol and diesel in Indian cities.International oil prices showed extreme volatility since Monday last week (July 5) when Brent crude jumped to $77.16 a barrel, its highest since October 2018 due to supply concerns. However, the recent compromise between two factions of producers’ cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) – over supplies pulled down crude prices by $3.57 or 4.62% to $73.59 a barrel at the end of this week’s close on July 16.While international oil prices impact pump rates of auto fuels because India imports more than 80% crude it processes, steep taxes are the other reason for high rates of petrol and diesel.In Delhi, central levies account for 33.29% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.07%, according to an official data of July 1. On diesel, Central taxes are over 35.66% while state taxes are about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic.Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Delhi, Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Bengaluru, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Kolkata, Salem, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali, Darjeeling, Dantewada and Kohima.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)—control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-price-jumps-30-paise-litre-on-saturday-diesel-prices-remain-unchanged-101626496335807.html

We still have not reached the stage of herd immunity nor do we want to acquire herd immunity through infections."Covid-19 third wave likely by August-end, will be less severe than second: ICMRSpeaking of the third wave of the coronavirus disease, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that it may hit India at the end of August but may not be as deadly as the second wave."There would be a nationwide third wave but that does not mean that it would be as high or as intense as the second wave," Dr Samiran Panda, the head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, told a Delhi-based news organisation.He also said that there could be a variant of the coronavirus that can bypass the acquired immunity and if the new variant doesn't do that it can circulate fast in the population. The Covid-19 third wave could also be brought about by the premature easing of Covid-19 curbs by states, Panda said.Supreme Court raps Uttar Pradesh on Kanwar YatraThe Supreme Court on Friday observed that “the Uttar Pradesh government cannot go ahead with the Kanwar yatra - 100%”, asking the state to either withdraw the decision to allow the religious pilgrimage “in the interest of the health of the citizenry of India”, or invite an order from the court.Citing widespread fears of a third wave of Covid-19, the bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai gave the state government time till Monday to reconsider its decision of allowing the Kanwar yatra due to “compelling religious reasons” and convey it to the court.Vaccine for kids to be available soon: CentreThe Union government told the Delhi high court this week that Covid-19 vaccines for children below the age of 18 years will be available “in the near future” as the clinical trials are on the verge of completion.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was informed by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma that Zydus Cadila, which is developing DNA vaccines for Covid-19, has concluded its clinical trial for children between the ages of 12 and 18 years of age and is awaiting statutory permission.Counting deaths in India is difficultLastly, since Covid-19 has wrecked lives, devastated families, and destroyed livelihoods, an inquiry into the excess deaths due to the pandemic is an important issue that needs redressal.The commonly used methodology of quantifying excess deaths based on India’s civil registry system (CRS), however, is not suited to address this. Any analysis based on it is likely to be misleading. The stark reality of India’s data system is that all deaths are still not accounted for; they are estimated based on demographic surveys.A few critical issues merit consideration. First, historically, CRS is not the source of estimates of deaths at the national, state, or city level for three important reasons. One, not all deaths in India are registered (primarily of women and those residing in rural areas); two, registered deaths are not necessarily domiciliary, that is, place of death could be different from where a person typically resides; and three, deaths, if registered at all, are not reported promptly, a large number of registrations happen after the stipulated 21-day period, and, in some cases, beyond a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-this-week-third-wave-fears-loom-large-kids-to-get-vaccines-soon-101626486875354.html

Live Hindustan, HT's sister publication, reported that Indresh Kumar slammed the Pakistan Prime Minister and said that "Imran Khan is blaming the RSS to cover up his terrorist connections.""Imran Khan's statement is a symbol of the fact that Pakistan is a country of rulers filled with poison since its birth. The people of Pakistan want to live in peace, but the rulers of Pakistan are enemies of their own country. In 1971, this poisonous spirit broke Pakistan and Bangladesh broke away," Indresh Kumar said according to Live Hindustan.According to Live Hindustan, Indresh Kumar also said that Pakistan's ideology is proof that they have divided Indians into two parts. The Talibani ideology of the rulers of Pakistan is the enemy of humanity, peace and brotherhood, he said.Union minister Kaushal Kishore also said terrorism has its roots in Pakistan, according to news agency ANI. "Imran Khan is well aware of terror havens in his country. Blaming RSS has no basis. It is an unnecessary statement by him. The RSS preaches harmony," Kishore told ANI.Their comments came after Imran Khan on Friday evaded questions on Pakistan's role about the Taliban's actions in Afghanistan and sought to put blame on "RSS ideology" for the stalled talks with India amid concerns over its support to cross-border terrorism.#WATCH Pakistan PM Imran Khan answers ANI question, 'can talks and terror go hand in hand?'.

The allegation has been rejected by Pakistan. "Pakistan air force has issued (an) official warning to the Afghan Army and Air Force that any move to dislodge the Taliban from Spin Boldak area will be faced and repelled by the Pakistan Air Force.

The next 100-125 days in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic will be critical, NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said on Friday, adding that people need to remain 'cautious'.Also Read | Next 100 days crucial, says Union health ministry amid Covid 3rd wave fears"The question of the third wave keeps coming back," Paul said during a press conference on Friday. "This is because our population is still very vulnerable. We still have not reached the stage of herd immunity nor do we want to acquire herd immunity through infections."Pointing out the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases around the world, Dr VK Paul said it should serve as a warning sign for India. "Leaving the North and South American regions, all other WHO regions are moving from bad to worse," he said.Spain has registered a 64 per cent rise in the weekly Covid-19 case spike, Dr Paul highlighted. The Netherlands, on the other hand, has seen a 300 per cent rise in the same figure. Elsewhere, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Thailand have also registered an increase in the number of cases, while a 50 per cent spike in cases was also recorded in Africa, he said.Also Read | Rising Delta variant cases make Covid-19 third wave real risk for India: Report"The world is moving towards a third wave and this is a fact," he said, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, has asked us to take this as a red flag and warning... the Prime Minister has given us the target to stall the third wave and it is possible."Paul said that although India has progressed in terms of Covid-19 vaccination and now nearly 50 per cent of the "most vulnerable group" above the age of 45 years is protected, the infection can still spread. "This will also impact mortality and it will come down, but the infection can spread," he said, "We are vulnerable, the virus is still around."India will have to watch out for the signs of a third wave of the pandemic over the next 100-125 days, and people will have to adhere to all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.

17-07-2021||India||5 UPSC civil services aspirants back in race after SC makes an exception||Five civil services aspirants, disallowed by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to appear for the interview-cum-personality test because they were late in submitting their graduation certificates, were granted a special relaxation by the Supreme Court on Friday which said it didn’t want them to suffer for no fault of theirs.The aspirants - four of the five had approached the top court - told a two-judge bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna that they missed the November 11, 2020 deadline to submit their graduate certificate because their results were declared a month later due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The four aspirants told the court that their university examinations were conducted in August 2019 but the results came only in December 2020 due to the intervening Covid-19 pandemic. UPSC declined to accept the documents but allowed them to appear for the Mains examination held in January 2021 as they had cleared the preliminary screening testing held earlier.Two months later, they were informed that their candidature was cancelled as the certificates were not filed on time.UPSC told the court during arguments that it allowed 12 candidates (including the petitioners) who were similarly placed to take the Mains examination but only five cleared. Of them, four petitioned to the court.The public services recruiter told the court that the commission was bound to act as per rules as the cut-off date to submit documents is sacrosanct.The two-judge bench invoked the extraordinary powers vested in the Supreme Court under Article 142 that allows the court to pass any order necessary to do “complete justice” in any case but made it clear that this verdict should not be treated as a precedent.“Considering the piquant situation due to Covid-19 and for reasons beyond their control in as much as the University could not declare results till December 2020, coupled with the fact that they were permitted to appear in the Mains examination, it will be inequitable at this stage to deny them the opportunity to continue with the UPSC examination,” the judges said.The bench directed UPSC to consider even the fifth candidate who did not approach the court to face the interview board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-upsc-civil-services-aspirants-back-in-race-after-sc-makes-an-exception-101626467414512.html
17-07-2021||India||BJP looks to downplay ‘Kongu Nadu’ controversy||Chennai: The BJP formally put to rest a controversy on ‘Kongu Nadu’ by stating that they have no plans to bifurcate Tamil Nadu. Union Minister of State and outgoing Tamil Nadu BJP chief L Murugan on Friday said that it was a “clerical mistake”. The controversy began after the party had released profiles of newly inducted union ministers and it referred to Murugan as hailing from ‘Kongu Nadu, Tamil Nadu’. “It is a clerical mistake. There is no need to talk about the issue anymore. It is over,” Murugan said after K Annamalai assumed charge as the new president of BJP in Tamil Nadu.Murugan and Annamalai said that the BJP does not have plans to bifurcate Tamil Nadu and there is no such demand. “The term ‘Kongu Nadu’ was used as a social identity for Murugan ji,” Annamalai said. Kongu is a colloquial term for the western region of Tamil Nadu with seven districts, including Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruppur which is considered the citadel of the AIADMK and their ally the BJP has a considerable support base here compared to its unpopularity elsewhere in the state. The AIADMK-PMK-BJP combine won 33 of the total 50 seats in the region while the DMK alliance almost every other region of the state. BJP’s executive Coimbatore north district unit on Sunday passed a resolution urging the Centre to create a separate state of Kongu Nadu by reorganising Tamil Nadu. The new BJP chief, Annamalai, said that he has sought an explanation from office bearers in Coimbatore. Annamalai, a former Karnataka IPS cadre joined the party only in August 2020 and his body of work as a police officer and backing from senior BJP leaders such as BL Santosh paved the way for him to occupy this post at the age of 37. On Friday, he reiterated that the BJP will continue to support NEET which DMK is seeking to abolish. However, the party will support Tamil Nadu’s stance in opposing the Mekedatu dam project though BJP is in power in Karnataka and in the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-looks-to-downplay-kongu-nadu-controversy-101626466093743.html

17-07-2021||India||CMs from southern states ask Modi for more vaccines||Chennai/Bengaluru/Thiruvananthapuram: Chief ministers of the southern states urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday for an increase in vaccine supply to ensure maximum protection to people before a third wave of Covid-19 strikes.Interacting with the PM through a video-conferencing, the chief ministers briefed him about the steps being taken to check the spread of coronavirus even though cases were on the rise.In a video interaction with chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala, where many districts have been reporting a high number of cases, Modi said the country stands at a point in its battle with the pandemic where apprehensions about a third wave are being expressed.These states have accounted for 80% of new Covid-19 cases last week and 84% of deaths, the PM noted in his closing remarks, specifically mentioning the rise in infections in Kerala and Maharashtra as a matter of grave concern for the country. A similar trend was witnessed in January and February before the second wave started, he said. “It’s very important that states with a rising number of cases take proactive measures to rule out any possibility of a third wave,” Modi said.The PM emphasised an effective trace, track and vaccination methodology, asking states to strengthen micro-containment zone strategy, which has helped some states such as Assam to control Covid without enforcing a lockdown. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said Covid-19 situation in the state is under control. “In Kerala the second wave started very late and at one point its test positivity rate went up to 30%, but now it is around 10%,” he said, adding the state’s mortality rate remained the lowest in the country at 0.48%.Vijayan said the state has given first dose of vaccination to 11.7 million people and both the doses to 4.41 million, maintaining zero vaccine wastage. The state has a population of 30.46 million. The Kerala CM sought six million more doses to cover a major portion of the population. Kerala has been contributing the highest number of Covid cases among all states since June 15. On Thursday, it reported 13,773 new cases, almost one-fourth of national total of 41,806, according to the state health ministry data. Its test positivity rate was 10.95% whereas the national average was below 3%. The virus has shown no sign of abating in Kerala with new daily cases hovering around 10,000 since March.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said the state managed “reasonably well” in fighting against the pandemic despite lack of modern medical facilities as in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. He said the newly set up village/ward secretariats system has played a key role in effective containment of Covid. “12 fever surveys have helped in containing the spread of the virus.”The CM said that of 17,71,580 doses given to private hospitals, only 4,20,209 have been used in June. He requested the Prime Minister to allot the remaining stocks in private hospitals to the government, so that the vaccination process will be expedited.Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa urged the PM to provide at least 10.5 million doses of Covid vaccine to the state every month, saying the Covid cases in Karnataka have declined to 1,900 a day and in Bengaluru to about 400 cases a day.Stating that Karnataka has so far received 20.62 million vaccines, the chief minister requested the Prime Minister to provide 10.5 million doses of the vaccine with a targeted 500,000 doses every day, a government statement said. Yediyurappa also told Modi that the district authorities have been authorised to impose sanctions depending on the positivity rate of Covid-19, the number of cases and the opinion of the Technical Advisory Committee. He also informed the PM about steps being taken to deal with the anticipated third wave.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin sought 10 million vaccine doses as a special case and urged the PM to exempt all goods needed for Covid management from the goods and services tax (GST). He also said the Centre should reconsider its decision to conduct national-level exams like the NEET, as it may lead to virus spread. “The demand for vaccines has tremendously increased in Tamil Nadu,” Stalin said. “However, when compared with other states, the allocation for our state is very less. To handle this tough situation, I had requested a special allocation of one crore vaccine doses. I look forward to your support in this important issue,” he told Modi. Stalin said Tamil Nadu has reduced vaccine wastage from 6% to 0%.On July 13, Stalin had said that till July 8, Tamil Nadu received 29,18,110 vaccine doses from the Centre for people in the 18-44 years bracket and 1,30,08,440 for those above 45 years. “The allocation was very inadequate and TN did not receive vaccines proportionate to its population,” Stalin had said in a letter to Modi.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cms-from-southern-states-ask-modi-for-more-vaccines-101626465733756.html
17-07-2021||India||Kerala continues to report high caseload||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala recorded a high Covid-19 caseload of 13,750 cases on Friday with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 10.55%, according to the data released by the state health ministry. In last 24 hours, total number of cases in the country was 38,949 with a TPR below 3%, which shows the southern state contributed more than 30% of total cases. At least six districts reported more than 1,000 new cases on Friday. Among 542 deaths, Kerala’s share was 130. The state’s active case pool, which went down to below one lakh last month, has been steadily rising for past three weeks and on Friday it stood at 121,944. Similarly new cases continue to show a rising trend in many northern districts triggering a fresh fear that there can be resurgence in cases even as the second wave shows slow plateauing. Though pressure on the health system has been eased considerably, every day the state is recording an average of 100 fatalities, according to records. The ICU admissions and critically ill patients, in both public and private hospitals, remained more or less unchanged in last two weeks. There are 724 patients that require ventilator support, according to health ministry data. Though the state put a target to conduct 3.75 lakh tests in two days, it failed to cross 2.50 lakh. Many experts have blamed its poor testing rate and obsession to cheap antigen tests for the present state. However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan rejected these contentions and said the situation is well under control. The state has administered the first dose of vaccination to 1.17 crore people and 44.18 lakh got both doses (state population is 3.46 crore). The CM sought 60 lakh more doses to cover a major portion of the population and he also cited zero wastage of the vaccine in the state. “The second wave started in the state very late. It is a fact that daily caseload and active cases are high but no need to panic. Our hospitals are not crowded and there is no shortage of oxygen also,” he said, adding the situation will stabilise by July end. But many experts complained that the government was going ahead with the advice of bureaucrats and it often ignored public health experts and medical bodies like IMA. Meanwhile, the government has eased restrictions in view of upcoming Eid-ul-Adha (Bakrid). In Kozhikode, many shopkeepers hit the street on Wednesday protesting severe restrictions on them and threatened to flout regulations. following which the CM held talks with them and eased some curbs. They can open shops this Sunday and shopping hours have been extended till 8pm. The CM also promised more relaxations in coming days, traders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-continues-to-report-high-caseload-101626465673743.html
17-07-2021||India||Banks can’t deny educational loans to students citing parents’ liabilities: HC||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala high court on Thursday said that banks cannot deny educational loans to students citing liabilities of their parents and directed a national bank to disburse the loan applied by a meritorious student. While giving a direction to the Indian Bank in this regard, the single bench of Justice PB Suresh Kumar observed that the very purpose of the educational loan is to ensure that a meritorious student cannot be deprived of an opportunity to higher education on the ground that he/she does not have enough resources for the same. The petitioner, a second-year student of Bachelor of Ayuveda Medicine and Surgery, approached the court after her loan request was turned down by the bank. In her petition, she contended that she secured admission through the centralised seat allotment process of the state in 2019 on the basis of her rank in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test. She said since her family could not raise the full amount of course, she and her father approached the banks for an educational loan of ₹7,50,000 for which no collateral security is needed as per the educational loan scheme. However, theIndian Bank denied her loan, saying it was not satisfied with the economic background of her parents. Doing a small-time business, her father’s shop was closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and he was not earning enough, the bank reportedly told her as she mentioned it in her plea. The court said such attitude will defeat the very purpose of the educational loan scheme. “The object of all educational loans formulated by banks in accordance with RBI (Reserve Bank of India) guidelines is to ensure that a meritorious student shall not be deprived of the opportunity to pursue higher education merely on the ground that he/she doesn’t have sources for the same,” the court observed. If the contentions of the bank are accepted, it would defeat the object and purpose of the scheme, the cout said while directing the bank to disburse loan to the meritorious student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-can-t-deny-educational-loans-to-students-citing-parents-liabilities-hc-101626465553764.html

17-07-2021||India||BSY meets PM in Delhi amid buzz over leadership change||Bengaluru Chief minister BS Yediyurappa who is on a two-day visit to Delhi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. He said that the meeting was largely regarding the development works in the state.“I requested the PM to facilitate for early implementation of some state works. He has agreed for all,” he told media persons. Yediyurappa is expected to meet senior ministers of the union government and the national leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). After landing in Delhi, Yediyurappa said that he would meet the Prime Minister and other newly sworn in ministers from Karnataka and discuss with them the development works of the state including the construction of the contentious Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project. At around 7.30 pm, the chief minister spoke to reporters again where he said that the newly sworn in ministers from the state will meet him at dinner. When questioned, if there was any discussion on leadership change, Yediyurappa refrained from giving a straight answer. “I don’t know, you tell me,” he said. The chief minister’s visit comes at a time when the cloud of uncertainty looms large over his continuing in his post for the remainder of the two-year term. Before the meeting with the Prime Minister, Yediyurappa told reporters that he would meet union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and other prominent leaders of the party. There is also speculation that Yediyurappa would seek the Centre’s blessing for a cabinet reshuffle to accommodate the rebels to quell any dissent. It remains to be seen which way the BJP high command will sway when it comes to Yediyurappa, who almost single handedly built the party over the last four decades. His unceremonious exit in 2012 removed the BJP from power in the only state in the south of the country where the saffron outfit has been able to make some inroads in recent decades. People aware of the developments said that the chief minister meeting the Prime Minister in the guise of appraising the latter on the Mekedatu project and developmental works cannot be taken at face value. “In my experience, a chief minister would meet the minister in-charge, the party leadership and others but not the Prime Minister directly,” said the BJP legislator from Karnataka, requesting anonymity. He added that there may be no telling as to when the BJP will replace Yedyurappa but this meeting in Delhi is definitely the “a step” towards it. “They will start tightening everything from now,” he added. Interestingly, Yediyurappa was accompanied by his two sons (BY Vijayendra, BY Raghavendra), grandson (Shashidhar Maradi), BJP MLC Leher Singh and two others. People aware of the developments questioned why the chief minister chose not to take any officials with him, if the agenda was indeed to seek the support for developmental works. Though it remains to be seen when Yediyurappa will be asked to step down, his stay on the chair threatens to dent the party’s chances in the 2023 assembly elections. Another person aware of the developments said that the visit to Delhi is most likely to set the terms of a replacement, if the two sides do reach a deal amicably. “There is no leadership change in Karnataka and Yediyurappa will continue. Yediyurappa is visiting Delhi to meet the Prime Minister and home minister, party president and other central ministers, especially the irrigation minister. Cauvery river issue is a major issue,”R Ashok, Karnataka’s minister for revenue and a person regarded as a member of Yediyurappa’s inner circles said on Friday. Just two days ago, union Jal Shakthi minister, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat visited Karnataka and met Yediyurappa and all senior ministers of the state where he said that justice will be done to the southern state in the Mekedatu issue. Yediyurappa has made it clear that he would like to remain in power till 2023 and, people aware of the developments said that the 78-year-old is hoping to placate his two sons in prominent roles in the government and party. Vijayendra is the state BJP vice president and Raghavendra is the MP from Shivamogga, the chief minister’s home state. Yediyurappa has at least once before said that Vijayendra would contest the 2023 assembly elections as a way to show that he would be the “heir apparent” of the Lingayat community and the BJP in Karnataka. Raghavendra was among the probables to be inducted in Modi’s cabinet expansion but the centre favoured Shobha Karandlaje, another close associate of Yediyurappa, which was a strategy to keep the damage to a minimal if the chief minister does choose to do a repeat of his 2012 exit. Adding to the similarities from a decade ago, Yediyurappa and his family continue to see rising charges of corruption. There have been at least three major cases against the chief minister and his family in the last one month and several more against ministers and legislators of his party. Yediyurappa has sought to take refuge behind the Lingayat community, believed to be the single largest group in the state who have backed the former since the turn of the century. However, leaders like Basanagouda Yatnal among others have now successfully bracketed Yediyurappa as a person from one of the sub-sects of the Lingayats and not of the entire community. “There is no reason to complain because they have made all concessions for Yediyurappa. He left the party and came back as chief minister which is a first. He is over the 75-years age limit and there is non-performance,” said one senior BJP leader, requesting not to be named. Yediyurappa’s confidence, if any, comes from the fact that the BJP in Karnataka does not have a credible replacement, which people aware of the developments said, is not true since the saffron outfit will abide by the person nominated by the central leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-meets-pm-in-delhi-amid-buzz-over-leadership-change-101626465193719.html
17-07-2021||India||16 dead in suspected hooch tragedy in Bihar: Police||Bettiah: At least 16 people have died since Wednesday in Bihar’s West Champaran district after allegedly consuming spurious liquor, police said on Friday. Of the total, eight of them died on Friday alone. The deceased belonged to Deurawa, Jogiya and Bagahi villages, district magistrate Kundan Kumar said.At least five persons, including two women, have been picked up for interrogation and one person has been arrested, police added. The sale and consumption of liquor are banned in the state since 2016.“In the course of investigation, family members of four of the deceased accepted the death occurred owing to the consumption of spurious liquor. However, family members of four of the deceased denied any liquor consumption. They did not furnish any medical documents about ailments either,” a release by West Champaran district administration read.Police on Thursday registered a case, in which two persons, identified as Thug Shah and Suresh Shah, were named.“One of the accused, Thug Shah’s son Sumit, has been arrested while two local chowkidars have been suspended,” the statement added. Bagaha SP Kiran Kumar Gorakh Jadhav, who is currently in-charge of Bettiah police station, said: “Their interrogation is underway. We have also deployed a dog squad for search operations and raids are being conducted. No seizure has been made as of yet.” “One of those who died in Bagahi village was on dialysis while the other at Deurawa village died following a heart attack,” Kumar said, adding: “The cause of the deaths could not be ascertained as the last rites were already performed. The matter is under investigation.” Lalan Mohan Prasad, deputy inspector general of police (DIG), Champaran range, said: “We took statements from about 40 people, including the family members of those who died, but all of them denied any consumption of liquor. However, one of the two persons undergoing treatment confessed to having been served liquor.” Villagers at Deurawa admitted that the sale and consumption of liquor was rampant in the area. “My brother fell sick after consuming liquor which is being openly sold despite prohibition,” Bhola, a relative of one Mumtaz Ansari who confessed to have consuming liquor before falling ill, said. The incident evoked a sharp reaction from the opposition with Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad tweeting: “In Bihar, thousands of people are dying every year due to (consumption of) spurious liquor under good governance. Under the garb of prohibition, the ruling party is running a parallel illegal economy of ₹20,000 crore in Bihar.” Birendra Gupta, CPI-ML (L) legislator from Sikta assembly seat, termed the deaths as “state-sponsored” and demanded a compensation of ₹4 lakh for kin of each deceased.“The family members of the deceased are under pressure. They had earlier accepted that the deaths had occured due to consumption of illicit liquor,” Gupta, who visited the kin of the deceased, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-dead-in-suspected-hooch-tragedy-in-bihar-police-101626465074436.html
17-07-2021||India||Govt prepares House agenda with focus on Covid handling||New Delhi : The government is prepared to discuss its management of Covid-19, a a key demand of the opposition parties, in the upcoming monsoon session of parliament. A senior minister who asked not to be named said the government is confident of replying to all questions of the opposition related to Covid19. The opposition wants raise issues ranging from deficiencies in the healthcare system that were exposed during the second wave of the Covid pandemic, to the slow pace of vaccination during the monsoon session of Parliament beginning Monday. The government also has a busy legislative agenda : six ordinances, nine pending bills and as at least 15 new bills. According to a person aware of the details who asked not to be named, the key bills that the government will try to push are those on DNA technology, the rights of senior citizens, the National Institute of Food Technology, and tribunal reforms. The government hopes to pass the Marine Aid and Navigation bill, Juvenile Justice Amendment bill, Assisted Reproductive Technology bill during the session. While the government wants smooth functioning of both the houses to enable the passage of key bills, it is also prepared for a stormy session. The opposition has accused the government of being unprepared for the second wave of the pandemic, and blamed it for a botched vaccination strategy. The government has decided to take on the opposition “with facts and figures” said a BJP leader on condition of anonymity. “We are prepared to have a discussion on the second wave of the Covid pandemic. Let the opposition ask questions; we have all the answers. We have data to prove how India quickly got its act together to provide the essential health care and save lives. There was a 14 to 16 day period when there were some shortages but we overcame the problem within a short time,” this person added. On the opposition’s charge that the pace of vaccination is slow and the government did not take timely steps to procure vaccines, this leader said: “No country in the world can administer vaccines in a single day. India has administered more dozes than America,” the leader said.India has vaccinated 391 million people till Friday. Vaccine supply has triggered a row between some states and the union government. At least six states, Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, Odisha have complained of scarcity of vaccines and said this has forced them to close some vaccination centres. Union health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday said the states were creating panic and that they were aware of the schedule and the number of vaccine doses being supplied to them. The opposition is also gearing to corner the government on the issue of inflation, especially the rise in fuel and cooking oil and gas prices.CPI data shows consumer price inflation at 6.26% and petrol price in Delhi has spiraled to ₹101.54 currently from ₹90.40 on May 2. On Friday, the newly appointed Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal called on several opposition leaders including former PM Manmohan Singh to discuss smooth functioning of the house. Goyal also met Congress leader Anand Sharma and NCP leader Sharad Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-prepares-house-agenda-with-focus-on-covid-handling-101626464954284.html
17-07-2021||India||TMC plans to bring parties opposed to NDA, Cong on board for House session||New Delhi: The Trinamool Congress (TMC), the second-largest Opposition force in Parliament after the Congress, is looking at the possibility of stitching a sub-group within the Opposition camp with parties that are opposed to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) but also not at ease with the Congress, people familiar with the matter said.The plan, prompted in part by the results of the last round of assembly elections in which West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee succeeded in containing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), could cast a shadow on the Opposition’s floor management and the unity of the non-NDA parties during Parliament’s monsoon session starting July 19.The TMC is well placed to work closely with parties from the anti-Congress platform such as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) which have a working relationship with the Trinamool. The West-Bengal based party also hopes to bring Samajwadi Party (SP) in this sub-group since Akhilesh Yadav’s outfit might be averse to follow the Congress agenda ahead of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.“The assembly election has changed many equations. We want to set the agenda of the Opposition in this session,” said a senior Trinamool leader on Friday, “The other problem for the Congress is they don’t have leaders who can reach out to parties such as Akali Dal, SP or AAP. So, someone will have to bring these parties to a common platform and no one better than Trinamool can do that”.The aggressive plan will also sync with Mamata Banerjee’s first visit to Delhi after her third straight victory in the recent assembly election. Banerjee will be in Delhi for five days and Trinamool leaders said she would also visit Parliament for “at least two days”. Banerjee was a seven-term MP from West Bengal before she left Parliament in 2011.The Trinamool and the Congress also appear to differ on the agenda for the Opposition. While the Congress is keen to raise the Rafale issue after the appointment of a French judge to probe into suspected “corruption and favouritism” in the ₹59,000 crore deal for 36 fighter jets, Trinamool’s prime pick is price rise and farm bills.On July 14, the Congress decided to raise a demand for debates on price rise, Rafale and the government’s management of the Covid pandemic.But the larger political brinkmanship would centre around Trinamool’s ambition to grab a space in dictating the Opposition’s floor management in Parliament.After the Congress failed to win any state in the latest round of assembly election and Trinamool positioning itself as the party that halted BJP in the polls, the parliamentary strategy will also be a part of the larger plan ahead of the 2024 election.TMC general secretary and the chief minister’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, last month confirmed that the party intended to expand its footprint outside Bengal, insisting that a concrete plan was in the offing. “This attempt to make TMC a national party will be very different from our previous endeavours,” Banerjee said at a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-plans-to-bring-parties-opposed-to-nda-cong-on-board-for-house-session-101626464953735.html
17-07-2021||India||‘Tolerance need of time’: Jamia shooter denied bail||A Gurugram court on Thursday dismissed the bail plea of 19-year-old Gopal Sharma, who was arrested on July 12 for making provocative comments against Muslims at a mahapanchayat in Pataudi on July 4.The civil judge of Pataudi, Mohd. Sageer, observed that the rights of the accused to his personal liberty could not be preferred against the right of the society to live peacefully in communal harmony.“The act of the accused that is hate speech instigating abduction and the killing of girls and persons of a particular religious community is itself a form of violence and such people and their inflammatory speeches are obstacles to the growth of a true democratic spirit,” the court said.It added: “Religious tolerance is the need of the time and not intolerance. It is necessary for individuals within the society to get along, especially when a variety of cultures and the people with different religious beliefs live in one community or nation.”Gopal earlier grabbed headlines when he brandished a gun during an anti-CAA protest, even firing at protesters in Delhi’s Jamia area in January last year.Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, counsel for Sharma, said his client has been made a scapegoat in this case. “My client attended the mahapanchayat but did not organise it. Those who did had not even taken permission for the same but no action was taken against them. Before he addressed the crowd, there were several other orators who used very offensive language and hate speech but only my client was booked and arrested. He has no political connection and is not even powerful unlike others.”The counsel argued that Sharma got carried away by the charged atmosphere and said what he did.The counsel for the state, however, argued that Sharma voluntarily participated in the event and can be seen in the video clip instigating the mob in the name of religion. “Sharma can interfere in a free and fair investigation and can threaten and put pressure upon the complainant and other witnesses, even flee from the trial if bail is granted,” said counsel SP Gothwal.“These kinds of incidents have become very common nowadays and the common man is under constant threat of violence in the name of religion, caste, etc. This incident cannot be seen only with respect to a young man’s religious intolerance, rather it is far more serious and has dangerous hidden consequences. If such people are allowed to move freely and to indulge in such kinds of activities, the very existence of communal harmony may be disturbed and that will give a wrong message that these types of acts are acceptable in society,” the court said.Sharma was arrested a week after the mahapanchayat following a complaint from a resident of Jamalpur village in Gurugram.

It is too much that prisoners have to wait even after the Supreme Court has granted bail as jails are insisting on the bail order to come by post,” said the three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana.To ensure “fast” and “secure” communication about bail orders, the bench proposed using a new tool that is under consideration of the top court.The bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and AS Bopanna, said: “The scheme being proposed is called ‘Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records’ (FASTER). We are looking at communicating the bail orders passed by us directly to the jail authorities.”Details of the proposed new channel of communication were not immediately available.The bench also directed the secretary general of the Supreme Court to prepare a report within two weeks after taking inputs from solicitor general Tushar Mehta, and court-appointed amicus curiae senior advocate Dushyant Dave, along with data from states.“If this scheme goes through, our orders can be securely transmitted,” the bench said. The court is keen on implementing the scheme within a month, CJI Ramana added.While hearing the suo motu petition on Friday, CJI Ramana referred to the July 8 order of the court.A bench of justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian directed prison authorities of the Agra Central Jail to release 13 convicts who were found to be juveniles at the time that the crime was committed. The jail authorities in Agra waited till the bail order arrived by post and released the convicts — who had already served 14 to 22 years in prison — on the night of July 12.Informed about this delay by the convicts’ advocate Rishi Malholtra, the top court on July 13 agreed to take up the matter on the administrative side for passing necessary directions, and on the same day, registered the suo motu (on its own) petition on the instruction of the chief justice.Attorney general KK Venugopal agreed with the court’s view and said that the insistence on receiving bail orders by post was “wrong and very bad”.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, pointed out at the hearing that there was a possibility that prisoners may obtain fake bail orders to secure their release.But “if the jail authorities can verify it (order) from the official website of the court, there should be no concern over its authenticity,” Mehta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-jail-admin-over-delay-in-releasing-convicts-after-bail-101626464713739.html

Danish Siddiqui, a Pulitzer Prize winner, was killed in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar on Thursday while on a reporting assignment embedded with Afghan security forces. He was covering clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters near a border crossing with Pakistan in Spin Boldak. Photos: Photojournalist Danish Siddiqui’s last work from Kandahar, AfghanistanWhile address the UN Security Council meeting in New York with the theme “Protection of civilians in armed conflict – preserving humanitarian space”, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla recalled the long history of differentiating between combatants and civilians in India and other countries around the world. “In this regard we condemn the killing of an Indian photo-journalist, Danish Siddiqui, while he was on a reporting assignment in Kandahar in Afghanistan yesterday. I extend our sincerest condolences to his bereaved family,” Shringla said.Harsh Shringla said the world is currently grappling with a range of humanitarian crises, most of them caused by armed conflicts. These crises have severely impacted millions of civilians and the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation, he said. While international humanitarian law has its genesis in the recent past, civilisations have developed rules of warfare to protect non-combatants and civilians and India has followed the path of Dharma or righteous conduct and provided refuge to persecuted people over the centuries, he said.“Dharma-based norms” for armed conflict in ancient India were based on humanitarian norms and there were many rules protecting civilians during conflict,” Shringla said. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani too condoled Siddiqui’s death in a message posted on Facebook. “I am deeply saddened with the shocking reports that Reuters photo-journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in Kandahar,” he said. “While I extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr Siddiqui’s family and also to our media family, I reiterate my government’s unwavering commitment to freedom of speech and protection of free media and journalists,” he added. Siddiqui was part of a Reuters team that won a Pulitzer for its coverage of the Rohingya refugee crisis. He also won praise for his images of communal violence in northeast Delhi in 2020 and the devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-unsc-meet-harsh-shringla-condemns-killing-of-journalist-danish-siddiqui-101626463034306.html
17-07-2021||India||Permanent commission: Army seeks clarification from SC over women officers||The Indian Army has sought a clarification from the Supreme Court on the grant of permanent commission to women short service commission officers (WSSCO) pointing out that around 14% of them failed one criteria for this -- and whether an apex court ruling of March meant permanent commissions had to be granted irrespective of the criteria being met.The issue involves 72 of 514 women short service commission officers (WSSCO). The Selection Board that considered their case in September 2020 found serious charges of indiscipline, forgery, disobedience and unbecoming conduct as an officer -- and on this basis denied them permanent commission.Under a Supreme Court order of March 25, 2021, Army was directed to positively grant permanent commission to all such women short service commission officers (WSSCO) who obtained 60 per cent marks, subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance. In all, 514 women officers met this rule, of which 442 were declared “fit” for permanent commission (PC) and 72 declared “unfit”.The charges against the 72 officers are serious and have been disclosed for the first time by the army despite the findings being available when the top court decided the case in March. These include “discipline, disobedience of orders, lapses in government procurement, forging medical documents, poor work ethics, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct, poor performance in courses, etc.”As per the army policy, laid out on September 30, 1983 and February 24, 2012, short service commission officers have to fulfil the twin criteria of minimum cut-off grade of 60% in the assessment and a “fit” declaration by the Selection Board. In the past, this rule has been uniformly applied to all short service commission officers.As the SC order of March 25 comes in the way of the army rejecting them, Colonel Sachidananda Prabhu, the Colonel Military Secretary (Legal) of the Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Army) has filed an application in the top court seeking clarification.The application said: “To avoid any ambiguity and misinterpretation, the Applicants seek clarification as to whether the 72 women officers who have scored 60% grade but are graded “unfit” for grant of Permanent Commission by the Selection Board are eligible for grant of Permanent Commission.”The March judgment of the court said: “All women officers who have fulfilled the cut-off grade of 60 per cent in the Special No 5 Selection Board held in September 2020 shall be entitled to the grant of PC, subject to their meeting the medical criteria prescribed by the General Instructions dated 1 August 2020 and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance.” The court also set a three-month deadline to complete this exercise. In its application the army has cited the pandemic and also sought additional time off two months to comply with the judgment.Women officers have claimed the finding of the Selection Board to be “ambiguous” and one that “reeks of vendetta”. In their reply to the army’s application filed on Wednesday, they said: “Charges like lapses in government procurement and forging medical documents are grave offences for which an officer faces inquiry and may be dismissed from service.” The officers found it strange that none of them were warned by the army for committing such grave offences. “This is highly misplaced, and it gives an impression of another well framed excuse by respondents for not granting PC to Women Officers on a very untenable ground,” the lady officers said.Interestingly, the army application also seeks to repair the damage caused by the Supreme Court in accusing the Army of gender discrimination. It has urged the top court to expunge remarks of “systemic discrimination” against WSSCOs from its March 25 judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-commission-army-seeks-clarification-from-sc-over-women-officers-101626461114688.html

The total orders are with both the companies -- Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) that manufactures Covishield and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech which makes Covaxin -- though a break-up of doses was not given.“For Moderna’s vaccine, contractual specifics are currently being worked out as there is a certain process that needs to be duly followed. The discussions have not concluded as yet...,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog on Friday, during media briefing on Covid-19 updates.“WHO warning is a global warning for the world...it is in our hands to prevent the country from seeing the third wave....

17-07-2021||India||Rajnath holds ‘informal’ talks on border situation with Sharad Pawar, AK Antony||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday held an “informal” interaction with Congress leader AK Antony and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on the border situation with China and Pakistan, and also the current scenario in Afghanistan.The Union minister, HT has learnt, invited the two former defence ministers to South Block where the meeting lasted for 75 minutes. The meeting was also attended by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Gen MM Naravane.“There was nothing political about it, it was all very informal,” a person familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity. There was no formal statement on the meeting from either side.While Antony served as defence minister in the Congress-led UPA government from 2006 till 2014, Pawar held the post in the Narasimha Rao government from 1991 to 1993.The meeting took place ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament which is slated to begin from July 19. The Congress is planning to corner the government over the border row with China in the House.“The CDS and COAS did a briefing on both Pakistan and China. The two former ministers had questions that were clarified. The government put its point of view forward,” the person cited above said.HT has learnt that while talks on the Afghanistan situation were not part of the agenda, it did feature in the meeting in the wake of the killing of an Indian photojournalist while covering the region’s escalating conflict with the Taliban in Kandahar on Friday. When asked if there were any differences of opinion, the person cited above said: “It was an exchange of views and friendly in nature.” There was no response from the offices of either the current or the former defence ministers. A Congress leader, however, said that this was an old tradition that was prevalent during the Vajpayee regime.“This is a welcome step... for the minister to meet his predecessors, at a time when national security issues almost never get discussed in Parliament. Covid has taken its toll too with Parliament being in stasis. One presumes that the defence minister will apprise former ministers like Mr Antony and Sharad Pawar and Mulayam Singh et al about the current challenges, especially on Ladakh and China. It would be desirable if Arun Singh joins, he is the minister archivist for the MoD,” Uday Bhaskar, former director of IDSA, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-holds-informal-talks-on-border-situation-with-pawar-antony-101626460513552.html
17-07-2021||India||Party will suffer if Sidhu is made state unit chief: Captain to Sonia||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh wrote to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday and expressed displeasure at the party’s handling of infighting in the state unit, said people aware of developments, signalling an escalation in the crisis engulfing the party months before polls.The letter by an upset chief minister also mentioned resentment brewing in the state unit, and cautioned that if his rival and trenchant critic, Navjot Singh Sidhu, is appointed Punjab Congress chief, it could lead to a split in the party, said the people quoted above.Singh’s letter was delivered to the Congress president at her 10, Janpath residence in Delhi before she met cricketer-turned-politician Sidhu on Friday afternoon, the people added.The letter came after two days of meetings and intense speculation of rapprochement between the rival factions in Punjab Congress – party leaders had on Thursday said that broad contours of a revamp plan had been drafted - and indicated that the crisis, which first surfaced in May, was far from resolution.It marks a personal shift in strategy by Singh, who until now had not responded to Sidhu’s public attacks, and met twice with a party panel set up to defuse the tension. A member of that panel, party general secretary Harish Rawat, will meet Singh on Saturday in Chandigarh.The two-time chief minister’s missive delivered by his officer on special duty (OSD-Delhi) Narender Bhambri also indicated that Singh, who met two dozen ministers, MPs and MLAs loyal to him in last 48 hours, dug in his heels.On Thursday, the party cleared the air about Singh’s role, saying he will continue as chief minister and lead the party in the next elections, scheduled in early 2022. The 79-year-old leader met Gandhi on July 6.Officially, Gandhi is yet to take a call on the role of Sidhu, around whom the opposition to Singh has coalesced and grown in recent months. But there has been a lot of talk that Sidhu may be appointed the next Punjab Congress chief, overriding Singh’s strong objections.It is these speculations that prompted Singh to write the strongly worded letter, said the people quoted in the first instance.In the letter, Singh conveyed his displeasure over reports of Sidhu’s “impending appointment” as the state unit chief. He told Gandhi that senior leaders and traditional Congressmen would object to any such move and even cautioned the central leadership about the likelihood of a split in the party in such an eventuality.Separately, he also raised questions over Sidhu’s style of working.Sidhu, who quit the state cabinet after the chief minister changed his portfolio in 2019, wants to head Punjab’s Congress unit – a position that will give him significant powers ahead of the assembly elections.But Singh is strongly opposed to having Sidhu, a Jat Sikh like him, in the top party position in the state and has repeatedly advocated for a Hindu face for the position.Sidhu, who joined the Congress in 2017, appears to be close to former party president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, both of whom he met on June 30.Tensions between Singh and Sidhu have simmered since 2019 but the bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu and some leaders publicly accused Singh of allowing corruption, prompting the Congress to set up the three-member panel.The panel met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to Gandhi on June 10. The panel recommended that Singh retain charge but Sidhu be accommodated in a key role. There has been little public progress since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-will-suffer-if-sidhu-is-made-punjab-unit-chief-captain-to-sonia-101626460273551.html
17-07-2021||India||Sidhu meets Sonia amid buzz of revamp in Punjab||Chandigarh: Former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu met Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday amid rising tensions in the party over the cricketer-turned-politician’s factional fight with chief minister Amarinder Singh. The meeting at Gandhi’s Delhi residence was also attended by party leader Rahul Gandhi. It came after days of talk – with no official announcement – that Sidhu could be appointed the state unit chief overriding objections by Singh. But there was no official word on the outcome of the hour-long meeting. “I had come to submit my report on Punjab to the Congress chief. As soon as any decision is taken by the party president, I will share the details,” said Congress general secretary in-charge of Punjab, Harish Rawat, who also attended the meeting. He refused to give any direct answer to a query about the state Congress chief’s appointment. This was the first time Sidhu met Sonia Gandhi since the row erupted in the Punjab Congress in May. He previously met Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on June 30.Singh is bitterly opposed to Sidhu’s elevation as party chief and has publicly advocated for a Hindu face for the post. On Friday, Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari tweeted demographic details of the state, mentioning that Sikhs form 57.75% of the population and Hindus constitute 38.49%. “Punjab is both progressive and secular, but balancing social interest groups is the key. Equality is the foundation of social justice!” Tewari tweeted, tagging the Congress and Rawat.His party colleagues, Anish Sidana and Pawan Dewan, were more direct. Sidana, a former member of the Kandi Area Development Board, said Hindus felt neglected. Dewan, chairman of the Punjab Large Industrial Development Board, asked for better representation. Sidhu’s early morning departure for Delhi made his supporters confident of an announcement of his elevation. They even put up hoardings in Amritsar thanking the party leadership. But no such announcement came.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-meets-sonia-amid-buzz-of-revamp-in-punjab-101626460213531.html
17-07-2021||India||‘State lawyers to handle riots, R-Day clash cases’||The Delhi Cabinet on Friday decided that a panel of government-appointed prosecutors will deal with cases related to the January 26 violence during a farmers’ tractor rally as well as the 2020 north-east Delhi riots which left 53 people dead and hundreds injured, and not the prosecutors proposed or appointed by the Delhi Police, the Delhi government said in a statement.The move is in disagreement with lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal’s stance on the issue and has become the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the state government.In July 2020, Baijal overturned a similar decision of the Delhi Cabinet to appoint a panel of lawyers of its choice to argue cases related to the 2020 communal riots and issued an interim order saying till the matter is resolved by the President, the panel of lawyers appointed by the Delhi Police and approved by his office will stand. Currently, the Delhi Police-appointed panel of special public prosecutors approved by the LG is representing the state in the riot-related cases.In matters related to the January 26 tractor rally violence, Delhi Police proposed a panel of special public prosecutors, which was recommended by the LG but dismissed by the Delhi government in a meeting earlier this month. The LG asked the Delhi Cabinet to take a call on the matter and inform his office. The Delhi government, in a statement on Friday, said decisions on the appointment of a panel of special public prosecutors have been sent to the L-G.A senior official in the LG’s office said they are yet to receive communication on the Cabinet decision, and will comment only after they get more details.‘Delhi Police lawyers will rid case of fairness’“The Cabinet refused to permit Delhi Police’s proposed list of lawyers from appearing in the court cases related to the farmers’ protests. The Central Government through the Delhi LG had been pressuring the cabinet to give their nod to the list of lawyers sent by the Delhi Police. The Cabinet, however, refused to allow Delhi Police’s own lawyers from appearing as public prosecutors. In a separate decision, the cabinet also refused to allow the panel of lawyers recommended by the Delhi Police in the North-East Delhi Riots case. The cabinet’s decision has been sent to the Lieutenant Governor,” said the government’s statement issued on Friday.It further said, “The farmers have been constantly agitating against the contentious laws and the Cabinet observed that appointing lawyers of the Delhi Police, who is investigating the case will devoid the case of fairness and impartiality. Similarly, in the second instance, the lawyers were supposed to appear in the north-east Delhi Riots case against those who were accused by the Delhi Police. The Cabinet noted that the courts had remarked that the Delhi Police had conducted dubious investigations earlier in the cases where lawyers of their preference were appearing.”Delhi Police did not comment on the matter.The statement added that the Cabinet observed that the demand of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their choice in the case was “baseless: and “unwarranted”, and that letting Delhi Police’s lawyers appear in the case of the farmers who have been protesting against the three farm laws “would seriously hamper legal parity and would not be fair to the accused farmers who bear a right to go through an unbiased trial”.A senior government official, who did not wish to be identified, said: “Delhi Police, through the LG’s office, has also proposed names of three more special public prosecutors recently with regard to north-east Delhi riots. That, too, was rejected.”The LG’s office did not comment.Move comes in backdrop of Punjab pollsAfter Friday’s meeting, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet, “To support the farmers of the country is the duty of every Indian. We have not done anyone any favour. We have just fulfilled our responsibility towards farmers of the nation. Farmers are not criminals. They are not terrorists. They provide us with food.”A majority of the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws, which were passed by Parliament in September 2020, are from Punjab. The state is going to the polls in 2022, and the Aam Aadmi Party is the principal opposition party in the Punjab assembly.Earlier in the day, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a video press briefing, “In today’s Cabinet [meeting], we have decided that Delhi government will appoint its own panel of lawyers. The LG had earlier dismissed the Delhi government’s recommendations on appointing such a panel. It is unfortunate that the central government through the LG is intervening in routine affairs of Delhi’s governance. Appointing prosecution in Delhi comes under the elected government’s domain, going by Supreme Court’s directions. The LG, however, has a veto power which can be used in rarest of the rare cases. Such routine use of the veto power is unconstitutional, anti-democratic and goes against the spirit of Supreme Court’s directions.”Senior officials in the LG’s office did not respond to the comments of Kejriwal and Sisodia.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nalin Kohli said the AAP government was being unreasonable.“Clients have the right to engage an advocate of their choice to prosecute on their behalf. The same would hold true for the Delhi Police. Should they be forced to accept any advocate they do not wish to engage? No. How would the Aam Aadmi Party government feel if the Union government forced them to use advocates they are not comfortable with?,” said Kohli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-lawyers-to-handle-riots-r-day-clash-cases-says-delhi-cabinet-101626459674139.html
17-07-2021||India||Afghan president Ghani hits out at terror by Pak||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Friday launched a blistering attack on Pakistan for failing to prevent foreign terrorists sneaking into Afghanistan and not doing enough to pressure the Taliban to join peace talks even as Prime Minister Imran Khan and world leaders listened on as part of the audience of a regional conference in Tashkent.Ghani used his address at the conference, hosted by Uzbekistan to foster connectivity between Central and South Asia, to criticise Pakistan for failing to deliver on its commitments to influence the Taliban to participate in negotiations and to prevent the cross-border movement of jihadi fighters.The president’s remarks reflected the Afghan government’s frustration over the Taliban’s refusal to begin talks to find a political settlement while it conducts a massive campaign to capture territory amid the rapid drawdown of US and NATO forces. Afghan officials have repeatedly blamed Pakistan for not putting pressure on Taliban leaders present on Pakistani soil to launch peace talks.Khan, who addressed the conference after Ghani, responded to the allegations by saying he was “disappointed” by the Afghan leader’s comments and that no country had “tried harder to get Taliban on the dialogue table than Pakistan”.Ghani told the audience, which included US deputy national security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, that intelligence estimates indicated the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters from Pakistan and other places in the last month as well as support from their affiliates and the trans-national organisations” for the Taliban. “There’s a consensus among credible international observers that [the Taliban have] not taken any steps to sever their relationship with terrorist organisations,” he said.Contrary to the “repeated assurances by Prime Minister Khan and his generals that Pakistan does not find a Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in Pakistan’s interest and short of use of force, will use its power to influence to make the Taliban negotiate seriously, networks and organisations supporting the Taliban are openly celebrating the destruction of the assets and capabilities of the Afghan people and state,” he said.Ghani said Afghanistan is not asking for sympathy but for a clear definition of interest. “Embracing regional connectivity and support for a political pathway to walk back the Taliban and their supporters from the brink of descent to hell is a win-win approach. To plunge Afghanistan into all-out war is to plunge the region into radical uncertainty,” he said.“Pakistan, therefore, needs to be engaged coherently and urgently from the perspective of regional interest,” he added.Ghani made it clear that while his government is committed to peace, the Afghan security forces will continue the fight. “We are prepared to face the Taliban and their supporters for as long as it takes, until they realise that a political solution is the only way forward,” he said.Khan said in his address that Pakistan’s foremost priority is stability in Afghanistan as it is “petrified” about the possible influx of more refugees at a time when it is supporting three million Afghan refugees.“Let me just say that the country that is going to be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan...the last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict,” he said.“To blame Pakistan for what is going on in Afghanistan, I feel, is extremely unfair...,” he said. Khan also questioned whether the Taliban would compromise at a time when the US has set a date for the exit of its troops. “Why would they listen to us when they are sensing victory?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-president-ghani-hits-out-at-terror-by-pak-101626459194675.html
17-07-2021||India||Call off kanwar yatra, or we will, SC tells UP||The Supreme Court on Friday observed that “the Uttar Pradesh government cannot go ahead with the kanwar yatra - 100%”, asking the state to either withdraw the decision to allow the religious pilgrimage “in the interest of health of the citizenry of India”, or invite an order from the court.Citing widespread fears of a third wave of Covid-19, the bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai gave the state government time till Monday to reconsider its decision of allowing the kanwar yatra due to “compelling religious reasons” and convey it to the court.The ultimatum effectively ends any chance of the yatra, which attracts around 30 million pilgrims from many northern and northwestern states to Haridwar in Uttarakhand, where they collect water from the Ganga (gangajal) and take it back home, on foot or on cycles. Many of the pilgrims are from Uttar Pradesh, which is keen to go ahead with the yatra despite fears that it could be a superspreader event, and despite warnings from public health officials. Uttarakhand has already cancelled the yatra and said it will not allow the entry of pilgrims. Uttar Pradesh was looking at ways to ship gangajal in tankers and then allow the pilgrims to collect it by walk or cycle. Both states go to polls early next year.“The UP government can’t go ahead with it - 100%...Either we order directly or we give you one final opportunity to reconsider your decision. Pandemic affects all of us. We are all the citizens of India. This suo motu (case initiated by the court on its own motion) has been taken up since Article 21 (right to life) applies to all of us. It is to safeguard each one of us,” the bench told senior counsel CS Vaidyanathan, who appeared for the UP government and agreed to return on Monday after a review of the decision.Vaidyanathan earlier informed the court that the state has decided to allow a symbolic yatra with a restricted number of kanwariyas (pilgrims) who will have to follow safety protocols. He said that the district administration will ensure that the number of permissions thus granted will be kept to a minimum.The UP government did not make any disclosure about a possible decision on Friday, but officials said they were in talks with kanwar associations, who may themselves call off the pilgrimage like last year.“The UP government has instructed the administration to establish a dialogue with kanwar associations so the right decision can be taken regarding the organisation of the yatra,” said a government spokesperson.“We are in talks with the kanwar sanghs and other states,” added Awanish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), Uttar Pradesh.For the Union government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta submitted that movement of kanwariyas for bringing gangajal from Haridwar must not be allowed in view of the pandemic. The Centre’s affidavit advocated a system to make gangajal available through tankers at designated locations for devotees to collect and perform rituals. Advocate Abhishek Atrey, representing the Uttarakhand government, told the court that Uttarakhand has completely banned any physical form of yatra.“We are of the view that this is a matter, which concerns every one of us as citizens of India, and goes to the very heart of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which has a pride of place in the fundamental rights chapter of our Constitution. The health of the citizenry of India and their right to life are paramount. All other sentiments, albeit religious, are subservient to this most basic fundamental right,” said the court in its order.The court was satisfied with the response of the Union and Uttarakhand governments but told the UP government unequivocally that it was not for allowing any physical movement for the pilgrimage. “Either you (Vaidyanathan) take this up with authorities to reconsider not allowing any physical movement at all or we will pass orders that we think is right,” the court said.The bench then recorded in its order that “given the Covid pandemic and the fear that looms over all the citizens of India of a third wave of the pandemic”, Vaidyanathan has been asked whether the authorities would be in a position to reconsider holding or the allowing, for compelling religious reasons, this yatra in physical form at all.“He (Vaidyanathan) responded positively to the court’s suggestion and asked for time to come out with an additional affidavit by Monday, July 19, to apprise this court as to whether there can be a reconsideration of holding the physical kanwar yatra at all,” stated the court in its order.Stating that it is a “little disturbed” by UP government’s decision to allow the kanwar yatra despite fears of a third wave of Covid-19, the bench on Wednesday sought explanations from the Union and the relevant state governments on the proposed religious pilgrimage and “disparate political voices” on avoiding large gatherings.It remarked that “the citizens of India are completely perplexed and don’t know what is going on” when different states are adopting a different stance.The court in its order on Wednesday pointed out that UP is pressing ahead with the kanwar yatra while the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand, “with its hindsight of experience”, has suspended it over apprehensions of a possible third wave of the coronavirus disease.Uttarakhand, which went ahead with the Kumbh Mela despite warnings from experts, saw a sharp increase in Covid-19 infections soon after. The management of the event has come under question with unearthing of a fake Covid tests racket.The bench also noted discordant political voices, all on the same day as Uttarakhand said no to the kanwar yatra; UP said yes; and Prime Minister Narendra Modi told chief ministers of north-eastern states that it is up to the people to stop the third wave by adhering to safety protocols. “Given the disparate political voices, all speaking at the same time, it is important that the relevant secretary, Union of India, respond,” the court had said in its order.Months after the Mahakumbh drew 9.1 million devotees and seeded clusters of infections, concerns have grown over the kanwar yatra.Uttarakhand on Tuesday announced scrapping the annual pilgrimage this year, heeding warnings from health experts who cautioned that millions of devotees thronging the banks of the Ganga in Haridwar could spark a third wave of Covid-19.The hill state also turned down a request from Uttar Pradesh, which allowed the pilgrimage to begin from July 25.On Thursday, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami told HT: “God won’t be pleased if lives are lost because of our laxity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-off-kanwar-yatra-or-we-will-sc-tells-up-101626459133520.html
17-07-2021||India||To evade tax, luxury cars imported in name of ‘diplomats’||The Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) on Friday busted a luxury cars smuggling racket involving the misuse of diplomatic privileges, with the arrest of three persons, including Nipun Miglani, a senior executive of Gurugram-based luxury car dealership, Big Boy Toyz, people familiar with the matter at the agency said.DRI said in a statement that the accused imported around 20 luxury cars such as Range Rovers and Prados over the past five years in the name of diplomats, and then sold them, evading duty of at least ₹25 crore.A Dubai-based man, who has been involved in Customs rackets in the past and has been probed earlier by DRI, is behind the entire racket but he is yet to be caught, the statement added.According to the statement, upon receiving specific details of one such luxury car imported in the name of a Delhi-based diplomat of an African nation, DRI launched an operation codenamed “Operation Monte Carlo” and kept discreet watch over the vehicle after its arrival at the port. It found that the vehicle was loaded onto a transport vehicle and taken to a showroom in Andheri (Mumbai) where it was displayed.Subsequently, it carried out searches across seven cities and recovered six luxury cars.Detailing the modus operandi used by accused, DRI said “a Dubai based mastermind would arrange for import of luxury cars into India from countries like the UK, Japan and the UAE, in the names of diplomats.”The actual buyers for the vehicles would be identified by Miglani. “Upon arrival in India, these vehicles would be directly ferried to the city of the buyer or a dealer of luxury cars. The domestic registration for these vehicles would be done in certain specific Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. After the registration formalities were completed, these cars on which full Customs duty @204% was evaded would be sold to the Indian buyers, thereby making a huge profit at the cost of government revenue,” the DRI statement added.Founder and managing director of Big Boy Toyz Jatin Ahuja told HT that his firm has fired Miglani as the CEO with immediate effect and a police complaint is also being filed against him to secure the interests of the company.“We absolutely have no idea about what Nitin Miglani was doing in his personal capacity beyond office hours but Big Boy Toyz has not role in it and not a single customer of the company has been affected (by his activities). We were totally unaware of this,” Ahuja said.He added that BBT is not into the business of importing cars.A statement by Big Boy Toyz said, “Mr. Nipun Miglani, an employee of the organisation... conducted certain transactions thereof in his individual capacity & without the knowledge and consent of the management of Big Boy Toyz. Mr. Nipun Miglani is terminated with immediate effect & BIG BOY TOYZ does not hold any liability and responsibility towards his alleged individual transactions. It is made known to the general public at large that whatever Mr.Nipun Miglani has done in his individual capacity, Big Boy Toyz Ltd. is not liable for the same.”Apart from Miglani, DRI has also arrested Liyakat Bachau Khan, an employee of the Dubai -based mastermind, and Suriya Arjunan, a Bengaluru based financier who used to fund the purchase of vehicles before they were transferred to private persons in India, said an official who didn’t want to be named.DRI said that imports made by foreign diplomats and missions in India are governed by the Foreign Privileged Persons (Regulation of Customs Privileges) Rules, 1957. The net customs duty on import of cars works out to 204% but the law exempts certain classes of members of Diplomatic Missions in India and their family members from duties on all imported goods.The agency said the “investigation is likely to identify more players of this racket in the coming days”.“It is estimated that more than 20 luxury vehicles have been smuggled into India in the name of diplomats over the past 5 years, resulting in duty evasion of more than ₹25 crore,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-evade-tax-luxury-cars-imported-in-name-of-diplomats-101626459134163.html
17-07-2021||India||India's real vaccination test yet to come, 10 million second doses due from July 21||India is expected to see a massive rush in the demand for both major Covid-19 vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) starting as early as the middle of next week of July as two significant groups of people – those in the 18-44 age group who received Covishield shots at the start of May when the drive was thrown open for all adults; and those who received Covaxin jabs after the June 21 shift in vaccination policy – become eligible for their second dose almost simultaneously.The number could be as high as 10 million doses in the week starting July 21, more second doses than have ever been administered in a seven-day period.The expected jump in demand comes at a time when the states and the Centre have been locked in a war of words over the supply of doses.Several states have said in recent days that they are facing severe scarcity of doses, and some said they have been forced to close down some vaccination centres.On Wednesday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that vaccine availability in July is 135 million doses.Till the evening of July 16, nearnearly 64 million doses had been administered in the month.The pace of daily vaccinations, meanwhile, has been slowing again. On average, 3.8 million shots have been administered every day in the past seven days, a drop of over 40% from the peak levels witnessed in the country.Of the total 315 million people who have been administered vaccines in India till Friday evening, according to the Centre’s Co-WIN dashboard, 235.7 million have been partly vaccinated (have received one dose), while another 79.3 million are fully vaccinated. This translates into a little over one-third of India’s population eligible for shots having received at least one dose of the vaccine (25% partially vaccinated, and 8.4% having received both doses).The wide gap between these two groups can be partly attributed to the revision of the prescribed gap between the two doses in the case of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield (a vaccine that accounts for nearly 90% of all doses administered in the country).On May 13, the Union health ministry announced the widening of the gap between the doses of Covishield from 4-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks. And due to the large proportion of those vaccinated having received Covishield, this change in policy has had a cascading effect on the number of people getting second doses. It ended up having a plateauing effect on the total number of people who were completely vaccinated in the country (see chart) after mid-May, even as more people received first doses.Till mid-May, the gap between the proportion of people fully vaccinated and those partially vaccinated was closing. At the start of April, only 16% of all the people who received the shots were completely vaccinated. This proportion rose to nearly 30% by May 17, but as the gap between Covishield doses was increased, it started falling again.To be sure, from the last week of June – which is the corresponding 12-week period from April 1, when the drive was expanded to include everyone over the age of 45 years – the number of people being fully vaccinated has again started rising. This phenomenon is expected to be magnified with an even larger group of people becoming eligible for their second shots starting July 24 (which is 12 weeks since May 1).The second bump in demand will come from those people who received first jabs of Covaxin from June 21 onwards, when the latest phase of the inoculation drive pushed up vaccination numbers. Since Covaxin has a recommended gap period four-to-six weeks, people in this group will be due for their shots starting July 21.To be sure, the Union health ministry has not released daily data on the first and second dose breakup of these two vaccines, which makes it difficult to ascertain the exact demand expected for second doses in the coming days. However, a rough estimation can be made based on the nearly consistent 9:1 ratio of Covishield-Covaxin administration. Based on Co-WIN data, around 6.9 million first doses were administered in the first week of May – if we assume 90% of these were Covishield, then around 6.2 million people will be eligible for their second shot in the last week of June. Similarly, 38 million doses were administered between June 21 and June 28 – if 10% of these were Covaxin, then around 3.8 million people may become eligible for Covaxin shots in the week starting from July 21.This demand, of course, will be in addition to the number of people who will be getting first doses at the same time.Experts said the situation stressed the need for authorities to be more strategic in using their supplies.“While the data for mRNA vaccines had showed that delaying second doses, and thus covering more people with first doses, was an effective strategy, I don’t know yet if that is true for our vaccines. Doing so may buy us a little time, but it may also mean that people who are administered one dose end up seeing antibody titer going down to the extent that they may not be protected from Covid. But prioritising second doses risks leaving a larger proportion of population vulnerable to the disease... It becomes very important for the government to not only increase production, but it also puts pressure to be a lot more strategic in using their vaccine supplies,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/real-jab-test-yet-to-come-as-more-2nd-doses-due-101626459074735.html
17-07-2021||India||Vaccine for kids to be available soon: Centre||The Union government on Friday told the Delhi high court that Covid-19 vaccines for children below the age of 18 years will be available “in the near future” as the clinical trials are on the verge of completion.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was informed by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma that Zydus Cadila, which is developing DNA vaccines for Covid-19, has concluded its clinical trial for children between the ages of 12 and 18 years of age and is awaiting statutory permission.He also said that a policy would be formulated and implemented by the Centre for vaccination of children as expeditiously as possible after grant of requisite permissions by the experts adding that some clinical trials are ongoing.In its affidavit, the government told the court that the Drug Controller General of India has permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials on children between the ages of 2 and 18 for its vaccine, Covaxin.The submissions were made in response to a plea by 12-year-old Tia Gupta, seeking direction to the Centre and the Delhi government to immediately vaccinate children between the ages of 12 and 18 in the city. The petition, filed through advocate Bihu Sharma, has also asked for prioritising vaccination for parents with new-born children.To be sure, around a third of the 940 million eligible population of adults in India has received at least one dose of the vaccine.Research has also shown that infection and fatality rates continue to remain low among children, although some medical professionals have created panic by warning that children will be especially susceptible should a third wave of the disease descend on India -- a claim that is entirely bereft of scientific backing. However, public health experts have said that children, like everyone else, should get vaccinated against the disease as and when they become eligible and shots become available.On Friday, senior advocate Kailash Vasdev submitted that the Union government has not specified any timeline for vaccinating children who have been out of physical school since last March.“Nobody is delaying, there cannot be a time limit granted by the court that too for research. The trials are ongoing and pathological effects have to be seen. They are saying trials are on and it is on the verge of completion. What time bound schedule do you want?” the court said while rejecting the request for a timeline to complete the clinical trials.The court observed that while the entire country is waiting for the vaccine, there should be a “foolproof trial”.“Everybody is in a hurry. Everybody is for the vaccine but a foolproof trial should be there, otherwise it will be a disaster,” the court said and granted time till September 6 to the Centre.Gupta’s plea contended that India’s vaccine policy failed to factor-in children or parents of children, who are a vulnerable section of society, for vaccination against the deadly virus.Meanwhile, the court also disposed of a separate plea which had sought vaccination of the children in wake of the board exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-kids-to-be-available-soon-centre-101626458833555.html
17-07-2021||India||Uncertainty persists over EMA approval for SII’s Covishield||The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Thursday said it was yet to receive a market authorisation application for Covishield, which is yet to be recognised by the European Union (EU) for vaccination certifications that may soon become mandatory for international travel.An industry executive aware with the matter, however, contended that the certification is following a different route since Serum Institute of India – the maker of Covishield – will not seek to sell the vaccine. Instead, along with its UK-based partner AstraZeneca, it is seeking to be recognised as an alternative production site for the Oxford-AstraZeneca dose.“EMA is technically not wrong because the application that has been sent via AstraZeneca is not really for grant of market authorisation in EU. It is actually for grant of approval to recognise SII as an alternate manufacturing site of the AstraZeneca vaccine. EMA would obviously say no if you ask them if Serum has applied for marketing authorisation because it is not an application for full marketing authorisation,” said this person who asked not to be named. “It is basically an extension of the already granted approval to AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria. They have not applied for full marketing authorisation (for Covishield), and rightly so as Europe is not Serum’s territory to market Covishield. This arrangement was clear from the start that Europe is AstraZeneca’s territory,” this person added.When contacted, an AstraZeneca spokesperson confirmed: “We have requested the addition of Serum Institute of India as an alternative manufacturing site on the Vaxzevria licence.”To be sure, the request is a variation to the marketing authorisation process, and not a full marketing authorisation.In a tweet on Thursday, EMA said: “For the Covid-19 vaccine Covishield to be evaluated for use in the EU, the developer needs to submit a formal marketing authorisation application to EMA, which to date has not been received”.EMA has approved Pfizer BioNTech’s Comirnaty, Moderna’s Spikevax, AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine for Covid-19.Covishield is one of the four vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorisation by the Indian drugs regulator Drugs Controller General of India, and it accounts for nine of every 10 doses given to people in India.The person quoted above said the SII application to EMA was sent along with all necessary documents in May. “Ideally travel should have been allowed based on the WHO emergency use listing,” said the person familiar with the matter.To be sure, India is still on blacklists of most countries for incoming travel due to the prevalence of the Delta variant, which is linked to faster transmission and somewhat more severe disease.SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said at an event recently that the company was confident of receiving approval from the EMA in about a month’s time. Speaking at India Global Forum 2021 on June 30, Poonawalla said: “It is not a controversy, it is just that blown out of proportion and the issue of vaccine passports should be on the basis of reciprocity between the countries.”“EMA is absolutely correct in asking us to apply, which we have through AstraZeneca, a month ago, and that process has to take its time,” added Poonawalla||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uncertainty-persists-over-ema-approval-for-sii-s-covishield-101626458773476.html
17-07-2021||India||Modi reviews situation in 6 high caseload states||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a review meeting on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation with six high disease burden states, and reiterated the need to take proactive measures to prevent the possibility of a third wave of infections even as some of the CMs asked for more Covid-19 vaccine doses.Modi interacted with chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Kerala, and said that the visible trend of increase in new Covid-19 cases Maharashtra and Kerala was a cause for concern.He pointed out that similar trends were seen in January-February before the second wave hit the country.“…all of us are at a point where apprehensions of the third wave are continuously expressed. Despite experts giving positive signals due to the downward trends increasing number of cases in few states is still worrisome. During the last week, 80% cases as well as 84% unfortunate deaths came from the states present in the meeting. Initially experts believed that states where the second wave originated will see the normalisation first. However, increasing numbers in Kerala and Maharashtra are cause of grave worry,” Modi said.“…if the cases keep on rising for long time, chances of mutation of the coronavirus will also increase and dangers of new variants will also rise. Therefore, we need to continue with the strategy of Test, Track, Treat and Teeka (vaccination) while putting special focus on micro-containment zones. Districts with large numbers should be focused on…,” the PM added.With numbers falling for the country’s second wave of infections, the seven-day average of new cases in the country has dropped to 39,112 new cases a day – the lowest in four months, or since mid-March – from a peak of 391,819 infections a day for the week ended May 9.Union home minister Amit Shah, who was also present during the meeting, mentioned that some of the states whose CMs were in the meeting have high test positivity rates of around 10% or more test positivity rate in some of the districts.While on average, 2.1% of all samples tested across the country have returned positive for Covid-19, the average positivity rate (a crucial statistic to gauge the outbreak) has been several times higher in many regions such as the northeast, along with states such as Kerala (where this figure was over 10%).Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan talked about the need to reinforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and containment measures in the districts that are reporting high caseloads. Terming vaccine as a strategic tool for high infection areas, the Prime Minister stressed the effective use of vaccination. He assured the chief ministers of all possible help in ensuring successful implementation of not just disease containment measures but also taking forward the Covid-19 vaccination drive, wherever it was required.CMs ask for more vaccinesThe chief ministers of southern states asked the PM to increase vaccine supply to ensure maximum protection for people before the third wave of the pandemic begins.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the state has vaccinated 11.7 million people with the first dose and 4.41 million people with both doses (Kerala’s population is 34.6 million), and no vaccine was wasted. He sought six million more doses to cover a major portion of the population. He also said Covid-19 situation in Kerala was under control; the second wave started very late, and at one point the state’s test positivity rate went up to 30%, but now was around 10%. The CM said the state’s mortality rate remained the lowest in the country at 0.48%.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said the state had managed reasonably well despite a lack of modern medical facilities. He said the newly setup village/ward secretariats system played a key role in effective containment of Covid-19 and 12 fever surveys helped in containing the spread of the virus in the state. Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa urged the PM to provide at least 15 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the state every month and said Covid-19 cases in Karnataka now stand at about 1,900 a day, and in Bengaluru at about 400 cases a day.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin sought 10 million vaccine doses as a special case and urged the PM to exempt Goods and Services Tax on all goods needed for Covid-19 management.The demand for vaccines has tremendously increased in Tamil Nadu, Stalin said. “However, when compared with other states, the allocation for our state is very less. To handle this tough situation, I request a special allocation of one crore (10 million) vaccine doses. I look forward to your support in this important issue,” he said.The PM assured the state chiefs of all possible help in ensuring successful implementation of not just disease containment measures but also taking forward the Covid-19 vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-reviews-covid-situation-in-6-states-underlines-measures-to-prevent-3rd-wave-101626434773291.html
17-07-2021||India||Indian journalist killed in line of duty by Taliban||New Delhi: Indian photojournalist Danish Siddiqui, whose searing images of wars, riots and human suffering won global accolades including the Pulitzer Prize in 2018, was killed in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province on Friday while covering the region’s escalating conflict for Reuters. He was 38.A largely self-taught photojournalist, Siddiqui is survived by his wife and two young children. Friends and family described him as a shy, friendly man from south Delhi’s Jamia Nagar who cared deeply about the issues he covered, and played cricket in a local park every week. “Deeply disturbed by the sad news of the killing of a friend, Danish Siddiqui in Kandahar last night. The Indian journalist & winner of Pulitzer Prize was embedded with Afghan security forces,” Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay tweeted. Mamundzay said Siddiqui, the chief photographer for Reuters in India, was with Afghan security forces when they were attacked by “terrorists” in Kandahar. An Afghan commander told Reuters that Siddiqui was killed on Friday while covering a clash between Afghan security forces and Taliban fighters near a border crossing with Pakistan in Spin Boldak. Afghan special forces were fighting to retake the main market area of Spin Boldak when Siddiqui and the senior Afghan officer were killed in what was described as “Taliban crossfire”, the official said. Siddiqui had earlier told Reuters he was injured in the arm by shrapnel on Friday while reporting on the clash. He was treated and was recovering when Taliban fighters retreated from the fighting in Spin Boldak. Siddiqui was talking to shopkeepers when the Taliban attacked again, the Afghan commander said. “I am deeply saddened with the shocking reports that Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui was killed while covering the Taliban atrocities in Kandahar,” said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani . “While I extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr Siddiqui’s family and also to our media family, I reiterate my government’s unwavering commitment to freedom of speech and protection of free media and journalists,” he added. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the Indian ambassador in Kabul was in touch with Afghan authorities regarding the development. “We are keeping his (Siddiqui’s) family informed of the developments,” he said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian embassy in Kabul was in touch with Afghan authorities to bring back Siddiqui’s body. “We have been informed the body has been handed over by the Taliban to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). We are actively facilitating the return of the body in coordination with Afghan authorities and the ICRC,” the people said. Siddiqui was embedded with Afghan special forces in southern Kandahar province since earlier this week and was reporting on fighting between Afghan commandos and Taliban fighters. ‘HE SOUNDED COMFORTABLE’“I last spoke to him on Wednesday night. He spoke pleasantly and sounded quite comfortable. He anyway was quite used to tense reporting environments,” said Akhtar Siddiqui, Siddiqui’s father.On Tuesday, Siddiqui reported on a mission by the Afghan special forces to rescue a wounded policeman who had been cut off from others and had been trapped by the Taliban for 18 hours. His report included graphic images of vehicles being targeted with rockets. “Afghan Special Forces, the elite fighters are on various frontlines across the country. I tagged along with these young men for some missions,” he tweeted on July 13. Siddiqui was part of a Reuters team that was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography in 2018 for documenting Myanmar’s Rohingya refugee crisis. A Reuters photographer since 2010, Siddiqui’s work spanned the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Rohingya refugee crisis, the Hong Kong protests and Nepal earthquakes.In recent years, his images of the Delhi riots, migrant worker crisis last year and devastation during the second wave of Covid earlier this year also won high praise. “Danish Siddiqui leaves behind an extraordinary body of work...Sincere condolences. RIP,” said Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur.OBSESSED WITH CAMERASThe oldest of three children, Siddiqui was born on May 19, 1983. He became a journalist after a master’s degree in mass communications from Jamia Milia Islamia in 2007. “Even while holidaying with friends, Siddiqui would be lost in his cameras, even during the days when he could only own a digicam,” said his childhood friend, Humayun Shahzad.His memories of photography were “a camera borrowed from a neighbour, black and white rolls of film bought with half my pocket money, and a school hiking trip in the Himalayas”, according to a Reuters profile. As news of his demise spread on Friday, friends and neighbours gathered at his two-storey ancestral house in Jamia Nagar’s Ghaffar Manzil and remembered him as being focused on ensuring safety during reporting and always giving tips to colleagues on how to stay safe in conflict situations. “It is such an irony, and so cruel, that a photojournalist so conscious about personal safety was killed on duty,” said Dr Sabeena Gadihoke, a professor who taught Siddiqui at Jamia. After his post graduation, Siddiqui went on to work with some news channels before abruptly quitting his television job in 2010. “He left a well-paying job and went on to purchase a DLSR camera worth ₹1.5 lakh. That was the moment we knew he would make it big,” said his childhood friend Shams Raza.Himani Singh, who also worked with Siddiqui in 2018, said she remembered his fearlessness. “He never feared any circumstances, he wasn’t afraid of any situation, and he never shied away from showing the truth through his images,” Singh said.In his own words on the Reuters website, Siddiqui said he enjoyed capturing the human costs of conflicts. “I shoot for the common man,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-photojournalist-danish-siddiqui-killed-in-afghanistan-s-kandahar-province-101626420192681.html
17-07-2021||India||Was considering India return, now wary about safety: Choksi||New Delhi Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi, who reached Antigua and Barbuda on Thursday after 52 days in custody of Dominican authorities, released an audio message soon after, claiming that he had considered returning to India to prove his innocence but is now “extremely apprehensive” about his safety in the country.Choksi said the change was brought about by what he described as an “inhuman abrasion kidnapping” by Indian agencies, a reference to the allegation by his legal team and family that he was abducted from Antigua by 7-8 people on May 23, tortured and brought to Dominica in a vessel.Choksi’s lawyers allege the kidnapping was a joint operation between Indian and Antiguan security agencies to get him deported to India where he is wanted in the ₹13,578 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud.“I am back home but this torture has left permanent scars on my psychology and physically,” Choksi said in an audio message shared by his lawyer Vijay Aggarwal hours after the air ambulance hired by him for the 200km journey landed in Antigua.A Dominican court this week allowed him to return to Antigua, whose citizenship he holds, for medical treatment, and ordered him to return to face charges of illegal entry after he is declared fit, a move that officials in Indian investigative agencies admitted was a setback to their efforts to have Choksi extradited. India flew a team of officials to Dominica, where Choksi mysteriously appeared on May 24 after going missing from Antigua the previous day. The diamantaire is a citizen of Antigua, although the country is engaged in a legal battle to revoke his citizenship; India’s position is that because Choksi’s relinquishment of citizenship wasn’t approved by the appropriate authority, he remains a citizen of India. “Though till now, I have been seriously considering return[ing] to prove my innocence in India. My medical condition is very bad and it has worsened like anything in the last over 50 days of my kidnapping and I am extremely apprehensive about my safety in India. This was so inhuman…,” the 62-year-old businessman said in the statement, his first after he went missing . Choksi’s statement also referred to the probe against him in India.“Also, many times I have said that due to my poor health I am not able to travel and offered the Indian agencies to visit here (Antigua) and interrogate me. But this inhuman kidnapping was never expected by me,” Choksi, who has an Interpol red notice against him for the bank fraud case, said. Choksi and his nephew, Nirav Modi, are accused of colluding with PNB employees to defraud the bank. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-seriously-planning-to-return-to-india-but-not-any-more-mehul-choksi-101626410772344.html
